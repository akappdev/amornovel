I know what you\u2019re thinking. She has to be a slut; she works at a strip club and takes off her clothes for money. Yes! I work at a strip club, and you may think I\u2019m a whore for showing off my body, but this is a talent that has been forced down my throat since I was a young child. Look pretty and smile. I put on a show for those who choose to watch. However long I\u2019m on stage, I\u2019m not even me. It\u2019s what I imagine an out-of-body experience would be like\u2014a performance, nothing more, nothing less. The people watching make assumptions about who they think I am or cook up a story in their heads of who they want me to be. I\u2019m just another beautiful face.</p><p>Beautiful. I hate that f**king word. Who gives a crap if someone is attractive on the outside if they are dying inside? My whole life has been about what I look like. I swear, the only reason my mother kept me was to have a real-life, living, breathing doll she could dress up and control, which is the exact reason why I got as far away from her special brand of crazy as I could as soon as I became eighteen. That\u2019s also why I don\u2019t date. The first thing guys do is look at me and see a pretty face, a nice body, and an empty space where my brain\u2019s supposed to be. They have no interest in getting to know the person I am on the inside. They don\u2019t care that I volunteer my spare time, and they couldn\u2019t care less that I\u2019m going to school to be an RN. They don\u2019t ask about my hopes, my dreams, or about where I see my life in twenty years. They don\u2019t care about me at all.</p><p>They just want someone pretty to follow them around and tell them how handsome they are, how special they are, while agreeing with everything they say. Fuck that! I did that for too many years. That\u2019s why I live inside books. At least there I can choose where I want to be\u2014from the highlands of Scotland to a king\u2019s bed in a faraway land\u2014and even if it\u2019s pretend, sometimes that\u2019s a lot better than reality.</p> <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Leaving On A Jet Plane</p><p>I look out the plane window, my finger going to the glass, feeling the cold on my fingertips as I look down at the land moving quickly below me. It\u2019s funny how, from up here, everything looks so small. I\u2019ve never traveled in a plane before today. The idea of being trapped inside a tin can while flying at six hundred miles per hour never appealed to me. I take a breath and look at the TV monitor that\u2019s in the seat in front of me. The small, animated plane on the screen shows that we\u2019re over halfway to Tennessee.</p><p>\u201cAre you traveling for business or pleasure?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and look at the guy sitting next to me. He\u2019s slightly overweight and balding, but he also has wrinkles around his eyes, giving him the appearance of someone who smiles often.</p> <p>I debate with myself on whether or not to answer before replying, \u201cBusiness.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drop to my mouth then to my chest as I fight the urge to punch him in the throat. I hate when men go from nice to creepy. I shake my head, turning away from him. I don\u2019t know why I even try.</p><p>I feel a hand on my bare leg and my head swings around quickly. \u201cTouch me again and I will rip off your balls and feed them to you,\u201d I tell him in a soft tone, trying not to bring attention to us.</p><p>He quickly removes his hand, swallowing hard. \u201cI...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head before turning my body away from his. I feel tears stinging my nose, but I fight them back. No way am I going to cry now\u2014not when, just six hours ago, my whole world exploded and I didn\u2019t shed one single tear. I lay my forehead to the glass, closing my eyes. I still can\u2019t believe how fast my life changed...</p><p>I got up yesterday morning and went to the hospital like I always do. I work at one of the busiest ERs in Vegas. I\u2019ve been working there since I finished school and was required to get my clinical hours for my RN. As soon as I walked into the building, I was loaded down with work. Weekends are always crazy in Sin City, but yesterday seemed worse than normal\u2014two drug overdoses, three stomach pumps, and one gunshot victim. Later, I left the hospital exhausted, only to head to my real job\u2014well, the one that pays me the money I need to live.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sid.\u201d I gave him a half smile as I walked into The Lion\u2019s Den, the gentlemen\u2019s club I work at.</p><p>Do I like working at a strip club? No. Does it pay my bills? Yes. The second I walk in the door at the club, I\u2019m no longer me. My brain shuts off and my body takes over, the same way it used to when I was growing up and my mom forced me into pageants. I\u2019m accustomed to being on display and used for my appearance. I wish life were different, but it is what it is.</p><p>Some people complain about being overweight or having acne; I hate being beautiful. I know it sounds stupid. I mean, why would anyone complain about being attractive, right? Here\u2019s why: Men see me as an object and women see me as competition. No one is ever willing to give me a chance. They all judge me by what\u2019s on the outside, never taking a second to find out even the smallest detail about who I am.</p><p>I know I\u2019m a walking clich\u00e9. I hate being beautiful, yet I work in a business where I put myself front and center to be viewed and judged.</p><p>The difference? For the first time in my life, when I get on stage, it\u2019s my choice; no one is forcing me to do it. I get up there to earn the money so I can change my life in order to never be objectified again.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Sid questioned, following me. I have worked for Sid for the last three years. He is a friend of sorts; he\u2019s also my boss.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t wait until my clinical hours are over and I can start working at the hospital full time instead of having two jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that I won\u2019t see your face all the time, but I know you need to move on,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>\u201cSome other girl will come in and you will forget all about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever, Angel.\u201d His eyes moved over my face and he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re working VIP tonight.\u201d He followed me down the hall towards the dressing rooms.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agreed, already exhausted. I needed a shower and a bed, but I knew I was going to be there for at least eight hours, so I might as well suck it up.</p><p>\u201cThe guys coming in are important, so you need to make sure they\u2019re happy the whole time they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have done this before,\u201d I reminded him, stopping outside the dressing room door to frown at him.</p><p>\u201cNormally, I wouldn\u2019t say anything\u2014you know that. But I gotta go get on a plane, so I won\u2019t be here to check on them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re taken care of,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Angel.\u201d He kissed my forehead like he often did before walking away.</p><p>I watched him go for a second before pulling myself together.</p><p>\u201cOh! Look who\u2019s here,\u201d Tessa said as soon as I entered the dressing room.</p> <p>I ignored her and tossed my bag into my locker before pulling my scrubs off. Tessa was a bitch; she was just like the girls I used to compete against in pageants. To her, life was a competition, and she was determined to come out the winner, even if she had to throw everyone else under the bus on her way to the top.</p><p>\u201cMick said I could work VIP tonight,\u201d she said to one of the other girls in the room.</p><p>I ignored her again, knowing better than to tell her that it wasn\u2019t happening. I was sure Mick had told her that...after she\u2019d taken him in the backroom and given him something to convince him.</p><p>\u201cPixie said the guys coming in are some big-time land developers, so you know the tips are going to be outrageous. Thank God, because I need to have my tits redone, and that shit is not cheap.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and headed for the shower room. I had met a couple of nice girls during my time here, but most were just like Tessa\u2014a whole lot of hair, tits, ass, and not much else.</p> <p>I stood in front of the mirror and put on a coat of red lipstick before standing back, looking myself over. The VIP dress code was different than the rest of the club. The required outfit consisted of a sheer, black overlay bra, black silk panties, a black garter belt with sheer hose, and black heels. My long, naturally red hair was pulled back on one side by a large flower; the rest was loose and wavy, flowing down my back and over one shoulder. My creamy, white skin, red lips, and smoky eyes made me look almost like a sexy vamp.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Angel?\u201d Sid asked, pounding on the door.</p><p>\u201cShowtime,\u201d I whispered before opening the door.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful. I\u2019m going to take you in there and introduce you before heading out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I followed him down the hall to the club.</p><p>The Lion\u2019s Den is well known in the area for its exclusivity. The walls are painted a dark brown, and the booths are designed into the walls, making the space feel intimate. The stage is in the center of the room, with a single spotlight shining down on it. Every booth has a girl assigned to it, and VIP has two girls. We aren\u2019t allowed to interact with the customers without being asked directly to do so.</p> <p>The club is less of a strip club and more of a place for men to hang out and drink while having beautiful women tend to them. If they choose to, they can watch the girl in the center of the room put on a show. I have been on stage several times in the three years I\u2019ve worked here. I haven\u2019t told Sid that I don\u2019t like it up there, but he normally put me in VIP or assigned me to a booth for the night.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so worried about these guys?\u201d I asked Sid.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re thinking about opening up a Lion\u2019s Den in one of the new casinos they\u2019re building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s huge! Congrats, honey.\u201d I squeezed his bicep and gave him a smile.</p><p>\u201cOne day, Angel, I\u2019m gonna take you away from this place. I wanna see that smile every day.\u201d</p><p>My heart did a little thud. Sid is a very attractive man, but he\u2019s not for me. I don\u2019t want or need a man. They get you all discombobulated, filling your head with a bunch of lies and then expecting you to follow them around. I did that once. I thought a man was going to save me from the hell I was living in. I gave him my virginity and my heart, and he gave me a child I wasn\u2019t allowed to keep and a heart so broken that nothing or no one has put it back together again.</p><p>I looked through the two-way mirror at the men around the table in the VIP room.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Sid said from beside me. \u201cThe man in the center at the table is John Barbato. He is the owner of three of the largest clubs in the city. The guy there on his left is Steven Creo. He\u2019s some bigwig on Wall Street and has backed more than half the new clubs and casinos opening on The Strip. The guy to the right of John has a location they\u2019re interested in purchasing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it. Who\u2019s working with me?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cTessa. Mick said she would be the best out of the girls we\u2019ve got on the schedule tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d I mumbled, looking back into the room. \u201cWhat other bouncers are on tonight?\u201d I hated when Mick and Craig worked together. They were both more concerned about hooking up with the girls than what was going on out on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLink\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Link was a good guy and a close friend. He also took his job seriously.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let me introduce you quickly before I head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I followed him into the room. The men\u2019s heads turned in our direction, and they were smiling.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I want you to meet Angel. She\u2019s gonna be your girl for the night. You need anything, you ask her and she will make sure you\u2019re taken care of,\u201d Sid tells them, gesturing to me.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d one of the men said, smiling while the others nodded.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201d I smiled back.</p><p>\u201cAngel will be right back. Give me a minute, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d the one who\u2019d spoken before said.</p><p>As Sid and I stepped away, I heard from behind me, \u201cDo you think the curtains match the drapes?\u201d and they all laughed. I hated that saying, and I\u2019d sworn that, once I was free of this lifestyle, I would kick the next man who said it in the nuts.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I gotta head out. I won\u2019t be back for two weeks,\u201d Sid said once we were standing in the hall.</p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d</p><p>His eyes searched my face. His mouth opened and closed like he was going to say something, but instead, he shook his head, kissed my cheek, and walked off down the hall, muttering something under his breath.</p><p>Tessa came around the corner a couple of seconds later with a smug smile on her face. I hated to admit it, but she was beautiful. Her skin had a natural glow that made her look healthy and youthful. Her hair was black and thick, reaching the top of her ass. Her eyes curved out at the corners, showing off her Asian-American heritage.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she asked, looking at me from head to toe.</p><p>I avoided rolling my eyes at her before stepping into the room behind her.</p><p>After we took the first orders, we stood back while the men talked. I learned a long time ago to zone myself out. We were there as eye candy and nothing else. There was a knock on the door, and I knew the drinks had arrived. Tessa answered it, opening the door wide, and the man who brought the tray in was someone I had never seen before. He looked to be mid-thirties, and he had long, shaggy, black hair and brown eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he set the tray down on the table in the corner, he turned and did something odd that had me watching him more closely. His hand went to his back as he looked over at the men, who were still busy talking. When his eyes came to me, he smiled before walking out of the room. I looked at Tessa to see if she had noticed anything strange, but she was busy handing out the drinks and flirting with the men at the table.</p><p>We stood to the side again once the men had their drinks. Every once in a while, they would ask me a question about the club, and I told them what I knew. About thirty minutes after they had their first drinks, I called and had more ordered. This time, when the guy came in, he did the same thing\u2014hand at his back, looking at the table. I had no idea who he was, but I planned to find out as soon as the men left.</p><p>One of the men received a phone call and stepped out of the room, and when he returned, he had another man with him. They all sat down. This time when they called me over, they wanted a bottle of Chivas Regal Royal Salute Scotch. One glass of the stuff cost close to six hundred dollars, making it over ten thousand dollars for a bottle. I placed the order and waited for it to be delivered.</p><p>When the knock sounded on the door, I opened it up, and the same man from earlier came in and set the tray down. I watched to see if he would do the same thing he had done the previous times. Sure enough, his head turned towards the table and his hand lifted behind his back, but this time, he lifted his jacket, pulling out something black.</p> <p>It took a second for me to realize what it was, and by that time, it was too late. He let off four rounds in rapid succession then turned and fired another round, hitting Tessa. I screamed as he turned the gun on me, and before I could think, I ducked down and ran as fast as I could out of the room. I felt a bullet whiz past me as I turned the corner and another as I entered the main part of the club.</p><p>I spotted Mick. Right away, his eyes got wide, and I yelled at the top of my lungs, \u201cHE HAS A GUN!\u201d</p><p>Everyone started screaming and running in every direction. I ran into a solid wall, and when I looked up to see that it was Link, he wrapped an arm around my waist, turned, and pushed me behind the bar. I stumbled in my heels, falling to my knees and hitting the ground hard. I crawled under the counter and curled myself into a ball, shaking out of fear for my life. I listened as people screamed but didn\u2019t hear any more gunshots. I don\u2019t know how long I stayed like that, but it felt like forever until I heard police sirens.</p><p>\u201cAutumn,\u201d Link called, using my real name, snapping me out of my terrified huddle.</p><p>I peeked out from behind my hands as he crouched down in front of me. \u201cDid you get him?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, putting out his hand for me to take. I shook my head no. I was safe; I didn\u2019t want to move from that spot.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Angel. He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again.</p><p>\u201cNothing is going to happen to you. I promise you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed against the lump in my throat, squeezing my eyes closed. \u201cTessa?\u201d I asked him. His eyes closed and his head dropped forward. \u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, shaking my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Angel,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure, but the cops are here. I need you to come out of there so you can talk to them,\u201d he told me gently, holding out his hand again.</p><p>I nodded, reluctantly taking it. Even though I didn\u2019t like Tessa, she didn\u2019t deserve what had happened to her. None of the people in the room deserved what had happened to them.</p><p>\u201cI should have tried to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you could have done,\u201d Link said, and my eyes went from to the floor to his. He shook his head, wrapped his beefy arm around my shoulders, and walked me over to a barstool.</p><p>I sat there until the cops came up a few minutes later and told me that they needed to talk to me at the station.</p><p>\u201cCan she get some clothes on?\u201d Link, who had given me the shirt off his back and hadn\u2019t left my side, asked one of the detectives.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the guy mumbled.</p> <p>I slid off the barstool and dazedly walked to the dressing room. When I walked in, all the girls were there huddled together and crying. I didn\u2019t know what to say to them; most of them had been friends with Tessa. I felt horrible that they had lost their friend, but I was unsure if they would want me to express my condolences.</p><p>I walked to my locker and started to pull off my stockings when one of the girls came up to me, wrapping her arms around me. Shocked, I hugged her back, and more of the girls gathered around me. We all stood there silently for a few minutes. Most of the girls were crying while a couple mumbled about how everything would be okay. I wasn\u2019t sure anything would ever be okay again; I\u2019d just watched five people die and was lucky to still be alive.</p><p>\u201cI have to go with the police,\u201d I told the girls when it didn\u2019t seem like they were going to let me go.</p><p>After a second, they all started breaking away from me one by one, giving me reassuring hugs. \u201cCall me if you want to talk,\u201d one of the girls, Elsa, said, handing me a business card with her personal information on it.</p><p>I looked at it for a long second before nodding. I had never really been friends with any of them. Maybe that needed to change.</p><p>I went to my locker, pulling off my clothes before slipping on a pair of jean shorts, a black tank top, an oversized, grey sweater, and a pair of black flip-flops. I grabbed my bag, shoved everything from my locker into it, and left the room without a backwards glance.</p><p>Link was waiting for me outside the dressing room door, his back against the wall, his head tilted back, looking at the ceiling. I\u2019ve known Link since I started working at The Lion\u2019s Den. He\u2019s a nice guy, with blond hair cut low to his head, tan skin, blue eyes, and a Southern drawl that made women fall to their knees. He used to flirt with me when I first started, but when I didn\u2019t return any of the banter, he laid off and became a friend. He is one of the only people who knows about my past and the things I\u2019ve gone through.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for me,\u201d I told him, pulling my bag across my body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go through this alone.\u201d He pulled me into his side.</p><p>I could feel tears stinging my eyes, and I fought them back. I wasn\u2019t going to cry until this was all over, when I could do it alone while hiding under my covers with my face stuffed into a pillow...like I always did.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a squeeze, and I felt his lips at the top of my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I have to leave the state,\u201d I told Link, putting another pair of shoes in my bag. I had no idea how long I would be gone, and Link had made it sound like I wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to Vegas for a long while.</p><p>\u201cI hate to remind you, but you\u2019re the only witness, and from what the cops said, the guy is a killer paid by the Mob to do hits on people.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, looking around my house. I hated that I was leaving, but I knew it was for the best. I\u2019d been at the police station for over eight hours, going over what had happened. Then I\u2019d sat with a sketch artist. Somehow, the guy who had shot Tessa and those men had avoided every camera in the club. The cops had informed me that I needed to be extra cautious. I was the only witness, and they were concerned that he would come after me.</p><p>When Link had found out what they\u2019d said, he\u2019d made a call to one of his friends from back home in Tennessee and asked if he would be willing to let me stay with him until the police caught the guy. The man, Kenton, had agreed, telling Link that I would be safe. I hated that I was leaving my home, but if my only options were either death or moving, the choice was begrudgingly clear.</p> <p>\u201cI hope they get the guy fast,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cMe too, but until then, you will be far away from here and safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a good idea to have me stay with this guy? I mean, how well do you really know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were best friends growing up. He\u2019s a good guy. You\u2019ll be safe with him.\u201d</p><p>I bit the inside of my cheek and nodded before going into the closet to get another suitcase. Might as well pack enough stuff to last me. Once I was all packed and ready to go, we got into Link\u2019s SUV and headed for the airport. I was nervous the whole way, feeling like something crazy was about to happen...</p> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re about twenty minutes out from our arrival destination. The weather in Nashville is mostly clear and sunny. The temperature is eighty-five degrees. The pilot has now turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Flight crew, please prepare for landing,\u201d I hear through my sleep-ridden state and lift my head from the wall where I was resting it.</p><p>The memories of what happened yesterday leave my head as I wipe my mouth with the sleeve of my sweater before looking around to see that everyone is putting their belongings away. I make sure my seatbelt is secure before sitting back. My leg starts quickly bouncing up and down, and I rub the tattoo behind my ear, trying to think about something other than the plane landing.</p><p>Once we are on the ground, I wait until everyone is off the plane to make my way out into the terminal. I go to baggage claim and look around, but I have no clue what this guy looks like. All I know is that his name is Kenton and he is supposed to be picking me up.</p><p>I don\u2019t see anyone who looks like they\u2019re searching for someone, so I go to the conveyer belt and spot one of my bags as soon as I get there. I pull it off, stumbling back slightly from the weight as every guy here just watches me without offering to help.</p><p>I look around again, wondering if I\u2019m supposed to call someone to tell them that I landed. I pull my phone out, click it off airplane mode, and send a text to Link, letting him know that I have arrived. He sends me a message back, letting me know that Kenton called and told him that he couldn\u2019t make it to pick me up and I should just catch a cab to his house. The door would be unlocked, and the address is in the message.</p><p>I shake my head, cursing under my breath, and almost miss one of my other bags going around the belt. Luckily, I catch it at the last second. I carry it over to my other bag and turn around just in time to see my last bag about to go through the tunnel. I run as fast as I can in my flip-flops and land halfway on the conveyor belt. My bottom half is being dragged along the floor as I grab the handle of my bag, pulling it back so hard that it flies over me, causing me to land on my back with my hands over my head.</p> <p>\u201cYou must be Autumn,\u201d I hear rumbled from above me.</p><p>I tilt my head back and look up at the man standing over me. He\u2019s upside down, but even from my awkward position, I can tell that he is good-looking. His chuckle makes me grit my teeth. I stand up, putting my bag on its wheels and dusting off my butt before turning back to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>He raises a brow at me, shaking his head, looking me over from head to toe. My body heats immediately under his gaze. I take my sweater off, wrapping it around my waist and clearing my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d I ask him again, getting annoyed that he\u2019s obviously finding this so funny, if the smirk on his face is anything to go by.</p><p>\u201cKenton.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThose bags yours?\u201d He nods towards my other two bags.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I blow some hair out of my face, looking into his amber eyes and wondering why the hell I feel so hot all of a sudden.</p><p>He looks away, going over to my bags while I take the time to look him over. He\u2019s tall, much taller than my five six. His hair touches the edge of the black T-shirt he has on. He needed a cut a while ago, but judging by the dark scruff along his jaw, I can tell that he doesn\u2019t care much about grooming. His shoulders are broad, tapering down to a lean waist. His thighs are thick, encased in a pair of dark jeans that have shredded around the seams, and his wallet is imprinted in the back pocket like he wears them often.</p> <p>I look at his ass as he leans over. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m checking a man out; I\u2019m not one to be the slightest bit sexually interested in anyone. My eyes travel lower, looking at his feet, which are encased in a very large pair of black boots. I wonder absently if what they say about shoe size is true. I shake my head at my thoughts, dragging my bag with me towards him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d I tell him when I reach his side. My head tilts back to look up into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, change of plans,\u201d he mutters, looking at me.</p><p>I wait to see if he\u2019s going to say anything else. Apparently, he isn\u2019t going to, so I shake my head again and lower my face towards the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d His voice is dark and rich, and it does something crazy to my insides. I nod, lifting my head. \u201cLet\u2019s roll. You can sleep when we reach the house.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything else. Something is wrong with me. Maybe I\u2019m getting sick, I think, putting my palm to my forehead. When I don\u2019t feel anything, I start to follow him out of the terminal to the car park.</p><p>When we reach the parking lot, he stops and pulls a set of keys from his pocket. I hear the beep and look around, expecting him to be driving a large truck, a Hummer, or maybe even a tank. I never expected him to be driving a Dodge Viper. The black-on-black of the car only makes it look hotter. I look at my bags, wondering how we will get them in the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be tight, but they\u2019ll fit,\u201d he mumbles, pulling my other two bags with him.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but notice the flex of his muscles as he gets my bags into the car or the fact even his fingers are attractive. It takes some maneuvering, but he does get my bags to fit. I sigh, sitting down on the warm leather once we\u2019re done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna drop you off at the house. I gotta head out for a bit, but you have free rein. Just make yourself at home. There\u2019s food in the fridge and fresh sheets on the bed in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this,\u201d I tell him, looking at his profile. He is seriously good-looking, and the butterflies in my stomach are making me feel anxious about staying with him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. So...you and Link?\u201d</p><p>It takes a second to decipher his words between the thickness of his accent, his smell, and the nervous energy I\u2019m feeling. Being in his presence, my brain seems to have shut down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d Shit, maybe I should have said that he was my boyfriend.</p><p>I look over at him again; he doesn\u2019t seem to be as on edge as I am. He\u2019s probably used to women swooning over him. My gut tightens with something, and it takes a second to realize what it is. My body freezes. Jealousy? Really? I must be going into shock or something. I don\u2019t get jealous.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you two meet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe work at the same club,\u201d I murmur, squirming in my seat.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he mumbles, his knuckles turning white from his grip on the steering wheel. I don\u2019t know what that means, but the energy in the car changes, making me want to get away from him.</p><p>We drive in silence for the next half hour, the car winding its way through one small town after another until we go up what seems like the side of a mountain. The area is surrounded by forest on either side of the road. We drive for five more minutes before turning onto a dirt road that takes us deeper into the forest. I want to ask if he lives out here and about where he works\u2014and a million other questions\u2014but my mouth has gone dry and the energy in his car hasn\u2019t gotten any better, so I decide to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be stuck with him for a while, so I figure there will be time for all of that later. I look ahead of us and squint as the image of a large house comes into view. It is a very large brick house. The front has two porches\u2014one on the first floor, one on the second\u2014and both wrap around the front of the house. It\u2019s beautiful and expansive.</p><p>I look over at Kenton again, gauging if I should ask him if this is his house. His jaw is ticking, and the vein in his neck is pulsing wildly. I have no idea what\u2019s set him off, but I figure my best bet is to sit there quietly until he calms down.</p><p>We park in front of the house, where there is no real designated parking place. He unfolds himself out of the car without saying anything, and I take it as my cue to follow him. By the time I make it to the back of the car, he has both of my bags out and is back on the driver\u2019s side, sliding his seat forward so he can get to the bag in the back seat. Without a word, he carries two of my bags up the front porch and right into the house. I drag my last bag with me, following close behind him.</p> <p>He sets my bags down at the bottom of the staircase then turns to look at me. \u201cYour room is at the top of the stairs to the right. There\u2019s a bathroom across the hall you can use. I have my own.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair and looks me over again, anger apparent on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want random men in my house, so if you need to get off, take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>I blink at him as he continues.</p><p>\u201cThe code for the alarm is 4-5-9-3. Don\u2019t forget to set it when you\u2019re in the house. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back, but you\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d Before I even have a chance to form a complete thought, he is closing the door behind him, shouting, \u201cSet the alarm!\u201d I stand there for a few minutes, just looking at the door. Then I look around for an alarm but don\u2019t see one. Tears sting my nose again as I recall the look of disgust on his face when he told me to get myself off. I say a silent, \u201cFuck you,\u201d and look at my bags then the stairs, shaking my head. I can cry once I get settled in the room.</p><p>I carry my bags one at a time up the stairs, and by the time I\u2019m done, I\u2019m so exhausted that I lie face-first on the bed, put my head under the pillow, and cry until I fall asleep.</p><p>There is a pounding on the door, and I roll, falling off the bed and onto the floor. \u201cYou didn\u2019t set the alarm,\u201d I hear growled.</p><p>I stand up, pushing my hair out of my face, and glare at Kenton, who is standing in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI looked and didn\u2019t see the alarm to set it.\u201d I copy his posture, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou should have called and asked me where it is.\u201d</p> <p>I scoff. \u201cWith what? Magic? I don\u2019t have your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have asked Link for it.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if you wanted me to have your number, I figured you would\u2019ve given it to me,\u201d I retort.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d he asks, changing the subject suddenly and throwing me off guard.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019m just really tired,\u201d I tell him, rubbing my face. All I want to do is go to sleep and forget about the last forty-eight hours.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat something,\u201d he chides, uncrossing his arms and placing his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m really thankful for you looking out for me, but I have been taking care of myself for a very long time. I don\u2019t want or need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He shrugs then looks me over again, his eyes lingering on my chest.</p><p>I glance down and groan. Seriously? My boobs are in my bra, hanging over the top of my tank top. I quickly adjust my shirt before narrowing my eyes on him.</p><p>He smirks, looking up into my face. \u201cMake sure you set the alarm from now on. The panel is inside the room off the entry, first door to the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d My body is doing that hot thing again, and I wonder why it keeps happening when he\u2019s around.</p><p>\u201cAll right, doll. Get some rest. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He lets his eyes linger on me for a few more moments and then shakes his head, stepping out of the room.</p><p>I go to the side of the bed and turn on the light before walking to the door and shutting it. I lean my head back, closing my eyes and breathing in deeply. I run a finger across the tattoo behind my ear before opening my eyes and looking around. I can do this; I have lived through much worse and come out on top. I just need to get a plan in place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Word Vomit</p><p>It\u2019s been three weeks since I moved to Tennessee. Three weeks of living with Kenton, who I don\u2019t see very often, and when I do, he\u2019s usually leaving for work or coming in before going to bed. One of the longest talks we\u2019ve had was the other day when he came in and told me that he had something for me and to meet him out front. I tucked my Kindle away and followed him out of the house, down the front steps, to a small VW Beetle.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s wife just got rid of it. You don\u2019t have a car, and I know it\u2019s not an easy trek to town.\u201d</p> <p>I looked from the car, to him, then back again.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the key. It has a full tank of gas, new tires, plus a tune-up,\u201d he told me, holding out the key between his large fingers. \u201cThis is the part where you say, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d he grumbled, looking at me then at the keys in his hand.</p><p>\u201cUm...I... Thank you,\u201d I whispered, taking the keys from him with shaky fingers.</p><p>He nodded, looking like he was going to say something else, but instead, he left me standing there, looking at the car, dumbfounded by the act of generosity. No one had ever done anything like that for me before.</p><p>From that day on, I tried to help where I could. I tried to cook a couple of times, but that was a disaster, so I settled on showing my appreciation in other ways. I kept the house clean, went to the grocery store if I noticed things running low, and even did laundry if I saw it piling up. He told me that I didn\u2019t need to do everything I was doing, but I ignored him. I knew he appreciated my help. He was always busy and seemed to be running himself ragged.</p> <p>When we did have moments to talk, he smiled more and seemed more at ease with me. I lived for the stolen moments I had with him. It was stupid, but I felt like a lost puppy looking for a bone. I hated and loved that he made me feel like that. I had wondered for a long time if I had somehow become asexual. I hadn\u2019t been interested in a guy since my first and last boyfriend.</p><p>I walk down the stairs, going into the kitchen to grab some much-needed coffee. I just got off the phone. The hospital I worked at in Vegas has agreed to transfer my hours to a hospital they are affiliated with in Nashville. Then I called the hospital in Nashville, and they want me to start as soon as possible. My shift will be eleven to seven a.m. They told me that, after I\u2019m on staff for a while, I can change up my schedule. It doesn\u2019t matter to me what hours I work, just as long as I\u2019m working.</p><p>I\u2019m on cloud nine; I can\u2019t wait to get back to work. Nursing is something I love doing and am really good at.</p><p>I hit the bottom landing of the stairs and go around the corner into the kitchen. Kenton is standing at the stove on the phone. His back is to me, so I take a second to admire him.</p><p>Today\u2019s jeans are light blue and faded in all the right spots. His red T-shirt fits him snugly, showing off his muscles while enhancing his tan. His head turns towards me; his golden eyes hit mine and then do a head-to-toe sweep.</p><p>\u201cYou want coffee?\u201d he rumbles out, his deep voice making my girly parts tingle.</p> <p>I hear him say goodbye to whoever\u2019s on the phone before he sets it on the counter. His eyes look me over again and his mouth starts to twitch.</p><p>\u201cYou want coffee?\u201d he asks again, this time a small smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cI...um... Yes please,\u201d I tell him, walking fully into the kitchen.</p><p>His house is older, the kitchen showing the wear and tear of having been around for so long. Everything is clean but in major need of updating. The cabinets are a light wood, and the counters are some old laminate that has started chipping around the edges. The fridge, stove, and dishwasher are white and desperately need to be replaced.</p><p>He hands me a cup of coffee, and I quickly add milk and sugar before hopping up on the counter, sitting across from him, praying that I don\u2019t continue to make a fool out of myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for the day?\u201d he asks, looking at me from over the top of his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cI need to go shopping. I left all my work clothes back home and I just got a job in Nashville,\u201d I tell him, smiling.</p><p>His cup lowers as his hand turns white on the handle. \u201cLike I told you before, I don\u2019t want randoms in my house.\u201d</p> <p>My face heats and I take a breath, needing to make sure I understand what he\u2019s saying before I flip out and kick him in the balls. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018randoms\u2019?\u201d I ask, keeping my voice light.</p><p>He studies me for a second like he\u2019s debating his next words. Smart man. \u201cGuys from the strip club.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he\u2019s not that smart. I take another breath as my stomach turns. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t bring my work home with me,\u201d I tell him, dumping out the almost-full cup of coffee into the sink. I jump off the counter, putting the cup in the dishwasher before grabbing my bag and heading for the door.</p><p>I\u2019m used to being judged, but for some reason, it coming from him makes me feel sick. I hate that he somehow has that kind of power over me. I hate that I want him to take a second to get to know me.</p><p>I get into the Beetle, telling myself that, as soon as I get back, I\u2019m going to find out the value of the car he got me and give him the money for it.</p><p>I quickly ask Siri where I can find a store to buy scrubs, and once I have the directions pulled up, I put the car in drive, do a U-turn in front of the house, and head into town. First, I go to the scrubs shop and spend over five hundred dollars. Who doesn\u2019t need cute scrubs?</p><p>When I\u2019m done with that, I go to a nearby nail salon and get a manicure and pedicure. Then I come across a small soul food restaurant and have barbecue ribs and homemade macaroni and cheese. For dessert, I have made-from-scratch peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Now that I can eat whatever I want without worrying about my appearance, I plan on eating everything I\u2019ve been denied.</p><p>When I was growing up and competing in beauty pageants, there wasn\u2019t a week that went by that I didn\u2019t have a competition. My mom was very strict about what I ate. Everything was premeasured and my calorie intake was no more than what was necessary to survive. I didn\u2019t even know what sugar tasted like until I turned sixteen. Then, when I moved to Vegas and my jobs all required me to have a certain image, I stuck with my old habits.</p><p>But now? Fuck that! I\u2019m going to eat\u2014and eat everything. After eating, I\u2019m not ready to go home, so I go to the movies, buy a ticket, and sit in the dark theater alone, watching as a young woman is attacked by an evil spirit. Well, I think that\u2019s what it is... About halfway through, I fall asleep. I wake up to screaming and have no clue what is going on, so I get up and leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I pull up in front of the house, the first thing I notice is Kenton\u2019s car parked out front. I really don\u2019t want to see him again, but I know I can\u2019t avoid going inside forever. I get out of the car, leaving the bags with my new work clothes in the trunk. He doesn\u2019t need to know what I\u2019ll really be doing. He chose to make assumptions about me, so he can continue to think what he wants.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to try to change his mind. Yes, he\u2019s good-looking, but I\u2019m starting to see a pattern. He\u2019s a dick and judgmental. He\u2019s a judgmental dick.</p><p>I sigh, walking up the front porch, and as soon as I unlock the door and push it open, the smell of something cooking hits my nose. Even though I ate earlier, my stomach growls. I ignore my stomach and start for the stairs. I have a candy bar in my bag; that can hold me over until tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d I hear from behind me as my foot hits the first step.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d I look over my shoulder at him. Why does he have to be so good-looking?</p><p>\u201cI made dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d I say sarcastically, going up two more stairs.</p><p>\u201cLook, I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said earlier.\u201d He sighs, and I wonder if he has ever apologized in his life.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d I agree, taking a few more steps.</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop for a second?\u201d He lets out a huff, and I turn to face him, raising an eyebrow. \u201cCome eat so we can talk. You\u2019re living here. I think it\u2019s only right that we get to know at least a little about each other.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue to tell him to f**k off, but sadly, my manners are ingrained in me. I turn, walk down the stairs, and follow him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWill you get out a couple plates?\u201d he asks, going to the oven. As soon as he has the oven open, the smell of baked chicken hits me, making my stomach growl again. \u201cYou really should eat more,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I turn to look at him and feel my temper spike. \u201cI did eat,\u201d I tell him, pulling down two plates before getting two sets of silverware out of the drawer and setting them on the counter with a little too much force.</p><p>\u201cI mean something besides rabbit food. You need to gain some weight.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath and blow it out slowly, counting in my head from one to ten. \u201cOkay\u201d\u2014I turn my face to look at him\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the filter that goes from your brain to your mouth, and honestly, I really don\u2019t care.\u201d I turn around to face him completely. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you saying things to me about my job, my free time, or my eating habits. I appreciate what you\u2019re doing for me, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to talk shit to me whenever you feel like it.\u201d</p> <p>I inhale deeply before letting out a breath, noticing that his eyes seem to have gone softer. Something about that look makes me feel better, but I finish with, \u201cIf you think that\u2019s going to be a problem, I can find somewhere else to stay until I can go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t have said that to you.\u201d He shakes his head, running a hand through his hair before our eyes meet again. \u201cLet\u2019s start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nod, my insides twisting under his gaze. Every time he looks at me, I feel like he sees way too much.</p><p>He walks towards me, sticking out his hand. \u201cKenton Mayson.\u201d</p><p>I put out my hand for him to take. \u201cAutumn Freeman,\u201d I tell him, and our eyes lock as his fingers wrap around mine. His touch sends tingles down my spine. I lick my lips, which have suddenly gone dry.</p><p>His eyes drop to my mouth before meeting mine again. \u201cRight.\u201d His voice seems deeper than before and his eyes seem to have gone darker. \u201cGet the salad, babe.\u201d He nods towards the fridge, dropping my hand.</p><p>My stomach flips at the word \u2018babe.\u2019 I ignore it and go to the fridge, pulling the salad out as he pulls some potatoes out of the oven, setting one on each plate before adding a golden piece of chicken as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice night. How \u2019bout we sit out on the deck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agree.</p><p>He finishes making our plates, adding butter and sour cream to the potatoes then adding salad to the dishes. \u201cGet the door for me.\u201d</p><p>I open the sliding glass door in the kitchen that leads to the deck. He sets the plates down on the table before coming back in, opening the fridge, and grabbing a beer.</p><p>\u201cYou want one?\u201d he asks, holding up the beer.</p><p>I shake my head; I\u2019ve never had beer...or any kind of alcohol for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like beer? I got a bottle of wine if you prefer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a beer?\u201d His voice sounds shocked, and I shake my head no again.</p><p>I have worked around alcohol since I was twenty-one, but I have also seen the way it makes people act and have never trusted anyone enough to be that unguarded around them. I watch as he goes to the counter, puts the beer to the edge, and pops the top off.</p><p>\u201cTry a sip,\u201d he orders.</p><p>I reluctantly take it. Why? I don\u2019t know. Normally, I would have stood my ground a little more firmly. I put the bottle to my lips and tip it back. The bubbles and cold hit my tongue before the taste. I pull the bottle away, scrunch up my face as the flavor hits me, and hand the bottle back to him.</p><p>\u201cNot a beer girl,\u201d he assesses with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, but it doesn\u2019t taste good either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an acquired taste. Do you like wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had it.\u201d I shrug, crossing my arms over my chest, feeling like I need to hold myself together.</p><p>His eyes drop for a second before meeting mine again. \u201cMost women like wine.\u201d</p><p>I ignore that comment and watch him go to the fridge to pull out a bottle of wine. He goes to the drawer, pulls out a bottle opener, and starts to screw it into the top of the bottle. His arm muscles flex with every turn, and soon, there\u2019s a pop and a hiss.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any wine glasses,\u201d he says, pulling a coffee cup down. He pours a small amount into the cup, handing it to me.</p><p>I take it and put the cup to my face, giving it a sniff before placing it against my lips and tilting it back. This time after the taste hits my mouth, I smile.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. You like wine,\u201d he declares, sounding proud.</p><p>I nod and start to wipe my mouth with the sleeve of my sweater. His hand moves towards me, his fingers curve around my jaw, and his thumb runs over my bottom lip, his eyes watching closely. He leans forward, making my stomach drop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat before the food gets too cold,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod, taking a step back trying to get myself under control. He fills the coffee cup with wine and waits for me to go outside before following me out onto the deck. I sit down on the iron chair as he sits in a plastic one across from me. I take a second to look around. The whole house is surrounded by trees, and it was built into a kind of valley. There isn\u2019t much of a backyard. It all seems to be forest beyond the small area of grass.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you lived here?\u201d I take another sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cAbout five years. I had plans to fix it up, but with my schedule, I\u2019ve only had time to redo my bathroom and bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really nice house.\u201d I take a bite of the chicken and moan when the taste hits my mouth. His eyes lock on me, making me squirm and lower my head.</p><p>\u201cI like it. I really bought it for the view.\u201d He takes a bite from his plate.</p><p>I nod. I bought my condo for the same reason. \u201cThis is a nice view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing better than coming out here at night with a cold beer and watching the sun set behind the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to try that one day\u2014minus the beer.\u201d I lift my coffee cup.</p> <p>He smiles, and for the first time, I notice a dimple in his right cheek. The sight of that dimple makes my stomach flutter.</p><p>\u201cYou should smile more,\u201d I blurt like the moron he\u2019s turned me into.</p><p>He smiles bigger, shaking his head while muttering, \u201cCute,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>The rest of dinner is nice. We laugh and joke, and he tells me about his job and the people he works with. He never asks me about my work again, nor does he give me an in to talk about it.</p><p>By the time we are done eating, a chill has filled the air. Kenton goes back inside and gets me a sweater and the bottle of wine, and then he comes back out with a cigar. I drink wine while he lights his cigar, which smells sweet and has me leaning closer to him.</p><p>When he\u2019s done smoking, I\u2019m completely drunk for the first time in my life, and I\u2019m laughing at everything he says.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, babe. Time to get you to bed.\u201d He pulls me up from the chair, smiling, and I lift my fingers to trace his upturned lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really beautiful,\u201d I tell him, wrapping my arms around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call guys beautiful, baby.\u201d</p><p>I smile before frowning. \u201cMy son was beautiful.\u201d I am too drunk to notice that his body has gone solid against mine. \u201cHolding him was the only time I\u2019ve ever been happy...until tonight. I was happy tonight.\u201d I sigh, laying my head on his chest. I think I hear him mutter a curse, but my drunken state has me unsure.</p><p>\u201cUp you go,\u201d he says softly, putting his arm behind my knees and lifting me up.</p><p>I bury my face in the crook of his neck, enjoying his smell. I feel him laying me down, and then my shoes are being pulled off.</p><p>\u201cNight, beautiful girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me beautiful,\u201d I mumble, cuddling deeper into my covers.</p> <p>\u201cNight, Autumn.\u201d</p><p>I feel lips on my forehead and sigh, liking the way his lips feel against my skin.</p><p>I wake up to the sun shining brightly through my window. I squeeze my eyes closed and put my hand to my head, which is throbbing. I can\u2019t remember much about last night\u2014just drinking wine and laughing a lot. Apparently, I\u2019m not a drinker.</p><p>I keep my eyes closed as I get out of bed and stumble across the hall to the bathroom. I turn on the water and jump into the shower, letting the cool water run over me. By the time I\u2019m done, my headache has lessened significantly. I get out and wrap a towel around myself, tucking it under my arms. I open the medicine cabinet and take a couple of pain pills before making it across the hall to get dressed.</p><p>When I\u2019m finally downstairs, I feel almost one hundred percent. I pour myself a cup of coffee before heading to Kenton\u2019s office. I need to get on the computer and print off the application for the hospital. Even though I got the job already, they still require me to fill it out.</p><p>My step falters slightly as I make my way down the hall. I can hear the sound of Kenton\u2019s voice. I don\u2019t mean to spy, but when I hear him talking about me, I can\u2019t help but listen.</p><p>\u201cI would never take a stripper home to meet my mom, so your point is moot.\u201d</p><p>My throat starts to close as I walk closer. I stop in the doorway, taking Kenton in while his face is turned to look out the window. The phone\u2019s against his ear and his knuckles are turning white from the grip he has on it.</p><p>\u201cFuck off. She\u2019s a stripper,\u201d he growls into the phone.</p><p>A whimper I can\u2019t control climbs up my throat before I can stop it. His head turns my way, our eyes lock, and his get wide.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he says then pulls the phone from his ear. \u201cNot you, f**ker. I gotta go.\u201d He hangs up and looks at me. I want to run so badly, but my feet feel like they are glued to the floor. \u201cBabe,\u201d he repeats, looking at me with his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot more than a stripper.\u201d I raise my hand before flopping it down at my side when it looks like he\u2019s going to say something. \u201cI\u2019m a person with feelings. I have my own hopes and dreams. I don\u2019t know how you can judge someone so easily without knowing what they\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>His eyes go soft again, but this time, I don\u2019t let that stop me. \u201cHonestly, it makes me sad that you\u2019re so close-minded, and I\u2019m glad I now see who you really are.\u201d Tears clog my throat, forcing me to pause. His eyes have changed again, but I don\u2019t know what the look means. \u201cUnlike you, I gave you the benefit of the doubt. The difference is you proved me right more than once,\u201d I say softly, leaving him standing.</p><p>I go upstairs and change into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt before grabbing my bag. Then I leave. I get into the car and pound the steering wheel a couple of times when I realize I forgot to find out how much the car had cost him. I do not want to feel like he has something over me. I put the keys in the ignition, promising myself that I will look up the Kelley Blue Book value.</p><p>I do a U-turn in front of the house and just drive. I have no idea where I\u2019m going, but there is no way I am going to sit around his house all day. I pull out my phone, thankful that I have my headphones already hooked in so I can make a call. I press Link\u2019s name as soon as I have his number pulled up on my phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, Angel.\u201d My stripper name makes me feel even colder for some reason when he answers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey. How are things?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Sid\u2019s worried about you. He wants you to call him, but like I told you before, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to make any phone calls right now.\u201d</p><p>I need to call Sid, but I feel awkward phoning him for some reason. \u201cCan I come home?\u201d I pull off the road when I reach a small gas station. I put my car in park, leaning my head back, trying to keep the tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I just want my life back,\u201d I fib.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, you know you can\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d I ask on a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAngel, I wish I could tell you the cops caught the guy or that they have a lead, but right now, they\u2019ve got nothing. You\u2019re safe there.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a joke; I\u2019m in more danger here than I was back home. Why am I so upset about this?</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Link asks, pulling me from my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked how you and Kenton are getting along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine... You know, he goes his way and I go mine,\u201d I answer casually.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you leaving out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what? I got a job in Nashville at a hospital,\u201d I say, changing the subject. I do not want to talk to Link about Kenton. They were friends long before I was in the picture.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news, Autumn, but...\u201d He clears his throat, and I can\u2019t tell that he\u2019s trying not to burst my bubble. \u201cI know you\u2019re a long way from here, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re one hundred percent safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you know where I am, right? So I should be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful...and keep Kenton up-to-date about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d I say, knowing that I won\u2019t be doing anything like that at all.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Talk to you later,\u201d I say softly, hanging up the phone. \u201cMay as well go get breakfast,\u201d I mutter to myself, putting my car back in drive. I reach a small town after fifteen minutes, pull into the first restaurant I see, get out of my car, and head inside.</p><p>The place is small, with a total of five booths and a long counter that stretches the length of the diner, which has short barstools lining the front of it. I walk to a small booth in the back, pushing my bag across the seat before sitting down. The smell of bacon and eggs has my mouth watering.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I getcha, sugar?\u201d asks a pretty, older woman with dark-brown hair that\u2019s in a bun at the top of her head as she pulls a pen from behind her ear.</p> <p>\u201cCoffee, pancakes, bacon, and eggs.\u201d</p><p>Her head lifts, looking at me. \u201cA woman who\u2019s not afraid to eat,\u201d she smiles. \u201cBe back with your coffee.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she leaves, I take out my cell phone and pull up my Kindle app. Any time I need a break from reality, I read. There is nothing better than going on an adventure or imagining two people falling in love.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sugar?\u201d the woman asks, making me jump in my chair.</p><p>\u201cAutumn. Thank you,\u201d I say when she sets the cup down in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Viv. You got man problems?\u201d she asks, sitting down across from me like it\u2019s completely normal to sit with someone you don\u2019t know and ask them such a personal question.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I see it in your eyes that you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I start to tell her that I don\u2019t when she cuts me off again.</p><p>\u201cMy mamma was able to see things, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agree, because who am I to judge? For all I know, her mom could have a gift.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see things too,\u201d she says. I watch her, wondering where she\u2019s going with this. \u201cThe guy you like, well... He\u2019s kinda an ass, like my old man used to be,\u201d she tells me, leaning forward like it\u2019s a secret between us.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with what he\u2019s feeling, so he\u2019s an ass.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou hear what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she\u2019s saying, but she\u2019s dead-on that Kenton is an ass, so I nod my head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cMake him grovel. Whatever you do, you make him pay for being an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cNow, when you do forgive him\u201d\u2014she shocks me by grabbing my hand\u2014\u201cwhat you\u2019re feeling right now will be worth it in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d I tell her, patting her hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, now you just sit back and I\u2019m going to feed you the best pancakes you\u2019ve ever eaten in your life. Food makes everything okay.\u201d She stands, leaving me wondering what the hell just happened.</p><p>Viv comes back a few minutes later with a plate overflowing with pancakes, bacon, and eggs. She sets the plate in front of me before taking a seat across from me again.</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you\u2019re new around these parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just moved here,\u201d I tell her, my mouth watering from the smell coming from the plate.</p><p>\u201cDid you move here to be with the ass?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at her name for Kenton. \u201cUm...no, and we\u2019re not together. I mean, we have never been together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2014tomato, tomatoes.\u201d She waves her hand at me, and I can\u2019t help but smile at the way she messed up the saying. \u201cYou got family \u2019round here?\u201d she asks, sitting forward in the booth like my answer is really important.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, taking a bite of bacon.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to come over and have dinner sometime. My ass makes a mean brisket.\u201d She smiles, watching me take another bite. \u201cGood, right?\u201d she prompts.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d I nod, covering my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou should come over next Sunday. We close the diner early that day and have a big Sunday meal with all the fixings. My daughter and my niece are a little younger than you, but I would guess my nephew is about your age, though he doesn\u2019t always show up. I\u2019m sure the girls would like to show you around. One sure way to get your man to mind is to find another man to show him you can have someone else if you want to,\u201d she rambles, and I can feel my eyes growing in size, so I cut her off.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Dinner\u2019s at three. We eat early. I\u2019ll give you my address. I expect to see you there,\u201d she says, standing up, and before I can come up with a good reason not to have Sunday dinner with her, her \u2018ass,\u2019 and their families, she disappears behind the counter and starts taking care of other customers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sit there for another hour, eating and reading on my phone. When Viv comes back, she gives me her address, cell phone number, and a very sweet hug. I leave the diner, get in my car, and head back to Kenton\u2019s. This time when I get there, his car is gone, and I breathe out a sigh of relief that I don\u2019t have to face him for a while.</p><p>I wake up to the sound of pounding and the doorbell going off. I roll and look at the clock on my bedside table, seeing that it\u2019s after three in the morning. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mumble sitting up. My brain is still asleep as I stumble through my bedroom door and down the stairs. When I reach the front door, I look out the peephole and see a beautiful woman with dark hair and sun-kissed skin standing outside.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re in there! Open up!\u201d she yells.</p><p>I turn off the alarm and open the door, leaving the night latch in place as I peek out the crack. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you help me?\u201d She waves her arms around. \u201cCan you help me? Yes, bitch, you can help me by telling me what you\u2019re doing in my man\u2019s house,\u201d she says, pushing on the door, the lock keeping her out.</p><p>\u201cYour man?\u201d I repeat, putting my weight against the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, my man.\u201d She shoves the door a little harder and I\u2019m surprised when I hear the sound of wood cracking.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re Kenton\u2019s girlfriend, then you need to call him. He\u2019s not home,\u201d I tell her, not liking the way my chest feels as the word \u2018girlfriend\u2019 leaves my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not home,\u201d she says, pressing on the door again.</p> <p>\u201cYou should call him or come see him tomorrow when he is here,\u201d I suggest, trying to be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cLet me inside.\u201d She takes her shoulder and slams it into the door.</p><p>She is really crazy. What the hell?</p><p>She stumbles back and then runs at the door again like some kind of football player. This time, the door crashes open. I fall on my ass and she flies into the house, falling onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king insane?!\u201d I ask her, standing and feeling a bruise forming on my hip. I look at the lock on the door, seeing it swinging on the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me in.\u201d She rolls over, getting on her knees before standing up.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Kenton\u2019s not here, you psycho. Now get out before I call the cops.\u201d I walk to the door, opening it wider, signaling for her to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to wait for Kenton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on crack if you think I\u2019m letting you stay here to wait for him. Get out!\u201d I point out the door just as lights beam through the house.</p><p>I look outside and watch Kenton pull up and park. He sees me standing in the door, and that\u2019s when I realize that all I have on is a T-shirt and panties\u2014and it\u2019s not even a long shirt. His eyes slide from me to the woman in the house and then narrow.</p><p>\u201cCassie, what the f**k?\u201d he growls at her, walking through the door.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she cries, taking a step towards him, only to stop when his eyes narrow further.</p><p>\u201cYou opened the door to her?\u201d he asks, looking at me.</p><p>I shake my head no, taking a step back from the look on his face.</p> <p>His head swings in her direction. \u201cYou know what time it is?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes. I got home to find all my stuff outside on my front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to my house and forced your way inside when I wasn\u2019t home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my stuff is ruined,\u201d she whines on a huff.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d he asks as he turns his head my way, his eyes locking on mine.</p><p>Heat boils under my skin at the endearment. I want to claw his eyes out.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Baby\u2019? Really? You call her \u2018baby\u2019? You never called me that!\u201d Cassie screeches, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too upset, honey,\u201d I tell her softly. \u201cI\u2019m just a stripper and don\u2019t mean shit to Kenton.\u201d My eyes go from her to him, and seeing his jaw ticking makes me feel better. \u201cNow,\u201d I say happily, \u201cif you two don\u2019t mind carrying on this love spat without me, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>I turn and head up the stairs, smiling when I hear Cassie yell, \u201cStripper?! A f**king stripper is living with you?\u201d</p><p>I close my bedroom door and crawl into bed. I listen to the rumble of Kenton\u2019s voice for a few minutes, and then I hear the door close and the alarm being set. I hold my breath as I listen to feet pound up the stairs. I don\u2019t know how I know, but I can feel him standing outside my bedroom door. The hall is silent for a few moments, and then he says my name. I ignore it, pulling the covers over my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I hear a thump then the sound of feet moving away from the door, and I squeeze my eyes closed, blocking him out. No way am I buying into that again. I run my finger over the tattoo behind my ear, taking comfort in it.</p><p>It\u2019s the only physical thing I have that connects me to my son. I wasn\u2019t allowed pictures or any other reminders from the nine months I carried him or the few hours I spent with him after his birth. Not that I would need them\u2014he was embedded in me, a piece of my soul that was taken from me before I was strong enough to fight for myself or him.</p><p>When I was sixteen, I met a guy. His sister used to compete in pageants against me, and he would show up at the competitions and sit in the crowd, looking annoyed about having to be there. He would growl at his mother, telling her how wrong it was what she was doing to his sister. He fascinated me. I wanted someone like him to fight for me or teach me how to fight for myself.</p><p>Not long after the first time I saw him, he found me in one of my favorite hiding spots. At first, he was rude and distant, only recognizing me as another snotty pageant girl, but then I told him that I hated it. I explained that I didn\u2019t have a choice and what would happen if I didn\u2019t perform.</p><p>After that, we met often. I trusted him. He told me what I wanted to hear\u2014we could be together, he had an apartment, and he would save me from the life I was living. For a girl who was broken and didn\u2019t know any better, he was perfect. It didn\u2019t take long for me to fall in love with him and give him the piece of myself that was the only real thing I had to give another person. I thought he loved me too; I thought he was willing to fight for me. He used my weakness to get what he wanted.</p><p>In the end, I learned a hard lesson. Not only did he not care about me, but when I ended up pregnant, he turned his back on me, allowing my mother to send me to a home for young girls to give birth to my son before being forced to give him away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull my pillow over my face and cry into the soft material as images of my son flash through my head. I think I memorized everything about him during those few short hours. He was so tiny, weighing only six pounds. His small head was covered in dark hair and his eyes were bluish grey. I remember praying that I would be able to see them one day to know what color they turned out to be.</p><p>He had a birthmark on his right thigh. I looked at the small area of discolored skin for a long time while I held him. The shape was unique, just like him. Not long after moving to Vegas, I was walking down the street and looked into a tattoo shop window. I hadn\u2019t wanted a tattoo until one of the posters on the wall caught my eye and I saw my son\u2019s birthmark. I went inside to find out what it was.</p><p>The old guy behind the counter got on his computer and looked it up for me. He told me that the symbol was an Ankh, the origin was Egyptian, and it represented eternal life or the giving of life. I couldn\u2019t believe that his birthmark had that kind of meaning behind it.</p><p>I knew that my son was the one who\u2019d actually given me life; he\u2019d made me fight harder to get out of my mother\u2019s grasp. I had hated her before he\u2019d come along, but after she forced me to give him away, I knew the kind of evil she really was and fought until I was finally free.</p> <p>I must have fallen asleep again, but when I wake up, I feel like I have only been asleep for an hour. The sound of the doorbell going off again registers, and I wait to see if I hear Kenton answer it. The house sounds quiet, and I hope the person at the door leaves. When the bell rings again, I let out a frustrated huff.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d I yell as the pounding starts.</p><p>I climb out of bed, stumble out of my room, run down the stairs, and swing the door open without thinking. The alarm starts going off and I run to the keypad, typing in the code quickly before turning and going back to the door.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I ask a guy who looks no older than twenty-one. He\u2019s tall and lean with tousled, blond hair. He looks like he just came from the beach.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He looks me over from head to toe, and I groan when I realize I once again forgot to put on pants. \u201cShit. Please tell me the carpet matches the drapes,\u201d he mumbles.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the lack of sleep or the promise I made myself the last time those words were said, but I walk towards him slowly, swaying my hips, my hands going up to his shoulders. His eyes go wide when I touch him, and then I bring my knee up, connecting with his nuts.</p><p>He groans, his knees hitting the floor with a loud thud. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asks me in a breathy, high-pitched voice, holding his junk.</p><p>\u201cThat was for asking an inappropriate question. Weren\u2019t you raised better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d</p><p>I turn at the sound of Kenton\u2019s words. He\u2019s standing on the stairs, wearing nothing but a towel. His eyes come to me then lower down my body. I make a mental note that, from now on, I will wear pants at all times. When his eyes stop on my hip, where I have a nice-size bruise from last night\u2019s run-in with the lunatic, they narrow.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d He looks at the guy on the floor then back at me. His jaw goes hard, and I put my hands up in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s from your girlfriend last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend,\u201d the guy I kneed says, whimpering as he stands.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you knee Justin in the nuts?\u201d he asks, walking the rest of the way down the stairs.</p><p>I try to take my eyes off him, but they feel glued. His wet hair is dripping onto his body. His abdominal muscles flex with each step. The deep V of his hips disappears beneath the small towel that is also showing off his well-endowed package. He walks past me and goes to the couch in the next room, coming back with a blanket in his hand. I don\u2019t even have a chance to think as he wraps the blanket around my waist. I slap his hands away from me, taking a step back to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. I\u2019m in love,\u201d the guy named Justin declares, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Justin? I told you I would be at the office late,\u201d Kenton growls, taking a step in my direction. I take another step away from him.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I needed to talk to you and it couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called,\u201d he scolds.</p> <p>\u201cI did. You didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Kenton looks at me like he wants to say something, but I shake my head no and take another step towards the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d Justin asks, looking at me with a big, cheesy smile on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re basically past second base. You touched my junk. It\u2019s only fair I get to touch yours.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at the guy. I see it now. He\u2019s not pervy, just strange and kinda cute in a brotherly kind of way. \u201cSorry. No, I need my beauty sleep, and I work tonight.\u201d I shrug, smirking.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need sleep, my love. You\u2019re alread\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kenton smacks him in the back of his head before he can finish, and I can\u2019t help but smile at him again.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Justin,\u201d I tell him, really meaning it.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Copper.\u201d He grins back.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re still not safe, Autumn. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to be working,\u201d Kenton says.</p><p>I look at him, my eyes narrow, and I growl. \u201cI\u2019m safe and going to work, ass, so get over it.\u201d</p><p>His jaw starts to tick a little faster and his hands ball into fists. \u201cTell me the name of the place so I can check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to check on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me or I\u2019ll have Justin do a run on you and I\u2019ll know everything about you down to your last f**king period,\u201d he growls, taking a step towards me.</p><p>\u201cAss!\u201d I yell, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he roars, leaning forward, and I can feel the anger rolling off him.</p><p>\u201cVanderbilt,\u201d I say, but I pronounce it \u2018Vander\u2019s Belt,\u2019 hoping he doesn\u2019t catch on that it\u2019s the hospital. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t what him to know what I\u2019m really doing. I almost feel like he hasn\u2019t earned the right to know.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he says, his tone softer, but the growl is still there.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d I assure him, pulling off the blanket and tossing it at him as I walk up the stairs. I hear Justin laugh and Kenton growl something about spankings under his breath before I close the door to my bedroom, smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>One Tequila, Two Tequila...Floor</p><p>\u201cSo why the hell did you want to move to Tennessee?\u201d Tara asks.</p><p>I\u2019ve been working at the hospital for about two weeks now, and I\u2019ve been Tara\u2019s shadow since the day I started in the ER. Tennessee is nothing like Vegas. Not only are the people different, but the ER here is much calmer. I look at Tara and smile when she raises an eyebrow at me. One thing I learned quickly is that people here have no problem getting in your business or asking personal questions.</p> <p>\u201cI just needed a change.\u201d I shrug, putting away another patient folder.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. I need a change, like a nice sandy beach and a hot guy to wait on me hand and foot.\u201d She smiles, her head tilting back like she\u2019s imagining herself on a beach right now.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, Tara,\u201d a deep voice says.</p><p>Tara and I look up and smile at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHow are you ladies this evening?\u201d Dr. D, or Derik, asks. He\u2019s a very, very attractive black man; sadly, he is also very, very g*y and has an even hotter boyfriend.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Tara and I say in unison. We laugh, pointing at each other and calling out, \u201cJinx!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve found myself laughing a lot more often since I started working here. In general, I find myself a lot happier period. All of my coworkers are very nice and easy to get along with. So far, I haven\u2019t met anyone who is petty or mean.</p><p>The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is my relationship with Kenton. I can\u2019t get over the amount of anger I feel towards him. Maybe it\u2019s stupid and immature on my part, but he hurt my feelings when he said all that to whomever he was talking to on the phone. Worse, I\u2019d thought he\u2019d been starting to like me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you girls doing this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep,\u201d I say, closing my eyes for a second. \u201cMy body hasn\u2019t adjusted to this schedule yet. I swear, if it weren\u2019t for coffee, I would be lying facedown on this desk right now.\u201d Plus, if I slept, I could continue to avoid Kenton.</p><p>He\u2019s left me a note daily and somehow got my cell number, so he\u2019s started texting me. He never says much. Mostly, he asks how I am, if I need anything, and if I am settling in at my job. I never answer him. I can tell that he is becoming frustrated. I have no idea how to face him, so I do the easiest thing and avoid him like the plague.</p> <p>\u201cSleep is overrated. You two should come out with me and Stan this weekend. There\u2019s a club that just opened up downtown. We could go out, have a couple drinks, and dance. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun?\u201d Derik asks.</p><p>I look at Tara, who nods her head, and I quickly agree. I need to start acting my age. I should be having fun and going out, and now that I have a few people I trust, I have a reason to do that.</p><p>\u201cSure, but I won\u2019t be staying out late. I have dinner plans with a friend on Sunday in the early afternoon,\u201d I tell them. I\u2019ve had dinner with Viv and her family the last two Sundays, and now, she expects me to be there. Her daughter is really sweet. Plus, her niece is supposed to be coming this weekend and Viv really wants me to meet her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Two drinks tops.\u201d Derik smiles and the desk phone rings.</p><p>Tara picks it up and stands suddenly. \u201cGot it,\u201d she says, looking at Derik. \u201cWhen?\u201d she asks and listens for a few more seconds before hanging up the phone. She leaves from behind the desk and I follow her. \u201cThe ambulance is in route. Male, thirty-four, gunshot wound to the right shoulder. He\u2019s conscious and may need a transfusion. We need to get everything set up. The ambulance is five minutes out,\u201d Tara says, and all three of us run down the hall to prepare the trauma bay before the patient arrives.</p><p>The ambulance pulls in and what I least expect happens. The guy is conscious, laughing, and joking with the EMTs like this is a routine occurrence for him. He hasn\u2019t lost enough blood to need a transfusion, and it doesn\u2019t appear that the bullet hit any arteries; it was a clean in-and-out shot. All he\u2019ll require is a few stitches and an overnight stay in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you two don\u2019t want to give me a sponge bath?\u201d Finn, our bullet wound patient asks.</p><p>I laugh, shaking my head at him, but Tara doesn\u2019t seem so sure about turning him down. His tall, lean body, boy-next-door good looks, and easy smile definitely make him swoon-worthy.</p> <p>\u201cNot tonight, handsome,\u201d Tara tells him, batting her lashes.</p><p>His hand goes over his heart as he flops back down in the bed and winces. \u201cYou wound me, Blondie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your ego will be okay.\u201d She smiles.</p><p>Tara is really beautiful. She has that whole Southern belle look going for her\u2014long, blond hair, big, blue eyes, and a cute personality. Actually, looking between the two of them, I see Ken and Barbie.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful with that shoulder,\u201d I scold Finn as he winces again when he sits up.</p><p>\u201cI could go home with you and you could look after me.\u201d He grins, making me roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I promised my roommate I wouldn\u2019t take my work home with me.\u201d I start laughing, thinking about Kenton and what he would do if I showed up with a guy who had a gunshot wound.</p><p>\u201cYour roommate sucks,\u201d Finn mutters.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I reply with a smile.</p><p>A second later, my body goes solid when the voice behind me hits my ears. \u201cWhat the f**k is going on, Autumn?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes slowly, hoping that I\u2019m wrong. When I turn my head, four large guys are standing near the door and none other than Kenton is standing in the middle of them.</p><p>\u201cAutumn?\u201d one of the guys says. My eyes go to him and he smiles. \u201cShit, boss. This is the Autumn who works at \u2018Vander\u2019s Belt\u2019?\u201d He laughs loudly, his eyes going back and forth between Kenton and me.</p><p>My eyes shift back to Kenton, seeing his jaw tick. \u201cUm...\u201d I mumble, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cVanderbilt,\u201d Kenton pronounces, his voice a low rumble. The anger in the one spoken word rolls against my skin, creating goose bumps. \u201cDo not f**king move,\u201d he demands when I start to take another step back.</p><p>My body freezes in place as I watch him move towards me, his eyes locked on mine. I feel stuck in place under his glare.</p><p>When he\u2019s within touching distance, his hand wraps around my bicep and his mouth comes to my ear. \u201cNo more f**king ignoring me,\u201d he growls.</p><p>If the wetness in my panties is anything to go by, I like his aggression. I look at Dr. D, who is looking at Kenton with his mouth hanging open, and when his eyes come to mine, he bites his lip. Apparently, he is not going to be any help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kenton drags me out of the room and down the hall. He stops at the first door we pass, and his hand that\u2019s not holding me goes to the handle. Finding it unlocked, he leans into the room before tugging me in with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask when I get over the shock of seeing him here.</p><p>\u201cYou said you worked at a f**king strip club,\u201d he says, letting me go.</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d I shake my head, crossing my arms over my chest, watching him pace back and forth in front of me like a caged beast.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a nurse?\u201d He stops across the room, watching me. His eyes travel from the top of my head to my sneaker-covered feet.</p><p>\u201cI am, but it changes nothing,\u201d I hiss, leaning forward.</p><p>He storms towards me and I retreat until my back hits the wall. Before I can register the move, his mouth is on mine, his hand twists in the hair at the back of my head, and I gasp. He takes the opportunity to lick into my mouth. I try to fight him; I try to pull my mouth away, but his grip on my hair tightens. When he bites my tongue, I lose it.</p><p>I kiss him back, and all the anger I feel towards him goes into that kiss. I bite his lips, bottom then top, and claw my nails through his hair. He growls down my throat, his big body pressing me harder into the wall. We each fight for dominance, but he wins, pinning me in place, his body overtaking mine.</p><p>When he pulls his mouth from mine we\u2019re breathing heavily, both still holding each other close. I can feel every hard inch of him pressed to every soft inch of me. He places his forehead to mine and it takes a few seconds to come back to myself. My eyes open, meeting his.</p> <p>\u201cThis changes nothing,\u201d I tell him quietly, my lips still tingling from his kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He takes a breath, his lips moving closer to mine. \u201cYou f**king changed everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack up.\u201d I push against his chest only to have him press harder into me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to push me away. You don\u2019t get to lie to me, even if it\u2019s by omission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lied to you,\u201d I mumble, looking away from him.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Vander\u2019s Belt\u2019\u2014that\u2019s not a f**king lie?\u201d His hand comes up to my cheek, forcing my eyes back to him.</p> <p>Okay, so I might have fibbed, but it wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass**le,\u201d I tell him, still pushing against his chest.</p><p>\u201cCall me what you want, but I know you feel this thing between us too. Don\u2019t f**king lie to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I feel towards you is anger,\u201d I growl.</p><p>Then his mouth comes back down on mine, stealing my breath. This kiss is more punishing than the previous one; and I whimper when he pulls away. My hands, which were trying to push him away, are now wrapped into his T-shirt.</p><p>His mouth goes to my ear. \u201cIf I stuck my hand between your legs, your pu**y would be wet and wanting.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes closed, trying to get rid of that image. My eyes fly open when his hand cups me over the thin material of my scrubs.</p><p>\u201cSo hot.\u201d His fingers press harder, and I stand on my tiptoes, trying to get away from what he\u2019s making me feel.</p><p>Part of me wants to jump up, wrap my legs around his hips, and grind myself into him. The other part of me wants to kick him in the nuts and scream in his face for having the power he has.</p> <p>Kenton</p><p>I look down into her big, blue eyes and groan. Fuck me. She is the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever looked at. She\u2019s perfect, and I don\u2019t just mean on the outside; I mean on the inside too. She\u2019s sweet in a way that is hard to believe, especially coming from her lifestyle.</p><p>I tried to keep my distance after I picked her up at the airport and got reminded of what she did for a living, but when she was around, I couldn\u2019t help but want to soak up a little bit of her time. She\u2019s not what I expected. She\u2019s not what I wanted, but f**k me if she\u2019s not what I need.</p><p>From the moment I saw her, I wanted her. I walked into the airport knowing that she wasn\u2019t expecting me. I\u2019d messaged Link earlier in the day telling him to let her know I wouldn\u2019t be picking her up. I\u2019d had a lead on a case and thought I wouldn\u2019t make it in time, and I didn\u2019t want her waiting for me.</p><p>When I spotted her long, red hair in the crowd, I watched her run for one of her bags. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when she fell forward and landed on the belt before being dragged with it. She didn\u2019t give up though. She pulled it off the conveyor belt over her head, falling backwards with the weight of it. She was cute.</p><p>When we got into the car and I sat down next to her, the doors closed and her smell suffocated me. Her long-ass legs in her shorts made it hard to concentrate on the road, and then I asked her about how she knew Link. I may get around, but I didn\u2019t like the idea of her being with someone who was a friend for some reason, and then she reminded me that she worked at a strip club, throwing all ideas of getting to know her out the window.</p><p>I look over her face again and shake my head. I have f**ked up with her in ways that even thinking about them makes me sick. I don\u2019t have an issue with strippers in general, but I know what happens at strip clubs. I do understand that not all women are the same and there are dancers who work in clubs to make money and nothing more, but I also know that there are some who go home with men at the end of the night or are willing to go a little further in order to make a little extra cash.</p><p>\u201cStep back,\u201d she says, and I shake my head, pressing deeper into her.</p><p>She smells like flowers or something sweet. I have wanted to be this close to her for a long time. Now that I\u2019ve got her where I want her, I\u2019m not backing off.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she asks softly, squeezing her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI want you. I want to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathes, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I press her harder into the wall.</p><p>\u201cThe things I know about you, I don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s just being honest, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it makes my chest ache any less. I don\u2019t know her well, but the parts of her she has let me see have been sweet, feisty, and so f**king cute that I have had to stop myself from kissing her when she laughs or does something that makes me smile.</p><p>The look in her eyes when she walked into my office when I was talking to Nico on the phone still haunts me. I know that my cousin was trying to make me see that I was interested in her, but I didn\u2019t need his help with that. I knew I wanted her; I just didn\u2019t know how I could deal with my jealousy. The thought of men looking at her or touching her makes me feel homicidal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she spoke, her words tore me open.

Then I went to Nico\u2019s house and saw him with Sophie and how close they had gotten. The way she looked at him like he had the power to turn on the sun had me feeling jealous. I wanted that for myself.</p><p>Nico was right in telling me to get my head out of my ass. He told me that if I wanted something, I had to take it; I couldn\u2019t ever let anyone or anything hold me back. I want Autumn more than I\u2019ve wanted anything before. I wanted her even before I knew she was a nurse. I would be proud to take her home to meet my family. My parents and sister would love her.</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You\u2019ve already said so many cruel things to me. I can\u2019t willingly open myself up for more of that from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know the night I made you dinner, when you told me it was the first time you had been happy in a long time? You weren\u2019t the only one who felt that,\u201d I gently confess to her.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk. Isn\u2019t everyone happy when they\u2019re drunk?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and her eyes meet mine. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. You\u2019re lying to yourself. I\u2019m a stripper, remember? I may not be one now, but I was. I can\u2019t change that.\u201d She shakes her head, causing her hair to slide against my skin.</p><p>How many nights have I lay in bed thinking about her hair spread out around her while she sleeps or hanging over me as she rides me to completion?</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said what I said. I should\u2019ve been man enough to admit what I was feeling for you. I said some f**ked-up shit in order to cover up how I really felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, confusion lacing her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it slow. I just need you to stop avoiding me. I need to be able to talk to you, to see your face,\u201d I practically beg, pushing her hair out of her face.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d she suggests with a tilt of her head.</p><p>\u201cMore than friends, baby, but we can start out as friends.\u201d I lift her chin to look into her eyes.</p><p>Autumn</p> <p>Our eyes meet and I shake my head. Friends? Can I be friends with him? Probably...and it would probably be the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done.</p><p>His hand runs along the underside of my jaw, his thumb touching my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeat, closing my eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking him or myself, but I just don\u2019t know why I feel this pull towards him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d he asks, leaning into me.</p><p>Heartbreak is the first thing that comes to mind.</p><p>\u201cAutumn?\u201d</p><p>I jump at the sound of Derik\u2019s voice and lean around Kenton\u2019s wide frame so I can see the door. My eyes meet Derik\u2019s, and then his go to Kenton before settling back on me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I gotta go and can\u2019t leave Tara on the floor alone,\u201d Derik says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming right now,\u201d I tell him, trying to duck away from Kenton, whose hold on my hip tightens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Saturday night,\u201d Derik says, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Saturday night?\u201d Kenton asks, and I feel his fingers dig into my skin.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out,\u201d I tell him, trying to step away again.</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d The word \u2018date\u2019 spits out of his mouth like it tastes bad.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a club or something.\u201d I shrug, attempting to move again.</p><p>\u201cWhat club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work. I don\u2019t have time to play Twenty Questions with you right now,\u201d I state, finally wiggling out of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have dinner with me on Sunday,\u201d he says rather than asks.</p><p>\u201cI have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d he growls, his jaw grinding.</p><p>\u201cViv,\u201d I tell him exasperatedly.</p><p>\u201cViv?\u201d He raises an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, Viv. Now I really need to go.\u201d I put my hand on the doorknob to open it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019re done talking,\u201d he says close to my ear, startling me.</p><p>I look over my shoulder and our eyes meet. I nervously lick my bottom lip and his eyes drop to my mouth. He leans in, and I\u2019m frozen in place. His mouth softly brushes mine and he leans back, looking at me again.</p><p>\u201cSee you at home, baby,\u201d he whispers, making it sound almost like a threat. He smiles, showing off the small dimple that fascinates me.</p><p>I inhale a deep breath and nod. My insides are going crazy, my heart beating double-time.</p><p>I walk down the hall towards the nurses\u2019 station, trying to ignore the fact I can hear his boots behind me. I spot Tara, and her eyes go big when she looks over my shoulder. When they come back to me, she smiles an odd smile and I shake my head in a slight move, letting her know to hush.</p><p>As soon as I make it to the desk, a bell goes off and I practically yell that I\u2019ll go check on the patient. Tara doesn\u2019t say anything. She just nods, and I make my way quickly down the hall to the patient\u2019s room. I take my time in the room, making sure everything\u2019s taken care of before going back to the nurses\u2019 station. I walk around the corner and see that the area\u2019s empty except for Tara. I let out a breath I didn\u2019t realize I was holding.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome, and where the hell did he take you?\u201d Tara asks as soon as I take a seat. I try to think of a way I can avoid answering that question before looking at her. \u201cPlease tell me you are sleeping with him regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I cover my face with my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh no... Please tell me he isn\u2019t one of those guys who look all hot and yummy, but then you get to the package and get a surprise...and it\u2019s not a good one.\u201d She sits back in her chair, shaking her head in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy who\u2019s been letting me stay with him,\u201d I tell her, hoping she\u2019ll drop it.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not together?\u201d Her eyebrows come together in confusion. \u201cI would\u2019ve sworn he was your man with the show he put on earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I shake my head frantically.</p><p>\u201cSooo...you live together, but you\u2019re not together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell can you live with someone who looks like that and not jump their bones?\u201d she asks, dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ass. Trust me\u2014it\u2019s not as hard as you think it is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d She nods in understanding, her eyes searching my face. \u201cYou know he wants you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell yeah, he does. You should have seen the way he was looking at you and then the way he was watching your ass when you guys were walking down the hall. He wants you, girl, and he doesn\u2019t look like he is the kind of guy you can put off for very long. Not only that, but why in the world would you want to put him off in the first place? If I were you, I would be waiting for him naked on my hands and knees when he got home and walked through the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about this?\u201d I ask pleadingly. The images that are now in my head of Kenton and me have started a small throbbing in my core.</p> <p>\u201cAre we still going out Saturday?\u201d she asks, reading my face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I respond immediately.</p><p>\u201cGood. I need to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say softly before getting back to work. The rest of the night I spend quietly trying to think of a way to avoid going home.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you have to try this,\u201d Tara says, shoving a drink in my face.</p> <p>We got to the club about ten minutes ago, and after making it inside, we fought our way to the bar for a drink and to wait for Derik and his boyfriend to show up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask, leaning away from her before taking the drink from her hand.</p><p>\u201cAn All-American Root Beer. It\u2019s so good. You can\u2019t even taste the Jack,\u201d she promises.</p><p>I put the straw to my lips before taking a small sip. She\u2019s right; it\u2019s sweet and I can\u2019t taste any kind of alcohol. \u201cIt\u2019s really good!\u201d I shout close to her ear.</p><p>She takes the drink back from me, lifting it up to the bartender while holding up two fingers. He nods in understanding as Tara sits back down next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo, how have you and Mr. Hot Guy been?\u201d</p> <p>I bite my lip and think about that question. How are Kenton and me? Well, I\u2019m still trying to avoid him, and he seems more determined than before to not let me avoid him. Before, he would leave me notes or texts, but now, I have to deal with him face to face.</p><p>Like last night. I went downstairs to get something to eat, and when I walked into the kitchen, he was there. I couldn\u2019t exactly leave without making it obvious that I was dodging him, so I went about making myself a sandwich. The only problem was that, every time I turned around, his body would rub against me or his mouth would come close to my ear when he spoke. No matter what I did, he was there in my space. By the time I left the kitchen, I was a huge mess and had to take another shower. I still can\u2019t figure out why he affects me the way he does.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Autumn.\u201d Tara snaps her fingers in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize, shaking the thoughts away.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to answer me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine?\u201d She raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly,\u201d I tell her with a shrug as the bartender puts two drinks in front of us. I slide my money across the bar before Tara has a chance to pay for them.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he looked pissed tonight when I picked you up.\u201d</p><p>I take a drink and smile around my straw. He was pissed. I had spent most of the day in bed. Then I\u2019d gone down to the kitchen around five and made a frozen pizza. Kenton wasn\u2019t around, so I went back upstairs after eating. I read for a while then sent an e-mail to Sid, who I couldn\u2019t bring myself to call. Around eight, I started getting ready to go out, knowing that Tara would be there to pick me up at nine thirty.</p><p>When I walked out of my room a little after nine, Kenton was at the top of the stairs, his foot on the top landing. His head turned, our eyes locked, and my body started to vibrate from the look in his eyes. I wouldn\u2019t even call it hunger; it was more than that. His eyes took me in and his jaw started ticking.</p><p>I knew what he saw; I had on a black, strapless dress that formed to my body like a second skin. Black pumps wrapped around my ankles, lifting me up on four-inch spiked heels. My hair was up on top of my head with little pieces out framing my face. I had on minimal makeup but dark-red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cH\u2014\u201d I started to greet him when he looked up at me again, but he opened the door to his room and slammed it closed behind him. I stood there for a second, and then I flipped off his closed door and made my way downstairs. When Tara arrived at the house ten minutes later, Kenton came barreling downstairs like a caveman.</p><p>Before I could get out the door and close it behind me, he pulled me inside by my hand, shut the door, and then kissed me. It was not a sweet kiss; it was rough, aggressive, and it left me panting. When his mouth left mine, his eyes were heated and still glued to my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t come off,\u201d he mumbled. I had no clue what he was talking about as his thumb swiped my bottom lip. \u201cFuck!\u201d His eyes came to mine, and I was frozen in place; all I could do was stare at him. \u201cWhy won\u2019t your goddamn lipstick come off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s smudge-proof,\u201d I whispered, shaking my head out of my daze. I took a step back, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair, those heels, and that mouth.\u201d He shook his head then ran a hand though his already messy hair. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I opened the door. \u201cToo f**king bad,\u201d I snapped over my shoulder as I went down the porch steps. I opened the door to Tara\u2019s car, getting in quickly and slamming it closed only to look up as he roared loud as f**k as I put on my seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you do to piss him off?\u201d Tara asks, bringing me out of my thoughts once again.</p><p>\u201cI have no clue. That man is confusing. One minute, he\u2019s kissing me, and the next, he\u2019s complaining about my lipstick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your lipstick?\u201d Derik asks, joining us at the bar.</p><p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d I repeat, giving him and Stan a hug.</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause you look hot and your lipstick is hotter,\u201d Stan says, leaning across the bar to call the bartender over. I give him a small smile before going back to my drink.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Mr. Rough and Rugged?\u201d Derik asks, taking the beer Stan is handing him.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the guy from the emergency room,\u201d he clarifies.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who doesn\u2019t like her lipstick,\u201d Tara adds out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Stan says with a knowing smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my lipstick?\u201d I run my fingers over my lips, wishing now that I hadn\u2019t worn it.</p><p>\u201cGirl, you are not stupid. I don\u2019t have a penis, but even I know that, when a man sees a woman who looks like you wearing red lipstick that makes her lips look even fuller, all he can think about is shoving something between them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that.\u201d I frown at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, girly,\u201d Derik says.</p> <p>Images of some of the women I have seen in Vegas, the ones who sell themselves, flash through my head, all of them with their bright-red lips and bedroom eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom.\u201d I stand and don\u2019t even wait for Tara when she calls for me. I run into the bathroom and franticly wipe at my lips, trying to get the color off.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, stop it. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Tears spring to my eyes and I bite the inside of my cheek, trying to fight them off. I wipe my mouth again and again, but the color won\u2019t come off no matter what I do. Stupid smudge-proof lipstick!</p><p>\u201cAutumn, please stop,\u201d Tara says more quietly this time, her hands going to mine at my lips.</p> <p>\u201cI just want it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know men will think the same thing whether you\u2019re wearing lipstick or not. Some guys are ass**les. You\u2019re beautiful and sweet. Please don\u2019t let something as stupid as lipstick f**k with our night out.\u201d</p><p>I take a second and let her words sink in, and I let out a long breath. \u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her, pulling the tissue away from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, and that\u2019s what friends do.\u201d</p><p>It feels good to be friends with a woman, someone who knows what I\u2019m going though, someone I can talk to about the stupid things like I\u2019ve seen women on TV talk to each other about.</p><p>\u201cNow, are you ready to finish our drinks?\u201d she asks, making me smile.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say immediately. I look in the mirror, quickly making sure I look okay before following her out of the bathroom.</p><p>When we reach the bar, Derik and Stan have disappeared.</p><p>\u201cDo you see them anywhere?\u201d Tara asks, stretching to try to see over the crowd on the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I look around, but there are so many people here that I can\u2019t even move without bumping into someone. \u201cOh wait, I think I see them.\u201d I grab Tara\u2019s hand and start to lead her through the crowd to where I think I spotted Stan and Derik.</p><p>I look back over my shoulder when she stops dead in her tracks, causing me to teeter in my heels. I start to ask her what\u2019s wrong, when she yells at the top of her lungs, \u201cI love this f**king song!\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing at her. The song is \u2018Sexy and I Know It,\u2019 and as much as people like the song, I really doubt anyone actually loves it.</p><p>When she starts dancing, I can\u2019t hold it in and start to laugh. Her long, blond hair is flying all over. Her face is a mask of concentration and her hands almost look like she\u2019s doing the hand jive.</p><p>\u201cDance with me!\u201d She throws her hands in the air and spins around, closing her eyes.</p><p>I look around, seeing that everyone around me is dancing; no one is even watching what Tara\u2019s doing. I start to move my hips a little, but apparently that\u2019s not enough for Tara, who grabs both of my hands and starts spinning me around with her.</p> <p>\u201cTara, stop!\u201d I yell as we fly around in circles. My feet are barely keeping me upright.</p><p>\u201cStop being a party pooper and dance, bitch!\u201d she yells back at me. Without warning, she lets my hands go and starts wiggling all over the place.</p><p>I laugh but join her wiggling, and then I bump my hip with hers when the song changes to Ke$ha\u2019s \u2018Your Love is My Drug.\u2019 We start jumping around, throwing our hands in the air, and spinning in circles.</p><p>I\u2019m laughing so hard and having so much fun that I don\u2019t even realize that I\u2019m in the middle of a giant crowd of people and they\u2019ve all stopped to watch us. When the song ends, we both stop immediately and look around.</p><p>\u201cRock on!\u201d Tara yells, making me lower my head and whisper a quiet, \u201cOh my God,\u201d to myself. \u201cYou only live once. Fuck it,\u201d Tara says, shrugging before grabbing my hand and pulling me with her to the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s Derik.\u201d I point to the other side of the bar, where Derik and Stan are sitting, both of them with large smiles on their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou two looked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy, I know,\u201d I cut him off, taking the bottle of water from his hand and drinking it in large gulps.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say hot, girl,\u201d Derik corrects with a laugh. \u201cHappiness is a good look on you, kid,\u201d he tells me, pulling me into his side.</p><p>I take a breath, realizing that I am happy\u2014really fricking happy.</p><p>\u201cYou want another drink?\u201d Tara asks, calling the bartender over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look around at all the people who are having a good time and then out on the dance floor at all the people still dancing and laughing. Screw it. I want to live a little. \u201cWhat are we drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tequila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had it.\u201d I shrug, watching as the bartender makes his way towards us.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Tara asks, looking at me with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you have to have a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not an adult until you\u2019ve had tequila,\u201d she tells me, her voice all serious.</p><p>\u201cIs this a rule?\u201d I ask with a smile as she gives the bartender our order.</p><p>\u201cOne of many.\u201d She looks at me and smiles. \u201cBody shots are another, but we\u2019ll get to that another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never doing body shots.\u201d I roll my eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cA couple shots of tequila and you will do a whole lot you never thought you would.\u201d She hands me a little glass of clear liquid and a wedge of lime. \u201cLick your hand,\u201d she instructs. I do, and she picks up a saltshaker, dumping some onto my hand. \u201cLick it, shoot it, suck it.\u201d She nods, and I shake my head but follow her directions.</p><p>The salt is grainy on my tongue as I close my eyes and shoot back the tequila. The cool liquid burns down my throat, making me gasp for air. My hand is suddenly shoved towards my face and I cram the whole piece of lime in my mouth, pressing it up against the roof of my mouth, and then I chew on it to try to get rid of some of the heat.</p><p>I open my eyes when I hear laughing, and I pull the lime out of my mouth and look around. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to eat the whole lime.\u201d Tara laughs and Stan shakes his head, smiling. \u201cWatch me, and then you\u2019re going to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I watch as she does exactly what I did, but in the end, she just puts the fleshy part of the lime into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cVoila,\u201d she says, taking a bow. \u201cNow, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but this is the last one,\u201d I tell her, taking the salt from her hand while she gets the tequila from the bartender.

What the hell happened last night?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask, not sure I want to know, seeing how I\u2019m wearing nothing but a sheet, his body is naked at least from the waist up, and his arm is draped across my stomach, his frame plastered to the length of mine.</p> <p>\u201cSleep.\u201d He squeezes my waist and my stomach slightly contracts.</p><p>I try to remember last night, but my brain is coming up with nothing. My whole night is blank after my second shot of tequila.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking and sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get up,\u201d I tell him, trying to lift his giant arm. My body feels so weak that I stop trying after a couple of seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou were up all night. You just went to bed two hours ago. You need to sleep. I need to sleep, so stop moving around.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen when I realize that his very evident erection is pressed up against my leg. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anything,\u201d I tell him, covering my face.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing how you drank a shit-ton of tequila last night, that\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he mumbles sleepily.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that word.\u201d I shake my head. Just the thought of that drink alone has my body ready to revolt. \u201cHow did I get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you every embarrassing detail from the time you texted me until now when we wake up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I texted you?\u201d I groan.</p><p>\u201cYou did. Now, go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing left if your stomach,\u201d he says on a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were sick all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis just keeps getting better and better,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cSleep, babe,\u201d he says quietly as I feel his lips against the bare skin of my shoulder; the touch has my pulse picking up.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I naked?\u201d I ask, concentrating on the feeling between my legs. I sigh in relief when I don\u2019t feel any tenderness or anything that would lead me to believe I did anything stupider than drink too much and send drunken texts.</p><p>\u201cYou were sick and I put you in the shower last night. I tried to give you a shirt, but you wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, squeezing my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t see anything. Much,\u201d he says quietly, and I can hear a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, sounding surprised. \u201cYou had a good time. You just don\u2019t know your limit. I will be having a talk with Tara. No way should she have given you shots of tequila on your first night out drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not talking with Tara.\u201d I shake my head, imagining him talking to her. I can see it now\u2014it would be a lot of yelling and none of it nice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. Right now, we\u2019re going to sleep, and then later, we\u2019re going to my Aunt Viv\u2019s house for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYep, my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell does this stuff happen to me?\u201d I question as my stomach gurgles loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. You had some Tums a little while ago.\u201d He squeezes my side, and I\u2019m pretty sure my life is like a really bad Lifetime movie.</p><p>\u201cYou can go to your room,\u201d I tell him after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I whine.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d He squeezes me again. \u201cClose your eyes and go to sleep or I will give you something that will put you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cCan you at least move your arm so I can move?\u201d I pull the sheet up higher on my chest, lifting my head slightly to see if I can spot a shirt anywhere near me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a pain in my ass.\u201d He flings his arm behind him and pulls a piece of fabric from behind his back.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have this?\u201d I ask when I see that it\u2019s a shirt.</p><p>\u201cI just told you. I tried to put it on you last night, but you refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whisper, slipping the shirt on over my head and then shimmying it down under the sheet.</p><p>\u201cNow, lay your ass down and go to sleep.\u201d He tugs me back onto the bed, not giving me a choice.</p><p>I turn my back to him and try to scoot away, but it feels like it takes all of my energy to move an inch. I close my eyes as he pulls me into him. My ass curves into his hips, his arm wraps around my waist, and his bicep slides under my head like a pillow. I try not to think about how it makes me feel to be so close to him. I try to tell myself that I don\u2019t feel incredibly safe and comfortable. Before I can convince myself that I hate how I feel, I fall asleep.</p><p>I wake up slowly and take notice that I don\u2019t feel the warmth of Kenton behind me, and I open my eyes, wondering if I dreamt the whole thing. I lift my head slightly and look at the clock. \u201cShit,\u201d I whisper, seeing that it\u2019s eleven already. I take a deep breath and smell Kenton\u2019s cologne. I lift some of my hair to my nose. The smell is so strong that my stomach flips over.</p><p>I take my time sitting up on the side of the bed, and I see that a glass full of water, two Tylenols, and a few Tums have been set on the nightstand. I don\u2019t want to think that it\u2019s sweet that he thought about how I would feel when I woke up and made sure to leave them where I would find them before I got out of bed, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it as I take the pills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I get out of bed and look down at myself, noticing that I\u2019m not wearing one of my shirts, but a shirt I\u2019m sure belongs to him. I walk to the dresser and get a pair of panties and a bra before going to the closet and grabbing a pair of shorts, a tank top, and an oversized sweater. I open my bedroom door, looking both ways before running across the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>Once inside, I quietly shut the door and turn to look in the mirror. I cover my mouth with my hand when I see myself. My hair is sticking out all over my head. My eye makeup is smeared around my eyes and down my cheeks, and my freckles stand out due to how pale I look.</p><p>\u201cKill me now,\u201d I whisper to my refection as I grab a couple of makeup remover cloths from the drawer and wipe my face. When I\u2019m done, I start the shower and step inside. I look down when I feel something soggy under my feet. My dress from last night is on the shower floor, sopping wet, so I pick it up and ring it out before tossing it over the shower rail.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened last night, and I can\u2019t help but be thankful I don\u2019t remember anything. I can only imagine the kind of fool I made out of myself while drunk. I get out of the shower and quickly get dressed before french braiding my hair and putting on some mascara, blush, and lip gloss.</p> <p>As I\u2019m picking up my clothes from the floor, my eye catches my cell phone sitting on the back of the toilet. I pick it up, looking at the black screen, afraid to click it on. I say a silent prayer that I didn\u2019t actually text Kenton last night and that he was just joking when he told me what I\u2019d done. I press the round button before sliding my finger across the screen.</p><p>The picture that is now my background has me almost dropping the phone into the toilet. I\u2019m lying across the bar at the club we were at with my dress up around my waist. A guy has his back to the camera and his upper body is bent over me, his face near my stomach.</p><p>\u201cPlease, no,\u201d I whisper, and my shaky fingers press the icon for my text messages. As soon as the screen changes, texts between Kenton and me pop up. \u201cNo, no, no...\u201d I chant, reading the messages.</p><p>Me: Why do you hav to so hot?</p><p>Kenton: Where are you?</p> <p>Me: da clubs lol</p><p>Kenton: What club?</p><p>Me: I wants to kis you all ovr</p><p>Kenton: Dammit, tell me where you are.</p><p>Me: I asj Tara shesnice.</p><p>Kenton: I\u2019m on my way.</p> <p>Me: howz that</p><p>Me: Yoi kisz god</p><p>Kenton: Go to the bar and ask for water.</p><p>Me: Tequeda is like watber</p><p>Kenton: Baby, I need you to find somewhere to sit down until I get there.</p><p>Me: Sitty with a nicews guy</p><p>Kenton: Where\u2019s Tara?</p><p>Me: herre</p> <p>Kenton: Parking now.</p><p>I close my eyes and bite the inside of my cheek hard, trying not to cry from embarrassment. I\u2019m never drinking again.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Not My Ass!</p><p>After I read the text messages in the bathroom, I try to sneak back into my bedroom, planning to hide out until it\u2019s time to go to Viv\u2019s house for dinner. Unfortunately, as soon as I make it back into my room, Kenton knocks on the door.</p><p>I think about not answering, but I don\u2019t want to be mean after he so obviously took care of me the night before. As soon as I tell him to come in, he pushes the door open, carrying a cup of coffee in one hand and a bagel in the other. I don\u2019t know how to react to him being sweet. Since the day I met him, things have been a roller coaster, and I\u2019m not someone who likes amusement parks.</p><p>\u201cI want you to try to eat something,\u201d he says, walking around the bed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, and thank you for taking care of me last night,\u201d I tell him, taking the coffee from his hand as he sets the bagel down on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Thanks for the Tylenol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>The small smile he gives me has my eyes dropping to his mouth. I take in his face, the scruff along his jaw, and the way his hair hangs, touching the collar of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou need to shave,\u201d I blurt and look away, but my eyes go back to him when his laugh hits my ears.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d he asks, rubbing his hand along his jaw. I want to lean forward and touch his face to see what it feels like against my skin. \u201cYou might like it,\u201d he mumbles, his eyes dropping to my thighs.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s thinking what I am, but the thought of the rough scruff on his jaw running along the inside of my thighs has my hands shaking.</p><p>\u201cEat. We\u2019ll head out in a couple of hours. I got some stuff to take care of before then, but come find me in the office,\u201d he says, his voice sounding deeper than before.</p><p>I nod, not able to say anything. I have a feeling that any words that might come out of my mouth right now would be incoherent anyways.</p><p>He looks at me again then stands, shaking his head. I watch him as he walks to the bedroom door, stops at the threshold to look at me over his shoulder before tapping the doorjamb twice, and then leaves the room. I let out a long breath, wondering what the hell I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m drawn to him. He scares the shit out of me. I\u2019m never like this and don\u2019t know what to do with the jumbled mess my emotions are in.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kenton asks, and I look from the house in front of us over to him and nod before I start to open the door to his car. \u201cWait here while I come around,\u201d he says, unfolding his large body from behind the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>I watch him walk around to the passenger\u2019s side of the car. Watching him move is fascinating to me. He reminds me of a lion or a bear, his movements fluid, even with his large mass.</p><p>He opens my door and I get out, running my sweaty palms down the front of my shorts as I stand. As soon as I clear the door of the car, his hand goes to the small of my back and he leads me up the front porch. He doesn\u2019t even knock or ring the bell; he just opens the screen door and walks us into the house.</p><p>My feet stop inside the front door. I didn\u2019t tell Viv that Kenton was going to be bringing me, and I don\u2019t want her to think that I\u2019m rude, even if they are family.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, his eyebrows coming together.</p><p>\u201cI feel bad. I should have called and told Viv what was going on. I don\u2019t like springing this on her,\u201d I tell him, fidgeting with the ends of my sweater.</p><p>\u201cI called her this morning and told her I was coming,\u201d he assures me.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good. Come on.\u201d He grabs my hand, pulling me along with him.</p><p>When we clear the front hall, we walk into the large living room, where more than a dozen people turn to look at us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I whisper and then glare at Kenton when he starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, you\u2019re here! And look! You brought the ass,\u201d Viv says, walking towards us.</p><p>I feel my eyes go wide at the word \u2018ass\u2019 and start shaking my head at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, trust me. I know this one\u2019s an ass.\u201d She pats Kenton\u2019s cheek, smiling up at him.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Aunt Viv.\u201d He laughs, kissing her cheek.</p><p>When she comes to me, her hands go to my face, her eyes look me over, and she smiles, shaking her head. I have the urge to bite my lip. I know what she\u2019s thinking, and she is oh-so wrong.</p><p>\u201cIs Mom here?\u201d Kenton asks her, and I look over at him, feeling suddenly like I might be sick.</p><p>\u201cYep. She\u2019s outside with your uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my mom, baby. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he tells me and starts to move away.</p> <p>\u201cNo! I mean...don\u2019t do that. I...um, I need to go back to the house,\u201d I say quickly, trying to plan my escape. \u201cYou guys have a nice dinner and I\u2019ll just reschedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nonsense,\u201d Viv says, waving her hand around.</p><p>No way do I want to meet Kenton\u2019s mom, and there is nothing anyone can say that will convince me differently, I think, feeling the panic rise.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d a woman says, walking into the room.</p><p>I take her in. Her dark hair is shorter than Kenton\u2019s. She\u2019s petite; I would guess close to five one. She\u2019s wearing a long, flowing dress and a blue jean vest with a wide belt wrapped around her waist. My eyes close and my head falls forward. Now I have no way to get out of this without looking like an ass.</p><p>\u201cI thought Aunt Viv filled you in on what was goin\u2019 on,\u201d Kenton says as he picks the woman up off the floor, giving her a hug.</p> <p>\u201cShe did. Well, kinda. She said you were bringing someone to dinner, and I told her if it was Cassie, I was not going to be happy,\u201d she says, and Kenton chuckles as he sets her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come with him,\u201d I blurt like an idiot, causing the woman\u2019s eyes to come to me. \u201cI mean...we drove together, but we didn\u2019t come together.\u201d I lower my head and shake it back and forth. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re not together. Viv asked me to dinner a few weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been coming every Sunday since.\u201d Shut up! Shut up, you idiot, I tell myself. Sadly, I don\u2019t even listen to my own warnings. \u201cKenton and I just live together. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Viv gives my arm a squeeze and Kenton\u2019s mom looks like her eyes are going to pop out of her head. When I look at Kenton, his eyes are soft as he smiles and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cMom, this is Autumn. Autumn, this is my mom, Nancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I tell her, sticking out my hand. Nope, this isn\u2019t awkward at all.</p><p>\u201cYou too, honey.\u201d She pulls me in for a hug then looks over at Viv and smiles. Viv smiles back, and I can see the wheels in her head are turning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna grab a beer and go outside with Uncle Maz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, honey. Go on,\u201d Kenton\u2019s mom says.</p> <p>I want to grab him and have him take me with him. His eyes come to me and light up, and something about the look has me taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside, baby,\u201d he conveys sweetly, taking a step towards me, and before I can step back again or duck, his hand slides around my waist and his mouth lands on mine in a kiss that forces all the oxygen out of my lungs. When his mouth leaves mine, my fingers go to my lips. \u201cOkay, ladies. Take care of my girl,\u201d he says, pulling his eyes from me. His hands give my waist a slight squeeze, and then he turns around and walks towards the kitchen before I can ask him what the hell that was.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s a small world, huh?\u201d Viv snarks, looking over at Nancy then back at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your ass was my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my ass. I mean...sorry. Your son\u2019s not an ass or anything like that,\u201d I say, looking at Nancy, feeling my pulse race, and wishing I could teleport out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I know my son, and I know he can be a little rough around the edges, so please don\u2019t feel bad for calling him an ass.\u201d She smiles with a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cSo, how long have you been seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, we\u2019re not.\u201d I shake my head frantically, looking between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She tilts her head to the side, studying me.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not together,\u201d I insist and then glance at Viv, who is wearing a very large smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s interesting, Nancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Nancy says with a smile.</p><p>I look at the two women and can tell that they are both up to something. Between them and Kenton, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>\u201cSo, Viv said you used to be a dancer. Is that right?\u201d Nancy asks while we\u2019re sitting at the dinner table a short time later.</p><p>I start to choke on my sip of tea. Kenton pats my back, and I wipe my eyes with my napkin, trying to figure a way out of this.</p><p>\u201cShe was, and in Vegas no less,\u201d Viv confirms. \u201cMaybe we could have her teach us some moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I breathe into my napkin, feeling my face heat up.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to be embarrassed about, child. Hell, if I looked like you, I would never wear clothes,\u201d Nancy says, and I hear a few chuckles.</p><p>\u201cThis is not really happening,\u201d I chant to myself, looking over at Kenton, whose whole body is shaking with the force of his silent laugher. \u201cThis is not funny,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn funny.\u201d He pulls me to him by the back of my neck, putting his lips to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I tell him quietly, pushing at his chest, not wanting to cause a scene in front of his family.</p><p>He smiles again and shakes his head. I pull away and look around the table at everyone watching us. My eyes land on Kenton\u2019s dad\u2019s. When his go soft and he smiles, my anxiety eases somewhat.</p><p>I found out earlier that not only is Viv sweet, but Kenton\u2019s mom is really funny and his dad is like a giant teddy bear who often shakes his head when his wife says something a little crazy, pulls his daughter Toni into his side to kiss her hair when she\u2019s close, and pats his son on the back when he approves of something he says. I smile back at him before lowering my eyes to my plate.</p><p>The rest of dinner is a blur, and before I know it, I\u2019m saying goodbye to everyone and getting into Kenton\u2019s car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d Kenton asks.</p><p>I roll my head in his direction and glare. \u201cDid I have a good time?

I roll my eyes, laying my head back against the head rest.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt loves you, and my mom already adores you,\u201d he says softly as I feel his hand on the bare skin of my thigh.</p><p>I pick up his hand, putting it back on his side of the console as he pulls out of the driveway. \u201cYour whole family is very sweet,\u201d I tell him, watching as the corner of his mouth lifts up.</p><p>\u201cI thought for sure we were making progress,\u201d he says, taking his eyes off the road to look at me with his lips twitching.</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d I turn my head away from him, watching out the car window as the scenery quickly flies by.</p><p>\u201cYou work tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I answer shortly.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta be there by eleven.\u201d I roll my head on the headrest in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna take a nap?\u201d he asks, his long fingers tapping on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI haven\u2019t really been able to get used to this schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get on a different shift?\u201d He sounds concerned.</p><p>\u201cIf a spot opens up, I can ask to transfer,\u201d I say, shifting against the leather of his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. The thing is...I really need to think about what I\u2019m going to do. I love Vegas and everything, but this is the first place I have felt at home. I love the people and the lifestyle here. I feel a lot more relaxed than I used to, and I think I might see if I can find an apartment and move here permanently.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I just said all that out loud. Up until now, it was just a thought rolling around in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou have a place to stay as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whisper, my heart squeezing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t move out for a while though,\u201d he says, and his jaw starts ticking. \u201cI talked to Link, and the cops are still tracking the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He told me,\u201d I say, feeling a chill slide down my spine.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing doesn\u2019t even feel real.\u201d I shake my head. Every time I think about what happened, I can\u2019t believe how lucky I was.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very real. Five people were murdered. Don\u2019t ever forget that,\u201d he growls, his knuckles turning white on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI will never forget it,\u201d I whisper softly, my hand moving to his jaw, wanting to comfort him, but right when I\u2019m about to touch him, I start to pull away, realizing what I\u2019m doing. Before I have a chance to move away completely, his hand catches mine, pulling my fingers up to his mouth, where he places a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting this,\u201d he says gently. He drops my hand to his thigh, where he covers it with his own. The harnessing warmth of his thigh under my palm has my breaths increasing. \u201cStop fighting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no us,\u201d I tell him, shaking my head, trying to pull my hand away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king stubborn.\u201d He tightens his hold on me.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an ass,\u201d I growl, and the car jerks to the right, onto the side of the road.</p><p>My body goes forward when he slams on the brakes. His hand goes to my seatbelt, and as soon as he presses the button, he pulls me over and onto his lap. One hand goes to my waist and the other to the back of my head and into my hair, forcing my head to the side.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I hiss, trying to wiggle free.</p><p>\u201cNo. Every time I knock one brick out of place, you put ten more in its place,\u201d he seethes.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to keep kissing you to prove there is something between us, then f**k it.\u201d His hand in my hair fists tighter as he pulls my head back, holding me immobile. \u201cI told you before not to f**king lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking him to kiss me or stop what he\u2019s doing, but the second the word leaves my mouth, his comes down on mine, possessing me with his kiss. I let go, completely drowning in him and his taste. My hands go to his long hair, gripping it between my fingers.</p><p>I whimper into his mouth as his other hand skims the underside of my breast. I\u2019ve never wanted anyone like I want him. He makes me feel again\u2014something I haven\u2019t done in a long time. Something about him makes me want to open up, but the part of me that clicked into place to protect myself when they took my son was so strong I didn\u2019t know if anyone would be able to get to the real me again.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I get my mouth on you, you melt,\u201d he says against my lips when he pulls his away from mine. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been hurt.\u201d I close my eyes, turning my face away from him. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear it, but I won\u2019t stop until I have you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. He turns my face back towards him, placing a soft kiss on my forehead then my lips before lifting me off him, setting me back in my seat, pulling my seatbelt around me, and buckling me in place. We drive in silence for a long time. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking, but all I can think about is what would happen if I gave him a chance. Then I wonder if Link told him what happened to me.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Link about me?\u201d I ask, looking over at him. I don\u2019t like the idea of him learning things about my history from someone else.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest with you, he offered to tell me about you.\u201d He looks over at me, his hand coming to my thigh and giving it a squeeze before his eyes go back to the road. \u201cI want you to be the one to tell me. I want you to trust me with whatever it is that has forced you to put up those barriers around yourself.\u201d</p><p>I let out a long breath, one I didn\u2019t know I was holding.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come to me, Autumn,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>Those words make my heart break a little. I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever be able to go to anyone ever again. I close my eyes and fight back the tears that\u2019ve started stinging my nose. When we get to the house, he says a quiet goodbye, telling me that he has some business to take care of. I nod, go into the house, and straight up to my room, where I crawl into bed, pulling the pillow over my head so I can cry.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Done, I\u2019ll Give Her Crazy</p><p>(Oops, did I do that?)</p><p>\u201cWe have a Life Flight coming in,\u201d Tara says, coming into the room where I\u2019ve been taking care of a patient. I automatically stop what I\u2019m doing and follow her. \u201cDerik has already started getting things ready. The victim is a young male suffering head trauma,\u201d she says as we hurry into the emergency room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as the helicopter lands on the roof, Tara and Derik are out of the room, meeting it, while I stay behind and make sure we have enough supplies and everything is in order. When they arrive at the room, my world feels like it closes in around me. A little boy no older than ten is strapped to the gurney. His neck is in a brace, his face is cut and swollen, and his head is bandaged, blood seeping through the white gauze they\u2019ve used to protect the wound. All I can see is my son. He would be about as old as the boy is. My brain tries to tell my body to move, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m glued to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, I need you to come over here and help me transfer him,\u201d I hear Derik say, but all I can do is stare.</p><p>\u201cAutumn!\u201d Tara shouts, and my eyes go to her as she shakes her head and then nods towards the young boy, asking me a silent question. I shake my head in response.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, I need you to pull it together. We need to help this little guy get better,\u201d Derik says gently.</p> <p>My eyes go to him and I swallow the bile in the back of my throat, turning my emotions off before I start to work on autopilot. For the next twenty minutes, we do everything we can to help save the boy before he is taken into emergency surgery.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d Tara asks, sitting down next to me on the bench outside of the emergency room.</p><p>I shake my head before looking over at her. \u201cI have a son.\u201d I close my eyes before opening them again. \u201cI had a son,\u201d I whisper, correcting myself bitterly. \u201cI put him up for adoption when he was just hours old.\u201d I look down at the floor, seeing small drops of blood on the tops of my shoes. \u201cHe would be about the age of that little boy. I\u2019m so sorry I freaked. I...\u201d I take a breath, closing my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never even thought about something like this happening.\u201d I feel an arm go around my back and Tara\u2019s head lean against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I nod as tears fill my eyes. I never once thought I would have to help a child. I\u2019m so stupid. \u201cAll I could think about when I saw that boy was my son lying there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney,\u201d she moans painfully, making me bite the inside of me cheek. Taking comfort from people is something new to me. Hell, having someone care enough about me to comfort me is something new to me.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to leave for the night,\u201d I tell her when I feel tears begin to fall from my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get someone to come in. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be a lot of help right now.\u201d I breathe through my tears.</p><p>\u201cRach needs hours. She\u2019ll come in. I\u2019ll give her a call now,\u201d Tara says softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, wiping my face. I never cry in front of people. I was never allowed to show emotion like that. One of my mother\u2019s favorite sayings was, \u201cIf you want to cry, I will give you something to cry about,\u201d and she often kept her word.</p><p>\u201cGo home and sleep, girl, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Tara assures me, rubbing my back.</p><p>I stand, giving her a quick hug before I make my way to the front desk. I grab my bag and head out to the parking lot. Once I have my car door unlocked, I toss my bag into the passenger\u2019s seat, get behind the wheel, and shut the door. I lean my head back and close my eyes.</p> <p>All I keep seeing over and over is the little boy, his face bruised and battered from the car accident he was in. I can\u2019t even imagine what his parents are feeling right now. I turn the car on, more tears filling my eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know how I make it back to Kenton\u2019s. Once I let myself into the house, I quickly set the alarm before heading upstairs. When I reach the top landing, Kenton\u2019s standing in his bedroom door. His shirt is off and the pajama pants he\u2019s wearing are barely hanging on his hips. I look at the hand he has resting against his thigh, seeing that he\u2019s holding a gun.</p><p>I look up at his face again. This time when our eyes meet, his are concerned. Something inside me snaps and I run to him, seeing surprise on his face right before I shove mine into his chest and my arms wrap around his waist as I sob loudly.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d he whispers, pulling me harder against him. I\u2019m grateful that he doesn\u2019t say anything else for a long time; he just stands there holding me in his arms, offering me comfort. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s lay down.\u201d He pulls me with him to the bed, sets me on the edge, and then lays his gun on the nightstand before going to the dresser. I watch as he pulls out a shirt before coming back to me.</p><p>I take the shirt from him as he turns around, giving me a little privacy to change. I pull off my scrub top quickly, tug his shirt on, and then kick off my shoes along with my pants. I scoot up the bed as he turns back around. He climbs into bed and his big body wraps around me, holding me against his chest.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he says as his hand slides through my hair.</p><p>I take a breath, my heart beating out of my chest because of what I\u2019m going to tell him. \u201cWhen I was sixteen, I got pregnant,\u201d I whisper, feeling his muscles tighten. \u201cWhen my mom found out, she sent me away to a home for girls who were expecting.\u201d Tears begin to fill my eyes again, so I squeeze them tightly, trying to fight them off. \u201cThe day I had my son, I got to spend two hours with him before they took him away from me.\u201d I feel a knot form in my throat, making it hard to breathe. \u201cI never wanted to give him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Kenton rumbles, pulling me closer to him. Feeling the strength in his arms gives me the courage to continue.</p> <p>\u201cA little boy was Life-Flighted in tonight.\u201d I close my eyes, seeing the child in my head. \u201cWhen I saw him, all I could think about was my son, who would be close in age to him.\u201d I open my eyes and tilt my head back to look up at Kenton. I can barely make out his image with the moonlight shining through the window. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m out and I see a little boy, I wonder if it could be him. Logically, I know it\u2019s not, but my heart still hasn\u2019t accepted that he\u2019s lost to me after all these years and I will never see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something easy to accept,\u201d he says softly, running a hand down my back. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t your boyfriend help you find a way to keep your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want me or a child. When I told him I was pregnant, he told me he didn\u2019t want to have a kid and he was breaking up with me.\u201d I cry a little harder, reliving the devastation I felt back then. \u201cHe was happy when my mom contacted him, telling him that she was forcing me to put the baby up for adoption and he needed to sign the papers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s f**ked up, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>There is nothing else to say. Kenton now knows some of my past\u2014really, the worst of it\u2014and I wonder what he\u2019s thinking about as he holds me until I cry myself to sleep.</p><p>I wake up feeling cocooned in warmth. It takes a few seconds for last night to come back to me and to remember that I willingly climbed into bed with Kenton. I can only imagine what he thinks of me now. I try to lift my head, hoping I can sneak away from him, but his giant hand is wrapped around my hair, holding me in place. Between that and his leg over mine, I can\u2019t move at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sneaking out on me.\u201d His voice is gravelly with sleep, and I close my eyes, trying to think of what I need to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about laying all that stuff on you last night.\u201d I hide my face in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came to me. I\u2019m sorry about your son. I can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019re going through.\u201d He takes a breath, pulling me closer to him. \u201cIf you want, I can find him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, baby,\u201d he says completely seriously, and my heart does a double thump at the sweet offer.</p><p>\u201cIt was a closed adoption,\u201d I whisper, tears filling my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have ways of finding people. You say the word and I\u2019ll find your boy for you.\u201d</p><p>The building tears begin to fall as I think about finding my son. Then I wonder what I would even do with the information. Would it hurt more knowing where he is? Could I even handle it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI would like to know if he\u2019s happy, but I don\u2019t know if I could handle seeing him or knowing where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d He gives me a gentle squeeze. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to decide right now. The offer has no time limit on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I unconsciously rub my face against his chest, breathing in his unique smell. His warmth and smell have me wanting to get even closer to him.</p><p>His hand in my hair pulls my head back as the leg he has over mine moves to between my legs. His eyes search my face for a long moment before his face lowers and his mouth gently touches mine.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get enough of your mouth,\u201d he says against my lips, kissing me again. The hand I\u2019m resting between us starts to inch towards his torso, but I stop myself. \u201cTouch me,\u201d he says, grabbing my hand and pulling it to his chest.</p><p>His skin is so warm, and the light scattering of hair he has on his chest prickles against my fingers. His hand on top of mine moves to my hip then down the curve of my ass, pulling my hips closer to his. I can feel his erection hard and long between us. I start to breathe heavily; I feel like I can\u2019t get enough oxygen into my lungs. My hand on his chest travels up to his hair at the back of his head, running it through my fingers as his mouth travels from mine, down my cheek, and then across my neck, the scruff on his jaw scraping against my sensitive skin.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you smell good,\u201d he rumbles against my throat as his tongue touches me there. I tilt my head farther back, pressing my thighs together, trying to alleviate the ache that is building between my legs. \u201cShit,\u201d he groans.</p><p>My eyes open and I look at his face, wondering why he\u2019s stopping, and then I hear his phone ringing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose that look,\u201d he orders as he quickly twists his upper body away from mine before turning back over, holding his phone in his hand. His eyebrows go together and he shakes his head, sliding his finger across the screen. \u201cThis better be f**king good,\u201d he growls, looking at me. His eyes narrow on me when I hear Justin\u2019s voice say something about pulling the stick out of his ass, making me smile. \u201cDo not f**king encourage him,\u201d he says, shaking his head when I laugh harder after hearing Justin yell through the speaker that Kenton stole me away from him and he\u2019s going to find a way to win me back.</p> <p>\u201cDid you call for a f**king reason, or are you just callin\u2019 to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hear Justin\u2019s response, but I can tell that Kenton doesn\u2019t like it by the look that comes over his face as he listens.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he clips, dropping his head. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d He pulls the phone away from his ear before dropping it to the bed next to my head. \u201cI gotta head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I bite my lip, wondering what I\u2019m supposed to do. This whole thing feels surreal to me. I don\u2019t know if I want to kiss him again or run away and pretend like nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>His question hits my chest and I feel my face go soft at his concern for me. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I assure him quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou workin\u2019 tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I feel bad about what happened last night and leaving early. I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m flighty. I really like working there,\u201d I say, absently rubbing the sheet between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Tara last night?\u201d I nod yes and his fingers run over my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re good then. That bitch is crazy. She would never let them think less of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her a bitch,\u201d I say defensively.</p><p>\u201cI mean \u2018bitch\u2019 in the nicest way possible.\u201d He smiles, dropping his face towards mine.</p><p>As soon as our lips touch, his hand goes to the back of my head, holding me to him while controlling the kiss. When he pulls his mouth from mine, I can\u2019t help the whimper that escapes.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your next day off?\u201d he asks through heavily panted breaths.</p><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow,\u201d I reply just as breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly like a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I say, not knowing how to respond.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up for debate. We\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I narrow my eyes. \u201cYou need to ask me if I would like to go out with you.\u201d No way am I going to let him boss me around.</p><p>He rolls until I\u2019m on my back and one of his legs is between mine. His hands capture mine, bringing them above my head. Then he bends his head and whispers into my ear, \u201cAutumn, will you have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I smile when he growls against the skin of my neck.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he asks, his tongue snaking out to touch my sensitive flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My body arches back. Having him cover me is doing crazy things to my body. I don\u2019t know if I want to pull him closer or push him away only to climb on top of him. My hands run down his back, feeling his smooth skin under my fingers.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d he asks, his hand running down my bare thigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I feel the vibration of his laughter before he pulls away so I can see his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your answer? Am I taking you willingly, or do I need to force you?\u201d</p> <p>My eyes drop to his mouth and he smiles. \u201cI guess I could suffer through a date with you. Who am I to pass up free food?\u201d I ask with a straight face.</p><p>His hands go to my sides and he starts to tickle me. I have never been tickled before and it catches me off guard, making me scream in horror.</p><p>When he realizes that I\u2019m not shrieking playfully, his body stills and he looks down at me in question. Tears fill my eyes again and I don\u2019t even know what to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says gently, removing his hands from my sides and sliding them into my hair. \u201cWe can talk about what just happened another time.\u201d</p><p>No way am I going to tell him about my childhood. Instead of saying that, I just nod. His eyes search my face, and I know he doesn\u2019t like what he sees when his jaw starts ticking.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta go or I would make you talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d I push his chest and he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d He drops his head before lifting it again, his eyes looking me over. \u201cJust like that, you replace those f**king barriers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d I say, really wanting to be away from him and how exposed I feel.</p><p>\u201cSwear to Christ, if I didn\u2019t know that the reward would be worth it, I wouldn\u2019t waste my f**king time with this bullshit.\u201d</p><p>His words are like a slap in the face and I flinch, closing my eyes for a second before opening them back up. \u201cGet off me,\u201d I say softly, and he presses me harder into the bed.</p> <p>\u201cShit, I di\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off, shoving at his chest and yelling at the top of my lungs, \u201cGet the f**k off me right now!\u201d I wiggle around, trying to break free. Not being strong enough to get him off me has tears of frustration forming in my eyes. \u201cPlease get off me,\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes. My body loses its fight, knowing that it\u2019s pointless; he has all the power.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he says quietly, kissing my forehead.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything; I just wait until I feel him get up. As soon as his weight is off me, I jump out of bed and look around for my stuff from the night before. I quickly grab it and open his bedroom door. Then I shut it behind me and run down the hall to my room, slamming and locking my door behind me.</p><p>I drop the clothes in my hands to the floor before I go to the closet, pull out a bag, and start to pack. I need to get out of here. My heart is wide open with him. Somehow, he has maneuvered through my defenses and now has the power to hurt me, and he isn\u2019t someone I trust with that power.</p><p>He has proven on more than one occasion that he can be an ass. How can I possibly put myself out there to be hurt by him again? I hear him coming down the hall and brace myself. When his fist pounds on the door, I close my eyes before yelling, \u201cGo away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou even think about leaving me, Autumn, and I will hunt your ass down and spank the shit out of you.\u201d He pauses and his voice gentles. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk to you right now, but we will be talking about what happened.\u201d</p><p>What is happening to me? The sound of his voice has me dropping my bag onto my closet floor.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you later, baby,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>I walk to the bed and lie down, pulling some of my hair to my face to smell it. Just like the last time I slept with him, his scent is clinging to my hair. I need to get it together; I need to stop running from him. I have a feeling that, if I do get away from him, it would be the biggest mistake of my life, and I have made enough mistakes to last a lifetime.</p><p>I stand and go to the window to make sure he\u2019s gone before I go downstairs. I need my phone out of my bag, and I left my purse in my car last night when I came home. I pull on a pair of shorts and leave my room. I turn off the alarm before opening the front door. The second I hit the front porch, a silver convertible pulls up. I squint my eyes, trying to see who it is, and when I recognize the driver, I run to my car, open my door, quickly grab my bag, and run back to the front porch.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wear clothes?\u201d Kenton\u2019s ex, Cassie, yells.</p><p>I want to tell her no, but instead, I run into the house, dropping my bag next to the door. I almost have the door closed when it\u2019s pushed open and Cassie grabs a handful of my hair.</p><p>I have never been in a fight in my life. I have been beaten many times, but I\u2019ve never fought back, knowing that the consequences would be a lot worse if I did. My body freezes, and then my adrenaline surges. I turn around and smack her across her face. Her hand goes to her cheek, and her eyes widened then narrow.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d she says, smacking me back a lot harder than I hit her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bitch?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cGet out of this house right now,\u201d I say with a scary calmness, holding my stinging cheek. I\u2019m too old for this crap.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel knowing you\u2019re sleeping in a bed I picked out...that I f**ked him in?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so that didn\u2019t feel good, but I keep my face neutral, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing that her words affected me. \u201cGet the f**k out,\u201d I tell her, leaning forward and pointing at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in my bed with my man and you want me to get out?\u201d She lets out a laugh then looks me over.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not yours,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cHe will always want me!\u201d she shrieks. \u201cWhy do you think he hasn\u2019t changed the bed or redecorated?\u201d</p><p>Wow, this chick is crazy, but her telling me about her and Kenton in that bed over and over again is grating my nerves. I turn and run up the stairs as fast as I can. I hear her following me, but I\u2019m on a mission.</p><p>I run to Kenton\u2019s room, locking the door behind me. My eyes land on the bed, which is still messy from this morning. I look around and see that he has a large sliding glass door in his room that leads out onto the upper balcony. Cassie starts pounding on the door, and I quickly look at it before running to the bed to toss the covers, sheets, and pillows onto the floor.</p><p>The bed is queen-sized, so even with the weight of the mattress, I\u2019m still able to pull it off the bed, pushing it to the side. I see that the side rails hook into the headboard and the slats are what keeps the mattress up, so I toss the slats aside then pull up on the side pieces. The bed falls apart, the footboard falling to the floor and the headboard hitting the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I go to the foot of the bed and pick up the wooden piece, carrying it over to the balcony. I open the sliding glass door and haul the footboard over to the railing. Seeing Cassie\u2019s car parked right under me, I say, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and toss it over. It lands in her back seat, making me smile. I do the same with the two side rails; these miss and land near her car on the ground.</p><p>Cassie has no idea what\u2019s going on; she is still pounding on the bedroom door. I go to the headboard, and with this piece being much heavier, I scoot it across the hardwood floors and out onto the balcony. I lift it over the railing, where it teeters before falling over the other side; the loud crunching sound of glass and metal soothes my temper.</p><p>I hear Cassie yell something as she leaves the door. I quickly get the mattress, pushing it out onto the balcony before tossing it over the edge too. With my adrenaline pumping like never before, I look down and watch as it floats like a feather in slow motion, landing with a little bounce on the hood of her car.</p><p>Cassie starts screaming at the top of her lungs then pulls her phone out of her pocket.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper. I know she\u2019s calling the cops. I start wondering where I should hide when the house phone starts ringing. I see the phone on the nightstand light up, and I debate if I should answer it or not when it stops ringing only to start up again. My gut clenches, and I know without a doubt that it\u2019s Kenton calling.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is going on?\u201d I hear from outside, and I close my eyes.</p><p>Are you kidding me? Why me? Why does this stuff always happen to me? I walk to the balcony door and look out over the railing, seeing Nancy and Viv. Both are standing near Cassie, who is still on the phone. Viv looks up and I start to duck, but I\u2019m too late; our eyes meet and she smiles.</p><p>I run to the phone when it starts ringing again. I don\u2019t really want to talk to Kenton, but right now, he\u2019s the lesser of two evils. \u201cHello,\u201d I answer, trying to make myself sound like I didn\u2019t just toss his bed outside and that his mom and aunt aren\u2019t downstairs probably wondering how to get me out of his house before I go crazy on him as well.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he answers back, the one word said in a tone sounding slightly humorous and slightly pissed.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d I ask, looking around his room, taking it in for the first time. If Cassie did help decorate, she did a crap job. There are two nightstands, one on each side of where the bed used to be. Both are older; the matte black paint is chipping away. The dresser in the corner of the room is in pretty much the same shape.</p><p>There is nothing else in the room\u2014no rugs, no curtains; the room is bare except for the furniture. It\u2019s a great room. The beige paint on the walls looks new, with beautiful, dark wood floors throughout, large windows that look out over the forest, and the sliding glass door that leads to a large balcony I can imagine having my coffee out on in the mornings. The urge to make over his room hits me when I hear his voice growl down the line.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you really just tossed my bed over the balcony and onto Cassie\u2019s car,\u201d he says in the same amused-slash-angry tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, I...\u201d I try to come up with some other reason why I would have done what I just did without making it seem like I may be insane.</p> <p>\u201cDo not f**king lie,\u201d he says, cutting me off before I can even think of something to say.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to lie,\u201d I snap, knowing that I was perhaps going to fib a little about what happened, but I wasn\u2019t going to lie.</p><p>\u201cAutumn,\u201d he rumbles out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes,\u201d I huff out, annoyed. \u201cI tossed your bed onto her car. Well, really, I tossed her bed into her car, so I was just helping her move it out.\u201d I press my lips together knowing how stupid that sounds.</p><p>\u201cYou were helping her move it out,\u201d he repeats, and I can\u2019t figure out if he\u2019s growling or laughing. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to my car \u2019cause I left my bag in the passenger\u2019s seat last night and I needed my phone. When I was outside, she pulled up. I tried to get into the house and lock the door, but she grabbed my hair. I may have smacked her, and then she may have smacked me back. She started telling me about you and her in your bed, and I may or may not have gotten pissed, ran up to your room, and threw your bed over the balcony onto her car. Oh, and your mom and aunt might be outside right now.\u201d I whisper the last part, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cYou were jealous,\u201d he says, sounding slightly surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was pissed,\u201d I correct.</p> <p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t jealous, why would you care what she said to you?\u201d</p><p>Okay, I\u2019m not going to answer that question. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new bed,\u201d I tell him, hoping to end this conversation.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the bed, Autumn. This isn\u2019t even about Cassie. This is about you realizing what you\u2019re feeling and accepting it.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself heat up. I know what I\u2019m feeling. I just don\u2019t know if I can trust him with these feelings.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, are you in there?\u201d I hear from outside the bedroom door, and my head drops to look at my feet.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s outside the door,\u201d I whisper into the phone, looking around the room for somewhere to hide.</p><p>\u201cSo answer the door,\u201d he tells me with an implied, Duh.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer the door. She was outside with Cassie,\u201d I hiss, going over to one of the other doors in the room. As soon as I swing it open, I see that it\u2019s a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and walk-in shower.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for somewhere to hide,\u201d I tell him without thinking, walking to the only other door in the room, and as soon as it opens, I see that it\u2019s a large, very organized closet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for somewhere to hide?\u201d he repeats, laughing.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, I know you\u2019re in there. Open the door.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and lean my head back. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do, but it\u2019s time to face the music. I take a breath and walk to the door. I click open the lock, pull the door in a crack, and peek out.</p><p>\u201cHey. Is everything okay?\u201d I ask, seeing not only Nancy, but also Viv standing outside the bedroom.</p><p>Nancy smiles and Viv\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cLooks like there was a little bit of an accident,\u201d Nancy says, and Kenton starts laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up,\u201d I tell him, annoyed that he is finding this situation so hilarious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d he warns me, and I hear the line go dead.</p><p>\u201cOh, great,\u201d I sigh, pulling the phone from my ear. I start to toss it on the bed when I remember that the bed is no longer there, so I squeeze it in my hand.</p><p>\u201cDid Cassie hit you?\u201d Nancy asks, her eyes zeroing in on my cheek.</p><p>My hand naturally lifts to my cheek and I swallow. \u201cUm...the thing is...she pulled my hair, so then I smacked her, and she smacked me back.\u201d Yes, the chick is crazy, but I\u2019m at fault as well.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Viv pulls me into a hug, and I feel Nancy put her arms around us both.</p><p>We stand there for a few moments. I didn\u2019t think they would be offering me comfort after what I just did.</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this just f**king sweet? Seriously, she hit me and trashed my car and you\u2019re f**king coddling her?\u201d Cassie yells.</p><p>I pull back from Nancy and Viv before facing her. Her face is red with rage, but there is no mark on her cheek from where I smacked her.</p><p>\u201cThe cops are on the way. I hope you know you\u2019re going to jail for what you did.\u201d</p> <p>Shit, she\u2019s right; I\u2019m probably going to jail for what I did. Then I\u2019m probably going to lose my job when I have to tell them why I can\u2019t show up to work tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Cassie?\u201d Nancy asks her.</p><p>\u201cI needed to talk to Kenton.\u201d She shrugs, glaring at me again.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s at work, so why are you really here?\u201d Viv asks, stepping in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you really must know, I wanted to tell him about the woman he has living with him. Did you know she\u2019s a stripper and was letting random men do body shots off her at a club downtown?\u201d</p><p>My stomach drops at her evil tone. I have no idea how she could possible know about that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over YouTube.\u201d She smirks, reading my face. \u201cYep, your whore face is all over the Internet.\u201d</p><p>I feel bile crawling up my throat as I look over at Nancy and Viv. I honestly don\u2019t care that people are going to see me acting stupid and drunk, but I do care that the guy in Vegas could somehow see it and know where I\u2019m now staying. I hate the idea of bringing danger to not only Kenton, but everyone else around me\u2014people I really care for and consider friends for the first time in my life.</p><p>\u201cDid you do it? Did you post that video?\u201d I ask, ready to push her ass down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCassie, why the f**k do you keep showing up at my house?\u201d Kenton asks, walking up the stairs. Butterflies erupt in my stomach when our eyes meet, and then his eyes go from soft to hard when they lock on my cheek. \u201cShe f**king hit you?\u201d he growls. He must have forgotten that I already told him about our little exchange. His head swings to Cassie, the look on his face forcing her to take a step back. \u201cYou hit her?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you f**king dare, Kenton Mayson. She is not the f**king victim in this situation. She hit me then trashed my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to my house and hit my woman, and now you want to point f**king fingers? I told you to never show your face here again. I told you we have not one f**king thing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly feel faint. His \u2018woman\u2019? I didn\u2019t think I was his, but he just said that I am, and he said it in front of his mom and aunt. I\u2019m not going to explore why that made me feel all squishy and warm inside.</p><p>\u201cNow, for the last f**king time, get the f**k out of my house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait! She can\u2019t leave!\u201d I shout, grabbing Kenton\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here,\u201d Cassie hisses and hurries down the stairs. I start to run after her, but an arm wraps around my waist and my back hits the solid wall of Kenton\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, baby.\u201d His lips brush my ear as he speaks.</p><p>I shake my head and he squeezes me tighter. \u201cNo, she can\u2019t leave! She said there was a YouTube video of me from the bar the other night. I don\u2019t know who put it up, but maybe she does.\u201d</p><p>His body goes tight behind me and he lifts me, swinging me behind his back before running down the stairs. I look at Viv and Nancy before following behind him.</p><p>The second I reach the front door and swing it open, I see Kenton pacing back and forth, talking on the phone to someone. Cassie is next to her car trying to lift the mattress off of it. Just as I take a step out onto the front porch, two police cars pull up the driveway. Kenton\u2019s head swings my way, and he lifts his hand and motions for me to come over.</p><p>I look at the cop cars then at Cassie, who is glaring at me while trying to lift the headboard. If things were not so messed up, I\u2019d be laughing at her. I walk to Kenton. His voice is a low rumble when he tells the person on the phone to track the video and have it removed. When he hangs up, his hand goes to the bottom of my shirt and he pulls me until I\u2019m forced to step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cJustin\u2019s on it. He should have the video down in a couple of hours.\u201d When his arms wrap around me, mine automatically do the same, and I lay my head against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. Everything will be okay,\u201d he says right before I feel his lips at the top of my head.</p><p>I close my eyes, soaking in the feeling only he gives me, but the moment is broken when I hear someone clear their throat. I open my eyes and turn my head. A cop is standing there, his mouth curved into a slight smile. I don\u2019t know what he could possibly be smiling about, but his eyes go from me, to Kenton, then over to Cassie, and he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you got a little bit of a situation on your hands here, Mayson,\u201d he says, tilting his head towards Cassie and her car, where there is another cop talking to her. \u201cWanna tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Ford. You know that woman is crazy as hell,\u201d Kenton says, and I bite the inside of my cheek, wondering if it\u2019s wise to talk to a cop like that.</p><p>\u201cYou were warned about her. Everyone told you to be careful when you got with her, but you are so f**king stubborn you had to find out that shit for yourself. Seems to me you have been taught a valuable lesson,\u201d Officer Ford says as I try to pull away from Kenton, who only holds me tighter. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d he asks again.</p><p>\u201cCassie showed up here not long after I left to head to the office. She pushed her way inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did the bed end up in her car?\u201d he asks, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI may have lost my temper,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Officer Ford smiles then shakes his head before looking at Kenton.</p><p>\u201cI want her arrested!\u201d Cassie screeches, and I look in her direction, seeing her pointing at me. \u201cI want to press charges.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit, this is going to be a lot of paperwork,\u201d Officer Ford grumbles, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cShe pushed her way into my house and attacked my woman. If she presses charges, I will do the same,\u201d Kenton says only loud enough for me and Ford to hear. \u201cI will pay for the damage to her car, but I want her gone and to understand that, if she comes back, I will no longer be nice about keeping her away.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what he means by that, but it doesn\u2019t sound good. Officer Ford nods and walks over to where Cassie and the other officer are talking. I watch as he says something to Cassie. Her eyes narrow before getting big, and she turns her head to glare at us.</p><p>\u201cGo wait inside with my aunt and mom, baby, while I take care of this,\u201d Kenton says, and I wonder if he saw the look Cassie just shot at both of us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMaybe I should find somewhere els\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou even think about running out on me now and I swear to Christ I will blister your ass,\u201d he says, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cYour family,\u201d I say softly, reminding him that we\u2019re not the only ones he needs to worry about.</p><p>\u201cMy family is safe and so are you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I do feel safer with him than I would anywhere else. Plus, I have a feeling that, if I did leave, he would do exactly as he threatened. What I don\u2019t understand is why that thought alone has a dull ache beginning to throb between my legs.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s agreed to not press charges if you agree to pay for the damage to her car,\u201d Officer Ford says, walking back up to us.</p><p>I look over at Cassie and then at the car. I have some money saved up and can afford to have it fixed. I don\u2019t want Kenton paying for the damage when this was all my fault to begin with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d I tell Ford.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying,\u201d Kenton says, shaking his head. I narrow my eyes and try to step away from him so I can fully have it out with him. \u201cShe\u2019s my ex. If she hadn\u2019t shown up, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Well, he has a point, but if I hadn\u2019t thrown the bed over the balcony into her car, we wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation. \u201cGo wait inside with my mom and aunt while I get this sorted,\u201d he says again, his arms releasing me.</p><p>His tone and bossy attitude have me wanting to punch him in the stomach. My hands ball into fists at my sides, and his eyes drop to them before meeting mine again as a smirk appears on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna hit me?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug then look at Officer Ford. \u201cWould you arrest me?\u201d</p><p>He smiles and shakes his head. I look back over at Kenton and grin.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re cute when you\u2019re pissed,\u201d he says, catching me off guard. Something about that statement only serves to make me madder. \u201cNow, stop f**king around and go wait inside.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, I kick him in the shin, turn around, and run as fast as I can up the stairs and onto the porch\u2014right into his mom.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cChild, I\u2019m starting to wonder if you need anger management,\u201d Nancy says, grabbing my hand, pulling me inside the house, and closing the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not normally like this,\u201d I mumble, lowering my head when I see Viv smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what is going on with you and my son, but you\u2019re good for him. He needs someone to put him in his place and keep him on his toes. His life is so serious and revolves around people listening to him and doing exactly what he says when he says it. I don\u2019t know about you, but that would get old.\u201d She shakes her head, smiling.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to get their hopes up about Kenton and me, so I decide to change the subject and avoid the topic, even though I have a feeling that I\u2019m not going to be able to avoid it much longer.</p><p>\u201cSo, what brings you guys to the neighborhood?\u201d I ask casually, leaning back on my heels. I bite my lip when Viv starts to laugh, looking over at Nancy.</p><p>\u201cWell, Kenton called and said you needed company.\u201d</p><p>A light bulb goes off in my head and I know exactly what happened. He thought I was going to run off, so he sent for backup. The door opens and Kenton walks in. I\u2019m surprised by the smile that lights up his face when our eyes meet.</p><p>\u201cTow truck\u2019s on the way,\u201d he says, walking towards me. I look around, trying to find an escape route. He looks at his mom and gives her a grin. \u201cCan you start some coffee while I talk to Autumn?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>She looks at me and her eyes sparkle when I start shaking my head at her. \u201cSure, honey,\u201d she tells him, turning towards the kitchen. \u201cViv, let\u2019s go make coffee,\u201d Nancy says with a smile.</p><p>Viv\u2019s eyes come to me and she smiles, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I semi shout. \u201cYou should really spend some time with your son. I can totally make the coffee,\u201d I tell them, starting to head towards the kitchen. I feel myself being tugged back by the hem of my shirt. When I look over my shoulder at Kenton, I glare.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he informs me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Nancy says, Viv following close behind her.</p><p>I close my eyes, letting my head drop forward.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d Kenton says as I turn around to face him and my shirt twists around my stomach. His eyes drop to my mouth and he takes a step towards me. I try to take a step back, but his hand, which is still wrapped around my shirt, prevents me from going far. \u201cYou kicked me,\u201d he says quietly, his mouth brushing mine, leaving me paralyzed.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, getting lost in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you really sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, watching his eyes grow dark.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d His tongue touches my bottom lip, making me gasp as his teeth give my bottom lip a punishing nip and tug. My hands lift to his hair, pulling it at the roots, as his hands slide down my sides and over my ass, where he gives me a squeeze.</p><p>The feeling of his hands on me has me jumping up without thinking and wrapping my legs around his waist. He groans, pulling my hips tighter against him. My back hits the wall and I whimper. His mouth leaves mine and travels to my ear, nipping it before his lips make their way down my neck, licking and biting along the way. When his mouth comes back to mine, my hips grind against him, trying to get some friction.</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s ready\u2014oh! Crap. Sorry,\u201d I hear Viv say.</p><p>My eyes open, my teeth release his bottom lip, and I look over his shoulder, seeing Viv heading back into the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand cups my cheek, pulling my attention back to him. \u201cI hate that she hit you.\u201d His words and the look in his eyes as he studies my cheek make my heart start to pound harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m sorry about your bed,\u201d I tell him. Now that I\u2019m not in the moment anymore, I feel bad for having lost my temper.</p><p>\u201cI needed a new one anyways.\u201d He smiles, and my fingers go to his cheek, pressing into his dimple. \u201cWe good now?\u201d he asks, and I know he\u2019s talking about this morning.</p><p>I fight myself on what to say. I need to be honest with him. He scares me, but not exploring this thing with him scares me more. I look over his shoulder before my eyes search his face.</p> <p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it like you said it. You\u2019re the first person in a very long time I find myself opening up to.\u201d I cover his mouth with my hand when it looks like he\u2019s going to speak. \u201cYou\u2019re also the first guy since my first that I have been interested in. I feel vulnerable when I\u2019m with you, and I hate that your words have the power to crush me, but they do,\u201d I confess softly.</p><p>His hand comes to mine, pulling it from his mouth, and he kisses my palm before placing it against his chest. \u201cI say shit I don\u2019t mean sometimes. It\u2019s no excuse and I\u2019ll work on it, but you need to work on opening up to me.\u201d His eyes search my face before his lips brush mine again. \u201cYou\u2019re so f**king fearless that I forget how fragile you are.\u201d The words gently spoken against my lips cause my eyes to slide closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fearless,\u201d I tell him, resting my forehead against his. \u201cI\u2019m afraid all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a f**king warrior.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p> <p>Annoying Roomies And Bad Guys</p><p>When I pull up to the house, it\u2019s just after seven in the morning. Yesterday, after the tow truck showed up and Kenton left to go back to work, Viv, Nancy, and I sat around the kitchen drinking coffee and chatting for a few hours. When Nancy asked about the video Cassie had been talking about, I cringed but told her and Viv what had happened and the real reason I was in Tennessee. Nancy was visibly upset about it, and I immediately told her that I would leave if she felt uncomfortable with me being here with her son.</p><p>The second the words left my mouth, she grabbed my face between her hands and I watched as tears slid down her cheeks. My heart broke when she looked into my eyes and spoke. \u201cThis is exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be. This is the safest place for you. This is where my son wants you. This is where we want you, so this is where you will stay.\u201d</p><p>I started crying and buried my face in her chest, taking something from her I never received from my own mother\u2014comfort. I hated crying, but something about crying while she held me healed a small piece of me. That lost, lonely little girl who was never allowed to show emotion was finally able to cry until she couldn\u2019t cry anymore.</p><p>I shake my head, clearing the memory, and slide my key into the door. All I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. I\u2019m exhausted from being up early and not having a nap before going to work. As soon as I can, I\u2019m going to have them change my schedule. There is just no way I will be able to keep this up.</p><p>I make my way upstairs and head right to the bathroom. I take a quick shower and wrap a towel under my arms, not even bothering with brushing my hair. I pick my clothes up off the floor and head to my room without turning on the light. I toss my stuff in the direction of my closet before pulling off the towel and begin climbing into bed.</p> <p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>I scream when I hear Kenton\u2019s voice. I jump off the bed and run to the closet, going inside and shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in the closet?\u201d Kenton asks, and I can tell that he\u2019s laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in my bed?\u201d I ask through the closed closet door while trying to find something to put on in the dark.</p><p>\u201cSomeone threw my bed outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch downstairs,\u201d I tell him, pulling a hoodie on over my head.</p><p>When I open the closet door, I find a shirtless Kenton sitting on the side of the bed, wearing a pair of cut-off sweats that have seen better days. Somehow, I find the strength to pull my eyes from him and walk to my dresser, pulling out a pair of cotton Victoria\u2019s Secret panties and slipping them on under the hoodie.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sexy underwear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, my face heating up from the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know. Silk thongs, lacy shit\u2014where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear those unless I have to. I would rather be comfortable,\u201d I explain. I know that a lot of women go gaga over sexy panties, but I couldn\u2019t care less. I hate the feeling of something crawling up my ass all day.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you. I have seen you in those things three times now, and all three times, that damn underwear has done more for me than any skimpy shit I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we never talk about you and what you\u2019ve seen other women wear please?\u201d</p><p>He smirks, his eyes running down my legs. \u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, looking at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou try to sleep on the couch and I\u2019m dragging your ass back up here to bed,\u201d he threatens.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid you won\u2019t be able to keep your hands off me?\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d I roll my eyes, knowing that is the exact reason why I don\u2019t want to get into bed with him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe. I can tell you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>I look at the bed then him. I am really tired. I open my dresser, pull out a pair of shorts, put them on, and walk over to the opposite side of the bed before getting in. I hear his laugh as he lies back down, shutting off the light. I put my back to him and close my eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m just about asleep when I feel him put his hand around my waist, and he pulls me across the bed to him so his body curves around mine and his hand can wrap in my hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask him sleepily.</p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d he says softly, kissing the back of my head.</p><p>I know I should get up and leave or at least put up a little bit of a fight about cuddling with him for the third night in a row, but I can\u2019t. I feel too warm, too comfortable, and way too exhausted to fight what I\u2019m feeling. I feel him kiss me again and his hand go a little tighter, and I\u2019m pretty sure I hear him whisper, \u201cShe\u2019s getting it,\u201d as I fall asleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wake up in complete darkness. My first thought is how great I feel. I have forgotten what it feels like to wake up after a good night\u2019s sleep. It takes a second to realize that it\u2019s pitch black in the room. I sit up quickly and look at the clock on the bedside table, and my heart starts beating out of my chest when I see that it\u2019s four o\u2019clock. I missed work!</p><p>I jump out of bed and run to the door, swinging it open only to be bombarded with bright daylight. I look over my shoulder into the room and see that there are now dark, wooden blinds on the windows, whereas before there were only sheer curtains. My heart, which was already beating hard, starts to beat harder. Kenton put in blinds while I was at work, knowing how little sleep I\u2019ve been getting. That was sweet. Really sweet.</p><p>I go to the bathroom, quickly taking care of business, and then head down to the kitchen. As soon as I make it around the corner, I\u2019m surprised to see Kenton there, wearing the same cut-off sweats he had on last night and a pair of sneakers. His head is back, his throat working vigorously while he downs a bottle of water. The ends of his hair are dripping with sweat along with his bare chest.</p><p>I stand there captivated by him; I can\u2019t pull my eyes away no matter how hard I try. Just watching him drink water is making the space between my legs get tingly. When the bottle\u2019s empty, he pulls it from his mouth, the back of his hand goes to his lips, and he swipes them. As soon as his head turns, his eyes land on me and a look I\u2019m starting to become familiar with fills his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d he rumbles.</p><p>I stand there staring at him, trying to comprehend what he just said over the lustful haze that\u2019s filling my head.</p><p>\u201cYou put up blinds,\u201d I say when I finally find my words and then want to smack myself for being an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI know how tired you\u2019ve been,\u201d he says, his eyes going soft.</p><p>\u201cThat was very sweet, and I actually slept really great. When I woke up, I thought I\u2019d overslept and missed work.\u201d</p> <p>His smile makes the breath catch in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI thought you would be at work,\u201d I tell him, trying to think of something else to say besides, \u201cPlease kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I have to leave for a couple of nights. Justin has a lead for me, but my flight isn\u2019t until after midnight, and I wanted to make sure you would be okay being here alone.\u201d</p><p>My heart plummets. I don\u2019t want him to leave, but I know his work is important. Plus, I would look really stupid if I were to beg him to stay. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d I wave him off, trying to do the same with the feeling of loneliness starting to fill my chest. I\u2019ve forgotten what that feels like; I haven\u2019t felt it since I moved here.</p><p>He shakes his head and takes two long steps until his body is crowding mine. \u201cI like worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask softly, my eyes drawn to his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHonesty, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I look at him and my hands go to his chest when I feel like I might fall over from the heat in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do know is I want this\u201d\u2014his finger presses lightly into my chest above my heart\u2014\u201cmore than I\u2019ve wanted anything, and that right there tells me everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe. The words aren\u2019t deep or particularly meaningful, but something about the way he said it, with such sincerity, has me leaning deeper into him.</p><p>His hand goes to the back of my neck and the other around my waist. I expect him to kiss me, but instead, he just pulls my head into his naked chest and the rest of me tighter against him.</p><p>We stand there for a long time with our arms wrapped around each other. I want to ask what he\u2019s thinking, but I\u2019m too afraid to break the moment. Instead, I listen to the sound of his heart beating rhythmically against my ear as I memorize the thud and double beat along with the way his chest feels when it expands against my cheek. This is a moment I know I can recall the next time I need comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get home, we have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>I smile as I hear his low growl. \u201cI\u2019m not even pissed that you wanna f**k with me right now.\u201d He pulls my head away from his chest, his hands go around my neck, and his thumbs slide under my jaw, tilting my head back. His mouth lowers and my eyes start to flutter closed. \u201cEvery time you f**k with me, it makes me wanna f**k you. One day, we\u2019re going to get to a point in our relationship where you\u2019ll say something to set me off and I\u2019ll bend you over right where you stand and punish you for misbehaving or talking back.\u201d</p><p>My clit starts to pulse. I can feel my breathing increase, my chest meeting his on each deep inhale. He closes the gap between us, his lips touching mine. When his tongue touches my bottom lip, my eyes close and I get lost in his kiss. By the time he pulls his mouth from mine, I\u2019ve never hated clothes more than I do right now. I have the urge to take off my sweatshirt and plaster my chest against his.</p><p>\u201cI gotta shower,\u201d he says, resting his forehead on mine.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nod, my eyes still closed.</p><p>He chuckles and shakes his head against mine. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna come shower with me, baby, you need to hop off.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes, seeing that my fingers have somehow gotten tangled into his hair and my legs have wrapped around his waist. I bite my bottom lip, place my hands on his shoulders, unwrap my legs, and hop down. \u201cSorry.\u201d I shake my head, trying to clear my needful haze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d He kisses my nose then forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be back down to say goodbye before I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nod again.</p><p>His hand goes to his chest then runs down his abs. My eyes follow its movement until they drop lower, seeing his very apparent erection outlined through his sweats. My eyes get big and lift to his when he starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re cute.\u201d He shakes his head, running a hand down his face. \u201cI gotta go before you end up on the counter.\u201d His voice sounds deeper than normal, and I nod again. \u201cBaby, you gotta move,\u201d he says, his hands fisting at his sides.</p><p>My gaze drops to his hands before shooting back up to his eyes when he growls. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I immediately step aside so he can get out of the kitchen. I watch him walk away, his head bent as he mumbles something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d I whisper to myself.</p><p>I pull up to the house, seeing a strange car parked out front. My pulse starts to speed up as I wonder who it could be. Kenton messaged me when I was at work, letting me know that he had arrived at his destination safely. I didn\u2019t ask where he was; I figured that, if he wanted me to know, he would tell me. I worry that he\u2019s in danger, and maybe his leaving has something to do with my situation. I don\u2019t want him hurt because of me, but I trust that he knows what he\u2019s doing. After all, he\u2019s been doing it for years without incident. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slowly pull into the driveway, trying to angle the car in case I need to make a quick escape. As soon as I\u2019m able to see the front porch, I spot Justin sitting on the top step with a black duffel bag at his side and his head bent towards his phone. His head comes up when I get out of the car and slam the door.</p><p>\u201cHey ya, roomie,\u201d he says, giving me a goofy smile.</p><p>\u201cRoomie?\u201d I ask, looking at the bag next to him and then noticing the sleeping bag he has along with it.</p><p>\u201cYep. Boss man told me to stay here with you,\u201d he says, pointing a finger at me while standing. \u201cI\u2019m here until he gets home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d I start shaking my head frantically. Justin seems like a nice kid, but I\u2019m not sure I can deal with him for more than a few minutes without wanting to strangle him.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on! It\u2019s going to be a great time. If you\u2019re nice, I\u2019ll let you paint my nails. I even brought my own color,\u201d he says, pulling a bottle of black nail polish out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not painting your nails,\u201d I huff out, wondering why the hell he would be carrying it around with him in the first place.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you don\u2019t have to. I can do it myself.\u201d He shrugs, putting the bottle back in his pocket before bending down to pick up his bags.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay here,\u201d I repeat.</p> <p>\u201cHave you met my boss?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cHe is scary. If he calls and says, \u2018Justin, I need you to stay with Autumn until I get home,\u2019 I say, \u2018Okay, no problem, boss man.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but I think I\u2019m just as safe alone as I would be with you. Actually, I think I\u2019m better off on my own. If you\u2019re here, I have to worry about both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never judge, sweet cheeks. I was a sniper. I know how to kill someone with one finger, and I guarantee nothing will happen to you while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Wow, okay. Didn\u2019t see that coming. So I\u2019m probably safer with him, but I still don\u2019t want him here. \u201cI think I should call Kenton,\u201d I tell him, pulling out my cell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to ground,\u201d he singsongs.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt means he is unavailable until he\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you need to talk to him? What if I need to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency and he needs to get back here, there\u2019s a code,\u201d he says conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the code?\u201d I ask, watching as he pulls out a set of keys from his pocket, opening the front door.</p><p>\u201cNo way, sweet cheeks. You don\u2019t need to know the code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I put my hands on my hips, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell ya.\u201d He shrugs, stepping into the house, and as soon as he\u2019s inside, he turns, grabs my arm, and drags me with him. \u201cNow, boss man said I have to be on my best behavior and to not say anything stupid or try anything on you...unless I want to see what it feels like to be neutered. I thought that was taking things a little too far, but he didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d He smiles, walking into the living room to set his bags down. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m sorry to say you\u2019re going to have to keep your hands to yourself and control the urge to molest me.\u201d He flexes his arms, and I close my eyes and groan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to control myself,\u201d I say, opening my eyes, wondering if there is a way out of this. I\u2019m going to kill Kenton.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be appreciated. I wish things were different, but I like my balls just the way they are. Plus, I don\u2019t think you want to explain to my mom why I can\u2019t give her grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Maybe I should make a move on him to save the world from him reproducing. \u201cI need to go to bed,\u201d I tell him, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d He pulls out some kind of gaming console from his bag and sets it on the coffee table. Then he pulls out a controller and some wires, but what I don\u2019t see are clothes.</p><p>I watch him for a few minutes as he connects the system to the TV, and after he has everything hooked up, he sits down on the couch, pulls out a pair of headphones that have a mic, puts them on, and then turns on the game.</p><p>The second it loads, the loud sound of guns firing fills the room and men wearing camo appear on the screen. I look at the TV then at Justin and shake my head before leaving the room. I don\u2019t care if Kenton has gone to ground; I need to text him to let him know that I\u2019m going to kill him when he gets home. Then I need to go to bed. I go upstairs, pull out my phone, and send Kenton a text.</p><p>Me: I hope you make it home safely so I can kill you when you get here.</p><p>I press send then bite my lip, wondering if I should apologize. I know he has my best interest at heart, but I do not want a babysitter. I toss my phone on the bed, grab some clothes from the dresser, and make my way across the hall to shower. When I get back to my room, I go directly to my phone and press the button, seeing that I got a text back.</p><p>Kenton: Sweet dreams, baby.</p><p>That\u2019s it? He didn\u2019t even address my threat. I huff out a breath, shake my head, toss the phone onto the bed, and pick it right back up to send another text.</p><p>Me: Ditto.</p><p>I hit send then feel stupid, wondering if I should\u2019ve just left it alone.</p><p>I wake up in complete darkness for the second morning in a row. My first thought is Kenton. I miss not having him hold me. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible to miss sleeping with someone after only having it for a few nights, but I do. I stretch out and look at the clock. It\u2019s three thirty. I need to get up, send some e-mails, and pay a few bills before I have to get ready for work.</p><p>I got an e-mail back from Sid the other day, and I could tell even through e-mail that he was upset I hadn\u2019t called him. Link also told me that I should try not to have too much contact with anyone in Vegas. He\u2019s worried I could somehow be tracked. I think this is a little over the top, but what do I know?</p><p>I don\u2019t miss home as much as I thought I would. I really don\u2019t miss my old life at all. I know that Link can tell that I\u2019m thinking about moving to Tennessee. The last time I spoke with him, he told me that he would be willing to have my stuff packed up and sent out to me if that\u2019s what I want. The idea of making this my permanent home is exciting and scary. I just want to make the right choice.</p><p>I get out of bed and pull on a pair of sweats before opening my door. The first things I hear are explosions and yelling coming from the living room below. I slept for over eight hours, and I wonder if Justin sat downstairs playing that game the whole time. Then I wonder how the hell he\u2019s supposed to \u2018look out for me\u2019 when he probably wouldn\u2019t hear if someone were to break down the front door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI made coffee!\u201d Justin yells over the TV as soon as I make it to the bottom landing. I wonder how the hell he heard me when the stairs didn\u2019t even squeak. \u201cTold you\u2014you are safe with me,\u201d he teases loudly as soon as I finish my thought.</p><p>I shake my head and walk into the living room, seeing that the whole space is covered with food wrappers and open bottles of soda. I have no idea how he consumed so much food in such a short amount of time. I take a seat next to him on the couch, pull a bag of Doritos from the coffee table to my lap, shove my hand in the bag, pull out a handful, and stuff my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat game is this?\u201d I ask through a mouthful while watching a guy get his head blown off.</p><p>\u201cCall of Duty,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cThese f**kers are campin\u2019!\u201d he shouts into the mic while the guy on the screen looks around him, trying to find whoever is shooting at him.</p> <p>Before I know it, I\u2019m yelling at the TV every time Justin gets shot at. I get so lost in the game that I don\u2019t even realize how late it is until I look at the clock and see that it\u2019s already after eight at night and I haven\u2019t done anything with my day besides eat junk food and lie on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get ready for work,\u201d I tell Justin.</p><p>He grunts and nods. I get up and go to the office to get online. After I pay my bills, I check my e-mail, and the first one is from Sid.</p><p>Angel,</p><p>There is so much I should have told you, so many things I should have said. I want to hear your voice. Please call me. My number hasn\u2019t changed.</p> <p>XX Sid</p><p>I close my eyes and lay my forehead against the desk. I do not want to deal with this, but I know I need to let Sid know that there\u2019s nothing between us and never will be. I feel bad, but I know I\u2019ll feel worse if I let him believe even for a second that I felt anything for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I lift my head and look at Justin, who is standing in the open doorway of the office.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something,\u201d he says, coming in and setting a cup of coffee down on the desk in front of me as he takes a seat and raises an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I take a drink of the coffee and sigh with happiness.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he repeats, and I know there is no way he is going to let it go.</p><p>\u201cMy old boss sent me an e-mail and wants me to call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he says, leaning back in the chair.</p><p>\u201cI think he believes there\u2019s something between us,\u201d I say quietly, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cBoss man won\u2019t like that.\u201d He smiles, rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cKenton won\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ, sweet cheeks.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve known Kenton for a long time and have seen plenty of women come and go\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know this,\u201d I cut him off, feeling a ball of jealousy beginning to form in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know how many times I came to stay when Cassie was living here and Kenton went out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know how many times he asked the guys to swing by her job to check on her or any of the other women he\u2019s been with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeat again, that warm feeling settling in.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many women he\u2019s become possessive over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to all of the above is zero. You are the first woman to have him tied in f**king knots, and I know you\u2019re going to say it\u2019s because he\u2019s looking out for you, but I guaran-fucking-tee it that\u2019s not the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything else,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhy are all women the same?\u201d He shakes his head, running a hand through his long hair. \u201cWomen are always talking about how men are so afraid to commit when the truth is you guys send the most f**king confusing signals. One minute, you want us, and the next, you\u2019re running away.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow and he shakes his head again.</p><p>\u201cE-mail your boss and let him down easy. If you don\u2019t and Kenton finds out about him, he will let him know and won\u2019t be nice about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re blowing this out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d He smiles and gives a small, humorless laugh. \u201cKenton had one of his best friends by the throat for calling you a sweet piece a few days after they saw you at the hospital. It took three dudes to pull Kenton off him. I\u2019ve never seen him react like that over a female.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what to do with that information. I\u2019m not even sure I want to know what all of that means exactly.</p><p>Justin continues. \u201cAll I\u2019m sayin\u2019 is whether you want to be or not, you\u2019re his, and he won\u2019t like your ex-boss sniffing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you beat the game?\u201d I ask, trying to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou never beat Call of Duty.\u201d He smiles then looks out the window.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from him today?\u201d I ask softly, thinking about everything he just told me and really wanting to talk to Kenton. I want to know that he\u2019s okay. I really want him to know that I\u2019m thinking about him and miss sleeping with him.</p><p>\u201cNot after your text last night, though I\u2019m surprised he messaged you back. But that only proves my point\u2014you\u2019re the exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I sent him a text?\u201d I ask, surprised and slightly annoyed while ignoring everything else he just said.</p><p>\u201cHis phone goes thorough my computer. I get all his messages. It\u2019s easier than waiting for him to send me the info I need. In this business, a second can mean the difference between landing a case and getting hurt.\u201d He stands up and leans on the side of the desk.</p><p>I don\u2019t want him hurt, so I\u2019m glad they\u2019re taking every precaution necessary. Then I wonder what kind of texts Kenton gets daily where he needs that kind of precaution.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I whisper in horror when I realize that Justin probably saw my drunken texts to Kenton. \u201cDo you read all his personal messages?\u201d</p><p>He smiles and nods. \u201cYeah. The ones from his mom are the best.\u201d He starts to laugh, and I can only imagine the kinds of texts Nancy sends Kenton. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re something like, Did you eat your vegetables? Are you taking your vitamins? Do you have clean socks and underwear?</p><p>\u201cI like Nancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes you too,\u201d he says softly, making me wonder what he knows.</p><p>I look away and try to swallow the lump in my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go back out and finish my game while you send your e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I try to smile, but I know that it\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. I wiggle the mouse around until the screen lights back up and press reply on Sid\u2019s e-mail.</p><p>Sid,</p><p>I don\u2019t want you to think that I haven\u2019t appreciated you or your friendship over the last few years. I also don\u2019t want you to think that I don\u2019t care about you, but I don\u2019t think we have anything else to talk about.</p> <p>I wish you all the best,</p><p>Autumn</p><p>I press send and hope that he understands. I know he may think that he cares about me or wants a relationship with me, but I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to Sid\u2019s dating life over the last few years, and if he really wanted something serious with me, I doubt he would\u2019ve paraded all of those women in front of me.</p><p>I close down the computer and yell to Justin as I\u2019m passing the living room that I\u2019m going to get ready for work. He says something back that I don\u2019t really understand due to the loud sounds coming from the TV.</p><p>Kenton</p> <p>\u201cFuck, man. Good to see you,\u201d Link says as soon as he spots me when I exit the airport.</p><p>I pull him in for a one-armed hug and pat him on the back, and he does the same before we separate. He pops the trunk for his SUV. I toss my duffel bag in and then walk around and climb into the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here under different circumstances,\u201d he says, running a hand over his head and using the other to start up the car.</p><p>\u201cMe too, brother.\u201d I pull out my phone and see a message from Justin letting me know that he\u2019s at the house and Autumn is home safe from work. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be long before she messages me, telling me off about Justin being there.</p><p>\u201cThe police really wanted to call Autumn, but I told them she\u2019s in Europe and I would get a message to her as soon as possible,\u201d Link says.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I clip. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to know her place was broken into.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday, while I was still wrapped around her in bed, Justin called and woke me up to tell me that Link had been trying to get ahold of me to let me know that Autumn\u2019s condo had been broken into. I didn\u2019t want her to know what was going on, but I needed to see for myself if I could find out what had gone down and if the break-in had anything to do with the shooting at the club.</p><p>\u201cChances are the two things are completely separate. Someone probably noticed that her place has been empty for a while and wanted to see if they could find anything worth pawning,\u201d Link deduces.</p><p>Those are my thoughts too, but I\u2019m not going to chance it. I know the local PD is trying to find out what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re taking way too f**king long. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving this shit to chance. While I\u2019m here, I need to see the tapes from the night of the shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the club,\u201d he says, pulling onto the highway. \u201cSid\u2019s there tonight. He\u2019ll let you look them over. I figure you can sleep for a while, and then we can head to the club later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>We drive in silence for a few minutes, and I know that he\u2019s dying to ask about Autumn. I\u2019m just waiting for him to say something, hoping it doesn\u2019t piss me off when he does.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Autumn?\u201d</p><p>I smirk, looking over at him. \u201cA pain in my ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe got to you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d he asks softly, tapping his thumbs on the top of the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cShe\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thinkin\u2019 about movin\u2019 to Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I reply, feeling a hint of jealousy that she talked to Link about it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her, man. She\u2019s a good woman,\u201d he says.</p><p>I feel a growl start to vibrate my chest. I know there\u2019s never been anything between them, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t piss me right the f**k off that he feels like he can look out for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, hoping he gets it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she has a sadness inside her that she tries to fight, but it\u2019s so deep that she gets lost in it and has a hard time finding her way out. I know she freaks when she\u2019s tickled and has a hard time letting people in. I know she has a boy she lost, and the loss still haunts her. But I also know that she smells like flowers, loves to be held even if she denies it, is cute as f**k when she\u2019s angry, and is funny as hell when she lets down her walls. I may not know everything, but I know enough that I want to know more,\u201d I tell him, hoping he gets that this isn\u2019t some passing f**k to me.</p><p>I also hope that he understands that, yes, he may know more than I do, but she is mine to worry about now. I don\u2019t like explaining myself to people, but I want him to comprehend that she is not a conquest; she is mine, and I take looking out for her very seriously.</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s ready for me to know everything, she will open up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he replies, no sarcasm to be found in his tone.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Sid.\u201d I know that Autumn worked for him, but I don\u2019t know what kind of man he is or if he keeps his business on the up-and-up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good dude. I\u2019ve known him for the last five years. He\u2019s good to the girls at the club, always willing to help them out.\u201d He pauses and takes a breath. \u201cHe has a soft spot for Autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they had a relationship?\u201d I grit out.</p><p>\u201cAutumn doesn\u2019t date. Sid\u2019s been tryin\u2019 to get in there for years, but she hasn\u2019t ever clued in or returned any of his feelings.\u201d</p><p>That makes me feel somewhat better about meeting him, but it doesn\u2019t mean I want to sit back and have a beer with the guy. \u201cDo you think he was in on what went down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He wouldn\u2019t put anyone in that kind of danger. He knew three of the men who came into the club for the meeting, but the fourth was not someone he planned for. From what I understand, the fourth man was a guy by the name of Terry Waters. He was the owner of two of the largest strip clubs in Vegas. The police had been working on building a case against him for sex trafficking and prostitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I shake my head, wondering what the f**k to do with this information.</p><p>\u201cThey think he was the target,\u201d Link explains, and I see that his knuckles turning white on the steering wheel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo the rest were just casualties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>My phone beeps and I click my messages, seeing that it\u2019s from Autumn. I smile before I even read her message. I know she\u2019s pissed about Justin being there, but I want to make sure she\u2019s safe while I\u2019m out of town and don\u2019t want her at home alone. I don\u2019t think the shooter has any clue where she is, but I know that Cassie is still on a rampage. The good news is that, as soon as Cassie gets my message from Finn, she will no longer be an issue, but until things get sorted, I don\u2019t want her f**king with Autumn while I\u2019m gone, especially after I found out that she\u2019s the one who posted the video of Autumn on YouTube after they\u2019d been at the same club.</p><p>Am I pissed that Autumn was letting some guy do body shots off her? Hell yes, but I know she was completely smashed when it happened. I also acknowledge that she never had a chance to experience that kind of thing before. Do I wish it had been me licking salt off her tight, little body? Fuck yes, I do, but I know only me and my mouth will be allowed to touch her from now on.</p> <p>I look at the message from her and laugh before quickly replying. We pull up to Link\u2019s apartment and I realize that I\u2019m f**king beat from the last few days. Autumn\u2019s schedule has mine all f**ked up.</p><p>A few minutes later, I\u2019m already toeing off my boots, ready to collapse on his guest bed, when he tells me from the doorway, \u201cI have some shit to take care of, but I\u2019ll be back later, and we can head to the club then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, man. Thanks,\u201d I tell him. Then I listen as he walks down the hallway and shuts the front door. I pull out my phone, see that she replied with one word\u2014Ditto\u2014and smile and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSid, this is Kenton. Kenton, this is Sid,\u201d Link introduces us later that night.</p><p>I look Sid over, and the first thing I notice is how put together he is. I imagine that he spends more time getting ready than most women do. His suit is tailored, his hair is combed over to the side, each piece styled just right, and his fingernails even look manicured.</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d He sticks out his hand and I grasp it with one of mine, giving him a firm shake.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d I nod, looking around inside the club, understanding from the decor where it got the name The Lion\u2019s Den.</p><p>\u201cKenton needs to see the tapes from the night of the shooting,\u201d Link says, bringing me back to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou working with the police?\u201d Sid asks, looking me over.</p><p>\u201cKenton\u2019s the friend I was tellin\u2019 you about,\u201d Link informs him, and Sid\u2019s eyes come back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can find the shooter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d My main concern is Autumn and keeping her safe. I don\u2019t care about any of the other shit.</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>We walk down a long hall and into a dark office, where there is a large desk in the center of the room and large computer monitors lining one wall.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get the guy on tape. He avoided all the cameras in the building and the two outside.\u201d He starts up the tapes from the night of the shooting.</p><p>There are no shots of the man in question, but there are images of Autumn running through the club, and even through the grainy images, I can see the terror on her face. \u201cWhere were the bouncers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo were out front and one was at the door,\u201d Sid answers.</p><p>\u201cDid they see the shooter?\u201d I ask, looking at the different screens to pinpoint the security on duty.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head then looks at the screen paused on a picture of Autumn.</p> <p>\u201cHow did he get the drinks that were being delivered to the private party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something we haven\u2019t been able to figure out. The bar registered and filled the drink orders but never had them delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone who works for you was in on it?\u201d I ask, trying to get him to see that he can\u2019t trust anyone right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he says, running a hand down his face. \u201cI want to say I trust everyone who works for me, but unfortunately, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna need to talk to the other bouncers,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cBoth the guys who worked that night are on now. You can use my office,\u201d he offers.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I tell him before he heads out of the room to bring the guys back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Link asks.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you know the guys who were on that night?\u201d I ask instead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friendly, but not friends,\u201d Link says as I lean against the side of the desk, looking at the still image of Autumn.</p><p>I hate that she\u2019s involved in this shit. I don\u2019t like the idea of someone on the inside being involved in what went down. That means that they know who she is\u2014and possibly where she is.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that one of them has something to do with the shooter being a ghost. Have you told anyone where Autumn is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d Link shakes his head, his eyes coming back to me. \u201cI haven\u2019t even told Sid that information. He told me he e-mailed her and she wrote back, but she didn\u2019t let him know where she was.\u201d</p><p>That makes me feel marginally better, but I still don\u2019t like the idea of her being in contact with the guy. \u201cWhen the guys come in, we\u2019re going to play it cool. I\u2019m going to ask some questions about what went down and see if they have any leads for me. Most of the time, when someone is involved in something like this, they try to make up for their sins by overly playing the good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow your lead,\u201d Link says, and he does just that. He\u2019s the guys\u2019 source of familiarity and comfort.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for me to figure out that Mick is hiding something. After about twenty minutes, I thank them for their time and let them know that I will be around if they remember anything else. As soon as the office door closes, I look at Link, who shakes his head and closes his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna let Sid know we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you outside.\u201d I head out the front of the club and pull out my phone to send a quick text to Justin to let him know what\u2019s going on. With this new development, I\u2019m going to need his skills to pull up some info on Mick.</p><p>About an hour later, Link and I are in his home office, sorting through the information we obtained at the club, when I receive Justin\u2019s email.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Link asks, looking over my shoulder at the report Justin sent me on Mick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom what Justin was able to find, old Mickey-boy has been having money problems. He was three months behind on his rent, had about ten thousand dollars worth of credit card debt, and took a title loan out on his car in the amount of two thousand bucks. Two weeks before things went down at the club, he deposited thirty thousand dollars cash into his account. Did he say anything about hitting the lotto or winning at the casino?\u201d I spin the chair around and lean back.</p><p>\u201cNah, he never said anything like that,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cIf he had, would he brag about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMick?\u201d He nods. \u201cHell yes, he would brag about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like we need to have another talk with him.\u201d I shake my head and look up at the ceiling. After letting out a long sigh, I stand and we head out to Link\u2019s SUV.</p><p>We park across the street from Mick\u2019s place and wait for him to show up. About two hours after we arrive, he pulls into the driveway, and Mick and a stumbling blonde get out of his car and start heading inside. I get out of the truck and slam the door closed, and when Mick turns in my direction, even in the dark I can see his eyes widen when he spots me and Link walking across the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks, taking a step back towards his closed door.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, you\u2019re gonna need to call a cab,\u201d I tell the blonde.</p><p>She nods, pulls her phone out of her purse, and starts walking away without saying a word.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Mick repeats, watching his date walk to the end of his driveway.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you in.\u201d He looks at Link then back at me and swallows.</p><p>\u201cYou can either open the door and we\u2019ll talk about this shit inside, or you don\u2019t open the door and I call the cops, tell them what I know, and we can see what they think. What do you think they\u2019ll say when I tell them you deposited thirty grand cash into your account? Do you think they will wonder how a bouncer at a club was able to get that kind of dough?\u201d I ask, creeping closer to him, watching him swallow thickly again. \u201cLink, you\u2019re cool with the local PD, right?\u201d I ask, looking over my shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cI have a few friends on the force,\u201d he replies, pulling out his phone.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk inside,\u201d Mick mumbles, pulling out his key and opening the door.</p> <p>As soon as we get inside, I notice that everything is new, from his couch to his kitchen appliances.</p><p>\u201cNice place,\u201d Link voices loud enough for me to hear.</p><p>\u201cCan we get this over with?\u201d Mick says, walking into the kitchen. He grabs a beer from the fridge, holds one out to me, and then offers one towards Link.</p><p>I shake my head, and Link does the same.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about how you got thirty thousand dollars,\u201d I say to start.</p><p>\u201cI won at the casino.\u201d He shrugs, looking away.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lie to me.\u201d I take a step towards him while blocking the kitchen exit. \u201cNow tell me how you got the thirty grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d He retreats as I take another step towards him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, man.\u201d His head drops forward, his hand going through his hair. \u201cThese dudes are f**king scary... A lot f**king scarier than you. They\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. They will, but they\u2019ll probably do that anyways.\u201d I lean back slightly and pull out my phone from my back pocket so I can bring up the message from Justin. \u201cThe men you\u2019re protecting are part of Lacamo, one of the biggest crime families in the United States. You mean nothing to them.\u201d I show him the email with a sketch of the suspect along with a picture of one of the most notorious Mob hit men, who matches the sketch perfectly. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you have no real understanding of what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\u201d His face pales as he looks over the pictures.</p><p>\u201cHave you told them about Autumn?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, but his eyes don\u2019t come back to me. Fury fills my veins as I realize the kind of danger my woman\u2019s in now.</p><p>\u201cYou piece of shit,\u201d I growl, shoving him into the counter. My hand goes around his neck and I can feel his pulse beating against my fingertips. I know that, if I squeeze his throat a little tighter, one less ass**le will be breathing. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me exactly what you told them and how you get in contact with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only told them her name,\u201d he chokes out, my hand going tighter. \u201cI never told them anything else about her, I swear.\u201d His nails claw against my hand and his feet skid against the floor, trying to get leverage.</p><p>Link\u2019s hand on my arm is the only thing that stops me from killing the f**ker where we stand. I take a step back while shoving him away. I run a hand through my hair, trying to compose myself enough to think of my next move.</p><p>\u201cCall in your friend from the local PD and tell them to pick up this piece of shit,\u201d I say, looking over at Link.</p><p>\u201cI told you what you wanted to know. Please don\u2019t call the cops,\u201d Mick whines.</p><p>I turn my head in his direction and he lowers his eyes. \u201cAs much as I want to leave you here and let you get what you deserve, you may be the only one who can stop these sick f**ks, so that means I need to keep your punk ass safe until this shit\u2019s taken care of.\u201d I scrub a hand over my mouth as Link makes a call to his friend.</p><p>It takes two hours to get everything settled with the cops and Mick to be taken into custody. When we leave the local precinct, we make a plan to go to Autumn\u2019s condo to have a look around. Once inside, I can tell that the person who broke in wasn\u2019t looking for shit to pawn. Everything that has any value is still here. The only things gone through are papers, which tells me that whoever broke in was looking for information.</p><p>\u201cNothing here will point them to Tennessee,\u201d Link says, shoving a stack of papers into the desk.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but she needs to change her number and stop using her e-mail. I don\u2019t want whoever this is to have any way to track her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell her what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d I look around again before walking over and opening her balcony door.</p><p>The sun is just starting to set over the mountains, causing an orange-and-red glow to fill the horizon. After taking a seat in one of her deck chairs, I pull out my phone and send a text to Justin, telling him the latest development. Then I send a message to Autumn, letting her know what time my flight would arrive so she would be dressed and ready to go out. I also tell her to make sure to wear the red lipstick she wore to the club. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just thinking about how she looked that night causes my c**k to jump. I need to see how f**king long it would take to kiss that red off her mouth. Looking out at the sunset again, I can\u2019t help but smile. I\u2019m not buying a new bed for my room until she\u2019s willing to help me pick it out and share it with me. Until I can convince her to move into my room, we will be staying in hers. I look down at my phone when it beeps.</p><p>Justin: Autumn is safe in bed. I\u2019m running a cross-check on the names you sent. As soon as I know anything, I\u2019ll send you the info.</p><p>I know Justin is a good kid, but I still hate that he\u2019s there with her right now instead of me, even if I\u2019m the one who ordered him to. I beat back the jealousy I feel and focus on what I need to do next.</p><p>Me: I get back tomorrow. Cancel all her e-mails/accounts and change her number. Now.</p> <p>Justin: Already on it.</p><p>I look over my shoulder when I hear Link come out. I know he\u2019s gonna want to know my next move, but until I get more info, my hands are tied.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d he asks, taking a seat across from me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lean back, closing my eyes. \u201cI need to make a few calls and see if I can get some info from a friend of mine before I head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t envy you right now, man,\u201d Link says.</p> <p>I open one eye, look at him, and smirk. A pissed-off Autumn is a thing of beauty, and she\u2019s going to be riled as hell when I get home.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>A Whole Lotta Like...</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s my phone off and my e-mail not working?\u201d I yell as I stomp into the living room, where Justin is still playing Call of Duty. I don\u2019t know how I know, but I know he has something to do with it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to wait to talk to boss man,\u201d he mumbles, never taking his eyes off the TV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you, so tell me why my phone is off, I no longer have an e-mail, and even my Facebook is gone...and I haven\u2019t gotten on that thing in over eight months!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout that\u2014you are not very photogenic. I think you should take some classes or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you frigging serious right now?\u201d I pick up one of the throw pillows off the couch and start hitting him over the head with it.</p><p>\u201cStop! You\u2019re making me lose the game!\u201d He grabs the pillow out of my hand, tossing it across the room.</p><p>I start to run for it but then turn to see that he\u2019s not even moving from his spot on the couch. My eyes travel from him to the TV then his Xbox.</p><p>\u201cYou better not,\u201d he says, standing.</p><p>I lunge for the game system, ready to rip it out of the wall, when I\u2019m tackled, but somehow, Justin flips us, taking the brunt of the landing, making me land on top of him, my thighs on either side of his waist. I reach for the pillow on the floor next to me and start to lift it above my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and press my lips together when I hear Kenton\u2019s voice, and when I open my eyes, I glare at Justin before standing up and facing the door of the living room. I fight the urge to run to him when our eyes lock. I\u2019ve missed him these last few days, and he looks even hotter than normal with the extra scruff darkening his jaw, making it appear squarer.</p> <p>\u201cI asked a f**king question. What the f**k is going on?\u201d he asks, taking his eyes off me, pinning Justin with a ferocious scowl.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest and glare first at Kenton and then at Justin, who glares back at me as he goes to stand next to his boss.</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s crazy,\u201d Justin mumbles to him loud enough for me to hear.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shut up,\u201d he retorts immaturely.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shut up,\u201d I repeat, taking a step towards Kenton.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what the f**k?!\u201d Kenton shouts, making me jump back.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s my phone disconnected along with my e-mail and Facebook?\u201d I ask, directing my haughtiness at Kenton this time.</p><p>He looks at me for a long moment before his head drops forward, his hand going to the back of his neck. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he says, lifting his head, looking me over. Then his eyes go to Justin. \u201cThanks for helpin\u2019 out,\u201d he says begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cNo prob, boss,\u201d Justin says and starts to gather all of his stuff up, shoving it all back into the same bag he showed up here with.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished packing everything, Kenton walks him to the door, where they have a quiet conversation before Kenton pats him on the back and opens the door.</p><p>\u201cSee ya around, Copper,\u201d Justin says over his shoulder.</p><p>I give him a wave, and he smiles before heading out of the house, the front door closing behind him.</p><p>As soon as Kenton faces me again, his eyes turn dark and his jaw starts to tick. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d I stutter, looking at his clenched fists and the pulse of his neck, which is beating rapidly.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he repeats, the tone of his voice making me freeze in place.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I haven\u2019t seen or touched you in days and need to reassure myself that you\u2019re good. Second, I need your help getting the image of what I just saw out of my head.\u201d</p><p>His words have my feet moving before my brain even has a chance to catch up. I do a face-plant into his chest, wrapping my arms around his waist and breathing him in. Every breath I take eases some of the anxiety I didn\u2019t even know I was feeling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I whisper into his chest. His muscles tense and I\u2019m not sure I want to know anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down.\u201d He takes my hand in his and leads me to the couch, where he tugs me down into his lap. \u201cYour place in Vegas was broken into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhat was taken?\u201d I don\u2019t really have anything of value, so I\u2019m not too worried, but it still doesn\u2019t feel good knowing that someone broke in.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he says, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask, searching his face.</p><p>\u201cFound out that Mick was the inside source at the club the night of the shooting.\u201d He runs a hand down my back. \u201cHe told them who you are, and we\u2019re guessing it was them who broke into your place.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to believe that Mick was involved in what happened, especially because he and Tessa were sleeping together, but I\u2019m not really surprised. Mick is a self-centered ass**le who doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, so what do we do now?\u201d I wonder out loud. I can\u2019t think of anything I left behind that would lead anyone here, but I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>His eyebrows come together in confusion and his hand travels to the back of my neck then up into my hair, fisting it. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply, feeling my own eyebrows pull together, wondering why I should cry.</p><p>\u201cWarrior,\u201d he says quietly, his eyes going soft, making my heart pound a little harder. \u201cI have a guy who\u2019s connected to the organization that planned the hit. I sent him a message and am just waiting for him to get back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure, but I doubt they want the kind of publicity they\u2019ll create if they try to send their guy after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they care about publicity if they are who you say they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in control of half of Vegas. They may be Mob, but even they have an image to uphold,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cThey killed innocent people,\u201d I remind him on a whisper. The thought of people like that caring what others think about them is laughable.</p><p>\u201cThey planned the hit, but their hands are clean.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>I look into his eyes and see an understanding that confuses me, and I wonder if he\u2019s ever used that excuse. I lift my hand and run it along the roughness of his jaw. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask him, seeing the weariness around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll be even better when this shit\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>I hear the tiredness in his voice and wonder how much sleep he\u2019s gotten since he left. I push my fingers through his hair and his eyes start to close at the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a nap,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cWe can figure out everything else later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna take one with me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Without thinking, I nod and he maneuvers me so that I\u2019m straddling him. My breath leaves on a whoosh, my hands go to his shoulders, and his go to my ass. Our mouths are so close that I feel each of his breaths against my lips. I expect him to kiss me, but instead, he stands up off the couch. My legs wrap around his waist and I bite my lip when I feel the hard length of his arousal against my core through the thin material of my shorts.</p><p>When we reach my room, he pushes open the door and gently lays me on the bed before stepping back and taking off his boots and shirt. I watch, mesmerized, as his arm and abs flex when his fingers go to the button of his jeans and he pulls them down. I can see his hard-on outlined through his boxers, and my eyes travel up his body to his eyes, which look sleepy. I scoot back in the bed as he shuts off the light, and I feel the bed compress and his weight hit my side.</p><p>I try to ignore the ache between my legs as I lie on my back with his arm around my waist, his breath hitting my neck and his thigh over my legs. I try to calm down, but his hand lifts my shirt and my muscles clench. I expect him to grab my breast or touch me sexually, but he surprises me yet again when his hand just lies against my skin. All of my nerve endings are tingling in anticipation, and then I hear his light snore. My body relaxes and I take a deep breath, letting it out slowly before drifting off to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWake up, baby.\u201d</p><p>I feel a featherlight touch travel down the side of my face. My eyes flutter open and connect with Kenton\u2019s. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, blinking against the light coming in from the now open blinds in the room.</p><p>His fingers run down the underside of my jaw then up along my ear. \u201cYou sleep okay when I was gone?\u201d he asks, his eyes focused on his fingers traveling over my skin.</p><p>I think about lying and telling him that I slept great and didn\u2019t miss him at all, but something about the moment has me blurting out the truth. \u201cI missed sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His eyes search my face as I nod and close my eyes, feeling too exposed. \u201cI slept like shit.\u201d His words make my eyes open and search his face. \u201cHated that I couldn\u2019t be here to look out for you and Justin was doing my job. I didn\u2019t like that another man was in the house with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I start to tell him that I would never even think about Justin like that, but his finger covers my lips and his head lowers towards mine.</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t. I still didn\u2019t like it.\u201d He takes away his finger and lowers his face towards mine.</p><p>The first touch of his lips is soft, and my eyes flutter closed as his hand runs along my jaw to the back of my neck. I whimper when his tongue runs along my bottom lip before nipping it with his teeth. My hands find their way into his hair so I can hold him to me. His hips shift and his hand at my hair travels down along my side then up and under the shirt I\u2019m wearing, settling just below my breast.</p><p>As his mouth devours mine, I pull my mouth from his, pressing my head back into the pillow, lifting my chest, trying to get his hand to move. His thumb sweeps over my nipple; the slight contact has me moaning loudly.</p><p>\u201cI need to see you,\u201d he rumbles, pulling away. His hands go to the hem of the shirt, pulling it off over my head and tossing it to the floor behind him.</p><p>I start to cover myself, but his hands capture mine and tug them above my head. His eyes travel down my body, and when they come back to mine, the dark hunger I see makes me hold my breath. His mouth lowers towards mine again, his tongue plunging between my lips, not giving me a choice but to kiss him back. When his mouth leaves mine, traveling down my neck, he sucks my collarbone, causing my hips to lift and my chest to rise higher. His mouth starts a slow trek around my breast before I feel warm, wet heat cover my nipple. My body arches off the bed, and one of his hands leaves mine above my head and travels down to cup my other breast, his fingers rolling over my nipple, causing a moan to climb up my throat.</p><p>My hand goes to his shoulder, holding on as his hand navigates down over my stomach, causing my muscles to contract and wetness to gather between my thighs. The first feeling of his fingers along my pubic bone has me panicking, but want quickly takes over as one slides under the edge of my shorts and panties and then down to roll over my clit.</p><p>\u201cSoaked,\u201d he growls, his head lifting and his eyes locking on mine.</p><p>His finger lowers, entering me slowly as his eyes watch me closely. I don\u2019t know whether to pull away or to lift my hips for more. When his hand leaves me, I cry out, only to be startled when I feel my panties and shorts being tugged off. Before I have a chance to think, his fingers are back and he adds his thumb, rolling it over the bundle of nerves that has me clawing at his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI really want to f**king taste you, but no way can I do that yet.\u201d His jaw locks and a look of desperation fills his eyes. \u201cMy control is slipping, so I need you to come for me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong, but as if he spoke directly to my body, I come on a cry, my head falling back and my eyes closing. The pull from below my belly button expands and explodes through my body. When the feeling subsides, I lift my head, still trying to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cFucking exquisite,\u201d he whispers, his eyes meeting mine, his fingers still lazily stroking between my legs.</p><p>I bite my lip, wondering what to do. I have never experienced anything like that before, and it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had sex.

I could see it in your eyes that you were unsure.\u201d He kisses my forehead and rolls to his side, pulling me with him. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d he asks softly, gliding his fingers down my spine then back up again.</p><p>\u201cA little over ten years.\u201d I close my eyes in embarrassment and only open them when I realize that not only is his body tense, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be breathing. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I get up on my elbow so I can look at his face.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters as his eyes open. \u201cHow the hell have you kept yourself away from men for the last ten years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard when you\u2019re not interested,\u201d I answer truthfully, looking away from him.</p><p>\u201cUntil me.\u201d</p><p>I hear the smugness in his voice and my eyes go back to him, narrowing when I see the smirk on his face. \u201cMy tastes could always change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d he says confidently.</p><p>\u201cThey might,\u201d I huff, and his smirk turns into a full smile as he rolls on top of me.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d he repeats, this time kissing me silent.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going out,\u201d Kenton says as soon as I walk around the corner into the kitchen.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a dark-burgundy button-down shirt that looks like it\u2019s custom-made for him. With the top button released, the shirt is tucked into a pair of black slacks that hug his thighs and show off his lean waist. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible for him to look just as hot dressed up as he does in jeans. Seeing him like this has me craving to see him in a suit.</p><p>His eyes do a head-to-toe sweep, and I stumble slightly when our eyes lock. The look in his eyes is so dark and hungry that I can\u2019t even take a breath. After he kissed me quiet earlier, he got out of bed and got dressed, telling me that he had some stuff to do, but we had a date and to make sure I was ready. I nodded, unable to talk, and watched as he left the room.</p><p>I got up, made some coffee, and ate a piece of toast before heading back upstairs to get ready for my first date. I took an extra-long shower, making sure I shaved everything from the neck down and scrubbed every inch of my body. I chose a dark-blue wrap dress that hugs my curves and shows some cle**age without being slutty. The shoes are what completes the outfit\u2014gold stilettos with a strap across the tops of my toes and a thick band around my ankle. I did my makeup the same way I\u2019d done the night I went to the club\u2014simple with dark-red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really testing my self-control.\u201d Kenton\u2019s rough voice brings me back to the present\u2014along with his hands, which have found their way to my waist. \u201cBut then, if I don\u2019t take you out, I can\u2019t show you off.\u201d One hand slowly slides up my waist to the bow that is holding my dress together. \u201cYou\u2019re like a dessert I get to unwrap and eat at the end of the night.\u201d His fingers wrap around the loose length of the ribbon, giving it a gentle tug. \u201cLet\u2019s go before I say f**k it and unwrap you here in the kitchen and take you on the counter.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not opposed to skipping dinner and being dessert now. After what happened earlier, I know I won\u2019t put off being with him.</p><p>He smiles like he read my mind and shakes his head. \u201cDinner, then dessert.\u201d</p><p>My pu**y contracts and I bite my lip to stop from moaning. He leans forward, his finger going to my chin, pulling my lip out from between my teeth, kissing me softly.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind skipping dinner,\u201d I tell him when his mouth leaves mine.</p><p>He laughs, shaking his head and taking my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re both gonna need our strength.\u201d He walks us out to his car, opening the passenger\u2019s side door for me before shutting it and jogging around the car to slide behind the wheel. As soon as we make it down the driveway, his hand interlocks with mine on my lap.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d I ask once I find my voice again.</p><p>\u201cAn Italian place a couple of towns over. They have the best eggplant parmesan I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Italian,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiles, squeezing my fingers.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those frozen dinners you bought are Italian.\u201d He laughs, making me smile and my cheeks heat up in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at cooking.\u201d I shake my head and look out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can teach you how to cook,\u201d he says softly, squeezing my hand.</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d I\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to cook, but every time I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s been a disaster, so I\u2019ve given up.</p><p>We talk the rest of the way to the restaurant about his favorite things to cook and how he learned. I knew that his aunt Viv and uncle own the diner I had gone to the first time I met Viv, but I didn\u2019t know that he used to work there during the summers when he was younger.</p><p>When we arrive at the restaurant, he finds parking along the busy street and leads me inside. The interior is dim, with mood lighting that makes the space feel much more intimate. The tables are covered in white linen cloths with a single tea light candle in the center of each. The host leads us to a small table in the back of the restaurant, but when he begins to pull out my chair, Kenton stops him, taking the chair and holding it for me until I take a seat. He then takes his own seat across from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like to see the wine list?\u201d the waitress asks when she arrives at our table.</p><p>I look up at her and see that her eyes are glued to Kenton. I know that, if we\u2019re going to try and build something lasting between us, I need to get a hold on the jealousy I feel when other women admire him, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a glass of wine, baby?\u201d</p><p>My eyes travel from the waitress to Kenton, and I shake my head. I don\u2019t want anything tainting tonight.</p> <p>His eyes darken with approval and never leave mine as he answers the waitress. \u201cJust water for now.\u201d</p><p>She nods and leaves us to look over the menus.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re going to have?\u201d he asks after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Everything looks so good,\u201d I tell him, my mouth watering in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cEverything here is delicious. My parents used to bring me and Toni here when we were growing up.\u201d</p> <p>My throat clogs at the happy memory of him and his family. A wave of sadness hits me over the fact that I have none to share with him.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, baby. We\u2019re here together.\u201d He takes my hand in his, some of his strength seeping into me through our connection.</p><p>I look into his eyes and nod as he brings my fingers to his mouth, pressing a kiss to them. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say after a few seconds.</p><p>He nods but doesn\u2019t release my hand. Even when the waitress comes back to the table to take our order, he still holds on to me but changes the subject. We talk about my job and the request I put in to change shifts; we also talk about Justin and how he started working for him.</p><p>He keeps the conversation away from family and anything else he thinks might have me retreating. I know what he\u2019s doing, and I appreciate it more than he knows. During dinner, I realize that he has a way of reading me that no one else ever had. That in itself tells me everything I need to know about being with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for dessert?\u201d the waitress asks when she arrives back at our table after clearing our empty dishes.</p> <p>I squirm, remembering what he said to me in the kitchen about being dessert when we got home. His eyes flare and his tongue comes out, running along his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kenton replies, his eyes on mine. \u201cYou ready for dessert, baby?\u201d</p><p>I know his question isn\u2019t about food, and I squeeze my legs together and nod.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a piece of tiramisu to go, please.\u201d He pulls out his wallet, handing her his card.</p><p>After he gets his card back along with a dessert box, we get back into his car, and the lust is so thick that I swear I can taste it as he pulls out into traffic. His hand goes to my knee then travels up my thigh and under the hem of my dress. When I feel his finger slide over my core, I gasp.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you sat across from me the whole time like that?\u201d he growls, his finger running down my bare center again.</p><p>\u201cKenton,\u201d I cry when his finger circles my clit.</p><p>\u201cJesus, baby.\u201d His fingers circle my entrance then travel up to run around my clit, keeping me on the edge of the orgasm I feel building, torturing me. I grab his wrist, trying to pull it away. His arm flexes and his hand cups me over my pu**y. \u201cThis is mine. I get to play with it any time I want, any way I want to.\u201d</p> <p>His words have me panting. I turn my head to look at his profile and his eyes come to me. The want and determination I see has me removing my hands from his wrist, sitting back, and spreading my legs slightly.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He keeps up the same pace and movements, and this time when I feel the orgasm building again, I expect him to pull away like he\u2019s been doing. Instead, two fingers swiftly enter me and I lift my hips higher, meeting his hand. His fingers curve and I come; my head rolls against the headrest and my legs squeeze his hand, which is lodged between my legs.</p><p>I wonder how he\u2019s able to drive while controlling my body. I look back over at him once I come back down from the high of my orgasm. I have no idea what happened to my inhibitions, but he makes me want to give myself to him, makes me want to please him. I watch as his fingers leave me and he slowly puts them in his mouth. His eyes close like I\u2019m the best thing he\u2019s ever tasted before coming to me for a second then going back to the road again.</p><p>\u201cYes. That pu**y is mine.\u201d</p><p>I press my legs together and pray that we make it to the house without me climbing into his lap and causing an accident. When we pull onto the dirt road that leads to the house, I sigh in relief and hear him hiss out a breath when I lean over and wrap my hand around his cock, feeling it throb against my palm.</p><p>\u201cSo is this mine then?\u201d I ask teasingly.</p><p>The car comes to a stop, and he looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m yours. All of me is yours.\u201d</p><p>His words hit my chest and the look in his eyes makes the last of the barricades around my heart crumble into dust. I swallow and lick my bottom lip, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes close and his forehead touches mine. \u201cThat makes me a very happy man.\u201d His hand moves to the underside of my jaw, tilting my head to the side, and his mouth slants over mine, taking it in a deep kiss before tearing away. \u201cInside. Now.\u201d</p><p>His door opens and I fumble with my seatbelt, getting it unhooked right as my door is opened. I\u2019m out of the car in a heartbeat, and we rush up the stairs. My mouth goes to his neck as he fumbles with the keys, trying to get the door open. Once inside, he shoves me against the wall, his hands going to the tie on my dress. I expect him to rip it apart. Instead, he drops to his knees, his eyes locking on mine as he slowly pulls the ribbon, causing the dress to fall open, exposing one side of my body.</p><p>His fingers move to the small button on the inside of the dress, undoing it quickly, making the dress open completely. He looks me over then pulls the dress off my arms, letting it drop to the floor, leaving me in nothing but my sheer bra and heels.</p><p>\u201cBest gift I\u2019ve ever unwrapped,\u201d he mumbles, running his hands along my sides then to my ass, pulling my hips forward to kiss me above my pubic bone.</p><p>I start to pant as I watch his tongue come out and lick up my center. My head falls back as his hand lifts my leg over his shoulder. My hands go to his head for leverage as he shoves his face between my legs, his mouth sucking my clit before releasing and licking it in fast strokes.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I breathe as two fingers enter me and my body starts to shake. My one heel on solid ground makes me teeter. \u201cWait,\u201d I cry, feeling myself start to fall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth never leaves me as he quickly maneuvers my other thigh onto his other shoulder, my back and him the only things keeping me from hitting the floor. His mouth takes me hard, sucking and licking until I explode. My hands fist into his hair, holding on for dear life as I fly into the abyss of a mind-shattering orgasm.</p><p>When I come to, we\u2019re heading up the stairs. My head is on his shoulder and his hands are under my ass, holding me to him. He opens the door to my room and lays me on the bed. I quickly take off my shoes before lying back on the bed so, just like earlier today, I can watch him undress. The only difference is that, this time when he gets to his pants and unbuttons them, he pulls them and his boxers down at the same time. I hold my breath when I see his size. He\u2019s long and wide, and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to fit inside me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be tight, but we\u2019ll make it work.\u201d The familiar words and the smile on his face cause me to smile and my body to relax.</p><p>My eyes roam from his eyes down his body, watching as he strokes himself. He walks slowly to me, his muscles flexing with each step. I scoot back up the bed as he crawls to me, his legs spreading my hips wide.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous, baby.\u201d</p><p>His body covers mine, his hands going behind my back, where I feel him unhook my bra then drag it down my shoulders. Once my br**sts are free, he lowers his head and pulls first one nipple into his mouth and then the other. I writhe under him, running my hands down his back to his ass, trying to pull him closer. I can feel more wetness surge between my legs as he torments my br**sts. I grab his hair in my hands and pull his mouth away.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>His eyes grow even darker and his fingers slip between my legs again. His hand leaves me, but then I feel the head of him at my entrance as he slowly starts to enter me, Then he stops, his body suddenly going still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I gasp, adjusting to his width.</p><p>\u201cCondom... We need a condom.\u201d</p><p>His words sound pained, and I search his face before deciding what to say. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill. I\u2019ve been on the pill since I was seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he clips, making me jump and wonder if I said something wrong. \u201cI\u2019m clean, baby, but I want to make sure you\u2019re really okay with this.\u201d Both of his hands go to my hair, pushing it away from my face, his eyes looking me over.</p><p>\u201cI want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he groans.</p><p>One of his hands goes to the underside of my thigh, lifting it up higher around his waist while slowly sinking into me. I breathe out against the slight pain, trying instead to concentrate on how good it feels. He starts to move in slow, steady strokes, his lips never leaving mine. I lift my hips higher, wrapping myself completely around him, needing to be as close as possible.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect. Your pu**y is so f**king perfect,\u201d he says as he slides out only to slide back in, making me moan. Our skin starts to slicken with sweat, causing his body to slide smoothly against mine. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be able to hold off,\u201d he says, pulling his mouth from mine and pressing his forehead into my collarbone.</p><p>I feel right on the edge as his fingers roll over my clit. I want to come, but I\u2019m so consumed by every other emotion I\u2019m feeling that I can\u2019t let go. Instead, I concentrate on the way my body\u2019s feeling. I hold him closer, just enjoying the closeness of the moment and how connected I feel to him. His hips jerk, and I feel him grow even bigger before he groans, his mouth latching on to my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come,\u201d he breathes against my skin after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say softly, running a hand down his back. \u201cIt was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Great\u2019?\u201d He chuckles, pulling his face out of my neck. When he looks down at me, he shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna work for me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even get a chance to ask him what he\u2019s talking about before he picks me up out of bed and walks us to his room, straight into his bathroom, where he starts up the shower, pushing me inside before following me in. He pulls me under the water, tilting my face back. His fingers work through my hair. When his hands leave me, I open my eyes, watching as he grabs a large sponge off the shelf. Then he pours some body wash onto it, lathering it up, causing the room to smell like him.</p><p>He gently washes me, paying close attention between my legs, where I can still feel him. When he\u2019s done, he washes himself before tossing the sponge to the shower floor. I think he\u2019s going to get out, but instead, he moves us under the rain coming from the showerhead on the ceiling so that hot, steamy water falls down on us. Then he pulls me to him, my back to his front.</p><p>His hands start at my shoulders, rubbing in slow circles, then travel down my arms to my hands, where he pulls them up and behind his head. His fingers run down the inside of my arms, over the tips of my br**sts, down my stomach, and over my hips. One hand moves to my center, rolling over my clit, and the other slides back up to my br**sts, alternately toying with my ni**les. My whole body relaxes into him, just enjoying his touch.</p> <p>\u201cI love touching you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>The word \u2018love\u2019 makes my stomach flutter. I know I\u2019m on the edge of love with him, and it won\u2019t take much to push me over.</p><p>\u201cFeel what you do to me?\u201d He licks my neck, his hips shift, and his c**k slides between my legs from behind.</p><p>I lower my hand to where his is playing with me, and I feel the head of his c**k near my clit. He pulls his hips back and forth again, and I feel him in my hand every time he moves forward.</p><p>\u201cI need to be inside you, baby.\u201d His words sound pained as his hand moves mine out of the way, and on the next thrust forward, he enters me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cThis time, you\u2019re gonna come with me inside you.\u201d He runs his chin up my neck, the scruff on his jaw causing goose bumps to break out on my skin.</p><p>One hand cups my breast, first softly. Then it pinches and pulls my nipple as his other hand slowly moves between my legs. My pu**y tightens when his fingers tug my nipple hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck. You like that?\u201d He does it again, getting the same reaction.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long to feel the knot in my lower stomach start to unravel. I lean forward, putting my hands on the tile wall in front of me. One of his hands slides around my waist, hitting my clit, and the other goes to my nipple, pinching it. My orgasm is sudden and all consuming. His name leaves my mouth on a cry, and in the distance, I hear mine roared as I float away into euphoria. When I come back to myself, I\u2019m sitting in his lap in the middle of the shower, my face in the crook of his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lift my head and look up into his eyes, giving him a tired smile. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d I run my fingers along his jaw then up and around his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d His tone is soft, along with his eyes, and I shake my head at his smugness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in like with you,\u201d I tell him, getting lost in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His eyebrow rises and he kisses my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m in a whole lotta like with you too, baby,\u201d he says softly, pulling my head back down to his chest.</p> <p>We sit there for a few more minutes before he stands us up, quickly rinses us off before turning off the shower, and then pulls a large towel out of the cabinet to wrap around me, getting one for himself off the hook on the back of the door. I watch as he dries his body, my mouth going dry as a tingle begins stirring in my core again.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d</p><p>I jump and quickly look away at his words, feeling my cheeks pinken as I start to dry myself off. Hearing him laugh, I turn my head, looking over my shoulder.</p><p>His eyes drop to my ass and he shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long night,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I look down at his hard-on before lifting my eyes to his again.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t wrong; it was a very long night.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>It\u2019s Not Past Tense</p><p>I wake up when I feel lips touch my shoulder, a hand slide around my waist, and warmth hit my back. I smile into my pillow then roll over to face Kenton.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d He pulls me up his body so I\u2019m lying on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d I laugh, cuddling into him while breathing in his scent.</p> <p>It\u2019s been three weeks of us being an \u2018us.\u2019 At first, it was difficult living together plus being in a new relationship, but things have seem to have fallen into place. He\u2019s still an ass every now and then, but he\u2019s my ass.</p><p>The day after our first date, Kenton woke me up early, dragging me out of the bed and into the shower, where he proceeded to make love to me before telling me to get dressed because we had to go shopping. I got dressed in a pair of shorts and a light T-shirt before meeting him downstairs. I was exhausted, a little sore from being kept up the night before, and in no mood to go shopping, but he seemed so excited about it that I couldn\u2019t exactly tell him that I hated shopping and to go alone.</p><p>When we got in his car, we headed to Nashville. I\u2019d expected him to take us to the mall, but instead, he took us to a large furniture store.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d I asked, looking at the store in front of us then over at him.</p><p>\u201cI need a new bed,\u201d he said, hopping out of the car.</p><p>My heart fell into my stomach. We had just had sex for the first time yesterday, and he was buying a new bed to leave mine already? I waited until he opened the door for me to get out. I wanted to claw his eyes out of his head for being such an ass, but instead, I swallowed down the hurt I was feeling, determined to find some other way to get back at him.</p><p>He took my hand in his, leading me inside the furniture store. A man in his mid-thirties with a bad comb-over and an even worse suit greeted us as soon as we entered the store. I looked around, trying to clear my head as Kenton and the guy spoke quietly.</p><p>When Kenton grabbed my hand, twining his fingers with mine, I was admiring a king-size bed with a canopy top. The set also came with beautiful side tables that were round in the middle with thin legs that curved out and a dresser and armoire that were similar. All the wood was dark with notches in it, making it look like it had just been chopped down in the forest. I could imagine a princess sleeping in that bed amongst the furniture.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like this one?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked over at him then back at the bed. I could see him in it as well. The ruggedness of the wood was manly enough that the whimsical element to the design was toned down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice,\u201d I said softly, not knowing how I felt about picking out a bed that would basically guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t be sleeping with me anymore.</p><p>\u201cIs it something you would buy for your own room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him truthfully.</p><p>\u201cRalph, we\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>Ralph nodded and we followed him to the register, where he rang up the order. The whole set was over six thousand dollars, and Kenton pulled out his wallet, pulling out a shiny black card and handing it over to Ralph without even an ounce of regret on his face. When we were done, Ralph told us that he would have it delivered this afternoon.</p><p>When we left the furniture store, I thought for sure we would head home, but he drove us to a bedding and home goods store, leading me inside and right to the bedding department, telling me to pick something.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018pick something\u2019? It\u2019s your bed. You pick something,\u201d I told him, crossing my arms over my chest in order to not punch him in the gut. My feelings were hurt. All I wanted to do was go home. I knew it was dumb, but that didn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t feel like crying about it.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d he said, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>I bit my lip, looked around at every bedding set, and one caught my eye. It was white with a large design of a tree on it, and it had a green border that was made out of silk ribbon. I knew it would look amazing with his new bedroom furniture, but I also thought it was too feminine for a guy\u2019s room. I walked over to the wall of blankets, grabbed a Bed in a Bag set that was mostly browns and blacks, and handed it to him. His eyes went from the bag to my face and then narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, wondering what was wrong with the set I\u2019d picked. I\u2019d done what he\u2019d asked me to, so what was his problem?</p><p>\u201cYou would have this in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but this isn\u2019t for my room,\u201d I said, pointing at myself. \u201cThis is for your room.\u201d I shrugged and started to walk away, but I was grabbed by the back of my jeans, and his hands slid along my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think will be sleeping in my bed with me?\u201d he asked against the shell of my ear. He\u2019d found out the night before that that was a very weak spot for me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, feeling stupid tears sting my nose. I didn\u2019t want to think about anyone in his bed.</p><p>He turned me in his arms and I ducked my head, not wanting him to see the emotions I was sure were written all over my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d His concerned voice caused my eyes to lift. I shook my head and started to look away, but his hand cupped my cheek, forcing me to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the most difficult woman I have ever met.\u201d He shook his head and started to laugh. My eyes narrowed, and he looked over my face before laughing harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is funny?\u201d I hissed.</p><p>He stopped laughing and his voice became serious. \u201cYou\u2019re in my bed. I want that to be the place you sleep from now on. I also want it to be somewhere you\u2019re comfortable. That\u2019s why I wanted you with me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, my belly fluttering.</p><p>\u201cNow, what are we getting?\u201d</p> <p>I bit my lip and walked over to the set that had caught my eye. I picked it up then put it down when I saw the price. \u201cMaybe you should just get that other one,\u201d I told him, seeing the much cheaper price boldly displayed across the front of the picture on the bag in his hand.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He shook his head then walked over and picked up the one I really liked. \u201cI hate shopping, so this will go a lot faster if you just pick the shit you like so we can get the f**k out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass,\u201d I growled, making him smile.</p><p>\u201cDo we need sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hissed then stomped over to the sheets, picking up two sets\u2014a black one that would match the tree printed on the comforter and one green set the same color as the ribbon on the border. The whole time I stomped around, I listened to Kenton laughing. I rolled my eyes but couldn\u2019t help the smile that formed on my lips when his arm swung over my shoulders and his lips touched my temple.</p> <p>The feeling of him taking a deep breath brings me back to the present, and I tilt my head back slightly to look at him.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask sleepily.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s good. Justin just left. He said you went to bed late \u2019cause you were up eating junk food while watching him play Call of Duty all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a tattletale.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>Justin has become like a brother to me. We bicker and argue constantly, but he also makes me laugh so hard that I can\u2019t breathe. I adore him for the way he looks out for Kenton and love that he is such a great friend. He stays with me every time Kenton is out of town. Between him and the rest of Kenton\u2019s men, there isn\u2019t a time when my whereabouts are unknown or I\u2019m not supervised. I hate having people constantly in my space, but I know that, in order for me to be safe right now, I need them.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I say softly, pressing my nose into his chest.</p> <p>\u201cMissed you too, babe.\u201d His hand travels down my back, over my ass, and between my legs. One finger dips inside my pu**y before rolling over my clit.</p><p>\u201cKenton,\u201d I moan as he takes my mouth in a deep kiss, rolling me to my back and entering me.</p><p>By the time we both come, we\u2019re exhausted and fall back asleep.</p><p>I snuggle into Kenton and wrap my arms around his waist when I hear the doorbell ring in the distance. \u201cThey\u2019ll go away,\u201d I tell him, not ready to get up. I feel like I just fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get it. It could be Mom.\u201d</p><p>Crap, he\u2019s right. It could be his mom, because while he\u2019s out of town, she or Viv stop by for coffee most mornings.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her you are home?\u201d I ask, knowing that, if she knows he\u2019s home, she would normally give him at least until the afternoon before calling or showing up.</p><p>\u201cNah, so she\u2019s probably here to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m up. You should sleep.\u201d I throw my legs over the side of the bed then find the T-shirt he had on yesterday. I pull it on over my head before bending and grabbing my sweats off the floor.</p><p>The loud slap on my ass has me jumping in place and glaring at Kenton, who is now up and wearing a pair of jeans with the top button undone.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stick it in my face, babe, and I\u2019m going to slap it,\u201d he says with a smirk, opening the bedroom door.</p><p>I jump on his back, wrapping my legs around his hips and my arms around his neck while biting his ear and neck, making him laugh as he tries his best to tickle me off him, making me giggle while heading down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I hear whispered.</p><p>I lift my head at the familiar voice, shocked to see Sid standing on the front porch. My arms and legs start to loosen from around Kenton\u2019s waist and neck, and I drop to the floor.</p><p>\u201cSid?\u201d I ask, concerned, taking in his disheveled appearance.</p><p>\u201cI knew she was with you.\u201d His eyes narrow on Kenton. \u201cI f**king knew after your last visit, but this sealed the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Vegas?\u201d I ask Kenton and glare.</p><p>He crosses his arms over his chest, looking down at me for a second before his eyes go back to Sid. \u201cWhy are you here? More importantly, how the f**k did you find me?\u201d Kenton asks him.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard,\u201d Sid says, glaring.</p><p>I look between the two of them then settle my eyes on Kenton. A million questions fly through my head, but the biggest one is why the hell he was in Vegas and didn\u2019t say anything to me. \u201cWhy were you in Vegas?\u201d I try, hoping to get an answer.</p><p>\u201cHe had a meeting at my club yesterday,\u201d Sid says, and my head swings in his direction.</p><p>\u201cMeeting?\u201d I mumble, looking between the two of them.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Kenton growls, taking a step towards him.</p><p>\u201cShe should know what\u2019s going on,\u201d I hear Sid say, and I look back up at Kenton.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The last time he went to Vegas, my place had been broken into. I have no idea who he would be meeting with besides Link, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this is about.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon,\u201d Kenton says, the vein in his neck ticking.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell her now?\u201d Sid looks from Kenton to me, his eyes going soft. He starts to take a step towards me, but Kenton blocks his way, putting his hand on the door. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Sid complains.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, please put your giant penis away for a minute,\u201d I tell Kenton, elbowing him in the side before looking over at Sid. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I ask him softly, wondering if he\u2019s in trouble or something.</p><p>\u201cAfter your last e-mail, I wrote you back. When I didn\u2019t hear from you, I wrote you again, only for it to come back to me saying you\u2019d deleted your account.\u201d He runs a hand over his head, and this time, his eyes go to Kenton. \u201cI knew you were with him after yesterday, so I got his address and came to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve always been in love with you, Autumn. Don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid\u2019?\u201d I whisper. \u201cSo, all the women you paraded around in front of me?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMeant nothing.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI just wanted you to realize you wanted me. I wanted you to fight for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say softly, shaking my head. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you were in love with me and brought women around so I would be jealous and fight for you...instead of telling me how you felt and you fighting for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so closed off. You were always in your head. I was trying to break through to you.\u201d</p><p>I look at Sid then Kenton.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, babe. I don\u2019t know what the f**k to say about this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSid, you\u2019re a great guy, but you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>The differences between Kenton and Sid are striking, the biggest being that Kenton has fought for me since the beginning. He\u2019s never let me get too far when I\u2019ve tried running away. He\u2019s also never brought women around to try to get me to accept my feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cLike I said in my last e-mail, I care about you, but not like that. I hope you can understand,\u201d I tell him softly, hoping that he gets that there is nothing\u2014nor will there ever be anything\u2014between us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I bite my lip and nod. I watch regret pass through his eyes before he shakes his head then turns to look off into the distance.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is goodbye then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I reply, not understanding the feelings I have inside, why this is so hard. Deep down, I wonder what would have happened if he would\u2019ve actually tried to get to know me. I step up to him and wrap my hands around his waist, giving him a hug. \u201cThank you for everything,\u201d I whisper. \u201cOne day, you\u2019re going to find someone worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>His arms squeeze me a little tighter, his chest expanding on a breath. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>I know exactly what he\u2019s asking, and tears sting my nose. I nod into his chest and step back into Kenton\u2019s embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her and I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Sid says before turning and heading down the steps.</p><p>Once he\u2019s in his car and pulling away from the house, I turn to look at Kenton. \u201cSo what happened in Vegas?\u201d I cross my arms over my chest.</p><p>His eyes drop then meet mine again. \u201cLet\u2019s go sit down.\u201d</p><p>I follow him into the living room, sitting on the opposite side of the couch from him. That way, he can\u2019t distract me with his touch.</p><p>\u201cI met up with the boss of Lacamo. They agreed you\u2019re off-limits,\u201d he says softly, and my whole body stills at the news I have been waiting to hear.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s over?\u201d I ask on a whisper. I can\u2019t believe that, after all this time, all it took was one meeting for this whole thing to be resolved.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he says, looking at me from across the couch.</p><p>I can\u2019t understand why he looks so worried when I know that this news will make things easier for him as well. He has been running himself ragged working his normal cases while trying to keep me safe. Then, my head starts to fill with thoughts about my life, why I\u2019m really here, and what this news means for my future.</p><p>\u201cSo, I can go home then?\u201d I ask, looking down at my hands.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The word is rough and causes me to lift my head. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no\u2019?\u201d I search his face, wondering what he\u2019s not telling me. If I\u2019m no longer in danger, I can return to Vegas, even if the thought alone makes me feel sick.</p><p>\u201cExactly what it sounds like\u2014no, you can\u2019t go back to Vegas.\u201d His hands ball into fist on his thighs. \u201cThis is your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home,\u201d I murmur and swallow, feeling my heart pound against the inside of my ribs.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve been here, this has become my home, but before you, it was a place I slept at night. You have given me a reason to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to move in with you?\u201d I whisper, hope blooming in my chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby.\u201d He laughs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my place in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSell it...keep it... I don\u2019t give a f**k what you do with it.\u201d</p><p>I stand up, glance around the room, and then look back over at Kenton, who looks worried. My heart does a flip from knowing that he really wants this; he really wants me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt. One hundred percent sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will your family say?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018When are you getting married?\u2019\u201d he replies. I feel my eyes get big and my mouth fill with saliva. \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d he says gently, and I nod.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s in love with me, but I think this feeling I have for him is love\u2014or some form of it. Never really having been loved before, I don\u2019t know what it really feels like. I know that what I feel for him makes what I felt for my son\u2019s father pale in comparison. I know that I want to spend all my time with him, and he\u2019s always my first thought when I wake and my last thought when I go to bed at night.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asks, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cYes, okay. I\u2019ll move in with you,\u201d I tell him, a smile creeping onto my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His lips twitch, and I nod before running at him and climbing onto his lap. His arms wrap around me as I press my mouth against his. \u201cShit,\u201d he groans, pulling his mouth from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you stopping?\u201d I try to pull his mouth back to mine when I hear someone knocking on the door. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I smile as he sets me aside and adjusts himself in his jeans before standing. I sit there for a second and then get up to follow him to the door. After he looks outside, his eyes come to me before pulling the door open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home?\u201d Nancy says, smiling. \u201cIf I would have known that, I wouldn\u2019t have come so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We were up.\u201d He kisses her cheek, letting her into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you up?\u201d She looks between the two of us, her eyes twinkling, and I know she\u2019s going to say something that will have me turning red. \u201cYou know, I want my grandchildren to have our family name. I think it\u2019s about time you two stop playing house and just get married.\u201d</p><p>All the air leaves my lungs at the word \u2018children.\u2019 I grab the table closest to me for balance. When a wave of dizziness hits me hard, I\u2019m surprised that I don\u2019t hit the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus, Mom! Autumn just agreed to move in, and now you\u2019re trying to scare her off.\u201d He shakes his head then looks at me. \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d he says gently, reading my face.</p><p>I nod and swallow against the lump in my throat. I could see myself having his child. I can picture a little girl with his dark hair and golden eyes. She\u2019d be a daddy\u2019s girl and he would adore her. Her life would be so different than mine was when I grew up up.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>I feel a hand on my cheek, and I shake the thoughts out of my head. I look into his concerned eyes and take a breath before nodding.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving in?\u201d Nancy asks. The surprise in her voice has me getting up on my tiptoes to look over Kenton\u2019s shoulder. I smile when I see the look of approval and the wide smile on her face as she looks between us. \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing everything has been sorted out?\u201d She looks at Kenton, who nods. \u201cI knew my boy would fix it.\u201d She shakes her head then ducks by Kenton and grabs my hand, pulling me with her to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that it\u2019s official, we need to talk about redecorating. This place was okay when it was just you, but now that Autumn\u2019s going to be living here for good, we need to make some changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about that, Mom. Autumn can make any changes she wants to, but we don\u2019t need to have a sit-down about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, until you give me a wedding to plan and grandbabies to play with, you\u2019re going to have to give me something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus. I\u2019m going to the office.\u201d He looks at me then his mom and shakes his head. \u201cYou gonna be okay here with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she will be okay with me,\u201d Nancy scoffs. \u201cI\u2019m going to get coffee started and call Susan to see if her boys have anything on their schedule.\u201d She looks at me then my clothes. \u201cYou should get dressed so we can go downtown and head to some stores. I need to get an idea of what you like. I hope we can do the kitchen right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, seriously, slow down,\u201d Kenton warns.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve waited for you to find a decent woman...someone I could stand being around, someone I would be proud to call my daughter?\u201d She puts her hands on her hips and narrows her eyes. \u201cI want the wedding and the grandkids, but I can\u2019t have that right now. So instead, we\u2019re going to be redecorating this house so that, when the time comes, you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that, when me and Autumn get married, it will be up to her to plan the kind of wedding she wants, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it will be her planning it.\u201d His mom shakes her head and starts down the hall.</p> <p>I stand there in shock, my body coiled tightly. He said when, not if, we get married, like he knows for sure that it\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d I hear on a laugh. I look up and my eyes automatically narrow when I see that he\u2019s chuckling. \u201cTold you she would be planning a wedding when she found out you were moving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said when.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyebrows come together in confusion and his hand goes to my waist, dragging me to him.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d I say, and it comes out sounding more like a question.</p><p>\u201cAutumn.\u201d His tone has my head coming up and my heart beating double-time.</p> <p>\u201cYou said when we get married, not if we get married,\u201d I repeat. The words are circling inside my head.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d His eyes narrow further, making me squirm.</p><p>\u201cWhen, Kenton...you said when we get married, not if,\u201d I say again, trying to drive home what I\u2019m getting at.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re getting married,\u201d he says in a tone that makes me squirm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, what the f**k do you think is going on between the two of us?\u201d He shakes his head, putting his fingers under my chin, titling my head farther back. His mouth touches mine, his teeth tugging on my bottom lip. \u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d He kisses me. Then his eyes search my face. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk,\u201d I say immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to talk. You just need to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy.\u201d I sigh, trying to think of a way to get out of this.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get home, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d I say sarcastically and yell, \u201cOw!\u201d when he smacks my ass hard. \u201cYour mom\u2019s here,\u201d I remind him when he gets the look in his eyes that tells me I\u2019m about to get bent over.</p><p>\u201cKeep up the smart mouth and I\u2019ll fill it with something that will keep you quiet,\u201d he whispers in my ear, causing goose bumps to break out over my skin.</p><p>\u201cI thought you needed to go into the office,\u201d I breathe, closing my eyes.</p><p>The image of me on my knees in front of him flashes behind my closed lids. Every time I have tried to take him in my mouth, he\u2019s stopped me, saying that he needed to be inside me badly.</p><p>My hands slide around his waist and my head goes to his chest, where I listen to the rhythm of his heart. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get home.\u201d I squeeze his waist and feel his lips at the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cSee you when I get home,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I reply, and he kisses me once more before jogging up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou got it bad,\u201d Nancy says, making me jump.</p><p>I turn around and look at her. Standing in the doorway, she looks me over before looking up the stairs at where Kenton just disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI would send you up to get dressed, but he\u2019s up there now, and if you go up there with him, I have a feeling neither of you will be back down for a while.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face heat up and I look at the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome have some coffee.\u201d She laughs, turning and heading back into the kitchen.</p><p>I follow behind, wondering if she gets off on making me squirm.</p><p>Once we\u2019ve had coffee and Kenton comes back downstairs to kiss me goodbye, he tells me that I can message him any time and he\u2019ll send someone to rescue me. I would normally laugh about that, but I have a feeling that he\u2019s being completely serious.</p><p>The minute the door closes behind him, Nancy pushes me up the stairs to get dressed. She lets me know what we\u2019re going to be doing, not that she gives me a choice in any of it. I have a feeling that the only way I could disagree is if I pop out a kid or start planning a wedding, and neither of those things is going to happen for a while, so I\u2019m stuck picking out appliances\u2014or at least agreeing with what she picks out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sigh as I sit down in the booth across from Nancy. I think we\u2019ve gone to every home improvement store in the state. If I never look at another oven or fridge again, it will be too soon. I feel my phone vibrate in my bag, so I pull it out and slide my finger across the screen when I see that Kenton is calling.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe. I just wanted to call you really quick and let you know I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>I feel a frown touch my lips at his words and the anxiety in his voice. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s place was broken into when she was home. I\u2019m with Nico and the cops now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. A little shook up, but she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho broke in?\u201d I ask in shock.</p><p>Nancy grabs my free hand, giving it a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure, baby. As soon as Nico gets Sophie home, I should be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk to you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>My mind goes to Sophie and Nico. I haven\u2019t met Sophie yet, but I have met Nico. He looks scary but is very sweet. The two times we\u2019ve talked, he told me all about Sophie, and I can tell just by the tone of his voice when he speaks about her that he is in love. I can only imagine how worried he is right now.</p><p>\u201cKenton said Sophie\u2019s was broken into,\u201d I tell Nancy, setting the phone down on the table.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Susan.\u201d She picks up her phone.</p><p>I watch as she makes the call, and I know that, by the time the phone is hung up, the Maysons will be on a mission. I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s going to be what Nico wants. He doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who\u2019d want everyone over after something like that.</p><p>\u201cSusan\u2019s going to call Nico\u2019s dad and tell him what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s a cop and may be able to get some stuff sorted before my son or nephew end up in jail.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes get big. \u201cWhy would he go to jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, Kenton works with cops but isn\u2019t a cop.\u201d She shakes her head, grabbing my hand again. \u201cHe can still be arrested if he does something the police find to be criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d I stand, grabbing my bag, ready to go save Kenton before he gets into trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d She grabs my hand and tugs me back down into the booth next to her. \u201cLet me tell you something. Kenton will always do whatever he wants. There is nothing his father or I\u2014or now you\u2014can say to change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to get into trouble,\u201d I breathe in distress.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really believe he will get into trouble, but a mom\u2019s job is never done. I will always protect my family.\u201d</p><p>Her words bring tears to my eyes. She\u2019s a great mom who loves her kids. Even with as old as Kenton and Toni are, they are still able to lean on her when they need something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re family now too, honey,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cand I will protect you as I would protect my own children. That includes looking out for my son so he can continue to look out for you.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tear falls down my cheek.</p><p>Her hand comes up, holding my face, her thumb wiping the tear away. \u201cNow, what do you say we have some cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nod, swallowing against the lump in my throat.</p><p>We sit there in silence while we each eat a large piece of chocolate cake that is so dense that it\u2019s more like fudge. I have a large glass of milk with mine, and Nancy has a glass of wine. When we\u2019re done, we pay the tab before climbing into Nancy\u2019s Jeep.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t say anything, but I know why I can\u2019t. My emotions are too exposed; too much has happened today and I need some time to regroup. It isn\u2019t until Kenton sends a text telling me that he\u2019s on his way home that I feel some of the tension in my belly dissipate. Right then, I know that I\u2019m no longer in like with him; I\u2019m head-over-heels in love with him.</p><p>I wake up on a scream when I feel myself being shaken. My throat feels like it\u2019s on fire and my skin feels damp with sweat. I look around in the darkness, holding my chest, trying to remember where I am, when the light is switched on and I see that Kenton is looking at me worriedly. I lower my head, covering my face with my hands, taking a few deep breaths as I try to get my heart rate back to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou were screaming like someone was killing you,\u201d he whispers, sliding in behind me.</p><p>I feel my stomach drop and my insides twist with anxiety. I haven\u2019t had a nightmare in years. When I first left home, I would get them often, but somehow, they stopped. I forgot what it feels like to wake up scared, so scared that I want to turn on every light then hide under the covers.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you,\u201d I whisper, trying to pull away from his touch, humiliated that I woke him, that he witnessed that.</p><p>\u201cJesus, don\u2019t do that. Do not f**king pull away. Not right now. Not when whatever it was you were dreaming about is still clinging to your skin and has seeped into mine.\u201d</p><p>The bed moves behind me again and my hands are taken from my face. He pulls me down so I\u2019m on my side, facing him, our faces so close that I can feel each of his breaths.</p><p>His arms wrap around me and his thigh slides over my legs so I\u2019m surrounded by him. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>I try to sort out what to say to him in my head. How can I possibly explain what just happened when I don\u2019t understand it myself? \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a dream or a memory,\u201d I say softly after a few minutes. I press my face into his neck and press my body closer to his.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens?\u201d</p><p>I take another shuddering breath and shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m in water. It\u2019s not very deep \u2019cause I\u2019m sitting in it and it only comes up to my waist. I have this doll in my hand that has blond hair, and I\u2019m dunking her underwater, singing a song to her.\u201d I swallow again, and this time, I feel bile at the back of my throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens, but I feel hands on my head pushing me down. I can\u2019t breathe and I try to scream but end up sucking in lungfuls of water.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath just to remind myself that I can. My mom was never a good mom; she was abusive but never left a mark. She always made sure there was never any evidence pointing to her being less than perfect. To everyone who knew us, we lived the perfect life. We had the perfect home, the perfect yard, and she was the perfect mother, who had perfect hair, clothes, and makeup. Everything about her was perfect, and she made sure I was perfect\u2014at least what everyone saw of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think that really happened? That she tried to drown me?\u201d I wonder out loud, feeling his body wrap tighter around mine and his muscles tense. We\u2019ve talked some about how it was for me growing up. I try to avoid talking about it as much as possible, even though he asks often. I just don\u2019t like the look that comes across his face when we do discuss it.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asks gently.</p><p>I take another deep breath, tucking my face into his neck, letting his warmth and smell take away the last of the nightmare. \u201cYes.\u201d I nod, feeling his arms go tighter before he lets me go and gets out of bed, muttering a quiet, \u201cFuck,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I whimper, feeling sick. I sit up, holding the sheet to my bare chest, looking around for quick escape. Tears start to sting my nose and I fight them back, knowing that there is no way in hell I will cry in front of him. Not now.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d is roared, and I turn my head just in time to see one of the new bedside lamps fly across the room, hitting the sliding glass door. The lamp bursts into thousands of pieces while the door somehow doesn\u2019t shatter. \u201cFuck, f**k, f**k,\u201d he chants, pacing back and forth, running a hand through his hair as I try to think of something to do or say to calm him down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave,\u201d I tell him quietly, fear settling in my gut.</p><p>His pacing doesn\u2019t change, and his fists clenching and unclenching tell me everything I need to know about his state of mind. I start to wonder if I do this to people, if I make them want to hurt me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whimper.</p><p>His head swings my way, and his eyes look me over, going from hard to soft. \u201cJesus, baby.\u201d He comes towards me and I hold up my hand, trying to ward him off. His eyes drop to my hand then move back up to my face. \u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I know this; I know deep down that he wouldn\u2019t, but I just watched him freak out, and that has put some fear in me.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he repeats, and that\u2019s when I notice that my body is shaking so hard that the bed is vibrating. \u201cIt was either the lamp or track down your mom and put a bullet in her.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes widen as he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI would kill her, baby. Without a second thought, I would end her. I know you don\u2019t understand, but this is me. I protect the people I love. I hate feeling helpless when I know I can fix this. Knowing that someone who has harmed you is out in the world, walking around, does not sit well with me. It goes against everything I am to let her get away with what she did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d I ask, ignoring everything else he just said, my mind zeroing in on that one fact.</p><p>His eyebrows rise and he shakes his head. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p><p>I swallow and shrug my shoulders at his familiar words.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you need to start looking at what\u2019s going on around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI show you every day,\u201d he says, looking dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me you loved me.\u201d I resort to getting angry. Why the hell are guys so damn stupid?</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. It\u2019s not past tense. I love you now and will love you until my heart stops beating.\u201d</p> <p>My belly flips and I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m in a whole lot of love with you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asks, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know until today.\u201d I shrug, pulling the sheet up higher on my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you love me,\u201d he says, and I\u2019m sure he did know, because he knows what love feels like.</p><p>\u201cI have loved\u2014really loved\u2014only one person, and that was my son.\u201d I look around, trying to think of a way to explain it to him. \u201cMy love for him was different. It was one-sided and pure of any other emotions. Then, today, you sent me a text message, and when I read that you would meet me at home, something in me clicked into place. I have never had that\u2014a home or someone to go home to. That\u2019s when I understood what I\u2019m feeling. You\u2019re my home. You\u2019re the person I belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he growls, and I know that he understands now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the glue that holds all of my broken pieces together,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cAutumn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me for me,\u201d I whisper, and I know he\u2019s done when he plows into me, his body knocking mine backwards onto the bed, caging me in.</p><p>\u201cI said shut it.\u201d His mouth comes down on mine, his tongue seeking entrance.</p><p>I open my mouth under his. My hands go to his back, feeling his warm, smooth skin under my fingers. His fingers go to my center, where he pulls my panties to the side. Then his fingers run down my slit, causing my hips to jerk at the contact.</p><p>\u201cLift your hips.\u201d</p><p>I do what he says, raising my hips off the bed. His hands pull my panties down my thighs, his weight leaving me only to drag them off me. As soon as they\u2019re gone, his fingers go right back to where they were, making my hips shift and jerk once again.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I get your mouth. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>My pu**y convulses, sucking his fingers deeper.</p><p>\u201cMy girl likes that idea,\u201d he says, licking up my neck before rolling to his back.</p><p>I watch as his hips lift and he pulls his boxers down, kicking them off the bed. His hand wraps around his cock, stroking twice and causing a bead of pr**cum to seep out of the tip. My mouth waters and I lick my lips. His groan has my eyes going to his as I bend forward on my knees to lick the tip. His taste bursts on my tongue, and I want more, so I wrap my hand over his and close my lips over the tip, swirling my tongue around it.</p><p>His fingers run over my cheek, around my ear, and down my neck, shoulder, back, and ass before hitting me just right. I moan, taking more of him into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCom\u2019ere,\u201d he groans, shifting my hips over his head. The second his tongue touches me, I cry out, forgetting what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. \u201cYou stop, I stop,\u201d he growls, slapping my ass. I moan, taking him as deep as I can, causing him to hit the back of my throat, which makes me gag.</p><p>I can feel his fingers holding me open while he licks and sucks, not missing any part. I feel my orgasm approaching and know that it\u2019s going to be huge. My hips start bucking against his face, my hand working fast with my mouth. Do I know what I\u2019m doing? No, but I know him, and I know the noises he makes when something feels good. I know we\u2019re both close, but then he lifts me off his face with an order of, \u201cRide me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I start to turn to face him, but his hands hold my hips in place.</p><p>\u201cReverse, baby.\u201d</p><p>I can feel more wetness build between my thighs. One of his hands holds his c**k upright, the other wrapping around my hip. I position myself over him and sink down hard. My head flies back and a loud moan leaves my mouth. I just found my new favorite position.</p><p>The head of his c**k hits my G-spot on each downward thrust. His hands slide around my waist, one going up to cup my breast, the other down to roll over my clit.</p><p>\u201cShit. I need a mirror.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder and down at him. His eyes are at half-mast and his cheeks have a slight pinkness, and I know I did that to him. I made his hot even hotter just by f**king him.</p><p>His hand wraps around my hair, pulling my head back, and I hold the position for a minute before leaning forward. My hands go to his shins as I start to ride him hard and fast. I can feel myself getting closer the harder I ride. When his hips start lifting to meet mine, I cry out my orgasm as he grunts his.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe into the crook of my arm, where my face had ended up.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah. Perfection in everything you do, baby.\u201d</p><p>I smile into my arm before lifting myself off him and turning around to lie against his chest with my chin on my hands. \u201cI love you,\u201d I tell him, looking into his eyes, my finger tracing first one eyebrow, then the other, and then around his lips, which I love so much.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby.\u201d He leans up, kissing my mouth. \u201cI gotta clean up. You wanna come, or do you want me to bring you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna come,\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d He smiles back, smacking my ass lightly and shaking his head.</p><p>I follow him into the bathroom, where he cleans me up before smacking me on the ass as I walk back into the bedroom. I don\u2019t even bother saying anything when he does it; I know it\u2019s pointless to tell him to stop. Instead, I pick my panties up off the floor, toss them towards the closet, and grab a new pair from the drawer before stepping into them.</p><p>\u201cI f**king love those.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my underwear and feel my eyebrows draw together.</p><p>\u201cWhen the f**k did cotton panties with flowers become sexier than lace shit? Do not f**king ask me, but those are hot, and you in nothing but them is even hotter.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and pull them up my legs before climbing into bed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love me,\u201d he says, and I smile.</p><p>\u201cI do. I don\u2019t know what that says about me, but I do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says you\u2019re smart.\u201d He turns off the light and pulls me to him so my head is on his chest and his hand can wrap around my hair like it always does when we sleep. \u201cYou gonna be able to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Hearing the concern in his voice has me pressing closer to him. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. I haven\u2019t had one in a long time,\u201d I tell him quietly, tracing random patterns on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what triggered it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think talking to your mom last night,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cShe told me about your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already knew about my work,\u201d he says, confused.</p><p>I press closer. \u201cI know, but I guess I never thought you could get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, if we were having this conversation a few years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you that you have nothing to worry about, but I\u2019m no longer reckless. I take risks, but they are all calculated, and the worst-case scenario is thought of and worked around before every situation.\u201d His hand moves to my cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about any of that. Things can always go wrong, and if they do, we figure it out when it happens. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nod against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNight, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I whisper, listening to his heartbeat, letting it lull me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Shit Hits The Fan</p><p>\u201cShhhhh,\u201d I whisper to the little ball of fur I just set down on the floor of my old room. He whines at me, and I can\u2019t help but pick him up again to give him a cuddle. \u201cSorry, baby, but you need to be in here until I can figure out how to tell Kenton about you,\u201d I tell my new puppy before setting him down on the ground.</p><p>I was at the mall when I walked past a pet store. I looked into the window of the shop and a little white fur ball caught my eye. He was tugging a large, red chew toy around the pen that was full of wood chips while all the other puppies fought amongst each other. I went into the store to have a closer look at him, and the minute I stood next to the pen, his head came up, his eyes met mine, and I fell in love. He ran to me, his little puppy body so round that he had a hard time running straight. I picked him up and started laughing. He was so wiggly and loveable, and I knew right then that I was taking him home with me.</p><p>I look around the bedroom, making sure there\u2019s nothing for him to get into while I\u2019m downstairs trying to think of a way to tell Kenton that we got a dog. The last few months have flown by. Not long after I agreed to move in, Kenton and I took a trip out to Vegas, packed up my condo, and put it on the market. When we got home from our trip, Nancy got her nephews to come over to gut the kitchen. It took about a month for them to completely renovate it.</p><p>The counters are now dark granite, the appliances are stainless steel, the cupboards are dark wood, and the floors are slate. Nancy wanted to redo the dining room, but after the kitchen ordeal, I was over renovating for a while. We did get a new set for the deck\u2014a large, metal table and six chairs\u2014and we also got a large, round outdoor bed that has a top that flips over to block out the sun. It\u2019s the perfect place to read a book or make love under the setting sun, which has happened more than once when Kenton\u2019s caught me out there reading.</p><p>I come out of my thoughts when I hear a quiet snore. I look down and see that Tubs is sleeping. I shake my head, laying him on his bed before closing the door carefully behind me, hoping that he doesn\u2019t wake up until I can tell Kenton about him.</p><p>I hear the alarm system sound, letting me know that the front door is open, and I run down the stairs. My feet hit the bottom landing with a loud thud when I jump off the last step.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d I say breathlessly as soon as his head turns my way.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he says suspiciously.</p><p>I feel myself start to squirm under his gaze, and I dig my nails into my palms to keep from blurting out about Tubs. I need to figure out how to tell him, and I\u2019m thinking a blowjob may ease the blow. A smile twitches my lips at that thought and his eyes start to narrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d This time, the words are impatient.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I reply immediately, and his eyes narrow further.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you over there and not here?\u201d He points to the floor in front of him.</p><p>I go to him like I normally would, lift up on my tiptoes, and tilt my head back, waiting for him to bend to kiss me.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what the f**k is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I... Well, we...um,\u201d I start, trying to tell him about Tubs, when all of a sudden, there\u2019s a loud bang upstairs and both of our heads tilt towards the ceiling for a second before he looks back down at me. When our eyes meet again, I see hurt hit his eyes. Then rage.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he growls, setting me away from him before I can explain what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I yell when I see him pull his gun out from behind his back. I run after him up the stairs and yell, \u201cNo!\u201d as he pushes open my old bedroom door when he sees all the others are open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d he asks, stopping dead, causing me to run into his back.</p> <p>I slide around him into the room, seeing that Tubs has pulled the lamp off the bedside table and onto the ground. Luckily, it didn\u2019t break. I pick him up and pull him into my chest.</p><p>\u201cBad puppy,\u201d I mutter, kissing his furry little head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Kenton asks.</p><p>My eyes go to him and I smile. \u201cThis is Tubs.\u201d I hold him out to Kenton and he wiggles in my hands, his tongue coming out, trying to reach Kenton\u2019s face. I look from Tubs to my confused man, who is looking at the dog like he\u2019s some kind of alien.</p><p>\u201cHow did it get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got here in my car,\u201d I say, bringing him back to my chest, petting him behind his ears when he whines.</p> <p>\u201cPut him back in your car and take him back to where he came from.\u201d</p><p>I lift my eyes and narrow them. \u201cI\u2019m keeping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, do you know how much work a puppy is?\u201d</p><p>No, I don\u2019t know, but I talked to a very sweet girl at the pet store and she made sure I had everything we needed\u2014from food to a rhinestone-studded collar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he says, watching me.</p><p>\u201cBut I love him,\u201d I pout, tucking his tiny head back under my chin.</p><p>His eyes drop to my mouth then to Tubs. \u201cFuck.\u201d He shakes his head then reaches out his hand, petting the top of Tubs\u2019s head. \u201cWhat kind of dog is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerican Eskimo,\u201d I whisper as he takes Tubs from my hands and pulls him to his chest. My heart melts at the sight of him cuddling the puppy.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, thinking, This is way too easy.</p><p>\u201cWe can keep him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d My eyes go wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably regret this after the first time he pisses in the house, but yeah, we can keep him,\u201d he says, bending towards me, kissing the smile off my face. \u201cNone of that,\u201d he tells Tubs when he tries to get in on our kiss.</p><p>I laugh and wrap my arms around his waist, looking up into his eyes. \u201cThank you, honey.\u201d I give him a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d I smile and his eyes heat.</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that,\u201d he says with a wicked grin, but then I remember the look on his face before he ran up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I had someone here?\u201d I ask him, my eyebrows coming together, thinking the look of hurt I caught.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you were acting strange, and then the crash happened, so I didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you,\u201d I tell him softly. The thought alone feels like a lead weight in my gut.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u201d\u2014his hand comes up, cupping my jaw\u2014\u201cbut sometimes when you have something that seems too good to be true, you start waiting for it to crumble to pieces around you.\u201d My breath catches in my throat and tears fill my eyes. \u201cYou, Autumn Freeman, are the most important thing in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I choke out.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I sob, burying my face in his chest, and Tubs takes the opportunity to start licking me, making my sobs turn into laughter.</p><p>Kenton tilts my head back again, kissing me. \u201cWhere\u2019s his kennel?\u201d he asks when his mouth leaves mine.</p><p>\u201cKennel?\u201d I ask dizzily.</p><p>\u201cWhere he sleeps,\u201d he prompts.</p><p>\u201cOh, I got him a bed.\u201d I point to the large, fluffy dog bed that is now in the middle of the floor, where I\u2019m sure Tubs dragged it.</p><p>Kenton looks at me then the bed and shakes his head. \u201cGet his leash and collar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, going over to the bags I put on the bed with all his stuff in them. I dig through until I find his baby-blue collar with rhinestone studs and his leash that matches. I turn around, my head bent as I take the tags off both items.</p><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d</p><p>I jump at his voice and lift my head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, looking down at my hands, where his eyes are pointed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, feeling my eyebrows draw together. \u201cThat\u2019s why I bought blue.\u201d I hold up the collar and leash so he can see them better.</p><p>\u201cIt has sparkly shit on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl at the pet store told me they\u2019re the \u2018in\u2019 thing. I even got him a couple of shirts that are blue,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cScratch that. We have two stops to make\u2014one to Petco and the next to wherever the hell it is you bought all that crap so we can return it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to return his stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one hundred degrees outside today with eighty percent humidity. He\u2019s covered in fur. When the hell would he wear a shirt?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a good point, but I don\u2019t want to give in; the things I bought are cute. \u201cHe can wear them around the house.\u201d I shrug, walking towards him with the collar undone so I can put it around Tubs\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wearing shirts around the house.\u201d He shakes his head, pulling the stuff out of my hand and giving me Tubs.</p><p>I turn and watch him go back over to the bags of stuff I bought, look through it, and mutter the whole time. By the time he\u2019s done, all he keeps out is the dog food.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He puts his hand on the small of my back, leading me out of the room then down the stairs to his car.</p><p>When we get home that night, Tubs has a new kennel, a few toys, and a plain, black leash and collar, but I did make it out of the store with a new harness that has blue hearts on it, much to Kenton\u2019s disapproval. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop him!\u201d I shout, running after Tubs, who is racing away from me with one of my bras hanging from his mouth.</p><p>Kenton blocks his path and bends down, picking up the fur ball, who is still gnawing on my bra, and when Kenton tries to take it from him, he starts acting like it\u2019s a game of tug-of-war.</p><p>\u201cBad puppy,\u201d I tell him, unlocking his jaw with my fingers and grabbing my bra, which is now covered with dog slobber. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d I snap at Kenton when his laugher follows me as I go back into the bathroom, tossing my bra into the hamper before going to get a new one out of my underwear drawer.</p><p>\u201cI told you having a puppy is a lot of work,\u201d he says, walking into the bathroom behind me.</p> <p>\u201cI know, but he\u2019s so cute,\u201d I say, putting my bra straps over my shoulders and hooking the clasp behind my back.</p><p>He starts to laugh again, but this time, the vibration of his laughter is against me as he slides his hands around my waist. \u201cYou sure you gotta go to work?\u201d he asks, kissing the skin of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d I move my head to the side so my neck is more exposed to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStay home with me.\u201d</p><p>I hear the plea in his voice and turn in his arms, looking up at his face. I know that, after what happened with Sophie and Nico a few weeks ago, he has been on edge and hasn\u2019t wanted me too far away from him, and it\u2019s not surprising. Having someone you know and care about kidnapped and then having to help rescue them would do that to anyone.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried to reassure him that nothing like that will happen to me the only way I know how. The cops are still looking for the hit man, but the men who hired him gave their word that I\u2019m not on his list, and as stupid as it may be, I believe them. After all, they are the ones who paid him. Kenton and I talked though, and he knows that, if they catch the guy, I will testify against him for what he did. I never made any deals, and there\u2019s no way I could refuse to be the only person to help the families of the five people I watched get murdered in cold blood get justice.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, coming out of my thoughts. I wrap my hands around the back of his neck and press my mouth to his before he has a chance to reply. If I only knew what was going to happen in a few hours, I would have kissed him a little bit harder and held him a little bit tighter, but that\u2019s the thing about life\u2014you never know what\u2019s going to happen, so every moment you have, you need to act like it\u2019s your last.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I stop outside the emergency room doors as soon as I see Sid standing there. My heart starts beating wildly as I scan the parking lot, trying to see if there is anyone else around.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d I shake my head, pulling out my keys as I make my way to my car. I have never been afraid of Sid, but something is off. My insides are twisted into knots. I ended up having to work a double tonight, so the darkness isn\u2019t helping with the fear turning in my gut.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d the pain in his voice is evident, and I slow down, turning to face him.</p> <p>As soon at my eyes meet his, a car squeals around the corner of the building, coming to a halt behind Sid, who looks stunned for a second before his eyes get big as he watches a man jump out of the driver\u2019s side door and pull a gun from behind his back. I\u2019m frozen in place as I watch the scene unfold in front of me.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Sid roars, causing me to come out of my freeze.</p><p>I look around, gauging if I should try and make it into my car. I realize I won\u2019t be able to get there in time and start to take off on foot towards the emergency room entrance. I hear one shot then a grunt, and I know it was Sid getting shot. I don\u2019t even pause. I keep running, but I don\u2019t get far before I\u2019m grabbed around my waist. I start kicking my legs and clawing at the arm wrapped around me, but due to the fabric covering his skin, I can\u2019t do any damage.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yell as my face is shoved into the hard ground. I feel a gun shoved into my cheek so hard that I know I will bruise. I\u2019ve heard stories about people coming back from flatlining, but I\u2019ve never experienced it myself, so I don\u2019t know what it feels like, but I swear I die in this moment. I feel two shots as pain explodes in my body, but after that, all I feel is myself floating away.</p><p>Kenton</p><p>\u201cMan, Kenton. Fuck.\u201d Justin\u2019s distressed voice sounds over the line as soon as I put my phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve been on edge all day; something has felt off since I woke up.</p><p>It took everything in me to let Autumn go to work. I knew that, if I tried to stop her, she would\u2019ve flipped the f**k out, but something isn\u2019t right. I\u2019ve been in contact with her all day. She even joked during the last call that I must really miss her, \u2019cause I wouldn\u2019t stop phoning.</p> <p>\u201cI need you to get to Vanderbilt,\u201d Justin says with forced calmness.</p><p>My gut tightens, and I know before he even says it that it\u2019s Autumn. \u201cTell me she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I\u2019m gonna meet you there,\u201d Justin tells me, and I can feel the pain in his voice as the words leave his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d I clip, hanging up, and I race out of the office, jump in my car, and head downtown.</p><p>When I pull into the parking lot of the hospital, I see that the news cameras and police cars have settled around the entrance of the emergency room. I spot Finn near the front doors in the crowd. I pull my car into the ambulance parking lot and get out, ignoring the yells from everyone around me. I toss Finn my keys before running into the building.</p><p>The minute I make it around the corner, the nurse\u2019s station comes into view, and unlike most of the times I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s completely empty. I run down the hall to where they took Finn the night he had been shot and stop dead when I reach the door. My eyes lock on Autumn through the small, glass window.</p><p>Her shirt is off.</p><p>Her skin is covered in blood.</p><p>Doctors and nurses are surrounding her.</p><p>My legs start to get weak and my stomach starts to turn. I swear I feel my life ending as I watch them work on her. I hear, \u201cCode red,\u201d from the other side of the door as someone pulls a set of paddles off the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d someone says as I feel a hand on my shoulder and turn my head. \u201cThis is a personnel-only area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I look over the nurse\u2019s shoulder and see Justin coming down the hall towards us. Girlfriend? Yes, she\u2019s my girlfriend, but she\u2019s also my future...and she is lying on the other side of that door, covered in blood, and they are calling a code red. FUCK! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s still not allowed back here. You need to wait in the waiting area.\u201d</p><p>I try to look back in the room, but this time, the nurse blocks the door. \u201cI need to be with her.\u201d My voice is gruff to my own ears. As a man who hasn\u2019t cried since he was young, I\u2019m shocked to feel wetness on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hun, but you still can\u2019t be here,\u201d she repeats compassionately this time. \u201cCome with me and I\u2019ll show you where to wait, and as soon as we know anything, a doctor will be out to speak with you and her family.\u201d</p><p>Family?</p> <p>I\u2019m her family.</p><p>She\u2019s my family.</p><p>I\u2019m her goddamn family!</p><p>I look at the ground, shaking my head, my hand going to the back of my neck. I can still hear loud voices from the other side of the door, but I can\u2019t make out what they are saying.</p><p>\u201cI need to be with her,\u201d I repeat, but this time, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying it for me or for the nurse.</p> <p>\u201cThose doctors in there will do everything within their power to help her, honey. Right now, you just need to be strong for her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I will ever be strong again if she doesn\u2019t make it. I shake my head at my own thoughts. If she doesn\u2019t make it, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do. My whole life with her flashes before my eyes\u2014the way she smiles, the look she gets when she looks at me, her kindness and generosity to everyone she meets. All the things we would miss out on, like her wearing my ring, our wedding, her having my child, and the little moments you take for granted every f**king day because you always think there will be a tomorrow.</p><p>I knew my own piece of heaven was too much to ask for. I f**king knew it was too good to be true.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, hun.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even know that I\u2019m following her until I hear Justin tell her that Autumn\u2019s his sister when she asks if there\u2019s anyone she should contact. He tells her that he\u2019ll call everyone. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m breathing when my parents show up. It isn\u2019t until my mom wraps her arms around me that I feel something.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong, baby,\u201d Mom whispers to me.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t make it without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d she replies softly, and I feel her tears seeping into my skin.</p><p>I pull away and put my head between my legs, praying for the first time in years. I pray to every god out there or anyone who will listen.</p><p>\u201cAre you all the family of Autumn Freeman?\u201d</p><p>I stand up immediately, taking in the room for the first time since I got here. My family, some of Autumn\u2019s friends, and my men are all sprawled throughout the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her fianc\u00e9,\u201d I tell the doctor, walking towards him.</p><p>His eyes take me in, and then Justin is at my side. \u201cI\u2019m her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk in private, or can I speak openly in front of everyone present?\u201d</p> <p>I looked around again at all the people in the room. \u201cWe can talk here,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cLet me start out by saying she is stable but still in critical condition.\u201d</p><p>I feel my legs get weak and I let out a long breath.</p><p>\u201cShe suffered two gunshot wounds: one to the shoulder that hit a major artery and one to the face. The one to the shoulder caused her to lose massive amounts of blood, and the one to the face went in her cheek through her lower jaw, shattering it.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cShe\u2019s a very lucky woman. Though the injuries are significant, we do expect her to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>I lean my head back, saying a silent thank-you to whoever answered my prayers before looking at the doctor again. \u201cWhen can I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, she\u2019s being moved to the ICU. After we get her settled into her room, we will let you know when you can see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cShe will only be allowed visitors for fifteen minutes at a time, and no more than two people in the room with her.\u201d I nod and he keeps going. \u201cHer recovery is going to be a long one. The amount of damage to her jaw alone will take months to heal. I have to tell you...if it weren\u2019t for the man who attacked her assailant, this conversation would probably be a lot different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, wondering what the f**k I missed over the last few hours while I sat here feeling like my world was ending.</p><p>\u201cA man named Sidney Sharp was there when the attack occurred. He was shot in the chest but was able to make it to your fianc\u00e9e and somehow stop her assault.\u201d</p><p>What the f**k was Sid doing here? \u201cThe gunman?\u201d I ask aloud.</p><p>\u201cHe got away. The police are looking for him.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath, letting it out slowly. I need to keep it together long enough to see that Autumn gets better, but then I\u2019m going to track down the stupid f**k and kill him.</p><p>\u201cDid Sid make it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the ICU now but is expected to recover as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d I shake his hand then go back to my seat. I lean my head back and close my eyes. Whoever did this is going to f**king die, and I don\u2019t give a f**k who or how many people I have to kill to make that happen.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>The Slaughterhouse</p><p>Kenton</p><p>\u201cThey agreed she was off-limits,\u201d I remind Justin, sitting back in my chair.</p><p>We were going over what happened at the hospital after watching the tapes from the night of the shooting. I hated seeing the video of Autumn getting shot, but it was the only way to know exactly what happened. The video footage was grainy and the images distorted, but I could still make out what happened. Autumn is adamant that the shooter from the club is the guy who shot her, and I will always trust her over anyone else.</p><p>It\u2019s been two weeks since everything went down. I\u2019ve been working leads as they come in, but most of my time has been spent with her since she woke up from the medically induced coma they\u2019d been keeping her in. She can\u2019t talk because they have her jaw wired closed, but she does recognize everyone and has been able to write things down, and that\u2019s the most important thing in all of this.</p><p>The first time I saw her after I was let into the ICU, it took everything in me to stay upright. Her head was wrapped in gauze, only her lips and eyes visible. She looked like a science experiment gone wrong. There were tubes and wires attached all over her body, leading to the machines that were surrounding her bed.</p><p>I used every muscle in my body to get my legs to move me to her. When I reached the bed, I fell to my knees at her side and dropped my forehead to the top of her hand. I stayed like that for a long time, just thankful to feel the warmth in her hand and hear the sound of her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I lifted my head and my eyes looked down at her empty finger, I knew I would put my ring where it belonged, where I should\u2019ve put it months ago, but I had been concerned that I was moving too fast for her. Now, I don\u2019t care. I know she loves me, and I know that the love I have for her is something I\u2019ve never felt for another person and what that meant for us.</p><p>So that night, I talked to my mom and she gave me my grandmas\u2019 ring, the same one that\u2019s been in our family for generations\u2019. The oval-cut sapphire ring has diamonds around the center stone and down the band. It\u2019s the ring I knew would sit on the finger of the woman I love since I was old enough to understand its meaning.</p><p>I went to the hospital the next day, and like it was meant to be, I slid the ring on her and it fit perfectly. I knew that, when she woke up, she would have a long road to recovery, but I also knew that we were going to go on with our lives together and there would be no more putting stuff off until tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cMan, he\u2019s the only person I can think of who would have the balls to hurt her,\u201d Justin says, bringing me out of my head.</p> <p>\u201cGet Kai on the phone.\u201d I run a hand through my hair, frustrated that this shit is happening. I feel torn between needing to be with Autumn and needing this finished so we can move on with our lives knowing that there is no longer a threat once she\u2019s out of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d He stands up and leaves the office.</p><p>I turn my head and look at Finn.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGo to the hospital, talk to Sid, and see if he told anyone about his visit here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDone.\u201d He stands but stops at the door. \u201cHow\u2019s Autumn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing better than they thought she would be at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she think of the ring?\u201d he smirks.</p><p>I smile for the first time in hours and shake my head. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t taken it off and thrown it at me, so I\u2019m taking that as a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, man. You\u2019re both real f**kin\u2019 lucky.\u201d He shakes his head and I see something flash in his eyes before he leaves the office.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what that was about and don\u2019t have time to find out right now, but it looks like, when the water calms, I need to have a sit-down with my boy.</p> <p>I run a hand over my head before picking up the phone when I see that Justin is calling. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKai will be calling any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heading to the hospital soon?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look at the clock and check the time. \u201cYeah. They should be moving her out of the ICU today and I want to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there at some point,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>Justin has been at the hospital as much as I have. I can tell that the thought of losing Autumn from his life has affected him as much as it has me. He isn\u2019t in love with her, but he loves her like a sister and is one more family member she didn\u2019t have before but has now.</p><p>\u201cSee you.\u201d I hang up. A few minutes later, I answer the phone, looking at the clock again. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was told you need to speak with me,\u201d Kai says, and I lean forward and feel my muscles tense.</p><p>\u201cI need you to set up another meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your situation, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not f**king tell me you can\u2019t get me a meeting,\u201d I cut him off, feeling the phone cracking in my hand. \u201cThis is my woman. I need this shit done so when she comes home, she knows she\u2019s safe. Get me the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting me in a very bad position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if this shit happened to your woman?\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cKill every single motherfucker who even thought about hurting her,\u201d he replies back, his tone dark.</p><p>\u201cGive me what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the call, but you owe me,\u201d he replies.</p><p>Kai isn\u2019t the kind of guy I like owing favors to, but at this point, I would make a deal with the devil to get what I need. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry about what happened.\u201d</p><p>I hear the sincerity in his voice, but that does nothing to ease the fury that\u2019s been pumping through my veins since this shit went down.</p><p>\u201cMe too. Call me when it\u2019s set up.\u201d I hang up and shove my phone in my pocket before heading to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou told me she was off-limits,\u201d I tell the two men sitting across from me. \u201cYou said you were putting a leash on your f**king dog.\u201d I got into Vegas two hours ago on Sven\u2019s private plane after I learned that Paulie Amidio had agreed to have a sit-down with me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201d Paulie Amidio Jr. asks, sitting forward.</p><p>His father, Paulie Sr., puts his hand on his shoulder, pulling him back. Anyone can tell they are family. They are both dressed identically in black suits, both have dark hair slicked back from their faces, and both have dark skin and crystal-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe were under the impression that it was over. Unfortunately for all parties involved, Vincent didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d Paulie Sr. starts rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t care what the f**k is going on in their organization; the only thing I care about is getting this shit settled.</p><p>\u201cMy men are looking for him now,\u201d he says, and his son nods.</p><p>\u201cI need a list of the people he associates with.\u201d I will find him myself if I have to.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is Match.com?\u201d Paulie Jr. asks, and it takes everything in me not to shoot him in the f**king head. This little f**k is greedy for power. I saw it during our first meeting, and I see it now.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d his dad says in a harsh tone.</p><p>\u201cFuck that, Pop. This is bullshit,\u201d Junior says, starting to stand.</p><p>His dad wraps his hand around his arm and pulls him back down into his chair. \u201cThis is my f**king family. You do what I say when I f**king say it,\u201d Senior tells him, slamming his fist onto the table in front of him. When the younger man\u2019s eyes come to me, I see embarrassment and anger, but he covers it quickly, ducking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get you the information you asked for, but if you find him, you bring him to me,\u201d Paulie Sr. compromises.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d I ask, because in my mind, death is the only option at this point.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s family business,\u201d he says vaguely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work for me. He put two bullets in my woman. I want him six feet under,\u201d I state, trying to keep my cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a threat to you after I get him.\u201d His tone is cold, and I immediately nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for your call,\u201d I tell him, standing and leaving the room.</p><p>Kai doesn\u2019t follow me out into the parking lot right away, so I take the time to call my mom and check in. She gives me an update about Autumn and Tubs, telling me that both are okay and Autumn seems to be doing a lot better today; she got out of bed and took a shower. That\u2019s all great news, but it would be better if I were there to see it for myself. Autumn was upset that I was leaving, and I could see it in her eyes that she was afraid, but I needed to see to this situation myself. I\u2019m not leaving anything to chance.</p><p>\u201cTell me where the f**k Vincent is,\u201d I growl, digging my thumb into the open wound on Alfeo\u2019s thigh. I have been at this for over two hours and still have nothing.</p> <p>I picked up Alfeo outside his place of business in Vegas at a house known for selling pu**y. Normally, I would turn my eyes at this, but Justin got back to me with information, and this house has been on the cop\u2019s radar for the last year. They\u2019ve beentrying to build a case against Alfeo. Seems he has a preference, and that preference is for young girls who are mostly runaways and high school dropouts with nowhere and no one to turn to. He gets them addicted to blow and then puts them to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you shit,\u201d Alfeo says as spit and blood fly out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the right answer.\u201d I pull the knife I shoved into his left thigh out and slam it into his right one.</p><p>His scream fills the small space, and I shake my head. For a man who acts so f**king hard, he sure as f**k screams like a chick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting really f**king sick of this game. Tell me what I want to know or I\u2019ll put a bullet in your f**king head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d He tries to sit forward, but the ropes around his arms and legs hold him in place.</p><p>I pull out one of the guns Sven gave me from behind my back and hold it to the side of his head. \u201cLast chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said before...fuck you,\u201d he spits.</p><p>I pull the trigger, letting one off into his shoulder. I don\u2019t want to give him another chance, but he\u2019s been one of Vincent\u2019s sidekicks since they were young. I only have three men who\u2019ve been in contact with Vincent over the last three years, so I don\u2019t have a lot of options.</p><p>\u201cYou shot me!\u201d I make out through his screams of agony.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it again if you don\u2019t tell me what the f**k I need to know.\u201d I put the gun back to his head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything for you, you piece of shit!\u201d His eyes go wide with panic.</p><p>\u201cWell then, Alfeo, our time here\u2019s up.\u201d I pull the trigger.</p><p>This time, the bullet goes through his temple and his brain splatters all over the wall. I will never get used to the stench that comes along with killing someone, I think as I go to the sink, wash off my arms and hands, and then begin thinking about my next move.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Kai asks.</p><p>I look at him then Sven over my shoulder. Both of them have been at my side since I left the meeting. They helped me get Alfeo to the basement I brought him to but have stayed back and let me handle this my way. I\u2019d expected Kai to go back to Hawaii, but he came out of the club when I was hanging up with my mom, his face contorted with rage. I didn\u2019t ask him what it was about, but I had a feeling the small woman I\u2019d gotten a glimpse of him kissing a couple of minutes before his men had taken her away as we\u2019d gone inside had something to do with that look. Sven, I knew, would have my back. The minute I called him from Tennessee telling him that I needed his plane, he was on it, coming to pick me up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find Carlo to see if he has anything to say,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna kill him too?\u201d Kai asks.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I look Kai dead in the eyes without saying anything else. These men are all f**king scum and do not deserve to breathe.</p> <p>\u201cJust making sure,\u201d he says, and I see his lips twitch.</p><p>I shake my head and listen as he makes a call to have someone come clean up my mess.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like we\u2019ve been here before?\u201d Sven asks Kai from behind me.</p><p>I ignore them and pull the blade out of Carlo\u2019s leg. I tilt my head back and forth, working out the kinks in my neck.</p><p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t know where he is!\u201d he shouts and then starts to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell did men start all this crying bullshit?\u201d Kai asks, stepping forward. \u201cYour man has no loyalty to you. Tell us where he is and this will be over,\u201d he says, getting down to Carlo\u2019s level.</p><p>\u201cSo you can kill me? Fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die one way or another, but think of it this way: you do the right thing and, when you get to the other side, God may have mercy on you,\u201d Kai says, but I disagree with him. This guy here is as bad as his friends. He has a history of beating women that goes back ages. His last girlfriend was in the hospital for a month after what he had done to her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him,\u201d he swears.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d I lift the blade I pulled from his thigh and slam it through his chest. He gasps for air, and I can almost visualize his lungs filling up with blood. \u201cTell me!\u201d I roar, losing patience.</p><p>He starts coughing and his body begins to convulse out of control in the chair.</p><p>\u201cNow you killed him and he didn\u2019t even tell us anything,\u201d I hear Sven say, but my eyes are locked on Carlo\u2019s mouth as I lip-read the word \u2018slaughterhouse.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the slaughterhouse?\u201d I ask Sven.</p><p>His eyebrows come together and his hand goes to his suit\u2019s pants pocket. He pulls out his phone and types something in it before looking at me again. \u201cThere\u2019s a club named The Slaughterhouse downtown.\u201d</p><p>I pull the blade from Carlo\u2019s chest and watch as his body fights for air, hearing Sven ask, \u201cYou gonna end him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll die.\u201d I wrap my knife up in a thick piece of cloth and tuck it into my bag.</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to piss you off, Mayson,\u201d Kai mutters as Sven laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of f**ked-up place is this?\u201d I shout over the music as we walk into the club.</p><p>The room is dark, with an eerie, red glow. Hanging from the rafters, acrobats of both sexes are naked and dripping blood onto the crowd below them. Around the room, there are spotlights that shine down on different BDSM scenes being played out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we now know where they got the name from,\u201d Kai says as we make our way through the groupings of people in various states of undress.</p><p>After the cleanup crew came and got rid of Carlo\u2019s lifeless body, I sent Justin a message and had him look into The Slaughterhouse. His search turned up the name of a woman named Abigail Soscia. She\u2019s a twenty-six-year-old woman who has a police record as a prostitute but has been clean for the last ten years. How she got the money to open this place is the information I\u2019m interested in.</p><p>We make our way to the bar and Sven leans across, talking to the bartender. Then his eyes come to me and he lifts his chin towards the door at the side of the room. As soon as we make it through the door and head down the hall leading to the bottom of a set of stairs, a guy who I\u2019m assuming is a bouncer comes down the stairs and blocks my path, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I tell him, not in the mood for bullshit. I need to get home to my woman, and the only way I can do that is to get this shit handled.</p> <p>\u201cNo one goes upstairs.\u201d He glares. \u201cGo back to where you came from. This part of the building is off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you got a job to do, but you do not want to piss me off right now.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow, obviously finding me lacking.</p><p>\u201cA word of advice\u2014move,\u201d Sven says, and the bouncer\u2019s eyes go to Sven and then Kai before coming back to me.</p><p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d Kai says, and his arm swings around my head and coldcocks the guy right in the jaw. I watch in slow motion as his eyes roll back in his head and his body folds to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d Sven mumbles.</p><p>I step over the guy. When we reach the top of the stairs, we see that there are three doors, one on each side of the hall, and a set of blood-red double doors at the end face us. I head straight for them while Sven and Kai stay behind, blocking the first two doors.</p><p>I knock once, putting my hand on the gun in the waist of my pants, and I hear something mumbled from the other side, footsteps, and then a lock being turned. The door swings open and a tall woman with dark-red hair, which I can tell is natural \u2019cause it looks almost identical to Autumn\u2019s, wearing a pair of jeans and a black, skintight T-shirt looks at me with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis area is off-limits,\u201d she says.</p><p>I scan the room behind her and see that it\u2019s an office with a desk, a chair and a couch. I can\u2019t see any doors, so I know she\u2019s alone.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d I start herding her into the room.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Justice!\u201d she yells, backing up.</p><p>I\u2019m sure Justice is her bodyguard who is currently taking a Kai-induced nap.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a guy named Vincent?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flash with understanding and she shakes her head, looking around the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask as she goes behind her desk, trying to put space between us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I roar, my hand going to the top of her desk, sweeping everything off.</p><p>Her chest is moving rapidly as her eyes go from me to the floor. I look to where her eyes are pointed and they land on a photo that is now on the floor lying faceup. The painted, black, wooden frame shows off the photo of a little boy, a man who I know to be Vincent, and Abigail. They look like an everyday American family, all of them wearing the same dark jeans and white button-down shirts. They are sitting out in an open field of grass, and Abigail is looking down at her son with a smile on her face that says he is the love of her life. Vincent has a smile on his face as well, but his seems forced, and even through a picture, I can see the kind of man he is, almost like he has no soul.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been together?\u201d I nod towards the picture. Her eyes come to me and tears begin to fill them. \u201cHe shot my fianc\u00e9e at close range two times, once in the face and once in the shoulder,\u201d I tell her, reminding myself why I\u2019m here. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until I get him. I\u2019m sure you know I\u2019m not the only person looking for him. I\u2019m sure members of Lacamo have been here looking for him. I would hate for something to happen to you or your boy \u2019cause you\u2019re protecting him.\u201d</p><p>Her face softens and her hands wring together. \u201cI found out he was having another affair two weeks ago and kicked him out. Last I heard, he was staying with his latest piece in the penthouse at The Guardian.\u201d</p><p>I pull my phone out and send a text to Justin. It takes two minutes to get a message back letting me know that the penthouse has been rented out for a little over a week to a woman named Layla Harden. I look up from my phone after reading the message. I have a feeling that anyone who has any kind of relationship with Vincent at this time is in danger. He has screwed over the wrong people, and those people\u2019s moral compasses are f**ked up.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get your boy and get out of town for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a business to take care of.\u201d She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cFind someone you\u2014\u201d I\u2019m cut off mid-sentence when there is a loud bang in the hall followed by a lot of grunts.</p><p>We both turn towards the door when it\u2019s thrown open. I pull my gun as the bodyguard from downstairs crashes into the room with both Sven and Kai trying to hold him back. If this situation weren\u2019t so serious, I would laugh.</p><p>\u201cJustice, stop! I\u2019m okay!\u201d Abigail shouts, covering her mouth as she watches Kai and Sven attempt to take this guy down.</p><p>His eyes go to her, and I can see worry etched in his face. \u201cGet the f**k off me!\u201d he barks, batting Sven and Kai off him. He storms over to her, holding her face and looking her over. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she answers as tears slide down her cheeks. \u201cI have to get out of town.\u201d</p><p>I watch understanding light across his face, and he nods, looks over at me, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t have my gun on me or you would have a bullet in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice.\u201d She slaps his arm, bringing his attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he replies softly, and her eyes lower from his as a light blush creeps across her cheeks. \u201cI know a place we can go. Dex will love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d She looks away.</p><p>\u201cNo more bullshit, Abi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I can\u2019t see you like that,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you I don\u2019t give a f**k what you say anymore.

If I were you, I would find a way to prepare your boy for what\u2019s to come,\u201d Kai tells her.</p><p>She nods and understanding flits across her face before she grabs Justice\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s roll,\u201d I tell Kai and Sven.</p><p>I watch from down the hall as the small housekeeper I just paid a thousand bucks walks up to the large double doors at the end of the hall and knocks.</p><p>\u201cHousekeeping!\u201d she shouts through the door.</p> <p>When I see the door open and a woman wearing nothing answer, I make my move, pulling my gun and heading down the hall. The housekeeper runs away and the woman, who I\u2019m assuming is Layla, screams at the top of her lungs when I shove her inside. Vincent comes around the corner with a towel around his waist and a gun in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDrop it,\u201d I grumble.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d He raises the gun towards me and an almost silent shot goes off from behind my back. He falls to the ground, clutching the hand he was holding the gun with to his side.</p><p>I turn my head, expecting to see Sven or Kai, but it\u2019s one of Amidio\u2019s men who has his gun raised. Kai and Sven are both behind the other three members of Lacamo, looking ready to kill.</p><p>\u201cYou following me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs, and I walk over to Vincent, putting my boot to his hand, which is trying to pick up the gun, and I crush a few bones. He grunts pulling his hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d one of Amidio\u2019s other men says, bringing Vincent to his feet.</p><p>His face is now pale from the amount of blood he\u2019s lost; I\u2019m sure an artery was hit. One of the men brings over a towel, wrapping it around Vincent\u2019s wrist while the others start to clean up the mess.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a deal,\u201d I remind them.</p><p>\u201cDeal still stands. Right now, boss has some questions for him. We\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d he says as he and another man drag Vincent from the room while another man talks to Layla, who is crying hysterically.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Sven says, looking between Kai and me.</p><p>\u201cNow, we wait.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t until two in the morning that Kai gets a message to head downtown. When we arrive at the location, I\u2019m surprised by the amount of cars gathered outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d Kai asks, looking over at his man, Frank, in the driver\u2019s seat. How the hell he got the name Frank when he\u2019s Hawaiian and looks like he could be a sumo wrestler is anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. You want me to come in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Kai shakes his head, looking around at all the cars. \u201cThese men know not to f**k with me.\u201d He gets out of the SUV and bends over, pulling something out from under the seat and putting it in the waist of his pants. \u201cKeep it running and use your gun if you have to. If something seems off, leave, get Myla, and head to my parents\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said they know not to f**k with you,\u201d Frank tells him, pulling his gun from his inside coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t stupid, brother,\u201d Kai mutters, slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cMyla won\u2019t be happy,\u201d I hear Frank say as I slam my door.</p><p>When we get to the building\u2019s entrance, one of the guys from the hotel earlier meets us out front and escorts us inside and down a hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d I ask when we\u2019re taken into a large room.</p><p>It is full of men of all different ages yelling at the top of their lungs as a man in the center of the room pulls a pair of metal cutters from his pocket and walks to Vincent, who is strapped to a chair. He picks up Vincent\u2019s hand and touches each of his fingers with the tip of the clippers before settling on one.</p><p>Vincent doesn\u2019t even flinch when his finger is clipped off and it rolls across the floor. His body is now black and blue, and he\u2019s bleeding from his nose, mouth, and other wounds. I can tell just by looking at him that he\u2019s in shock. The good in me fights to the surface, not wanting any human being to suffer like he is, but then I remind myself of the shit he\u2019s done and how much pain he\u2019s caused and the urge to end his pain is beat back as anger is put in its place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up next,\u201d Paulie Jr. says, walking up to me and handing me a knife. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayback. He betrayed a lot of people, and all those people get their pound of flesh before he\u2019s ended,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cTake this back.\u201d I hand him back the knife and pull my gun.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him, and you only get one hit,\u201d Junior tells me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I walk past him to the center of the room.</p><p>Vincent raises his eyes, but at this point, with the kind of damage that\u2019s been done to his body already, I would be surprised if he even understands what\u2019s going on. When I reach his side, I put the gun to his shoulder at the same place he shot Autumn. Then I think about her face, the damage that\u2019s been done, and how, regardless of how much she heals, every time she looks in the mirror, she will be reminded of what happened. I pull the gun away from his shoulder and walk around to the front of him. My hand moves to his jaw and I pull it open.</p><p>\u201cI told you, you can\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him, put the gun in Vincent\u2019s mouth, and lean it to the side so the muzzle is sitting against the inside of his cheek. I feel a gun come to rest at the side of my head, and I start to say something when Kai comes over and whispers inaudibly to Paulie Jr., making him back up.</p><p>\u201cYou shot my girl,\u201d I say quietly, tilting his head back and forcing his eyes to mine. \u201cYou know I could kill your son and wife and you can\u2019t do shit about it,\u201d I taunt only loud enough for him to hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes widen and I know he understands. Before he can respond, I pull the trigger, and blood and flesh spray out across the room and onto some of the people who are standing too close.</p><p>A loud cheer goes up as I make my way back to Sven and Kai. When I reach them, I notice a man talking to Kai. He\u2019s young\u2014I would guess mid-twenties. He\u2019s wearing a suit and his blond hair is pulled back into a ponytail. His posture is casual, but the expression on his face is anything but.</p><p>\u201cWe good?\u201d I ask, stepping into the mix when the man presses his chest into Kai\u2019s.</p><p>His eyes come to me and he looks me up and down before looking back at Kai. \u201cTell Myla I send my love,\u201d the guy says, starting to walk off.</p> <p>I put a hand to Kai\u2019s chest when I see a look I\u2019ve become familiar with over the last few weeks come across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even get to say my wife\u2019s name!\u201d Kai growls, grabbing the guy around the throat.</p><p>Wife? I look at Kai\u2019s hand and notice for the first time that a very thick band is wrapped around his left ring finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Paulie Sr. asks, walking up and putting a hand on Kai\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJust making a few things clear,\u201d Kai says, shoving the guy away from him. The guy looks like he wants to say something before thinking better of it and walking away. \u201cLet\u2019s get the f**k out of here,\u201d Kai says, shrugging off Senior\u2019s hand.</p> <p>I look at the older man and give him a chin lift before leaving the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d Sven asks Kai, and he nods, but I notice that his body is still tight and his fingers have started rolling his wedding band around his knuckle. I don\u2019t say anything, but I do watch closely as he and Frank have some kind of silent conversation. Sven looks at me and shakes his head, saying, \u201cI\u2019m gonna call and have the plane ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d I tell him, sitting back. I pull out my phone, sending a message to Autumn, telling her that I love her and I will be home soon. It didn\u2019t take long for her reply to come through. The simple \u201cI miss you\u201d message has me smiling to myself. A few more hours and I would be home with my woman, leaving all this shit behind us.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Future, Meet Past</p><p>Autumn</p> <p>I look in the mirror and turn my head to the side, taking in my face. My jaw is still slightly swollen, but for the most part, I have healed completely. I know I\u2019m the one who said that I hated being beautiful, but when I was able to see myself in the mirror at the hospital for the first time, all I could think about was how disgusting I looked. My face was swollen and deformed, my lips cracked from being so dry. It wasn\u2019t so much that I cared what I looked like, but I was worried Kenton would see me and the look of love I was so used to receiving from him would turn into something else. I didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>I should have known better though. The first time he saw me without the bandages covering my face, his hand gently cupped my cheek while his eyes told me everything I needed to know. I knew he loved me before everything happened, but now, I will never doubt it again.</p><p>I look down at my hand and remember when I saw my engagement ring for the first time. I was sitting up in bed, my head swimming due to the pain medication I was on, but Kenton was there to see me and I never wanted to go without spending a single second with him. We were talking. Well, he was talking; I was writing everything down on a white board they had given me. My face was bent towards my hand when my eyes caught on something on my finger. At first, I thought it was a bug, but then my eyes focused on the sapphire and diamonds and my breath caught in my throat, making me feel like I was going to pass out from lack of oxygen.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d I heard him urge, and I gulped down a lungful of oxygen as my eyes filled with tears. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d His hand covers mine on the whiteboard before I could write YES. \u201cI already told everyone you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9e, so you have to say yes. Maybe I should take your pen from you so you don\u2019t have a say,\u201d he mumbled, and I growled. \u201cSo what will it be? You gonna make an honest man out of me?\u201d</p><p>His hand left mine and I wrote MAYBE in large, bold letters on the board.</p><p>\u201cYou must feel better if you\u2019re f**king with me.\u201d He smiled and my heart contracted. \u201cNow, will you please just f**king say yes?\u201d</p><p>If I could have smiled, I would have. My head bent and I wiped the board off before writing YES across the whole surface. The smile that lit up his face was one I would never forget until the day I die. His fingers went to the ring, rolling it back and forth on my finger.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he whispered. I nodded, feeling tears fill my eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d His forehead touched mine. I lifted my hand and held it against his cheek.</p> <p>I shake my head out of my thoughts when I hear something coming from down the hall. I peek my head around the corner just in time to see Tubs running with a pair of Kenton\u2019s boxers, taking them with him down the stairs. I shake my head and go back to getting ready, figuring that Kenton can deal with him. I hear Tubs bark and Kenton growl, and I start to laugh.</p><p>When my eyes go back to the mirror, I see the dimple in my cheek I didn\u2019t have before the shooting. My hand lifts and my finger runs over the mark. It\u2019s funny how something that seems so innocent can come out of something so painful.</p><p>I clear my head and finish getting ready. Tonight is the night I marry Kenton. Well, kind of. When I got out of the hospital, Kenton wanted to go right to the courthouse and get married, but I wanted to at least have his family there to witness us starting our lives together.</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree with me. He didn\u2019t want to put it off another day, so we compromised. We got married two days after I was released, and he promised me that, when I was completely healed, he would throw me a huge reception, where I could wear a dress and he would wear a suit, and that way, I could have the wedding pictures I really wanted.</p><p>I finish my hair and makeup, and when I hear someone coming up the stairs, I smile as Tara calls out my name.</p><p>\u201cIn the bathroom!\u201d I yell, touching up my lipstick.</p><p>\u201cYour dog molested me when I walked into the house. I think it\u2019s time you got him fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. Not yet anyways. Only one of his balls has dropped,\u201d I tell her, walking into our bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she asks, and I can\u2019t help the laugh that escapes me.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, but don\u2019t bring it up in front of Kenton. It\u2019s a sore subject.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a sore subject?\u201d Kenton asks, walking into the room, wearing his usual jeans and T-shirt. I cannot wait until later\u2014when I get to see him in his tux.</p><p>\u201cYour dog having one ball,\u201d Tara teases him.</p><p>His eyes narrow and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you heading to your mom\u2019s?\u201d I ask in a rush, knowing what\u2019s coming if I don\u2019t change the subject.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. I just came up to kiss you,\u201d he says sweetly.</p><p>I smile as he walks towards me. His eyes move from my mouth to my cheek and then to my eyes. I see pain cross his features, but he quickly covers it. He told me the other day that he loves my dimple, just hates what it reminds him of. I can\u2019t imagine being in his position, thinking he was going to die. He hasn\u2019t talked much about what happened while I was in the hospital, but before he left, I could sense that he was ready to snap at any moment.</p><p>Since he got back from Vegas, he\u2019s seemed much more at ease. He hasn\u2019t told me what exactly went down when he was away, just that I was safe now. I asked about the police and what they were doing, but all he told me was that sometimes justice isn\u2019t provided by law enforcement. What that means is anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>His mouth touches mine in a soft kiss, bringing me back to the moment. When my eyes meet his, I take a deep breath, willing myself not to cry.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you at the altar.\u201d I smile, and he shakes his head, kissing me again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already my wife,\u201d he says against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper then start to giggle when I hear Tara making gagging noises. I look around Kenton at her. \u201cYou know I have seen you with Finn, right?\u201d I ask her, watching a blush creep across her cheeks.</p><p>She and Finn got together while I was in the hospital. She had been in the ER while I was being worked on and was a wreck when they took me to the ICU. Finn found her sitting in the hospital chapel and didn\u2019t leave her side. Since then, they have been inseparable. It\u2019s funny to watch him with her. He never lets her leave his side when they are in the same room. Life is crazy sometimes. The guy who seemed to take life as a joke has done a complete turnaround.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut it,\u201d she growls, picking up a pillow from the bed and tossing it at me.</p><p>I laugh and Kenton kisses the smile off my face. This time when he pulls away, it takes a few minutes to pull myself together enough to finish getting ready.</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to do this, right? We can run away and live on a beach somewhere, drinking from coconuts and using banana leaves as clothes,\u201d Justin says.</p> <p>I look at him and raise an eyebrow. \u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s sick. I don\u2019t want to even see you without a shirt, much less wearing nothing but a banana leaf. Second, you\u2019re like a brother to me, so that\u2019s just weird. And third, I\u2019m already married to Kenton, so it really doesn\u2019t matter if I walk down the aisle or not at this point.\u201d</p><p>I watch his eyes go soft and he puts his arm around my shoulders, pulling me into his side before kissing my hair. \u201cI love you too, sis, and I\u2019m honored to walk you down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mess up my makeup by making me cry, I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d I tell him, putting my arms around his waist and laying my head against his chest.</p><p>When I was little, I used to wonder who my dad was. My mom never talked about him, and if I did bring him up, she would get pissed, so I learned quickly not to ask questions. Kenton asked me if I wanted him to look for him, but I don\u2019t know if I want to do that. When Nancy and I talked about the wedding\u2014or renewal of vows\u2014she asked who I wanted to walk me down the aisle. At first, I said no one, but then I thought about all the people I have gained as family here. Then I thought about Link and wished he would be here to do it, but he was taking care of the club for Sid. Then I thought about Justin, how much he means to me, and how important he is in my life, and I knew it had to be him. We may not be blood, but I know deep down we are family\u2014maybe not in the traditional sense, but in every way that counts.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go before you get my suit all wet,\u201d Justin says as we hear the music begin.</p><p>I look at myself in the mirror that\u2019s propped up against the side of the door one last time, making sure my dress is still in place. The white lace dress with cap sleeves that drapes under my shoulders hugs my body, showing off every curve until it reaches mid-thigh and bellows out similar to a mermaid\u2019s tail. I fell in love with this dress immediately when I tried it on at the bridal shop.</p><p>I pull the veil over my face and down around my shoulders, taking a deep breath. Tara looks at me and smiles, and I smile back as she opens the door. I take in the backyard of Kenton\u2019s parents\u2019 house. There are chairs on the grass, where all of our family and friends are seated so they can watch us say our vows. At the end of the aisle, Kenton is standing under a large arch that\u2019s been covered in tulle, lace, and flowers. My breath catches in my throat when I look at him in his tux. He is always gorgeous, but right now, as his eyes take me in, I have to do the same. His broad shoulders are covered in black material that shows off the expanse of his chest and the strength in his arms. His hair looks like he has been putting his hand through it all day, and the dark hue around his jaw that is always visible only adds to his hotness.</p><p>He asked me if he should shave, and I told him that, if he did, he wouldn\u2019t be getting lucky until his scruff grew back. He laughed and smiled, picked me up, put me on the bathroom counter, and ran his jaw along my inner thigh before looking up and whispering, \u201cTold you you would love it.\u201d Then he proceeded to shove his face between my legs, making me scream out his name. He was not wrong; I loved the way I could grab fistfuls of his hair to hold him in place and the way the roughness of his facial hair felt between my legs.</p> <p>I come out of the memory as I make it to the end of the aisle, and Kenton takes my hand from Justin. When I look into his eyes, his travel down my body and he mouths the words, \u201cHoly shit.\u201d I smile bigger and look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Kenton and Autumn,\u201d the pastor says, and my eyes go to him. \u201cIs there any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already married, so you can skip the part about anyone not wanting us joined together,\u201d Kenton says, cutting the pastor off, and I feel my cheeks get pink as everyone in the crowd starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll skip that part,\u201d the pastor says, looking at Kenton and laughing. He continues the ceremony, and when he asks Kenton if he will have me as his wife, Kenton\u2019s eyes come to me and I see the same look in his eyes that I saw the first time he said, \u201cI do.\u201d Every ounce of love he has for me is there right on the surface for me to see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t even remember saying, \u201cI do,\u201d when my veil is lifted and Kenton takes my mouth in a kiss that is way too hot for all of the people who are there to witness it. His tongue delves into my mouth, his body pressing against the length of mine. One hand is on my ass, his other hand on the back of my head, forcing it to the side so he can get deeper. I moan into his mouth as I feel his erection press into my belly.</p><p>The moment is broken when the catcalling and clapping starts.</p><p>He rips his mouth from mine and his lips go to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so f**king lucky my whole family\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes tighter and press my legs together the best I can to temper down the throb that\u2019s started in my core. When I open my eyes, I\u2019m almost bent backwards and Kenton still hasn\u2019t stood up.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper, looking at everyone watching us.</p><p>He presses his hips into my waist, letting me know why we\u2019re stuck. After a second, he stands us up and wraps his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cHow long until you can walk without me guarding you?\u201d I ask him while trying not to laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cGlad you think this is funny, babe, but I have no idea how I\u2019m going to make it through the rest of this party. You in that dress is a recipe for blue balls,\u201d he mumbles, giving me a squeeze. \u201cIf the cameraman wasn\u2019t at the end of the aisle waiting to capture this moment, I would say f**k it, but I don\u2019t think I want our kids looking at our wedding album one day and asking what\u2019s wrong with my pants.\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh and bury my face in his chest. It takes a minute or two for me to get my laughter under control, and by the time I\u2019ve calmed down, his hard-on is no longer pressing into me. I tilt my head back and he leans down, kissing me one more time. This time when his mouth leaves mine, his hand goes behind my back and his other under my legs. I squeal as he lifts me into the air, shouting, \u201cMy wife!\u201d More applause breaks out and I shake my head, looking out over the crowd at everyone I have come to know and love.</p> <p>I look around the backyard and smile. It\u2019s now dark, and there are twinkling white lights running overhead across the entire area. The center of the yard has been turned into a dance floor with tables set up along the edge, each with a large centerpiece in the middle made out of large glass bowls with candles floating in them and stones at the bottom that match the forget-me-nots and white roses I carried in my bouquet. The whole backyard looks like something out of a romance novel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you and Kenton,\u201d November says, bouncing April, one of her little girls, on her thigh while another runs around us.</p><p>Her and Asher\u2019s other kids are off running around with the rest of the kids at the party. Kenton told me that the Maysons are trying to take over the world with their offspring, but I didn\u2019t believe him until there were kids running around the backyard.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her, smiling at the little girl on her lap. She holds her hands out for me to take her, and I look at November, who nods. \u201cHi.\u201d I smile, looking into her cute little face.</p><p>She pats my cheek with her hand then pulls herself closer to me, laying her head against my chest. I feel tears start to sting my nose then look around when I feel someone watching me. My eyes meet Kenton\u2019s and his go from mine to the little girl, who is now fighting to keep her eyes open as she plays with the stones of the necklace I\u2019m wearing.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to be joining the club soon,\u201d November says.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I murmur before looking down at the sleeping baby girl in my arms then over at Kenton, who hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off me. The look in his eyes makes my belly flutter, and the word, \u201cMaybe,\u201d comes out of my mouth before I can think better of it.</p><p>November starts to laugh, and I look at her and smile.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, you\u2019re needed out on the dance floor,\u201d I hear through the speakers set up around the backyard.</p><p>My eyes go to the dance floor, and Kenton is standing there in the center with his hand reaching out to me. I get up from my chair, handing a sleeping April to her mom. I walk to the dance floor, my stomach in knots. When my fingers touch Kenton\u2019s, his hand wraps around mine and he pulls me into him just as All of Me by John Legend starts to play. Tears fill my eyes as I listen to the lyrics of the song. When Kenton\u2019s lips whisper words of how he loves all my curves, edges, and imperfections, my face goes into his chest and the lyrics of the song sing to my soul like they were written just for us.</p><p>When the song ends, Kenton looks over my shoulder and nods, and I turn my head to see who he\u2019s looking at. Sid is standing off to the side, his hands in his suit pockets. I put out my hand to him and he shakes his head, walking towards me. He saved my life the night I was shot. If he hadn\u2019t been there, I have no doubt I would have been shot again. I put my hand in Sid\u2019s as I feel Kenton kiss my hair. He still doesn\u2019t like Sid, but he now tolerates him.</p><p>I finish my dance with Sid and go right to Kenton. His arms wrap around me and I look up into his eyes, saying a silent, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the night is a complete blur. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to get my shoes off; they feel like they are imbedded into my feet. I have laughed and danced more tonight than I ever thought possible. When all the men went to the dance floor, I almost fell out of my seat laughing, watching them dance to Larger Than Life by the Backstreet Boys. I couldn\u2019t imagine a more perfect night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to fall asleep on me, are you?\u201d Kenton asks as he kisses the top of my hair.</p> <p>\u201cNo way. I want to see where we\u2019re going for our honeymoon,\u201d I tell him, leaning my head back to see his face.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know until we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I know they tell you where you\u2019re going when you check in at the airport.</p><p>\u201cSven\u2019s letting us borrow his plane as a wedding present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. So you\u2019re telling me we\u2019re going on a private plane?\u201d I ask, my mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019ve always been curious about the mile high club,\u201d he says with a shrug. A smile forms on my lips and his eyes drop to my mouth. \u201cYou like that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda can\u2019t wait to show you your surprise,\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cIf it has anything to do with you naked, then I can\u2019t wait either.\u201d He bends down, pressing his mouth to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d I say breathlessly when his mouth leaves mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time we get into Kenton\u2019s car and head to the airport for our honeymoon, my eyes are so heavy that I\u2019m not sure how I will keep them open. I make it onto the plane and find a seat as Kenton talks to the stewardess and pilot. I can\u2019t imagine living the life Sven does, but he always seems so down to earth. I adjust my wedding dress and lean my head back, just wanting to close my eyes for a few minutes before I go take the dress off.</p><p>I wake up, feeling a kiss to my lips then forehead. My eyes slowly open and Kenton\u2019s face is the first thing I see before I look around, seeing the sun streaming through a set of open doors. Bits and pieces of last night come back to me, but most of it is hazy.</p><p>\u201cI missed all the good stuff, didn\u2019t I?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou slept like the dead, babe.\u201d He chuckles, kissing my nose.</p><p>\u201cI even slept through you taking off my dress.\u201d I close my eyes in disappointment. I had on a beautiful, strapless, lace bra and panties that matched it. I know he says that he loves my plain undergarments, but even I thought I looked hot in what I had on under my dress.</p><p>\u201cI loved the lace, but I prefer you as you are now,\u201d he says softly, his hand moving under the sheet along my belly then up, cupping one breast before traveling down to run along the top of my pubic bone. His tongue runs over my nipple and he pulls away, blowing on it and watching as it puckers. \u201cYes, I love you like this.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, pulling my nipple into his mouth. This time, the heat has me arching back and grabbing a handful of his hair. His mouth travels from my breast, up my neck, and to my mouth, where he kisses me deeply as his tongue delves into my mouth. His long, thick fingers slide between my folds and down over my clit before entering me, curling up, and then hitting that spot that makes my toes start to curl.</p><p>\u201cYesssss,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cAlready so hot and wet for me.\u201d He bites my earlobe before licking and sucking down my neck. He moves so that his body is over mine and his thighs are pushing mine apart. His hands hold each of mine, pulling them up near my head. I lift up, biting into his chin. His mouth takes mine, and I moan when I feel the head of his c**k touch my clit before it lowers, bumping against my entrance. Then the tip slips inside before pulling out, going too far. My mouth pulls from his and I try to lift my hands, wanting to grab his ass to pull him into me.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d he whispers, bending his head, biting and sucking one nipple before moving to the other one and torturing it the same way.</p><p>My hands are fighting to get free, wanting so badly to grab him. His hands shift to hold on to my wrist, forcing my hands flat down on the bed. His hips shift forward and he enters me again, this time thrusting fast and hard. My hips rise up to meet his, my legs wrapping around his waist.</p><p>I start to feel that deep tingle in my core, but just when I know I\u2019m going to come, he pulls out, his hands release mine, and his body shifts. Then his hands push my thighs farther apart and his mouth lands on my center, pulling my clit between his lips. I come on a scream, my hands holding on to his hair as I ride out my orgasm.</p><p>His mouth lifts, and before I even come down from my high, he flips me to my elbows and knees and his hand slides up my spine to the back of my neck, pressing my head deeper into the mattress. Then his hands go to my hips and lift them higher, and he surges deep inside on a swift thrust.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d I moan and start to get up on my hands when they are grabbed from the mattress, pulled behind my back, and used to pull me back into him so hard that the slapping of his skin against mine causes a slight sting against my ass.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, baby. Give me what I want.\u201d He thrusts harder, and this time when I start to feel the pull to come, he releases my hands and pulls me up against his chest. His mouth moves to my ear. His hands separate, one zeroing in on my clit, the other pulling one nipple. I come hard and fast, bucking against him. \u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he mumbles in my ear, his thrusts slowing until he plants himself deep inside me, where I can feel him pulsing.</p><p>His hand releases my breast, traveling up my neck and turning my face towards his before he takes my mouth in a deep kiss. He pulls out of me, making me whimper, then flops down on the bed, pulling me down on top of him. I lie there in silence for a few minutes, listening to the sound of water while feeling the slight breeze coming from outside glide across my damp skin.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we anyways?\u201d I ask, getting up on an elbow so I can look down at him.</p><p>\u201cGo look out the door.\u201d He smiles, and I debate on whether or not I want to get up before pulling myself away from him.</p><p>I find his shirt at the end of the bed and quickly slip it on over my head before walking to the doors. The closer I get to the doors, the brighter it gets outside. My breath catches as I take in the view before me. There is a pink beach that leads to water so blue that it looks like a painting.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper and feel hands slide around my waist. My hands slide over Kenton\u2019s and I tilt my head back so I can look into his eyes. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bahamas.\u201d He smiles, bending down to kiss my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs the beach pink or are my eyes playing tricks on me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Who would have thought there was a place in the world with pink-sand beaches?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say you put on that bikini I saw in your bag and we go snorkeling?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I smile and nod before completely turning around in his arms. \u201cThank you for this.\u201d I get up on my tiptoes, press my mouth to his, and then duck under his arm, running back into the room so I can put my suit on. I hear him laugh and the sound only makes me smile bigger.</p><p>The rest of our honeymoon is spent either in bed or on the beach. I can\u2019t imagine it being any more perfect.</p><p>\u201cBabe, get the door!\u201d Kenton yells from his office.</p><p>I roll my eyes and drop the shirt I was folding to the bed. \u201cYou could say please!\u201d I yell back, bouncing down the stairs with Tubs right behind me. I hear him laugh but don\u2019t hear him say please.</p><p>We have definitely fallen into the role of a married couple\u2014except I don\u2019t cook or clean. We have a housekeeper who comes once a week, and Kenton cooks dinner most nights, because anytime I get near a stove, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.</p><p>I swing the front door open and my world tilts. \u201cMom,\u201d I whisper in shock. Before I realize what\u2019s happening, her hand is coming across my face in a slap so hard that my head flies to the side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she hisses, lifting her hand again. I can hear Tubs going crazy.</p><p>\u201cI have never hit a woman in my life, but I will tell you right now. You touch her again and I will put you down,\u201d Kenton growls while stepping between my mom and me.</p><p>My hand hasn\u2019t moved from my cheek. I can still feel the sting of her slap, and my body heats up. My vision blurs\u2014not with tears, but with rage. I have been through hell and she shows up here not out of concern, but out of self-preservation. I know exactly why she\u2019s here.</p><p>Kenton found my father not long after we got home from our honeymoon. At first, I wasn\u2019t going to contact him, but after a long talk with Kenton and Nancy, I decided I had nothing to lose. If he didn\u2019t want to talk to me or have a relationship with me, it wouldn\u2019t hurt any more or any less than if I didn\u2019t reach out to him. So I called him, and to say he was adamant that I was a scammer is an understatement.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Justin sent him a copy of my medical records that he called me back. He told me that my mom told him that I\u2019d died when I was three and that I had been cremated. He said that he still had the urn that he believed my ashes were held in. He explained that my mom moved out of the area they lived in a few days after she dropped off what was supposed to be my remains to him, and he never heard from her again.</p><p>\u201cDo not come between me and my child,\u201d my mom hisses, trying to get around Kenton.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what comes over me, but the rage I have felt since I was young gives me the strength to get around Kenton\u2019s body, which I swear is expanding before my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow dare I? How dare I?\u201d I shriek at the top of my lungs. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re here because my father contacted you. How dare you keep him from me?! How dare you tell him I was dead and let him believe his only child was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not talk to me like that. I did what was best for you. He was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Because he didn\u2019t fit into your perfect little world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a garbageman,\u201d she says snottily.</p><p>\u201cAnd you slept with him for over two years!\u201d I yell, my hand balling into a fist at my side. I feel heat from Kenton at my back, his presence offering me strength. I know that, with him, I will be able to face any demons I have.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t good enough for me or you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved me!\u201d I scream, and without thinking, I smack her. My hand stings from the impact, but seeing the red tinge to her cheek somehow makes me feel better.</p><p>Her hand goes to her face and her eyes get big. \u201cYou little bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that scared little girl anymore, Mom,\u201d I tell her when I see her hand start to rise again. \u201cYou hit me and I will hit you back.\u201d</p><p>Her hand reluctantly drops to her side and her eyes start to narrow. \u201cHe\u2019s suing me. After all these years, he showed back up in my life and threatened me. My fianc\u00e9 left me and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he wins, and your ex is obviously a smart man,\u201d I hiss, and then I take a step back and slam the door in her face. My heart is beating out of control and I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my system, begging me to open the door and kick her ass.</p><p>She starts to yell, and Kenton picks me up, growling, \u201cStay,\u201d before setting me away from the door and opening it. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing. I have a gun and will shoot your sorry ass if you don\u2019t get the f**k off my property, and don\u2019t even think about coming back. There will be a restraining order in place before the night\u2019s up.\u201d He slams the door closed then puts both his hands to the frame, his head lowering between his open arms.</p><p>I can tell by his breathing alone that he\u2019s trying to control the urge to go back out there and make good on his threat, whether she\u2019s leaving or not.</p><p>\u201cI want to kill her,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I duck under his arm, put my face near his, and wrap my arms around his waist. \u201cI know,\u201d I whisper back. I can feel the anger rolling off him in waves so strongly that it\u2019s almost hard to stand. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll come back?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe will never get near you again.\u201d He stands, his hands come up to hold my face, and his thumb moves over my cheek, which still feels hot from the slap. \u201cI may not be able to kill her, but I swear she will not have the life she has now by the time I\u2019m done with her.\u201d</p> <p>I can tell that there\u2019s nothing I can do or say that will change his mind. I don\u2019t even want to try to get him to let it go and let her move on with her life like nothing happened. She knowingly ruined my life\u2014and my father\u2019s\u2014and it\u2019s going to take a long time to build a relationship with him.</p><p>\u201cI need to call Justin. Are you gonna be okay?\u201d he asks after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I tell him softly.</p><p>He bends down, pressing his lips to mine in a quick kiss. I watch him walk away before heading upstairs to finish what I was doing. I somehow feel like a weight has been lifted and I was given my power back after what happened with my mom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Kenton tells me, coming into the kitchen, where I\u2019m making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p><p>I look at the clock, seeing that he has been in his office for about five hours now. When my eyes go to him, I can tell that the stress and anger that were on his face before are now gone. I know that, with him as my man, I never have to worry about anything. He will always work to make the world a safe place for me.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell him, watching his face go soft.</p><p>\u201cI know, babe.\u201d</p><p>I smile bigger and go to him, wrapping my arms around his waist. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no bad guys after me, and I\u2019m sure you got rid of my mom for good, so now what do we do for entertainment?\u201d I ask, and he starts walking me backwards until my back hits the counter.</p><p>\u201cNow, we see how long it takes for me to plant my kid in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d he growls back, his mouth crashing down onto mine.</p><p>I have to say that I like the way he looks at keeping us entertained.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One Year, Three Months, Six Days, Twelve Hours, Fifteen Minutes, And Thirty-Six Seconds Later. Approximately.</p><p>I look in the mirror, my hands going to my waist, where my stomach has started to expand. I love this. I love knowing that our baby is growing inside me. We were worried for a while after we started trying to have a baby because I didn\u2019t get pregnant right away, but the doctors all assured me that sometimes it just takes time. It was worth the wait. When I took that pregnancy test and saw the positive sign for the first time, I thought I was going to pass out from excitement. Kenton just looked stunned, like he couldn\u2019t believe it had finally happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby, seriously, we\u2019re going to be late if you don\u2019t move your ass,\u201d Kenton says, walking into the bathroom.</p><p>Our eyes meet in the mirror and mine narrow. \u201cI would be ready if I didn\u2019t puke every ten minutes and pee every five from your child. So if you want to blame anyone for my lateness, you need to look in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, I got you up four hours ago knowin\u2019 you get sick in the mornings and you need time to wake up and use the bathroom a million times before we can leave the house.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes narrow further and my fists start to clench at my sides.</p> <p>\u201cI wanna meet my kid, baby,\u201d he says gently, a small smile forming on his lips as his hands come around my waist, his thumbs moving over my bump. All the annoyance I was feeling seconds ago leaves, and then tears start to fill my eyes. \u201cWhat am I gonna do with you?\u201d he asks, taking in the tears filling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLove me,\u201d I say as he pulls me into his chest. These pregnancy hormones are killers. One minute, I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world; the next, I want to kill someone. Luckily, Kenton loves me all the time.</p><p>\u201cSo today\u2019s the big day, huh?\u201d the nurse says, handing me a dressing gown. I look at her and smile, nodding my head. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just let you get changed, and the doctor should be in in a few minutes.\u201d She closes the door behind her, and I start to get undressed.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Kenton asks.</p><p>I turn to look at him, my eyebrows coming together. \u201cWhy would I be nervous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, what if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>I smile and start to laugh. All of his cousins have girls; it seems their firsts are always girls. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s bringing this on now, but we\u2019ve talked about the sex of the baby before and he\u2019s always said that he would be happy with whatever we have as long as he or she is healthy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bringing this on?\u201d I ask him as I finish getting undressed and putting the gown on before hopping up on the table.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Nico last night. He was telling me how different it feels having girls than boys and how, with the girls, he\u2019s worried nonstop, but with his boy, his emotions have seemed to even out some.\u201d</p><p>Nico and Sophie had a little boy a few weeks ago. I\u2019m sure it is different having boys, but I can\u2019t imagine it being that different. \u201cSo now you\u2019re worried?\u201d I guess.</p><p>\u201cI think about you nonstop all day long,\u201d he says softly, causing my breath to pause. \u201cI just worry that I won\u2019t have enough of me left over.\u201d</p> <p>I let out a breath, and my heart lightens. \u201cYou have the biggest heart of anyone I know.\u201d I hop off the table and go to him, pushing my fingers through his hair. \u201cNo matter if we have a boy or girl, I know you will find room for all of us.\u201d</p><p>His head tilts back and his eyes meet mine. \u201cLove you, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d I bend my head down and kiss him just as the door opens and the doctor walks in.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys today?\u201d Denise, our doctor, asks.</p><p>Kenton stands to greet her with a hug, and Denise smiles and hugs him back with a pat to his cheek. Denise is about seventy years old and should probably retire, but she told me the first time I met her that she will probably be working until the day she dies. She\u2019s the same doctor who delivered Kenton and would be delivering our baby if everything goes as planned.</p><p>I go back to the table and hop on top, lying back before answering, \u201cWe\u2019re really good.\u201d I smile at her, running my hand over my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look really good, and all the work-ups we did look perfect. I just need to check you over to make sure everything looks okay, and then we can see what you\u2019re having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say.</p> <p>She smiles at me and then Kenton before proceeding with the internal exam. Then she lets me put my pants back on before having me lie back on the bed again. She tucks a paper towel under the edges of my leggings and lifts my shirt farther up, exposing the rest of my stomach before squirting lubricant there.</p><p>Kenton comes to stand next to me, wrapping his hand around mine. The loud sound of a heartbeat pulses through the room, and I watch the dark screen next to my head, trying to make out our baby. When I see the figure emerge through the black, tears start to fill my eyes as they always do when I see our child.</p><p>\u201cLook at how big he is already,\u201d Denise says, and my eyes go to her before my head tilts back so I can see Kenton\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a boy?\u201d I ask when I don\u2019t see Kenton react at all. I wonder if he even caught on to what she just said.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d I hear the smile in her voice as Kenton\u2019s head tilts down and he looks at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, Daddy, what do you have to say about that?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He bends, kissing my mouth. Before he pulls his lips away, he whispers, \u201cI want a girl too. You\u2019re right. I have enough room for a lot more.\u201d</p><p>I nod and lift my head slightly, pressing a kiss to his lips as I feel tears slide down my cheeks. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing that with him.</p><p>Three years, one month, six days, twenty-two hours, six minutes, and two seconds later.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you need to put her down,\u201d I tell Kenton as I walk into the living room.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting on the couch, wearing a pair of sweats and nothing else. The football game\u2019s on the TV, the sound low in the background as our sleeping daughter lies in his arms and our son sits at his side, his head laying against his chest with his eyes closed. Half the time, I wonder if he pretends to be asleep just so he can spy on us. He knows far too much for a three-year-old.</p><p>\u201cShe just knocked out,\u201d he says softly, looking down at her before looking at me again.</p><p>I roll my eyes and shake my head, knowing that he\u2019s lying. If he\u2019s home, the kids are on him. I love seeing him with them, but when he\u2019s not home and I have our kids, when I\u2019m alone and they both want to be held all the time, it makes it hard to get stuff done around the house.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s on her way over with Viv. They want to look at the backyard and measure to see if they can fit a play set back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t give up, does she?\u201d he gripes, looking down at Annabelle again.</p><p>I know exactly what he\u2019s thinking. The minute his mom walks in the door, the kids are no longer ours. They are all Grandma\u2019s, and he hates it.</p><p>\u201cYou have something in common.\u201d I smirk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, seems like she will be useful while she\u2019s here after all,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask, my eyes narrowing as I watch a smirk form on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna find something to do with that smart mouth of yours while Mom takes care of the kids for us for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tingle begin and am all of a sudden very anxious for Nancy to show up.</p><p>\u201cStrip. Then get on your knees, babe,\u201d Kenton grunts, backing me into our bathroom.</p><p>As soon as Nancy walked into the house, Kenton handed the kids off to her. I could tell by the twinkle in her eyes that she knew exactly what was going on. Thank God Maz was awake so she couldn\u2019t say anything that would have me turning red.</p><p>I quickly strip and drop to my knees, watching as Kenton locks the door to the bathroom behind him.</p><p>\u201cFinally, she listens,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I ignore that comment and just enjoy watching him walk towards me. His hands go to his sweats, one pushing them down until his c**k springs free, the other hand wrapping around himself, stroking as he walks to me.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d His eyes lock on my mouth as I open for him. The second the head of his c**k touches my tongue, I moan. \u201cI think you love sucking me off more than I like it, and I like it a whole hell of a lot.\u201d</p><p>His hand runs down my cheek, his thumb going to my chin. He pulls down on my jaw, making me open more as he slides deeper into my mouth, hitting the back of my throat. His hand lowers, running down my neck then over each nipple, giving them a tug. I moan around him and us one hand to cup his balls before wrapping around the base of his cock, twisting on each thrust, while my other hand goes between my legs.</p><p>\u201cShow me how wet you are for me,\u201d he demands, and I pull my slick fingers out from between my legs. His hand wraps around my wrist, pulling my fingers to his mouth.</p><p>The heat and feel of his tongue on my fingers has me releasing him from my mouth and leaning my head back. Before I can even ask him to f**k me, I\u2019m up and bent over the vanity, his foot kicks my legs farther apart, and I feel the head of his c**k touch my entrance. I expect him to enter me slowly, but he surprises me by covering my mouth with his hand as he slams deep in one fast thrust. I scream out, my teeth biting into his palm. His hand pulls my face to the side so he can take my mouth in a deep kiss while he moves rapidly behind me.</p><p>\u201cTilt your ass higher,\u201d he says, and I rise up on my tiptoes and put my palms flat down on the vanity, getting more leverage. \u201cLook at us.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go to his in the mirror and I take us in. His suntanned skin makes mine look creamy white in comparison. His large size behind me makes me look more feminine somehow. My red hair is down, cascading over my shoulders in a wavy mess. We look like we belong on the cover of an old romance novel. His hands move over me before one wraps under my neck, the other holding my breast; the visual alone has my orgasm approaching quickly.</p><p>\u201cCome for me. I want to feel it.\u201d His words, cock, and hands send me over as I turn my head, pressing my forehead into his neck. I hear and feel him growl his release as his thrusts slow and his hips jerk.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I tell him, turning towards the mirror so I can look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou too, baby,\u201d he says, pulling me a little closer to him as I feel his thumb run over the scar on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAutumn, Anna\u2019s diaper needs changing!\u201d we hear Nancy yell, breaking the moment.</p><p>I look at Kenton and roll my eyes. Unless the kids are at her house, she doesn\u2019t do diapers. She says that she changed enough of them to last a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of our girl while you get dressed.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I moan as he pulls out.</p><p>He turns me in his arms, kissing me deeply before releasing me, grabbing a washcloth, and cleaning us up. After washing his hands, he leaves the bathroom. I stand there for a few minutes looking at myself in the mirror. When I look into my eyes, I see a woman who knows what love is, and that feeling alone has me hurrying to get dressed so I can go be with my family.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s him?\u201d I ask, leaning across Kenton, who is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of our truck so I can get a better view out his window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, baby,\u201d he says gently, running a hand down my back.</p><p>I look from the young man I\u2019m supposed to be meeting in a few minutes to my husband. \u201cWhat if he hates me?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s the same question I\u2019ve asked every time we have spoken about this moment.</p><p>\u201cNo one could ever hate you, and if he does, I\u2019ll kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be nice,\u201d I say firmly. I know him, and he will do just as he says.</p><p>\u201cYou know I will be. Now, are you ready to go over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper, shaking my head and looking back out the window at the young man.</p><p>He\u2019s handsome, with dark hair, golden skin, and a long, lean frame that makes me think of his dad. I watch him as he takes a drink of coffee before setting it on the table, lifting his wrist to look at his watch.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d I say quietly, sitting back in my seat. My stomach in knots from the anxiety.</p><p>\u201cMy warrior is never afraid of anything, and if she is, she knows I will be there to fight along with her.\u201d</p><p>I look into his golden eyes, the same eyes I fell in love with all those years ago, and smile, feeling tears fill my eyes. I have no idea how I got so lucky. I lean forward, this time putting my hand behind his neck and pulling his face forward so I can reach his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper against his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you.\u201d</p><p>I smile and open the door to the truck, hopping out before he can make it around to my side.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about waiting for me?\u201d he grumbles, grabbing my hand.</p><p>I shake my head but don\u2019t reply; we would be arguing for the next hour if I did. We walk across the street, and the second we hit the sidewalk, Dane\u2019s head lifts, his eyes lock on mine, and I see for the first time that his eyes are blue.</p><p>\u201cAutumn.\u201d He says my name, and tears pool in my eyes.</p><p>I nod and squeeze Kenton\u2019s hand so hard that I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cKenton.\u201d Dane\u2019s says, sticks out his hand, and gives it a shake before pulling back. \u201cCan I get a hug?\u201d he asks me, and I feel my body shake but nod anyways.</p><p>His arms come around me and I realize how big he is. I would guess his height to be around six two; it\u2019s hard to think that he was once growing inside me. Our kids now are still so small being just ten and seven. I start to cry harder and feel myself being transferred from him to Kenton, and as soon as I smell my husband\u2019s familiar scent, my anxiety starts to ease and the tears start to lessen. I pull my face out of Kenton\u2019s chest and wipe my eyes with the back of my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He smiles, rubbing my shoulder.</p><p>Tears sting my nose again as I wonder what his parents must be like to have raised such an amazing man.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down.\u201d Kenton says and I feel his hand on my lower back as he leads me to a chair.</p><p>\u201cTell me about you,\u201d I say as soon as we\u2019re seated.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m in law school and work part time at a firm. I play soccer and run track. Really, I\u2019m kind of boring.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He laughs, running his hand along his jaw. I can\u2019t imagine girls his age not falling at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask when he doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Kenton says, \u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my mom,\u201d he tells me. Then he looks like he thinks he shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your parents,\u201d I say softly. I hate that I couldn\u2019t raise him, but I hope that the people who adopted him really wanted a child and loved him fiercely.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s a schoolteacher and Dad\u2019s a fireman. They met when my mom\u2019s house caught fire and my dad rescued her. They were married not long after they met and started trying to have kids soon after, but it never happened for them, so they gave up and decided to adopt.\u201d He shrugs, looking slightly uncomfortable. \u201cFunny thing is, about a week after they brought me home, they found out my mom was pregnant, so I have a younger sister.\u201d He smiles, and I can see how much he loves his family. \u201cThey\u2019re really great parents.\u201d</p><p>I nod and feel Kenton\u2019s hand give my thigh a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you had a good childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenton told me a little bit about what happened and why you gave me up for adoption. I want you to know there are no hard feelings or anything.\u201d His hand moves to his hair, running through it. \u201cI\u2019ve had a really great life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I just never wanted you to hate me,\u201d I tell him quietly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t. My parents have been upfront with me since I was little, explaining that I was adopted. I was always curious about you, but I have never been upset when I\u2019ve thought about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, all the fears I\u2019ve held inside since the day he was taken from me releasing with the words he spoke. I was so worried that he hated me, and I never wanted that.</p><p>\u201cKenton told me you have two kids, a boy and a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d I smile at him then over at Kenton, who leans in, kissing the side of my head.</p><p>\u201cI would love to meet them. And maybe bring my sister with me, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll set it up for a weekend when I have time to hang out for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree with a smile.</p><p>He stands and so do I. Then he pulls me in for a hug. I hug him back, memorizing the feeling. He steps back and gives Kenton\u2019s hand a shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to you soon,\u201d I say as I watch him walk away before facing Kenton.</p><p>\u201cCool tattoo!\u201d I hear yelled from behind me.</p><p>I turn around, seeing Dane standing on the other side of the street with his hands in his pockets. I put my finger to the skin behind my ear and bring it to my mouth, kissing it before waving goodbye to him.</p><p>We get into Kenton\u2019s truck and I lay my head back against the seat before rolling my face in his direction. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, babe,\u201d he says, and I nod and look out the window as I listen to the truck start up.</p><p>I sit forward and put my hand over his on the gearshift. \u201cAnything for you too. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already given me everything,\u201d</p><p>I press my mouth to his and kiss him with every ounce of love I have for him. Then I pull back and get back in my seat. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he mumbles, squeezing my leg.</p><p>I wrap my hand over his and lean my head back, giving a silent thank-you to whoever makes unknown dreams come true.</p>  </body></html>"]
