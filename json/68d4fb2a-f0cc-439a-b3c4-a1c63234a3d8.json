There you go\u2014you\u2019re dead. Live with it.</p><p>But it\u2019s far more difficult than you would ever imagine.</p> <p>It begins with why?</p><p>Oh, we all know the theories. A death by violence. Something left undone. Someone to be protected, someone to be warned\u2014someone to be avenged.</p><p>Vengeance? Once you\u2019re a ghost? Great stuff.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t my situation. My killer perished split seconds before the light of life faded from my own eyes. It wasn\u2019t that I hadn\u2019t loved life\u2014I had. There were those left behind whom I cherished deeply.</p><p>The great love of my life, Matt Connolly, had gone before me, however. And he was there to greet me when I arrived.</p> <p>\u201cCrossed over,\u201d as they say. Except there\u2019s the thing\u2014you haven\u2019t actually crossed over. You\u2019re existing in a vague and shadowy world where, often, you see something truly horrible about to take place\u2014and you don\u2019t have the power to stop it.</p><p>I\u2019d known something of what would occur. I had almost died before. I had felt the power of the light that beckons\u2014an invitation to heaven? I don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.</p><p>Because that time I lived. And this time I stayed.</p><p>As a ghost.</p><p>And I know that I\u2019ve remained behind for a reason, though I haven\u2019t a clue as to the specifics. But at least, unlike some, I\u2019m pretty sure I do have a purpose.</p><p>I\u2019ve come across many of my kind who are far more lost than I am, having had a strange relationship with them after my near-death experience and before I departed the life of flesh and blood. There\u2019s Lawrence Ridgeway, Colonel Lawrence Ridgeway, a charming fellow, with his perfectly trimmed beard and muttonchops.</p> <p>Sadly, he can\u2019t accept the fact that the Civil War has been won. He was a brave soldier who came to New York during the terrible draft riots of the eighteen-sixties. No matter how often I try to explain things to him, he\u2019s forever keeping guard over his long-gone prisoners. Matt, too, has tried to point out to him that there are no prisoners present, but poor Colonel Ridgeway simply can\u2019t accept that fact. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s doomed to haunt one particular hallway here in Manhattan\u2019s historic Hastings House forever, a sad and tragic figure who\u2019ll never find closure.</p><p>Marnie Brubaker died in childbirth. She\u2019s a sweet and charming creature, and she loves the children who pass through the house. Children tend to be more open than adults to visits from my kind. Marnie likes to play games with the little ones. When they\u2019re falling asleep on a parent\u2019s shoulder, she sings lullabies. Every once in a while, one of them gets scared by her presence and screams bloody murder, which puts her into a funk for weeks to come. All she wants is to offer is love and comfort, but some people, even kids, just don\u2019t want solace from a ghost.</p><p>There are those, like Colonel Ridgeway, who will go on repeating their last action over and over again. Then there are those who learn to move around the physical worlds. Passing through walls. Appearing and disappearing at will. Moving objects. The truth of it is, we ghosts can learn to do all kinds of things, so long as we have the will, the patience and the stamina.</p><p>I was the victim of a killer who first took the lives of others, before he took mine. But there\u2019s no pain in my world, especially not for me. Because Matt\u2019s here with me, and that\u2019s really all that matters. He died the night of my almost-death, and he stayed behind to warn me. To save me. But my salvation wasn\u2019t to be. In the end, I died to save Genevieve O\u2019Brien. And so far, at least, I\u2019ve been successful. But as a social worker, she\u2019s one of those people who won\u2019t rest in her quest to help others, and that can put her in danger sometimes.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Joe Connolly, Matt\u2019s cousin. He\u2019s a private detective and a super guy. A tough guy.</p><p>But no one\u2019s so tough that he can defy death. Life\u2019s not like the movies. Most of the time, the bad guys can aim, so Joe can use some protection, whether he knows it or not.</p><p>I believe Matt and I have stayed on because of either Joe or Genevieve. Or maybe both. It\u2019s our job to make sure they\u2014and maybe others\u2014stay safe.</p><p>Nope, being a ghost isn\u2019t easy. In fact, it\u2019s damn hard work protecting people when most of the time they can\u2019t even see you and don\u2019t think they need protection, anyway.</p> <p>Take Joe. He has a thing about going to the graves of the people he couldn\u2019t save\u2014including Matt\u2019s and mine. Sometimes he brings flowers. Sometimes he just sits in deep thought. And sometimes he talks. Then he looks around, hoping that he hasn\u2019t been overheard. I imagine that it would be difficult to obtain new clients if word got out that he was insane. But everyone out there has his own way of coping with loss. For Joe, it\u2019s talking to people at their grave sites.</p><p>That\u2019s how we became involved in the Poe Killings.</p><p>And that\u2019s how Joe became involved with Genevieve again.</p><p>She was a child of privilege, but even after she\u2019d almost lost her own life, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from investigating problems.</p><p>Including murder.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The crash occurred on the FDR. Strange thing, Joe had just been driving along Manhattan\u2019s East Side and thinking it was amazing that there weren\u2019t more accidents on the busy\u2014and outdated\u2014highway when, right in front of him, a crash caused the car a few lengths ahead of him to slam into someone else. The sounds of screeching tires, shattering glass, grating steel and several massive impacts were evidence that the domino effect had come into play. Someone almost stopped in the aftermath of the first collision, but then that car was pushed into the next lane, and the driver coming up didn\u2019t have time to stop. He slammed into it hard and careened into the next lane. The car that hit that driver bounced over the median and into the oncoming traffic going south.</p><p>Joe somehow made it off to the side, threw his car into Park and hit 9-1-1 on his cell phone. He reported what he saw and his position, dropped the phone and hurried out to help.</p><p>The car that had caused the initial crash was fairly far ahead of him, but there was a line of disabled vehicles stretching back from it almost to where he was.</p><p>The people in the car closest to him were fine, and so were the people in the next vehicle, and the driver of the third probably had nothing more than a broken arm.</p><p>The smell of gas around the car that had hopped the median was strong, though\u2014a bad sign.</p><p>People had stopped all around, talking, shouting, while other drivers were trying to get around the wreckage no matter what.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s going to blow up!\u201d someone called to Joe as he approached the car. He lifted a hand in acknowledgment but kept going. He wasn\u2019t a superhero, he\u2019d just worked lots of accident scenes when he\u2019d been a cop, and an inner voice was assuring him that\u2014death-defying or not\u2014he had time to help.</p><p>The car was upside down. There was blood coming from the driver\u2019s head, which was canted at an awkward angle. The man\u2019s eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cHey. You have to wake up. We\u2019ve got to get you out of there. I\u2019m going to help you,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cMy niece,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help my niece.\u201d He grabbed Joe, his grip surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cTrish,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Then Joe saw the little girl. She was in the back. Not really big enough for the seat belt, she had slipped out of it and was on the roof\u2014now the floor\u2014with silent tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Joe said with forced calm, \u201cCome on, honey. Give me your hand.\u201d</p><p>She had huge, saucer-wide blue eyes, and she was maybe about seven or eight and just small for her age, he decided. \u201cTrish,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with relief when she did so. He managed to get her out, even though she had to crawl over broken glass on the way. As soon as he had her in his arms, someone from the milling crowd rushed forward.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here now, buddy!\u201d the man who took the child told him. \u201cThe car is going to blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man in the car,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe said. \u201cHe\u2019s alive. He talked to me.\u201d</p><p>Joe was dimly aware that the air was alive with sirens, that evening was turning to night. He was fully aware of the fact that he didn\u2019t have much time left.</p><p>Flat on his stomach, he shouted to the man who had taken the child from him. \u201cGet them back\u2014get them all back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrish?\u201d the man in the car said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. She\u2019s out. She\u2019s safe. Now, get ready, because I\u2019m releasing your seat belt. You\u2019ve got to try to help me.\u201d</p><p>He did his best to support the guy\u2019s weight after he released the seat belt, but it was a struggle. An upside-down crushed car didn\u2019t allow for a lot of leeway, especially when it was about to explode.</p><p>But he got the man out. He could only pray that he hadn\u2019t worsened his pain or any broken bones.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d he roared, once he had the man away from the car.</p><p>The same Good Samaritan who had taken the child came rushing up. Together, they started to half drag and half carry the man from the wreckage.</p><p>Just in time.</p><p>The car exploded, flames leaping high over the FDR. They would have been easily seen over in Brooklyn, and probably even halfway across Manhattan.</p><p>The blast was hot and powerful. He felt it like a huge, hot hand that lifted him, the victim and his fellow rescuer, and tossed them a dozen feet so that they crashed down hard on the asphalt.</p><p>Joe rolled, trying to take the brunt of the impact, knowing he was in far better shape to accept the force than the victim of the crash.</p><p>For a moment he didn\u2019t breathe, since there was nothing to breathe but the fire in the air.</p><p>Then he felt pain in almost every joint, and the hardness of the road against his back. He became aware of the screams around him, which he hadn\u2019t heard before; the blast had sucked all the sound out of the air along with the oxygen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou all right, buddy?\u201d he asked the man who had helped him.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>The next thing he knew, there was a young EMT hunkered down in front of him. He tried to struggle up.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy. Don\u2019t move until we\u2019re sure you haven\u2019t broken something, sir,\u201d the med tech said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing broken. I\u2019m good,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cThe guy who helped me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man in the car\u2014I think he was hurt pretty bad,\u201d Joe said.</p> <p>\u201cWe, uh, we got it,\u201d the med tech told him. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added gently, \u201cthe girl is fine. Everyone\u2019s already talking about how you saved her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, good,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut the man needs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he had a chance.\u201d</p><p>The med tech was silent for a minute. \u201cYou did a good thing,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cBut that man...he died on impact, sir. Broken neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014he talked to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think maybe you hit your head, sir. That man couldn\u2019t have spoken to you. I\u2019m sure his family is going to be grateful you got the body out, but he\u2019s been dead since the first impact. Honest to God. It was a broken neck. He never suffered.\u201d As he spoke, the med tech got a stethoscope out; apparently he wasn\u2019t taking Joe\u2019s word that he was okay.</p><p>Joe had his breath back. He pushed the stethoscope aside and sat up, staring at the med tech. What did the kid know? He wasn\u2019t the coroner.</p><p>\u201cHe was alive. He spoke to me. I wouldn\u2019t even have seen the girl if he hadn\u2019t told me she was in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Joe knew damned well when he was being humored. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He knew the EMT was all good intentions, but he was just fine\u2014except for this kid trying to tell him that the man had died on impact.</p><p>\u201cSir, let me help you,\u201d the med tech said.</p><p>\u201cYou want to help me? Get me the hell out of here,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cFast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust let me get a stretcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Joe said, figuring anything that would get the guy out of the way was fine.</p><p>As soon as the med tech went off for a stretcher, Joe took a deep breath and made it to his feet. Damn, it hurt. Well, he\u2019d been pretty much sandblasted when he skidded down on the roadway, and he wasn\u2019t exactly eighteen anymore.</p><p>He saw that there was no way in hell he would be leaving the scene in his own car. But it wasn\u2019t blocking anyone, so the thing was just to start walking, to get away.</p><p>He did. It was easier than he\u2019d imagined, but then, he was walking away from a scene of chaos, and everyone\u2019s attention was on the wreck, not on one lone pedestrian. He could hear voices\u2014most alarmed and concerned, some merely excited\u2014surrounding him as he escaped the scene. More and more cop cars and ambulances passed him.</p><p>He headed south along the shoulder, and at last he followed an entrance ramp down to the street, where he hailed a taxi. The driver didn\u2019t even blink at his appearance. Hey, this was New York.</p><p>He suggested a route to Brooklyn that didn\u2019t involve the FDR.</p><p>He got home eventually, where he showered and changed, then went out into his living room and turned on the television, looking for the local news.</p><p>The accident was center stage.</p><p>\u201cTwelve were injured and are being given care in various area hospitals,\u201d the attractive newscaster was saying. Her face was grave. \u201cThere was one fatality. Adam Brookfield was killed when his car flipped over the median. The medical examiner reports that Mr. Brookfield died instantly, though a heroic onlooker, who fled the scene, carried the man\u2019s body from the automobile just instants before the car exploded. That same man rescued Mr. Brookfield\u2019s six-year-old niece, Patricia, who is doing well at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, where her parents are with her.\u201d</p><p>The woman shifted in her chair to look into a different camera. The somber expression left her face. She smiled. \u201cThis weekend, we welcome the All American Chorale Union to Kennedy Center, and for those of you with tickets, remember that tonight\u2019s the night for the special showing of ancient Egyptian artifacts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. All those pricey meal tickets will pay for more archeological research right here in New York. And now...\u201d</p><p>Joe no longer heard her. He was irritated.</p><p>That man, Adam Brookfield, had been alive; he had spoken to Joe. It was bull about him dying on impact. He couldn\u2019t have spoken if he\u2019d been dead.</p><p>Joe glanced at his watch. It would be hours before he could reasonably go for his car, which meant it would probably be towed anyway. Screw it.</p><p>He had been on his way to attend tonight\u2019s fund-raiser at the Met when he\u2019d gotten sidelined by the accident, but now he decided he no longer cared. He was heading to Manhattan and a bar that had become one of his favorites.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, she\u2019s just beautiful, Senator,\u201d Genevieve O\u2019Brien said to Senator James McCray and his wife. They had been showing her pictures of their new grandson, Jacob. She had done the right thing, \u201coohing\u201d and \u201caahing.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, the baby looked like a pinhead at the moment. As bald as a buzzard. Squinched up and...newborn.</p><p>But the senator was a supporter of the Historical Society, and had a paid great deal for his meal and a walk through the museum. Naturally she was going to say all the right things about his grandchild. Of course, if she\u2019d met him on the street, she still would have said the same things, she realized.</p><p>She damned digital cameras.</p><p>The senator had not had just one picture but at least a hundred.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get married and have children yourself, young lady,\u201d James McCray said.</p><p>His wife elbowed him. She\u2019d suddenly gone pale.</p><p>Genevieve sighed and tried not to show her feelings in her expression, but she was so weary of this. Anything that so much as hinted of sex was considered taboo around her. She\u2019d been the victim of a maniac who\u2019d been stalking New York\u2019s streets and targeting prostitutes, the same prostitutes Gen worked with. Everyone knew what she\u2019d been through and that it was a miracle she was alive.</p><p>She had stayed alive because she had realized quickly that her attacker was actually incapable of sex. She had played on his own psychological makeup, providing the bolstering and ego boosts that he needed, and though she had been a prisoner and abused, she wasn\u2019t suffering as shatteringly from the experience as the world seemed to think she should be. If she faced an inward agony, it was knowing that someone incredible, her friend Leslie MacIntyre, had died.</p><p>\u201cI would love to have children one day, Senator, Mrs. McCray,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cWhen the right person to be a dad comes along. You enjoy that beautiful baby. But now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to see to a few things.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she needed to see to an escape.</p><p>She walked quickly into a side hall, opened only for the convenience of the Historical Society, which was hosting the event. There was a bench, and she sat on it.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shown.</p><p>She let out a sigh, wondering why she had even thought Joe would show up. He was a fascinating guy, intrigued by almost everything in the world. He hadn\u2019t come from money, but if anyone out there knew that money really wasn\u2019t everything, it was her. Joe was one of those people who lived life, and he\u2019d done well enough for himself. He could look like a million dollars in a suit. Definitely a striking guy.</p><p>And her friend, she thought.</p><p>When he wasn\u2019t avoiding her.</p><p>She smiled to herself. If she was in trouble, if she needed rescuing, he would be right there. Thing was, she didn\u2019t need rescuing. And she didn\u2019t want to need rescuing, either.</p><p>Her smiled faded.</p><p>She did want help.</p><p>She had hoped he would show tonight because she wanted to ask him about the current worry dogging her life.</p><p>A murder.</p><p>The media had dubbed it the Poe Killing, because the victim, Thorne Bigelow, had been president of the New York Poe Society, a readers and writers group whose members studied the works and life of Edgar Allan Poe, and called themselves the Ravens, and the killer had left a note referring to the famous author.</p><p>She looked around the room. Most of the members were involved with things that were considered either literary or important educationally in the city of New York. There were several of the Ravens here tonight; like her own mother, they also supported various groups interested in history and archeology. Among them she noticed newspaper reporter Larry Levine, who had come to cover the event. Then there was Lila Hawkins\u2014brassy and outspoken and very, very rich. Quite frankly, she was obnoxious, but she did do a lot of good things for the arts in the city. Just a few minutes ago, Gen had seen Lila with Barbara Hirshorn, another Raven and the complete opposite of Lila; Barbara was so timid, she had difficulty speaking to more than one person at the same time.</p><p>She had noted that even Jared Bigelow had made a brief appearance with Mary Vincenzo, his aunt, on his arm. He was gone now, and she hadn\u2019t had a chance to speak to him. He had shown up just to support the cause tonight; he was still in mourning for his father.</p><p>From her seat on the bench she could hear the booming voice of Don Tracy, the one Raven who\u2019d taken Poe to the masses. He was an actor, a good one, even if he\u2019d never become a household name. He loved the stage and had performed Poe\u2019s works on numerous occasions.</p><p>None of them seemed to be frightened by the note that had been found with Thorne\u2019s body.</p><p>Thorne Bigelow had been a very wealthy man. A well-known man. And though murder happened all too often, it was the sad truth that a murder with a hook\u2014like a victim who was regularly in the headlines and a mysterious note making reference to a long-dead storyteller and poet\u2014intrigued the media more than most deaths did.</p><p>It was only happenstance that Thorne Bigelow had been a very rich Raven. The Ravens didn\u2019t demand that a member be wealthy, published on the topic of Poe\u2019s life and works or world-renowned, though sometimes they were. Thorne Bigelow had written a book on Poe that was considered to be the definitive work on the man. Bigelow was honored far and wide for his knowledge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he had been poisoned. Poisoned with a bottle of thousand-dollar wine.</p><p>He loved wine, perhaps even to excess. And he had died of it.</p><p>\u00c0 la Poe.</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Cat.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado.\u201d</p><p>The killer didn\u2019t seem to have been too precise about which story he meant Bigelow\u2019s death to parallel. He had made his intentions clear in the note he\u2019d left at the scene, though.</p><p>Quoth the raven: die.</p><p>The police were pretty much at a standstill, though why the media were harassing them so strongly about the case, Genevieve wasn\u2019t certain. Thorne Bigelow had only been dead a week. She knew from personal experience that bad things could go on for a very long time before a situation was resolved. If it hadn\u2019t been for her family\u2019s wealth and her own disappearance, the sad deaths of many of the city\u2019s less fortunate might have gone unsolved for a very long time.</p> <p>But Bigelow was big news.</p><p>\u201cMy darling, there you are!\u201d</p><p>Genevieve looked up. Her mother\u2014it was still strange to call Eileen Mother, when she had grown up believing that she was her aunt\u2014was standing before her. Eileen, only in her early forties now, was stunning. Her love for Genevieve was so strong\u2014not to mention that without her persistence, Genevieve would surely be dead now\u2014that it was easy to forgive the lies of the past. Especially since Genevieve knew what family pressure was like, and that her mother had been far too young to speak up for herself when Gen had been born.</p><p>But Eileen Brideswell had finally decided that a New York that embraced reruns of Sex and the City would surely forgive her a teenage, unwed birth. What she might once have been damned for now passed without notice by most in the city.</p><p>And after all, Genevieve had loved Eileen all her life.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d Genevieve said cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t show,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Eileen hesitated. She was very slim, and had classic features, the kind that would make her just as beautiful when she turned eighty as she was now. But at the moment, her expression was strained.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Genevieve asked, suddenly worried by what she saw in her mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere was a terrible accident on the FDR.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve leapt up. \u201cWhen? Joe uses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout an hour ago. The reports are just coming out now. One man was killed\u2014don\u2019t panic, it wasn\u2019t Joe\u2014and a number of other people were injured.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve sat back down and fumbled in the pocket of her black silk skirt for her cell phone. \u201cThat bastard better answer me,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cJoe Connolly,\u201d came his voice, after three rings.</p><p>She could hear music in the background. An Irish melody. He was at O\u2019Malley\u2019s, she thought.</p><p>\u201cJoe, it\u2019s Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. You still at your big soiree?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I thought you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make it past the traffic.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh. All right. That might be a legitimate excuse.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it sounded like O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He was silent. It felt like an awkward silence. Was she being too clingy? Good God, did she sound disapproving, as if she were his wife or something?</p><p>Stop, she warned herself. She had to be careful of expecting too much from him. It had seemed, after she was rescued, after Leslie had...died, that they were destined to be close. The best of friends, needing one another.</p><p>But then it was as if he had put up a wall.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. She needed him now. Cut and dried. Needed his professional help. He was a private investigator. Finding people, finding facts, finding the truth. That was what he did. And she needed to hire him. She wasn\u2019t asking any favors.</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun,\u201d she said.</p><p>She clicked the phone closed before he could reply.</p><p>Eileen looked at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear.\u201d Her mother sat down beside her and patted her knee. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to come out fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d The word seemed a bit strange, but Genevieve loved to use it. \u201cMom, I\u2019m worried about you now. You\u2019re a Raven, and...\u201d</p><p>Eileen sighed. \u201cOh, darling, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a fringe member, at best. Poor Thorne. I like being a member, I love all the reading and discussing we do, but...honestly, I\u2019m just not worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy someone who apparently wasn\u2019t impressed with his work on Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never written a book,\u201d Eileen assured her.</p><p>Genevieve sighed, rising. \u201cBut you are a Raven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with many other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it. I\u2019m worried about you. Henry is driving you home, right?\u201d</p><p>Eileen frowned. \u201cYes, of course. What about you? Are you leaving, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drop by O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Eileen frowned worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Genevieve assured her. \u201cI\u2019m in my own car, but I know where to park. I\u2019ll let security see me out and I won\u2019t leave O\u2019Malley\u2019s without someone to walk me to my car. Okay? I\u2019ll be safe, I promise. Hell, I think they ask your approval before they hire anyone at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Eileen laughed, but there was a slight edge to it. \u201cI do not tell them who they can and can\u2019t hire. I\u2019ve simply always enjoyed the place, and I\u2019m a friend of the owners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m safe there,\u201d Genevieve said very softly.</p><p>Eileen still appeared worried, Gen thought. Then again, these days she was worried every time Genevieve was out of her sight.</p><p>But Genevieve had gone back to living in her own apartment. Not that she didn\u2019t adore Eileen or love the mansion. She just loved simplicity\u2014and her independence.</p><p>It was sadly ironic that they both seemed to be frightened for each other these days, just when they had become so close.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help worrying about Eileen in the wake of Thorne\u2019s murder, though. Eileen was a Raven, and though the police discounted the idea, it seemed to Gen that Thorne had been killed specifically because he was a Raven, not just because he was a published Poe scholar.</p><p>Admittedly, it was quite likely the book that had brought him to the killers attention, and it was true that Eileen had never written a book. She had way too many charities and women\u2019s clubs to worry about to devote much time to being a Poe fan.</p><p>Still, the connection made Genevieve uneasy, and she wanted Joe involved.</p><p>That was it, cut and dried.</p><p>Or was it so cut and dried?</p><p>Maybe she was lying to herself; maybe she wanted to see Joe for personal reasons, too. God knew there was enough about him that was easy to see. He was intelligent, funny, generous and a little bit rough around the edges. Sexy and compassionate. A hard combination to resist.</p><p>And he was in love with a dead woman.</p><p>She tried to dismiss the thought. She and Joe were just friends precisely because of what had happened. They had seen one another through the hard times and come away good friends.</p><p>Yes, she had a multitude of emotions raging within her where Joe was concerned. But what was becoming a growing fear for her mother\u2019s safety was the driving force in her desire to see him now.</p><p>She rose, kissing her mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be at O\u2019Malley\u2019s. I\u2019ll call when I\u2019m leaving, and I\u2019ll call when I get home, all right?\u201d</p><p>Eileen flushed, then nodded. \u201cDid you enjoy the exhibit?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve nodded. \u201cI think we raised a lot of money. I think Leslie would have been happy.\u201d Leslie, who had been either gifted or cursed with extraordinary powers, had been an archeologist. She had loved history; she had revered it. Tonight had been planned in her honor, and they were going to use some of the funds raised this evening to respectfully reinter some of the bones Leslie had dug up on her last dig, the one that had ended up costing her life.</p><p>Genevieve dropped another quick kiss on her mother\u2019s cheek, then hurried out.</p><p>The night was a little cool, making her glad she had chosen a jacket rather than a dressier stole. Not so much because it was warmer, but because it would fit in a hell of a lot better at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.</p><p>The attendant brought her car, and in minutes, she was taking the streets downtown. As she drove, she turned on her radio.</p><p>She was in time to catch the news, and the topic was that evening\u2019s accident on the FDR, which was still being sorted out. There were brief interview snippets with several of the survivors, and Gen sat up straighter, alarmed, at the sound of one name.</p><p>Sam Latham.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Sam Latham.</p><p>Another Raven.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>How many millions of people were there in the city?</p><p>Gen frowned as the newscaster went on to talk a bit about the man that had been killed, though she was relieved to hear that his young niece had been saved by a man who had left the scene after rescuing the little girl and pulling her uncle\u2019s body from the car moments before the explosion that had destroyed it.</p><p>Joe?</p><p>How many millions of people in the city? she taunted herself.</p><p>No way.</p><p>That would be too much of a coincidence.</p><p>But Joe should have been on the FDR right around that time, on his way to the Met.</p><p>As she neared O\u2019Malley\u2019s, she noticed a number of people on the streets and was grateful to see that the lights in the area were bright. Maybe she was more spooked by what had happened to her than she\u2019d thought. She parked, pleased to find a spot right outside the bar.</p><p>At the door, she hesitated.</p><p>She\u2019d been coming here what felt like all her life. It was an authentic Irish pub, and her family was authentic New World Irish. This was pretty much the first place she had come after she was rescued, and it was one of the few places where she had felt truly comfortable, one of the few places where people hadn\u2019t stared, where she hadn\u2019t felt as if she needed to describe her ordeal in detail, so that people would save their pity for the dead women and not waste it on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t uncomfortable about going into O\u2019Malley\u2019s.</p><p>She was uncomfortable about confronting Joe.</p><p>What if he was with a woman? He might not have skipped the Met just because of traffic.</p> <p>Then she would sit at the bar, have a soda and chat with the bartender. She didn\u2019t know who was on, but whoever it was, she would know him. Just as she would know a dozen of the old-timers who came here. Guys who had long since retired. Perhaps they had lost their wives, perhaps they\u2019d never been married, but they liked to come to O\u2019Malley\u2019s. It was comfortable. The beer was good, the food was tasty and the prices were reasonable.</p><p>No matter what was up with Joe Connolly, she would be fine.</p><p>She pushed open the door.</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t with a date. At least, she didn\u2019t think so. He was leaning against a bar stool, shirtsleeves rolled up, tie loosened.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe.\u201d She walked over to him.</p> <p>Joe was a regular at the pub, too. She knew that he spent a lot of time here because he liked it. Because the beer was good, and the food was tasty and the prices were reasonable. But it was still more her place than his, she told herself. Even if he fit in just fine.</p><p>He was playing darts with Paddy O\u2019Leary and Angus MacHenry. Regulars. Neither one of the octogenarians really drank much. She usually found them drinking soda, water or tea\u2014hot Irish breakfast tea, always with sugar and milk.</p><p>She greeted both of them as she got closer.</p><p>The older men paused to kiss her cheek and offer her giant smiles. \u201cY\u2019 doin\u2019 okay?\u201d Angus demanded.</p><p>\u201cOn top of the world,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019 sure, lass?\u201d Paddy demanded, searching out her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been saying the same thing for a year now, but with Angus and Paddy, it was all right. They asked after her every time they saw her, took her word that she was doing fine and moved on.</p><p>Joe threw his dart. It was just shy of a bull\u2019s-eye. He walked over, and also offered a hug and a kiss on the cheek. It was awkward, though. As if he were simply going through the expected motions.</p><p>They were friends, she told herself. Like she was friends with Paddy and Angus.</p><p>Except that Paddy and Angus could have been her great-uncles, while Joe was young and straight and pretty much the perfect man.</p><p>Too damned perfect.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be up at the museum, girl?\u201d Paddy asked.</p><p>\u201cI was at the museum,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m here.\u201d She smiled to take any sting out of the words.</p> <p>\u201cAh, a great night, eh?\u201d Angus asked, rubbing his white-bearded chin.</p><p>\u201cIt was a very good night,\u201d she agreed. Then she hesitated. \u201cI need to speak with Joe,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to mess up your game or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t be silly, child,\u201d Paddy told her.</p><p>\u201cGet on over there with the girl, Joseph Connolly,\u201d Angus said cheerfully. \u201cYe can knock the socks of the both of us old geezers later.\u201d</p><p>Joe arched a brow, but he didn\u2019t complain; he just reached for his jacket and said, \u201cCertainly, gentlemen. I\u2019m delighted to speak with Genevieve. At any time.\u201d</p><p>His words were polite, almost gallant, but then, Joe was always polite. It seemed to come naturally to him.</p><p>But he seemed distant. He indicated an empty booth, and she took a seat. He sat across from her and ordered \u201canother beer\u201d as soon as the waitress arrived. Gen asked for a soda and frowned. Joe had apparently had a few drafts already.</p><p>\u201cAre you driving?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t worry. I came by subway. You know me.\u201d</p><p>Do I? she wondered.</p><p>\u201cSo how was the party?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I actually think you would have enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I intended to come.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy mother wanted to see you.\u201d Oh, that was horrible. Laying a guilt trip on him when she knew how much he liked Eileen.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Not as worried as I think she should be.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cAh. The \u2018Poe Killing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t appear to be too concerned, either.\u201d</p><p>Again, he shrugged. It bothered her that he seemed so distracted. \u201cI wish I could lose sleep over every terrible thing that happened, but I can\u2019t. We all need to keep a certain distance. It\u2019s the key to sanity and survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take the case.\u201d</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the table for a moment. \u201cGen,\u201d he said softly, giving her his attention at last, \u201cyour mom isn\u2019t one of the key players in that organization. She doesn\u2019t write about Poe. Hell, she belongs to a zillion clubs, most of them trying to make the world a better place. I can\u2019t see her as a target.\u201d His argument was rational, and the same one Eileen had given her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>He inhaled, looking off into the distance. \u201cGen, I\u2019m thinking about heading out to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned, and upset that his sudden announcement hurt her so badly. Sure, he was tall. Rugged, handsome. Frigging charming, even.</p><p>But she had led a life that didn\u2019t include a lot of wild dating, and that was by choice. If she had wanted...well, there had been plenty of willing men out there, if for no other reason than that she was rich. She had just thought that...</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cFine. Move to Vegas,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cBut take this case first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen, I\u2019m willing to bet this murder was committed by someone who just wanted to kill Thorne\u2014the Poe angle was just a convenient smoke screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>He looked away for a moment.</p><p>She leaned forward urgently. \u201cJoe, did you know that Sam Latham was driving the first car that got hit in that accident on the FDR today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked at her with a frown.</p><p>\u201cSam Latham. He\u2019s a member of the New York Poe Society, another Raven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet that at least two-thirds of the other people involved were all members of some society or other. We\u2019re social creatures. Usually,\u201d he added.</p><p>She shook her head, irritated. \u201cJoe, the New York Poe Society is not a huge group. The local membership is pretty small. Both Thorne Bigelow and Sam Latham are...were on the board. As is my mother.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, at least, that seemed to pique his interest.</p><p>\u201cJoe, there are only nine other board members, and two are Bigelow\u2019s family members. Jared, his son, and Mary Vincenzo, his sister-in-law. Then there are Brook Avery, Don Tracy, Nat Halloway, Lila Hawkins, Larry Levine, Lou Sayles and Barbara Hirshorn. There were twelve in all, but Thorne is dead. And now Sam is in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve...it was an accident. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know Poe\u2019s stories as well as the Ravens do, but since he died in the middle of the nineteenth century, I don\u2019t think any of his characters murdered anyone with a car. Somebody was probably driving recklessly, might have been drunk, might have been an asshole, but it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe the driver was pretending to drive recklessly, but he was really trying to hit Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her firmly. \u201cI saw it, and it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI saw a lot of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her at first. It was as if he hadn\u2019t even heard her. He was frowning, as if he were deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I saw most of it. And before that...before that, I saw the guy who probably caused it. He could have hit any car on that highway. He was driving like a maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get a look at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA saw a car weaving through traffic, and my instinct was to stay the hell away from it. Genevieve, I\u2019m not a traffic cop.\u201d</p><p>He was irritated, which surprised her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the car look like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head, still looking irritated. \u201cSome kind of sedan. Black, dark blue, maybe dark green.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure why, but she was certain he was angry with himself, and not with her.</p><p>Because he should have noted the car. He should have known the exact color, make and model. He should have gotten the license plate. He was an ex-cop, and in his own mind, he thought he should have done all those things, because the driver had ended up killing someone.</p><p>\u201cIt was you!\u201d she exclaimed suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you.\u201d She knew it beyond a doubt, without need for verification. Oh, yeah. It sounded just like Joe, saving a life, then walking away. The man hated the limelight.</p><p>\u201cI was not driving drunk!\u201d he said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the driver,\u201d she said.</p><p>A curtain seemed to drop over his eyes, along with a lock of his wheaten hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat was me?\u201d he asked warily.</p><p>\u201cThe missing hero.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air, his gray-green eyes as expressionless as steel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds? I\u2019m not sure myself. Eight million who live in the city, how many million more when the work force is at its peak? During rush hour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were eyewitnesses, and you\u2019ll be identified eventually.\u201d She saw his hand where it lay on the table and grabbed it. He winced. She turned it over. There was a big scrape mark on his palm.</p><p>\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want a media frenzy. You understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said quietly. Life could be so odd. She had met Joe when he and Leslie MacIntyre had discovered the horrible pit in the subway tunnel where she had been taken after she\u2019d been kidnapped by the monster who\u2019d been stalking the streets of Lower Manhattan. His other victims had wound up dead. Leslie had been killed in the showdown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe had been devastated.</p><p>But that day he and Genevieve had formed a certain bond. Maybe because they were both broken in a way.</p><p>Genevieve wasn\u2019t certain if she had made it through because she had been smart, because she had stroked the killer\u2019s ego or only because her instinct for survival had been desperate and strong. She had relied on herself in the awful days when she had been a prisoner, and in the aftermath she had created a block against those memories.</p> <p>What had been harder to handle had been the press. Finding the right words to say at all times. Her uncle\u2014who had raised her as his own child\u2014had been a fierce taskmaster. She had been born to privilege, and he had taught her to be responsible. He had made her tough, had expected her to work hard and then harder.</p><p>After the rescue, she had been treated as if she were as fragile as a thin-shelled egg, though she had told the truth about her ordeal. Even so, rumors had found their way into the press that were more horrible than anything she\u2019d been through, and for much too long she had been an object of pity. She appreciated that people could be compassionate, but she loathed being pitied, loathed the possibility that she might end up in the papers again.</p><p>She looked at Joe. \u201cBut it was you, on the highway, who saved that child, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, my voice is down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to work if this gets out. Come on, please. Don\u2019t say anything to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head, smiling. Leave it to Joe. It was all about the work. She forced the smile to go away. \u201cTake this case, Joe.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cAre you blackmailing me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her smile deepened. She hadn\u2019t thought of that, but it wasn\u2019t a bad idea. \u201cMaybe. Now, come on, I\u2019ll drive you home. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll see you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, you\u2019ve had a few.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant that I\u2019ll drive with you to your place and take a cab from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Joe. I carry Mace now, and I can take care of myself,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Hmm. She was touchy, she realized. Friends saw friends home all the time.</p><p>Maybe being defensive was a good thing if he thought that he needed to look after her. She definitely didn\u2019t want his pity or to have him as a guardian. She was tough enough to take care of herself. She had proven it. She had survived. And she meant to keep doing so. She had thrown herself into self-defense classes, and she spent hours on a treadmill, getting fit.</p><p>Running.</p><p>As if she could outrun the past.</p><p>\u201cI know you can take care of yourself, but I\u2019d still like to see you to your place. And I\u2019d like you to promise you\u2019ll keep your mouth shut about me helping out at the accident,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut. And you can see me home,\u201d she told him gravely, \u201cif you promise to take on the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so afraid, Gen. Really. I simply don\u2019t believe your mother is a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe...\u201d She hesitated. She didn\u2019t know herself why she was so concerned. Her mother hadn\u2019t been a close friend of the dead man. Eileen and Thorne had been casual acquaintances, at best, brought together only by their membership on the board.</p><p>But she was scared. Bone-deep frightened. It was something that had just settled over her, and she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable until the killer was caught.</p><p>\u201cPlease. The cops aren\u2019t getting anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d she told him, even though she herself had been thinking earlier that the press should cut the cops some slack, \u201csomebody else could die.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands, staring at her, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cEileen hasn\u2019t been threatened in any way, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve...\u201d He lowered his head for a moment, then shook it again. \u201cGen, it\u2019s only been a week, which is no time at all. You\u2019ve been watching too much television. A murder like Thorne Bigelow\u2019s isn\u2019t solved in a one-hour episode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, this is what you do for a living. I want to hire you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d be stepping in where people are hard at work already. I don\u2019t know that I could find out anything new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Maybe you could do something. Before somebody else gets killed. That\u2019s just it, Joe. Someone else could die.\u201d</p><p>It was strange, but just then Kathryn, their waitress, came by, her eyes wide. \u201cMan, what a night for the bizarre!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>Joe was studying Kathryn with apprehension.</p><p>The waitress shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s always one in every crowd, you know? Someone who just has to stick their nose in and make a tragedy worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cThe psychic,\u201d Kathryn said.</p><p>\u201cWhat psychic?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cGo look at the television,\u201d Kathryn said disgustedly. \u201cThere\u2019s a reporter talking to her right now, actually. Just turn around and you can see. It\u2019s that Robert Kinley, and he\u2019s with some so-called psychic named Lori Star, who claims that some guy named Sam Layman or Latham or something was supposed to die in the accident, and that it was the Poe Killer behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she know that?\u201d Joe asked, his expression darkening.</p><p>Kathryn shrugged. \u201cShe said she just knows it. And she says she knows more, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please!\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019m telling you, it makes sense. That\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Genevieve pressed.</p><p>\u201cShe is convincing,\u201d Kathryn admitted. \u201cShe says that in a few days, someone else will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Raven?\u201d Genevieve breathed.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. Just go watch. All she said was that the Poe Killer will murder someone else.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve slipped out of the booth first, but she was quickly followed by Joe.</p><p>The woman, who was at the accident scene talking to the well-known anchor, was attractive enough. She just seemed to be slightly...rough around the edges. Her voice was clear, though, and her grammar was good. She didn\u2019t have an identifiable accent.</p><p>She also seemed to know how to play to the camera. She was direct and dramatic, without overplaying her cards. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she whispered to the camera, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cMost people would say that\u2019s impossible,\u201d the anchor told her. There was slight scoffing in his voice. Nothing direct. He was too professional for that.</p><p>\u201cIt was as if I were there,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAs if I were driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said that you felt heat and anger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was as if I were someone else, and I could feel that person\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you a man or a woman?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But as I said before, I do know this. It was the Poe Killer. And I know this, as well. He, or she, intends to kill again\u2014soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Star.\u201d The anchor turned his full attention to the cameras. \u201cTruth or fiction? What\u2019s in store for New York? Well, first things first. The police are busy cleaning up the FDR, and it\u2019s going to be a long ride home for anyone on that highway tonight.\u201d</p><p>Another anchor picked up from the studio, and Genevieve turned to look at Joe, but he was already turning away.</p><p>\u201cKathryn, I\u2019ll take another beer, please,\u201d he called.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Before he even opened his eyes, Joe winced.</p><p>His head was pounding.</p><p>What in the hell had made him drink so damned much beer? He hadn\u2019t even gone for the hard stuff, which he should have. No, he had just started inhaling the beer because of...</p><p>The accident.</p><p>It was ridiculous. He\u2019d seen lots of accidents. He should have felt good; a little girl had been saved because of him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>He felt unnerved.</p><p>Because a dead man had spoken to him.</p><p>And things hadn\u2019t gotten any better after that.</p><p>A psychic. A self-proclaimed psychic solving the whole damned thing while somehow not solving anything at all.</p><p>Lori Star? Like hell. She might as well have called herself Moonbeam.</p><p>He went ahead and groaned, thinking that voicing his pain might make him feel a little better. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Hell, no. Because he\u2019d awakened thinking.</p><p>And all he could think about was the fact that a dead man had spoken to him, and then, as if that hadn\u2019t been bad enough, the news had dragged a damned psychic out of the woodwork. She knew, she just knew, that the driver of the car had been after Sam Latham.</p><p>No, they hadn\u2019t dragged her out of anywhere. She\u2019d come forward, claiming to be eager to help the police.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t identify the car, of course. Because it was as if she had been the one driving it. She had been in his would-be head as he\u2014or she\u2014went after Sam Latham\u2019s car. And then she\u2019d finished up with the dramatic revelation someone else would be murdered within days.</p><p>Later newscasts had delved into the truth about the woman, but too late for him. Genevieve had looked at him with her huge blue imploring eyes. And he\u2019d known right then that he was on the case.</p><p>Though he dreaded it. Dreaded it. And he didn\u2019t know why, other than that it had something to do with that freakin\u2019 psychic.</p><p>It had turned out that Lori Star was an aspiring actress, as well as a supposed psychic. No wonder she\u2019d been so good in front of the camera. But there would be those out there convinced that it was no act, that she was right, that the accident had been no accident.</p><p>Even if she was right\u2014and he sure as hell didn\u2019t see how she could be\u2014he was sure that all she had done was look at a few facts and take a lucky guess. She was definitely not a psychic. She just wanted her fifteen minutes of television fame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he was so angry because...</p><p>Because he had known Leslie. And he hadn\u2019t believed in her at first, when she claimed to talk to the dead. But she had been legit.</p><p>And this girl sure as hell wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>He opened his eyes. He wasn\u2019t at home, but he already knew that. He was at Genevieve\u2019s. She hadn\u2019t let him take a cab; she\u2019d insisted he stay on her couch. Lacking both the will and the physical coordination to find a cab willing to go to Brooklyn at that hour, he had shrugged and agreed. And fallen asleep. Or passed out. One or the other.</p><p>He\u2019d been doing all right last night, considering what he\u2019d gone through with Leslie and her ability to commune with the dead, until that damned psychic had shown up on television. And then he\u2019d started calling for the beers hard and fast.</p><p>Now, of course, he was ashamed of himself. Only cowards drank because they\u2019d been spooked. And what a fool he\u2019d been, besides. As far as talking to a dead man went, there was surely a logical explanation for what had happened. One, maybe the EMT had simply been wrong and Brookfield hadn\u2019t died on impact. Or maybe, as Freud might have suggested, Joe had created the man\u2019s voice as a tool to tell him to look for survivors in the car. There. That made sense\u2014so long as he didn\u2019t think about the fact that his inner voice had known the girl\u2019s name.</p><p>And the fact that Lori Star was an annoying fraud seeking the spotlight. Well, hell, that made sense, too. She was just trying to get work.</p><p>So here he was, having had way too much to drink, sleeping on Gen\u2019s sofa. It was a nice one, too. Antique, but restuffed and reupholstered. She loved things that were old and had a story. She and Leslie would have been great friends.</p> <p>The thought made him wince and shut his eyes.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, his face lined with tension, she was there.</p><p>Gen, not Leslie.</p><p>Thank God he was seeing the living, at least.</p><p>That caused a moment\u2019s guilt to trickle down his spine. Leslie...I would love to see you. Your face...</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t really true. He didn\u2019t want to see ghosts.</p> <p>No problem. This was Gen in front of him, and she didn\u2019t seem to be judging him for his night of imbibing, even if she probably didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t intend to explain.</p><p>Let her think that it was because he had been a witness to such an awful accident, or because he could have died when the car blew up.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said gravely, handing him a glass and a couple of aspirin.</p><p>He looked at her, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey work for a hangover.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnd no, I don\u2019t spend my life fighting hangovers. A lot of people thought I\u2019d wind up on drugs or alcohol after the kidnapping, and this was a tip my doctor gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said briefly, swallowing the pills with the glass of water she\u2019d provided.</p><p>He didn\u2019t really want to look at Gen. He felt too much like the dregs of humanity to want to face her.</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t anything not to like about her, of course. Genetics had made her beautiful\u2014Eileen, at forty-plus could still turn heads. Gen had the same perfect features, perfect skin and more-than-perfect build. She had rich auburn hair that looked more lustrous than silk and more wicked than sin. And her eyes...</p><p>Just saying they were blue didn\u2019t do them justice. They were the blue of the infinite sky, the blue of the deepest sea. Blue that could hint at darkness, blue that spoke of wisdom, even though she was only twenty-odd years old.</p><p>They were eyes that had seen a lot. The child of privilege, she had wanted to help those who hadn\u2019t been born with silver spoons in their mouths. She hadn\u2019t jetted around the globe, hobnobbing with the rich and useless. She had gone to school, gotten a degree and gone into social work.</p><p>She had survived for weeks in the underground lair of a psychotic killer.</p><p>She was strong. She was...</p><p>She was alive because Leslie had taken the bullet meant for her.</p><p>He pushed that thought from his mind. Genevieve sure as hell hadn\u2019t wanted that to happen, and he knew it. And Leslie had been gone nearly a year now. He liked to think that she was back with Matt, at last, but he didn\u2019t really believe it. He could have sworn that he had once seen them together on a little rise in the cemetery where they were both buried.</p><p>Again, Freud would have helped him out.</p><p>He had seen them there because he wanted to see them there.</p><p>\u201cYou should feel better soon,\u201d Gen told him, breaking into his morose thoughts.</p><p>Better than he deserved, she might have said.</p><p>But of course, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>He leaned back, studying her. She was already up and showered, smelling both fresh and subtly exotic, rich tendrils of her amazing hair curling over the casual black sweater she was wearing over jeans. He noticed her hands\u2014delicate, refined, manicured, but not fussily so; she kept her nails filed and polished, but at a reasonable length. And she wasn\u2019t encrusted with jewels; she wore a simple claddagh ring on her left middle finger, gold studs in her ears and a plain cross around her neck.</p><p>She could easily have covered herself in furs and diamonds. Instead, she didn\u2019t even buy designer sunglasses; he knew because she had laughingly told him once that she seemed to lose a pair a week, so it made sense to buy them off the street vendors.</p><p>And in fact, she knew the streets.</p><p>Once upon a time she hadn\u2019t been regularly recognized. Despite her family\u2019s wealth, she\u2019d kept far from the public eye and worked for a pittance helping to get prostitutes off the streets.</p><p>What the hell was not to like about her? he asked himself silently, wondering why the question left him feeling so irritable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She grinned, looking away. \u201cRight. Real men don\u2019t get loaded on too much beer.\u201d</p><p>He groaned aloud and started to rise.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cLook, I know that what you saw must have been really terrible. I can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t she? he wondered.</p><p>Dead was dead.</p><p>Did it matter if death came with gallons of blood, mangled steel and mangled flesh? Or a neat little bullet hole that left a person looking as if she were at peace, merely sleeping.</p><p>She had seen enough, he thought.</p><p>And she had somehow risen above it all.</p><p>He felt even more like a lout, if that were possible.</p><p>\u201cYou have every right,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cThat woman was a jerk,\u201d she said. \u201cLori Star? I doubt it. I don\u2019t know where she was getting her information, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not in touch with helpful spirits or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>The way Genevieve looked at him, he knew that she was thinking about Leslie, too. She had known that her kidnapper had been determined to kill Leslie; she\u2019d been at the top of his list.</p><p>Because Leslie had known things. She had seen things. He wasn\u2019t certain that psychic was the word to describe her, but whatever she\u2019d been, she\u2019d been for real.</p><p>He waved a hand in the air. \u201cHey, I was a horse\u2019s ass last night, and it was inexcusable,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, once you weren\u2019t so angry, you were kind of cute.\u201d</p><p>Kind of cute? Great. Just what he\u2019d always wanted to be. A kind-of-cute drunk.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for your forgiveness. And your couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, there\u2019s a meeting tonight,\u201d she informed him, her eyes somber.</p><p>\u201cA meeting?\u201d Heaven help him, did she think he needed AA?</p><p>\u201cOf the\u2014the Ravens.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her quizzically. \u201cOn Saturday night? Date night?\u201d His tone was mocking; he was stalling her, he knew. \u201cMust be a wild bunch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJoe, we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, you promised last night that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand. Damn, she was persistent.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d take the case,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go to the meeting. But you aren\u2019t going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is going to be there, Joe. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m not going to be there, too.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent. What the hell was the matter with these people? If they all believed that Thorne Bigelow had been killed because he was a Raven, wouldn\u2019t anyone sane think that perhaps they shouldn\u2019t meet until the killer had been apprehended?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just stupid for them to be meeting,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cStupid or not, it\u2019s happening,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the one who said that the whole Poe thing is a smoke screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it could be a smoke screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...woman said that another Raven would be dead in a matter of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen...\u201d He winced, lowering his head. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was feeling the temple-pounding headache of a killer hangover, or a sense of mixed anger and dread. Gen was surely the most stubborn human being he\u2019d ever met. She was like pit bull on behalf of the underdog or any cause she believed in. She rushed in where the sane wouldn\u2019t go.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t angry with her, only upset that people liked to play so casually with the fears of others by claiming to know the future.</p><p>He lifted his chin, eyes on fire, and pointed a finger at her. \u201cI said I\u2019d take the case, and I will. But you\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always listen to you, Joe,\u201d she said softly. That unnerved him.</p><p>Oh, yeah, she listened, in a perfect case of point noted\u2014and rejected.</p><p>\u201cJoe, honestly, I have to go tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the Ravens are just going to discuss some favorite masterpiece by Poe?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll talk about the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not members. Are you sure they\u2019ll let us in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMembers are always free to bring guests. It\u2019s simply a matter of paying for their meals. And can you imagine anyone trying to tell my mother that she\u2019s not welcome to bring her daughter and a friend?\u201d</p><p>Gen had a point. Eileen had the power to open a lot of doors.</p><p>He stood up. The world didn\u2019t rock. A shower would fix him, he decided.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going home, but I\u2019ll be back in time to go to the meeting with you. And you\u2019ll stay here until I come back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe...\u201d She said his name in a soft whisper, accompanied by a weary sigh. \u201cI am not a hothouse flower. I\u2019ve been taking care of myself in the city for some time now. I do not intend to stay cooped up in my apartment all day.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice apartment.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. It was a nice apartment. She lived here because of Eileen; the building was supposed to have the best security system in the city.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive it a rest, Gen. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of hours. Depending on traffic,\u201d he added dryly, wondering how long it would take to reclaim his car at the impound lot.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If we\u2019re going to this meeting, let\u2019s do a little Poe research first, huh?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, a slow smile curving her lips, a light entering her eyes.</p><p>Damn, she was a beautiful woman.</p><p>\u201cOh, Joe, that\u2019s great!\u201d</p> <p>She leapt up and threw her arms around him. Her scent was intoxicating, and the feel of her warm body as she crushed herself against him was like a taste of heaven.</p><p>He unwound her arms and stepped back. \u201cYou, uh, you stay here till I get back, promise?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cJust this morning, Gen, please? Until I get a handle on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Raven. It\u2019s my mom we\u2019re worried about, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, fine.\u201d</p><p>He started out.</p> <p>\u201cJoe? You don\u2019t have your car,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cYou can take mine. It\u2019s in the garage.\u201d</p><p>He was certain that the garage fee in this building was probably more than most Americans paid for an apartment. But he couldn\u2019t take her car. It was time to rescue his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just grab a cab for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call you a car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can run out to the street and snag a cab. I\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Genevieve didn\u2019t mind spending a few hours in the apartment. In fact, she loved the apartment and liked killing time there. What she did mind was being told that she needed to stay somewhere, anywhere, even though she knew that she should be grateful she had friends who cared.</p><p>At least he intended to involve her in the investigation, although he definitely wasn\u2019t happy about how things had played out last night. He was never happy if he wasn\u2019t in control. Not so much of others, but he was the kind of man who wanted to be in control of himself at all times, and getting drunk was anything but.</p><p>Restlessly, she paced the room. The morning would go slowly. She was sure of it.</p><p>She put a call through to her mother, just to say hello and tell her that she and Joe would be taking her to the meeting that night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be much of a meeting,\u201d Eileen warned. \u201cAll they\u2019ll do is talk about poor Thorne.\u201d She hesitated at the other end of the line. \u201cI suppose a lot of them are frightened, after what that psychic said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d Genevieve chided.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d There was another slight silence, then a gasp. \u201cOh, Genevieve! Perhaps you shouldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, darling, after all you\u2019ve been through, do you really want to be around a bunch of people talking about murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve been through, I take great delight in going wherever I choose to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up at six-thirty,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, I can get there by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up at six-thirty,\u201d Gen repeated.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ll be with Joe,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cRight. At least I\u2019ll be with Joe,\u201d Genevieve agreed, though she was more than a little irritated by her mother\u2019s words. Even her own mother felt she needed protection.</p><p>Genevieve rang off and wandered over to her desk, where she brought the front page of the paper up on her computer, curious to see if anything new had been written about Thorne\u2019s murder.</p><p>The headline and the main story were on the accident that had taken place on the FDR. She read the story, then clicked a link and watched the video that had been taken by a chance onlooker. Unfortunately, nothing in the story or the video told her anything that Joe hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Genevieve drummed her fingers on the desk. Sam Latham had been in that accident.</p><p>And so had Joe.</p><p>She hesitated, then picked up the phone again. This time she called St. Vincent\u2019s.</p><p>Sam was in a regular room and able to see visitors.</p><p>Again she hesitated. Then she glanced at the clock. She could get to St. Vincent\u2019s and back in plenty of time. She wouldn\u2019t take her own car. She would have Tim, the morning security guard, call for car service, and the driver could just wait for her while she was at the hospital. She could be back in no time.</p><p>Even as she made the arrangements, she felt guilty.</p><p>She told herself that she didn\u2019t owe anyone anything, that she was a free woman who could come and go as she pleased. Even so, she felt guilty.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d promised.</p><p>But it was broad daylight, and she needed to see Sam Latham.</p><p>But she had promised.</p><p>As her mind warred with itself, the phone rang. She was going to let the machine get it, but she heard Joe\u2019s voice and picked up.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he returned. \u201cListen, I forgot I had an appointment. I\u2019ll be a few hours longer. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can fill the time somehow,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s say I\u2019ll be back around two or two-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Okay, so she still felt guilty. But, really, the promise had been made during the last conversation, when he wasn\u2019t going to be gone nearly so long. That had to make it null and void. She had said that she would find a way to fill the time, and she would.</p><p>She left her apartment, making sure to lock up, and hurried to the elevator.</p><p>If he\u2019d been blindfolded, he would have known where he was.</p><p>No matter how much antiseptic was used, no matter what kind of air filtration was in place, a morgue smelled like a morgue.</p><p>Even in the entry rooms.</p><p>Joe was grateful to be in good standing with the police. He didn\u2019t even need to show his credentials when he arrived; Judy, at the desk, knew him well.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d</p><p>She was a big woman, round and rosy-cheeked, fiftysomething and always pleasant. She was the perfect person to meet the public in such a place.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThe living always look handsome to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shucks, be careful or all these compliments will go to my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter be careful\u2014your head could swell up like a balloon if I really got going,\u201d she teased. \u201cBut you\u2019re not here to flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Judy, \u2019fraid not. I need to know who was on the Thorne Bigelow autopsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was Frankie.\u201d</p><p>Not many people could have used such a casual reference. Frankie was Dr. Francis Arbitter, one of the most renowned members of the medical examiner\u2019s office. He was a down-to-earth guy, but his expertise had earned him a reverence over the years that made most people speak of him with awe.</p><p>\u201cIs he available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>A phone call sent him through the double doors and down the hallway to autopsy room number four.</p><p>Francis Arbitter was alone. There was a corpse on a Gurney, but a sheet covered the torso and limbs. There was a huge gash on the head of the middle-aged, bearded man who lay there, but there was no sign of blood. The body had been washed for the exam that was about to take place.</p><p>Frank was at his desk, munching on what appeared to be a ham and cheese on rye. \u201cJoe!\u201d he called with a smile, and he rose. He was a tall, well-muscled man who looked like he should have been playing fullback instead of solving mysteries at a morgue. But his tousled, thinning hair and Coke-bottle glasses gave him a little bit of the mad-scientist look that was more befitting to his chosen calling.</p><p>\u201cSit, sit,\u201d he said, drawing up a chair from behind one of the other clinically clean desks in the room.</p><p>Joe took a seat. He\u2019d been in plenty of morgues, but he never became as accustomed to working with the dead as Frank, who got right to the point.</p><p>\u201cIf you just wanted to shoot the breeze, you\u2019d have called to meet for a beer somewhere. So what\u2019s up? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the Thorne Bigelow murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deduction,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cWell, speaking as Dr. Watson here, I\u2019d have to say I learned something from Holmes,\u201d Frank said shrewdly. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked for Eileen Brideswell before. She knew Thorne, so I assume she intends to use her resources to help the police find the murderer. After all, she has a lot at stake.\u201d</p><p>Joe decided not to correct him and explain that he wasn\u2019t working for Eileen but had been pretty much forced to take the case by Genevieve. He wasn\u2019t surprised that Frank had made the assumption that his appearance had to do with the case, but he was surprised that Frank seemed to think that Eileen had a lot at stake.</p><p>He nodded, watching Frank. \u201cYes, I\u2019m here about Bigelow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son picked up the body the other day. Personally. What with the Bigelow money, he certainly didn\u2019t have to do it, but the kid came in here crying like a baby. Well, hell, he\u2019s not a kid, really. He\u2019s got to be about thirty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess you never get so old that you don\u2019t feel the loss of a parent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Frank shrugged. \u201cI talked to him. He\u2019s on the warpath himself, wants to know who killed his father, and why.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at Frank, and Frank grinned and shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you and I both know that the Bigelow money and power drew lots of enemies. But, hey, I\u2019m not a cop. I turn over my findings, and the cops take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the man\u2019s love for a good glass of wine did him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo his wine was definitely poisoned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. He hadn\u2019t eaten in hours. From the timing, I got the impression he was probably about to go out for dinner. That it was the aperitif before the meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosencraft 1858. A very rare burgundy,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>Joe almost smiled. \u201cI meant the poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArsenic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought arsenic poisoners usually dosed their victims more slowly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArsenic poisoning was popular in the past. Centuries ago. People got sick, and eventually they died. But a large dose is just as effective\u2014and quicker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas there anything else? Any sign of a struggle? Bruises, gashes, defensive wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Frank told him.</p><p>Joe was silent. Frank shrugged. \u201c\u2018Quoth the raven\u2014die.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about poisoning in \u2018The Raven,\u2019 is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but there is in both \u2018The Black Cat\u2019 and \u2018The Cask of Amontillado.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do the autopsy, Joe. That\u2019s it. After that, I let the cops do their work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho caught the case?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cRaif Green and Thomas Dooley. They\u2019re both good guys. Neither one is green. They\u2019ve been working murders together for almost ten years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know them both,\u201d Joe said. He knew them well, and he liked them both. That was a relief. Neither was the type of hothead to get antsy because a P. I. was on the case. They were both workhorses who had come up through the ranks, seen everything, grown weary and kept at it anyway. Good cops, they were constrained by the department\u2019s budget and tended to be pleased when someone like him could throw some private citizen\u2019s funds at a case.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a break for you,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, I\u2019ll give Raif a call. I know him best,\u201d Joe said as he rose. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to grab a beer soon, Frank. I don\u2019t want to keep you from your work now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Old Hank isn\u2019t going to get any deader,\u201d Frank told him.</p><p>Joe glanced over at the body on the Gurney. If it weren\u2019t for the gash, \u201cOld Hank\u201d could have been sleeping.</p><p>\u201cA fall?\u201d he asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. You bet. He fell right into his buddy\u2019s broken-off whiskey bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always sad,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing\u2014death is sad. Except...\u201d</p><p>Curiously, Joe turned back to him. \u201cExcept?\u201d</p><p>Frank shrugged. \u201cEvery once in a while, I get someone in here who was dying of cancer or something. I cut them open, and it\u2019s horrifying what disease does to them on the inside. But on the outside, hell, sometimes it\u2019s as if they\u2019re actually smiling. Like death was a release from god-awful pain.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou get used to it. Then again\u2014hell, you should know this\u2014you never get used to it. And if you did, you\u2019d suck at your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Arbitter?\u201d</p><p>A young woman was standing in the open door.</p><p>\u201cConnie?\u201d Frank said.</p><p>\u201cThey need you in reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Frank told Joe.</p><p>Joe started to protest. He needed to get going. But Frank had already gone to see to whatever business had summoned him away.</p><p>Joe looked over at the body, and suddenly the corpse\u2019s head turned, and the grizzled old man opened his eyes. Hey, you. Yeah, you, buddy. You can see me, and you can hear me. You tell Vinny I said fuck you! You tell him he\u2019s going to get his. He can get that crack-freak friend of his to pay his bail, but he\u2019s going to go down out on the streets. You tell him. He ain\u2019t going to have a moment\u2019s peace. You tell him, you hear me? Damn you, you hear me?</p><p>Joe felt frozen, staring at the corpse.</p><p>This was bullshit.</p><p>It was all in his mind.</p><p>Hell, he must have had even more to drink last night than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>The door behind him swung open again. He spun around. Frank had returned, muttering. \u201cWith all today\u2019s technology, these clerks still can\u2019t spell. Who the hell mistakes the word breast for beast?\u201d</p><p>Joe looked back at the body.</p><p>It was just a corpse again.</p><p>Old Hank couldn\u2019t get any deader.</p><p>\u201cJoe? You all right?\u201d Frank asked. \u201cHell, man, you\u2019re as white as if you\u2019d seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Joe forced a laugh. \u201cLike you said, Frank. Old Hank can\u2019t get any deader. I take it the cops have whoever did this to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead to rights. A low-life drug dealer. Not that Hank was your model citizen. He bought it during a barroom fight with a guy named Vincent Cenzo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just had to ask, Joe thought.</p><p>\u201cSo, Joe. I\u2019m sorry, where were we?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>\u201cFinished,\u201d Joe said, offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cBeers are on me,\u201d Frank said as they shook.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. You need anything else, don\u2019t hesitate to call.\u201d</p><p>Call. Yup. Next time, he would just call.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Frank. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He felt like a swimmer who had seen a shark and needed to stay calm. He tried like hell not to go running out of the autopsy room.</p><p>He managed to push his way through the doors like a normal person, then walked quickly down the hall. He even managed a goodbye and thanks for Judy at the desk.</p><p>Then he burst out into the light of day and joined the throng of people rushing around in the Saturday afternoon sunshine.</p><p>He was almost running...</p><p>And then he stopped.</p><p>Because there was no way for a man to run away from his own mind.</p><p>What a beautiful day.</p><p>He walked and walked, wishing he had a hat to tip to passersby. It was nearly summer, but the usual heat and humidity weren\u2019t plaguing the city today. No rain clouds marred the heavens. No unhealthy miasma hung around the buildings, and a pleasant breeze swept through the giant forests of concrete and steel. It was simply a perfect day.</p><p>He visited St. Mark\u2019s Square, where he paused, thinking that politicians, stars, geniuses, men of letters, heroes, patriots and enemies of the state had once walked this way. He closed his eyes and imagined a long-ago city.</p><p>What a beautiful, beautiful day. It was just good to be out. To love New York. To love the world.</p><p>To bask in pleasure.</p><p>Someone walked by him with a boom box blaring, gold chains making a strange clanking sound against the plastic casing. The man\u2019s arm sported a tattoo.</p><p>Ah, yes. The gangs of New York. Ever present. Then and now.</p><p>A little Yorkie passed him, yapping shrilly. He was tempted to kick the tiny beast into the traffic. Instead, he paused and said something complimentary to the dog\u2019s pudgy owner, who blushed and chatted. He moved on quickly then, afraid she was going to try to give him her phone number.</p><p>He passed a police officer strolling his beat, and nodded a greeting. The officer nodded and smiled in return.</p><p>As he walked at a leisurely pace, he passed an electronics store. A giant plasma screen took up most of the display window. The news was on, so he paused to watch.</p><p>His heart was filled with glee. He longed to laugh aloud. Instead, he watched gravely as other people grouped around him on the sidewalk.</p><p>The entire city was still pondering the death of Thorne Bigelow.</p><p>Philanthropist.</p><p>Icon.</p><p>Brilliant man of letters.</p><p>Like hell!</p><p>Bastard. Braggart. Glutton. Idiot.</p><p>\u201cWhat a horrible way to die,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that book he wrote. He was killed because someone didn\u2019t like his book on Poe,\u201d a young woman said solemnly.</p><p>Her boyfriend slipped an arm around her shoulders. She was hugging something that looked like a mop. Maltese, Pekinese, some kind of \u201cese.\u201d What was it with people and their obnoxious little dogs ruining his Saturday morning?</p><p>\u201cIt could have been anything,\u201d the boyfriend said. \u201cI mean, the man was a billionaire.\u201d</p><p>The man was a bag of hot air. Gas. He was one big fart.</p><p>\u201cTragic,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>The boyfriend was shaking his head. \u201cDid you know that one of the guys who got hurt in that pileup on the FDR was some friend of Bigelow\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>The girl shivered. \u201cAnd that psychic said somebody else is going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink psychics really know the future?\u201d he asked, turning to the couple.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d the girl said, and turned to look at him. Maybe a little too closely. \u201cThere are real psychics out there. People who see things. Who knows if that woman, that Lori Star, is really one of them, though. I mean, I never heard of her. She hasn\u2019t written a book or anything. Anyway, it\u2019s all so tragic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTragic,\u201d he repeated, shaking his head.</p><p>And he moved on somberly, his head lowered.</p><p>His grin wide.</p><p>Yes, it was a beautiful day.</p><p>His grin suddenly faded.</p><p>It was bull. There weren\u2019t really people out there who could see the future, who had second sight, who could share experiences as if they were in another person\u2019s body and just...know things.</p><p>Were there?</p><p>He kept walking, pensive.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t such a beautiful day after all.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys, for taking the time to meet me,\u201d Joe said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were at Gino\u2019s Salads and Sandwiches, near One Police Plaza.</p><p>Times had changed. Once upon a time, Raif Green would have been wolfing down a hamburger anywhere that served up hot, greasy food. Tom Dooley would have chosen corned beef on rye.</p><p>But, as he had discovered when he called Raif, Tom Dooley had suffered a heart attack two years ago. No doughnuts for these cops anymore.</p><p>Raif had opted for the Greek salad, while Tom was nibbling his turkey, low-fat Swiss, lettuce and tomato on wheat, as if by taking small bites he could make the sandwich last longer.</p> <p>Thomas Dooley was a big man. He\u2019d lost weight since Joe had seen him last, but he was still six-four and just shy of three-hundred pounds. Raif wasn\u2019t really all that small or thin\u2014five-ten and one-eighty, maybe\u2014but next to Tom Dooley, he looked like a midget.</p><p>Both men were in their early forties.</p><p>Both still had their hair.</p><p>They were like Laurel and Hardy in size and appearance, but there was nothing comedic about the work they did.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Raif said. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday, we should be off, but here we are\u2014working. You know, this may be a democracy but Joe Schmo in the streets gets knocked off and it\u2019s nine to five. Bigelow...well, he was a big cheese. No one is off until we solve this one.\u201d He cast Joe a crooked grin. \u201cAt least we can eat light and fit, with you picking up the tab. There\u2019s the problem with heart-healthy. It\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d kill for a fry,\u201d Tom said. His round face was deceptive. He looked so amiable, but in an interrogation room, he was about as amiable as King Kong on steroids.</p><p>\u201cSo, one day, order some fries,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>Tom shook his head. \u201cMy wife would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your wife here, Tom?\u201d Raif demanded.</p><p>\u201cI swear, that woman should be the detective. She\u2019s got surveillance everywhere,\u201d Raif said, shaking his head. \u201cHell. She\u2019s got eyes in the flipping lettuce, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting old. Talking about food,\u201d Raif said to Joe.</p> <p>\u201cThe way of the world,\u201d Joe assured him. \u201cYour wife just wants you alive, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cMan, this is rabbit food, though.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded sympathetically, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your take on the Poe angle? Motive or smoke screen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far?\u201d Raif wiped his mouth with his paper napkin. \u201cSo far, we don\u2019t have a hell of a lot to go on. What you saw in the papers is pretty much what we have. I wanted to conceal the note, but there was a leak\u2014not a big surprise, there were uniforms all over the place before we got there. The crime-scene guys had a nightmare, trying to figure it all out. First the son gets there and gets hysterical, then the sister-in-law...and the butler, to boot. Everyone decides they\u2019re going to save him. People calling 9-1-1, med techs all over. It looked like he\u2019d had a heart attack or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal on the butler?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Raif shook his head. \u201cYou think it might be as easy as the butler did it? I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s a skinny old English guy, and he was totally shaken. His name is Albee Bennet. He was in tears when we interviewed him, and he didn\u2019t know a thing. He has his own little apartment in the building, and he was there napping when it happened. Never saw or heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe him?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Raif said.</p> <p>\u201cI believed him, too. You know, it\u2019s that sixth sense you get about people after doing this job for so many years,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cSo, he was there. And the son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst one on the scene. He\u2019d been out. But he lived there\u2014came and went all the time,\u201d Tom told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on him?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Raif shrugged. \u201cHis tears seemed real, too. Young guy, early thirties. We asked around, and it seems he and his dad didn\u2019t have any major problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sister-in-law?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cMary Vincenzo. His late-brother\u2019s wife,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll interview her, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Raif said dryly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it. She\u2019s real thin, one of those nervous types. Wealthy in her own right. The brother left her part of the family fortune already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen them wiping their lips when they heard it was poison,\u201d Tom commented, shaking his head.</p><p>The concept of poison didn\u2019t in the least deter him from his enjoyment of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I just want to hear it beginning-to-end. The med techs were there? How soon did they discover that it was a crime scene, if everyone thought it was a heart attack?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty darned quick, thanks to one of the bright boys with fire rescue,\u201d Raif informed him. \u201cHe stopped them from moving the body when he noticed it was cold. But, actually, they were right to think it. I mean, say your grandmother or someone in your house dies in the middle of the night, and you call 9-1-1. They\u2019re taught to try mouth-to-mouth. Even if you\u2019re sure they\u2019re dead. Anyway, the body is cold, and this kid is bright. And because it\u2019s an unexplained death, he tells the head guy on his team that they need the cops. The cops come, and then the medical examiner\u2019s office gets out there. Doc Arbitter is on, and he figures out it could be poison in the wine. So at least there\u2019s photo documentation of just about everything. Everything after the family and EMTs have moved everything to hell and gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was the note found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on his desk. Just one piece of paper among a bunch of others\u2014no one even noticed it at first. Looked like\u2014and forensics proved\u2014it had come right out of his own printer. Computer was dusted, of course, and there weren\u2019t any prints, so it had been wiped down,\u201d Tom told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the timing? And why did the sister-in-law show up?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cThe son showed up first to tell his dad it was time to go. And he\u2019d already been to get his aunt. They were all going to some dinner party. The butler didn\u2019t come out until after the son and sister-in-law arrived,\u201d Tom explained.</p><p>Raif continued the report. \u201cWhen the son walked in, it looked like the old man had been drinking his special vintage wine, and then just keeled over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was just one wineglass?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>Tom waved what was left of his turkey-and-Swiss in the air. \u201cIn a nutshell, we think Bigelow was alone. He was due at that dinner party at eight, and he\u2019d been dead about an hour when he was found. He had a visitor earlier, though. He last spoke to the butler around five and told him someone was coming before closing himself into his office. But whoever it was must have come and gone, because Bigelow was drinking alone.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cEither that, or the killer took his wineglass with him. Anyone check to see if a glass was missing?\u201d</p><p>Tom flushed and looked at Raif.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Raif admitted, reddening.</p><p>\u201cNo one saw anyone come or go?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one. The chauffeur was waiting for them out in the garage, sleeping behind the wheel, by his own admission,\u201d Tom said. \u201cAnd, yes, we canvassed the neighborhood. No one saw anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the\u2014the other Ravens?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken with them. They all claim to have alibis, but we have a lot of legwork to do, checking them all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you can tell me about the family?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Raif looked at Tom.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you know I\u2019m licensed, and I\u2019ve been hired by an interested party,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. We\u2019ve got some files on the rest of the board. I\u2019ll fax \u2019em to you,\u201d Raif said. \u201cI\u2019d just as soon you not mention it around, though. Some guys on the force aren\u2019t all that fond of outside interest, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. And thanks,\u201d Joe told him. He hesitated, then asked. \u201cWhat do you think about that woman on TV, the one who claimed to be psychic?\u201d</p><p>Raif and Tom exchanged glances again.</p><p>Joe groaned softly. \u201cOh, Lord. You two believed her?\u201d</p><p>Tom laughed softly.</p><p>Raif\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cJerry Grant in vice has picked her up at least three times,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor fraud?\u201d Joe suggested.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Raif said. \u201cVice doesn\u2019t handle fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe picked her up for prostitution,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI noticed that last night she was going by Lori Star. When the cops picked her up, she was going by Candy Cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did say she was an actress,\u201d Joe said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s put on a few innocent acts at the station, all right,\u201d Raif said. \u201cStill, we\u2019re going to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, as soon as Tom Turkey here finishes his sandwich,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cMind if I tag along?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, we\u2019re on your dime today,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Raif was staring at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it would bother you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e...that Leslie MacIntyre. She was supposed to be the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should definitely go. I\u2019ll know the real thing when I see it.\u201d</p><p>Sam Latham was an all-around good guy. Thirty-six years old, married and the father of two young children. He worked in the editorial department of one of the major publishers, and he simply loved books, especially mysteries, and joined scholars everywhere in considering Edgar Allan Poe to be the father of the detective novel. Genevieve had met him through her mother, and though she couldn\u2019t say she knew him well, she had always liked him, his wife and their kids, Vickie, eleven, and Geoffrey, fourteen.</p><p>When she arrived at the hospital, she expected something more than what she found: a quiet hallway; Dorothy, Sam\u2019s wife, in the room with him; and a woman who introduced herself as his mother, Stella, returning with coffee from the hospital cafeteria. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No cops in the hallways, no one on guard.</p><p>Because apparently no one believed that Sam had been the intended victim of a killer. Despite the so-called psychic.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve!\u201d Sam said with pleasure, seeing her at the door. He had a cut below one eye, and the bruising that accompanied it, but other than that he appeared to be fine, though the sheets could have been covering other injuries.</p> <p>\u201cSam, Dorothy...Mrs. Latham,\u201d she said after introductions were made.</p><p>His mother was probably around sixty-five. She had stunning silver hair styled to set off her tiny features. She immediately looked apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t know Sam was expecting visitors. I could have gotten you a coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, but thank you so much for the thought,\u201d Genevieve said. She\u2019d stopped downstairs for a flower arrangement, which Dorothy came forward to accept.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Genevieve asked Sam, as Dorothy added the flowers to the others filling the room.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Sam said.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a liar,\u201d Dorothy said, distressed. \u201cHe goes into surgery tomorrow. For his leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sam, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>His mother cleared her throat. \u201cAre you going to be here for a while, dear? I thought Dorothy and I might go grab something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d Sam said with a groan.</p><p>Genevieve glanced quickly at Dorothy, who tried to appear impassive. Apparently Dorothy was more worried than the police were. Maybe she\u2019d seen the psychic on TV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to stay and chat with Sam until you return,\u201d Genevieve said.</p> <p>His mother flashed her a grateful smile; Dorothy gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cSam,\u201d Dorothy asked, \u201cwill you be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, go eat. Genevieve will guard me. She has a black belt now.\u201d</p><p>Gen didn\u2019t have a black belt. But she didn\u2019t contradict him.</p><p>The other two women left, and Genevieve took the chair by the bed. She looked at the IV drip, and the various tubes to which he was attached.</p><p>\u201cWell, other than the hardware, you do look good,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He showed her a little clicker which had been hidden in his hand. \u201cMorphine,\u201d he said, with a dry grin.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sam, I\u2019m so sorry. It must have been a horrible accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A horrible accident,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>\u201cBut it was an accident,\u201d she said. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, as if suddenly realizing she had come for more than a simple visit. \u201cI guess,\u201d he told her. \u201cGenevieve, I didn\u2019t see anything. I was driving along, thinking about a new manuscript we\u2019d just paid a small fortune for, and then...\u201d</p><p>She could have chatted a while, talked more about his kids, pretended. But Sam wasn\u2019t about to pretend, so she wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cThen...bang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Then...that sound. That awful impact,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>She inhaled deeply. \u201cWell...you look good,\u201d she said, trying to sound cheerful.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cGenevieve, you\u2019re full of bull. I look like shit. And you\u2019re a nice person, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d visit me no matter what, but you\u2019re worried because of Thorne Bigelow. You think someone wants to kill all the Ravens. Including your mother.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t attempt to deny it. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple of people reported a car driving erratically. The cops wanted to know if I had seen it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I was driving, then...wham. I was out. The air bag saved my life\u2014that\u2019s why the bruises. But I was knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was on a stretcher with a microphone in my face while I was being stuffed in an ambulance. And they were shooting stuff into me, and I was grateful, because I managed to break a leg, despite the air bag.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, reached for his free hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a tough time seeing how anyone could have planned to murder me on the highway like that. He couldn\u2019t have any idea who he might kill, and he obviously didn\u2019t succeed in killing me, if that was even his plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBut what if...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...what?\u201d Sam pursued.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t care if he killed a dozen other people at the same time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Lori Star. Candy Cane.</p><p>She lived in a rent-controlled building in Soho. When she opened the door to their knock, she kept the chain on as she looked out. Her eyes were wide, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cAre you with another news station?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Raif shook his head solemnly, showing his badge. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops,\u201d she said with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYeah, cops,\u201d Tom supplied.</p><p>She stared at Joe. \u201cBut you\u2019re not a cop,\u201d she said. Her voice had changed. It had turned low and sexy. Candy Cane, not Lori Star. How did she know? he wondered. Was she really psychic? Was it his manner? Or just a wild guess?</p><p>\u201cMr. Connolly is a private investigator, and he\u2019s with us,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>Joe blessed the fact that he\u2019d managed to keep a great relationship with the NYPD.</p><p>The woman still had the chain on the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t come to arrest you,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cThen you should go away,\u201d she suggested, and started to close the door.</p><p>Joe put out hand to stop it. \u201cMiss Star, we really need to talk to you. Just for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He was convinced that she didn\u2019t have any extraordinary talents\u2014not paranormal talents, anyway\u2014but he still very much wanted to talk to her.</p><p>She stared at him with wide, powder-blue eyes. Then she sighed, closed the door most of the way and undid the security chain.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she told them resignedly.</p><p>She was a small woman, thin, but cosmetically \u201cenhanced\u201d in the breast department, and pretty in a hard-edged way. She wasn\u2019t exactly a high-class hooker, but it didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d hit bottom yet, either. She had blond hair\u2014enhanced, too, but decently done\u2014and small, sharp features. As she let them in, he saw that she was wearing a silk kimono, but beneath it she had on sweatpants and a M\u00f6tley Crue T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cSit down, I guess,\u201d she said, indicating a sofa and two chairs in the living area, which was also the dining area and was connected straight to a typical studio kitchen.</p><p>He chose one of the chairs across from where she sat on the edge of the couch. Raif took the second chair, so Tom was left to sit next to her on the couch, perching uncomfortably a few feet away. She picked up a pack of cigarettes, shook one out and lit it.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked. \u201cSay no\u2014this is my apartment, and I can smoke here if I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your funeral,\u201d Raif said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI still like the smell of smoke,\u201d Joe told her, smiling.</p><p>She flashed him a smile in return.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a psychic, Miss Star?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>She hesitated, a strange look on her face. \u201cI\u2019m really an actress,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tom made a choking sound. She flashed him a cold glare. \u201cI\u2019ve been an extra in three movies now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cDid you play a hooker?\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head, tempted to put a bag over the man\u2019s head. Tom was too used to interrogating suspects with whom it was necessary to take a hard line.</p><p>In this case, though, a hard line wasn\u2019t what was called for.</p><p>\u201cMiss Star, please, we need your help,\u201d he said. He had been ready to dismiss the woman\u2019s claims himself, but something about the way she had looked when he\u2019d asked her how long she had been a psychic had given him pause.</p><p>After all, who the hell was he to doubt anyone? He\u2019d thought a corpse had spoken to him from a Gurney at the morgue.</p><p>She hesitated, looking at him. \u201cHonestly?\u201d she asked. And at that moment, there was something raw and young and vulnerable about her features that got to him.</p><p>She was scared.</p><p>\u201cYes, honestly.\u201d</p><p>She looked around at the three of them. \u201cThis is off the record, right? You guys have to keep what I say between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know anything about an attempted murder...\u201d Raif began.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about an attempted murder. Except for what I saw. In my mind.\u201d</p><p>A shadow seemed to pass over Raif\u2019s eyes. From now on, he wasn\u2019t going to believe her. Tom seemed to have withdrawn, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see, in your mind\u2019s eye, and how did it all happen?\u201d Joe said quickly, before either of the other men could say anything to shut her down.</p><p>\u201cI was here. At home. Getting ready for the night.\u201d</p><p>Tom made a choking sound again.</p><p>Joe flashed him a frown. \u201cWere you here alone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. Then the words suddenly started spilling out. \u201cI sat down here. Right here. On the sofa, like I am now. I lit a cigarette, and I was going to watch some TV before I went to change clothes. But then...it was so weird. All of a sudden it was as if I was in a car. As if I were really there. I could see the traffic in front of me. I was someone else. And I was gunning for a car. A green Cadillac. I knew the car. I knew where it was, because I\u2019d been following it. It was as if I was me, but at the same time I wasn\u2019t me. It was as if I was a passenger in someone else\u2019s body. Oh, God, it was awful. As if I could feel all this hatred...I\u2014the me that wasn\u2019t me\u2014knew not to hit the car myself, but I\u2019m\u2014he\u2019s\u2014a good driver and could make people swerve and stuff. So I...he...she...I don\u2019t know which...did, and then...wham. Crash. There was metal and glass, and a word in my head....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stopped speaking.

What was the word?\u201d Joe persisted gently.</p><p>\u201cNevermore,\u201d she said.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the meeting tonight,\u201d Genevieve told Sam. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t help it\u2014I\u2019m worried about my mother. About all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Thorne\u2019s murder,\u201d Sam agreed.</p> <p>\u201cI know he made plenty of enemies, and the Poe angle could just be the killer\u2019s way to throw people off track, but...well, what did you think of his book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was a good book,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThe man could write.\u201d He looked past her for a moment, then turned back to her and asked, \u201cI take it you saw that \u2018psychic\u2019 on TV?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou believe in psychics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I believe.\u201d</p><p>She heard a sound then and turned around.</p> <p>Joe was there, leaning against the wall, arms crossed over his chest as he watched her. She swore silently.</p><p>\u201cJoe, hi. Come on in,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>She rose uneasily. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe met years ago,\u201d Sam said. \u201cJoe and Matt Connolly were cousins.\u201d He stared at her. \u201cBut I guess you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew Matt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Sam said uncomfortably. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, \u201cJoe and I actually go way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long way,\u201d Joe agreed pleasantly. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging in,\u201d Sam said. He must have noticed the way Joe looked at Genevieve\u2014as if she had committed a sin\u2014because he looked curiously from one to the other.</p> <p>She hoped she wasn\u2019t looking guilty. She shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. She hadn\u2019t actually lied to Joe.</p><p>As if trying to diffuse the tension, Sam asked her, \u201cSo Joe is working for you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, meeting Joe\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an amazing woman. She hires me, but she still likes to do all the work herself,\u201d Joe said dryly.</p><p>She forced a tight smile. \u201cI thought I\u2019d drop by to see a friend,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou did say you\u2019d been held up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe, do you know if they\u2019ve questioned all the drivers, trying to figure out who hit me?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cNot that it did much good. Apparently, if you\u2019re a crook in this city, you find a dark sedan with mud on the license plate so no one can read the number. A lot of people noticed a dark sedan driving dangerously. Some say it was blue, others say it was forest-green, and one man is positive it was black. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful,\u201d Sam said. \u201cReally sorry.\u201d</p><p>Joe moved farther into the room to stand by the bed. \u201cSam, do you think the driver might have been gunning for you?\u201d</p><p>Sam had nice brown eyes. They were intense as he stared at Joe, then Gen. \u201cI\u2019m praying not. I\u2019m praying that someone else didn\u2019t die because of me, and that a dozen people aren\u2019t laid up in a hospital like I am\u2014because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Poe Killer is after more members of the society?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Sam said bitterly, shaking his head. \u201cThat psychic says so, huh?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve expected Joe to say something derisive, but he didn\u2019t. He just waited for Sam to go on.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is afraid it\u2019s true, though,\u201d Sam said. \u201cReally. Afraid...Oh, God. I\u2019m sorry, Genevieve, I shouldn\u2019t be talking to you about fear.\u201d</p><p>There they were. Back to her ordeal once again, she thought. Why wouldn\u2019t people let it rest?</p><p>\u201cSam, please,\u201d she said awkwardly, avoiding Joe\u2019s eyes. She knew he was angry with her for leaving the apartment.</p><p>Too bad. He would just have to get over it.</p><p>\u201cThere are many kinds of fear,\u201d she said to Sam. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, too. Afraid for my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police haven\u2019t said anything about needing to protect you, right?\u201d Joe said to Sam.</p><p>\u201cNo. But Dorothy has decided that she wants to hire off-duty officers to guard my room,\u201d Sam said, shrugging. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what I think, but God knows, I have time here to try to figure it all out. But if it\u2019s going to make Dorothy happy, I guess it\u2019s fine to bring in some security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never a bad idea,\u201d Joe said, to Genevieve\u2019s surprise. Had he changed his mind on his conviction that Bigelow\u2019s murder had nothing to do with Edgar Allan Poe and the Ravens?</p><p>Dorothy and Sam\u2019s mother returned just then. They both greeted Joe and spoke with him about hiring private security. He put through a call to a friend, and before he and Gen left the hospital, an off-duty officer was sitting in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to wait at your apartment for me,\u201d Joe said a few minutes later, as they got into his car after dismissing Gen\u2019s driver. He looked at Genevieve and saw that she was blushing slightly. Whatever she said, it would be an excuse, he knew. She obviously felt guilty. But then her chin lifted.</p><p>Guilty and defiant, he amended. Ah, yes, that was Genevieve. Then again, that defiance was part of what had saved her life.</p><p>\u201cI was staying in and waiting, but then you called and said you\u2019d be late. And I told you I\u2019d find something to do to fill the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood one,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe, you\u2019re the one who said the whole Poe thing was a smoke screen.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWhether it is or isn\u2019t, don\u2019t you think you should be a little bit careful for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mother I\u2019m worried about,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s the Raven, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him sharply. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was driving, but the traffic was light enough that he was able to look over at her before turning his attention to avoiding a kid on a skateboard who had just swerved into the street.</p><p>\u201cNothing has changed my mind,\u201d he said, knowing it was what he wanted to believe, rather than the truth. To accept the fact that he believed a two-bit hooker\u2014actress\u2014had experienced a genuine psychic vision was more than he was ready to admit.</p><p>And yet it appeared, even to him, that it might be true.</p><p>After so many years prying into the lives of others, he had a good sense for whether people were lying or not. And Candy Cane, or Lori Star or whatever her real name was, hadn\u2019t been lying.</p><p>Not only that, she was scared.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Genevieve asked, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He cast a quick glance her way, a slight smile curving his lips. \u201cI thought we should take a self-guided Poe tour. Just a pleasant walk around a few places our long-gone poet might have haunted. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him, smiling quizzically herself. \u201cYou\u2019ve acquired a new appreciation for the literary life and times of Edgar Allan Poe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ve always been an aficionado,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he found a garage where he could park for a few hours without spending half a month\u2019s rent, and they started walking.</p><p>There was something special, almost magical, about Lower Manhattan, he thought. It had nothing to do with Wall Street and all the money that changed hands there, or even the vibrancy of the people who were always rushing around following their own agendas.</p><p>Maybe it was magical, he thought, because he had learned to see it through Leslie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>New York wasn\u2019t just Wall Street and big bucks, or the egos of celebrities and business moguls. Nor was it any longer the huddled poverty of the thousands of immigrants who had made their way here, first via Ellis Island and now via Kennedy Airport.</p><p>It was both, and it was more.</p><p>He and Genevieve walked. They toured the area around Lower Broadway, pausing at Trinity Church, looking toward the empty place where the World Trade Towers had once stood, which gave them both pause.</p><p>Finally they moved on.</p><p>\u201cAre we actually on a thinking tour?\u201d she asked him, curious and amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Does it feel like I\u2019m just dragging you around aimlessly?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cHey, I like to walk. Just so long as we\u2019re not walking because you don\u2019t want me going home by myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIs it so bad for someone to be worried about you?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend my life being a burden, being someone others have to worry about all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a burden,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>And so they kept going.</p><p>\u201cThis has been my home my whole life,\u201d she said, \u201cand I still love being here. I love to go into Trinity and St. Paul\u2019s. I love to go in and look at George Washington\u2019s pew, and wonder what it might have been like when we were a country fighting for its independence.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a smile. \u201cYeah, cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>And amazing.</p><p>They were near Hastings House, in fact, near the area where she had been held prisoner underground. He saw no deep-seated bitterness or fear in her eyes, and she had just told him that she had moved on, that she loved this part of town.</p><p>Was it true?</p><p>Whether it was or not, Lower Manhattan, the area around St. Mark\u2019s, and his small cottage up in the Bronx, were places where Poe had spent time when he was in New York.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne the best I could,\u2019\u201d he quoted aloud.</p><p>Genevieve arched a brow at him. \u201cIs that word-for-word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said with a shrug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you know more about Poe than you\u2019ve admitted?\u201d</p><p>He offered her a sheepish grin. \u201cWhen I was a kid, my folks bought a video of The Raven. The movie had little to do with the poem, but Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre were magnificent. It was pretty silly, really. They turned the poem into a battle between magicians. But I watched it over and over, and then went on a Poe binge.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMaybe you should be a Raven.\u201d</p> <p>They were on Nassau Street now. \u201cI think it would have been right about here,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Genevieve frowned. \u201cWhat would have? I don\u2019t think Poe lived here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but not far away,\u201d he said, flashing Genevieve a smile. \u201cNo. I\u2019m thinking about \u2018The Mystery of Marie Roget.\u2019 It was based on a real murder case that put New York City into a state of upheaval. Journalists had a field day. Politicians were shaken to the core...and Poe wrote his story. The girl who was killed lived on Nassau Street. Her name was Mary Rogers, and she\u2019d worked at a cigar shop where Poe had almost certainly been. She was considered to be beautiful, and she was from a good family whose fortunes were in bad shape. Her mother opened a boarding house on Nassau Street. And it was from Nassau Street that she left...and never returned. The summer of 1841 was stifling. A steamboat ran across the river to New Jersey, and people went to escape the heat and the crowds. It was like going to a park to play. P. T. Barnum staged wild west shows over there, and people flocked to someplace called Sybil\u2019s Cave to drink the waters, which were considered to be restorative. Anyway, three men took the ferry over one day, several days after she disappeared, and as they were walking north along the river, heading for the pavilion at Sybil\u2019s Cave, they spotted something in the water. It was Mary Rogers. Poe turned Mary into Marie and he moved the whole thing to Paris. He had already written \u2018The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u2019 and he wanted to use his Parisian detective, C. Auguste Dupin, to solve another mystery.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was staring at him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHey, it\u2019s common knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cSo common I didn\u2019t know it. I did see The Raven, though, and I loved it. And of course, I\u2019ve read the poem. I\u2019ve even been to his grave site in Baltimore,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He turned and walked toward Broadway again. \u201cPoe didn\u2019t live here when Mary Rogers was killed\u2014he had left the city for a job in Philadelphia. But he lived here from eighteen-thirty-seven to thirty-eight, and there was a bookstore near here, owned by a Scot named William Gowans, where Poe spent a lot of time. Gowans was totally eccentric and only catered to those he considered serious readers. The shop where Mary Rogers worked was only a few blocks north, and Gowans roomed at the boarding house Mrs. Rogers kept. So they were all acquaintances, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve cocked her head, looked at him with a slight grin tugging at her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re very serious about your Poe facts\u2014for a man who said that that note was just a smoke screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well get the feel for what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He started walking faster, though he didn\u2019t realize how fast until he heard the sound of her footsteps as she tried to catch up.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was poison in Thorne\u2019s wine. That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with \u2018The Mystery of Marie Roget.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for Poe himself, and his life and times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew York back then...the Five Points area was like a haven for thugs, drug dealers, murderers and thieves. I think the population of the city back then was about three-hundred thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Genevieve said dryly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, nothing by today\u2019s standards, but back then, it was huge. Just like now, people came here from all over to make a living. You know, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere? Well, that\u2019s always been true before. So Poe came to New York with his sights on becoming financially secure and finding real respect for his talents. According to those who knew him, he was a fine literary critic\u2014but a vicious one at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best critics are vicious at times, so they say.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. He indicated the doorway to an old bar. The Dingle Room. A sign boasted that it had stood on the same street for over two hundred years, acting as a tavern for over one hundred of them.</p><p>\u201cThink he might have lifted a beer or two here?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Meanwhile, I\u2019m thirsty. And hungry.\u201d</p><p>They went inside, and not only did the place appear to have been in business as a tavern for more than a hundred years, Joe wasn\u2019t sure it had been cleaned in all that time, either. But answering the question Gen had asked, there was a sign above the bar that read: Edgar Allan Poe drank here. Imbibe and find your inner genius.</p><p>Those words were followed by a hand-painted addendum that said: At least, we think he drank here.</p><p>\u201cJust like Washington,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slept everywhere, and Poe drank everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Their waitress, a gum-cracking woman of about fifty, offered them a tired smile. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she told him honestly.</p><p>\u201cA Coke\u2014in a bottle\u2014then,\u201d Joe told her. \u201cGen?\u201d</p><p>She opted for the same, and then the woman smiled and told them that the home-style meatloaf and mashed potatoes were actually quite tasty, so they went ahead and ordered food.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Genevieve said, when the waitress had gone.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing all morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have any answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they think the Poe angle is a smoke screen?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head thoughtfully. \u201cIf they have any ideas right now, they\u2019re not sharing. And I think they would if they did. I know the two lead detectives on the case, and they\u2019re both solid guys, good at their jobs. The killer was careful and seemed to know how not to leave any clues he didn\u2019t want to. Maybe a professional, or maybe just someone who reads or watches television and has learned how not to leave trace evidence behind. There was no forced entry, and Bigelow apparently had a visitor earlier, so it\u2019s likely Thorne Bigelow knew his killer. But as far as the Poe connection goes, though he was killed via his beloved wine, he wasn\u2019t walled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sam Latham?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThey\u2019re looking into the accident, as well, trying to find out exactly what happened. Lots of people apparently saw the same car I did, but no one can agree on the details of what it looked like, and no one caught the license plate. Maybe a better witness will come forward in the future.\u201d</p><p>It was inevitable that she asked him, \u201cWhat about that psychic?\u201d</p><p>And dammit, she knew him well enough to catch something in his hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYou think she does know something!\u201d Genevieve exclaimed.</p><p>Luckily their meals arrived just then and saved him from having to answer.</p><p>But the minute their waitress moved on, Gen pounced on him again. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWho knows? I sure don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t know anything,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to meet her anyway.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. It was already nearly six.</p><p>\u201cToo late. We have to go pick up your mother and get to that New York Poe Society board meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, then,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe can stop by and talk to her, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, definitely. And you won\u2019t put me off. Promise me, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right, I promise. You can really be a pain in the...butt, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work hard at it,\u201d she assured him solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at all sure you need to make much of an effort,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shrugged, and silence fell between them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said softly a little while later, and smiled a little crookedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019d sounded gruff and impatient. He knew it.</p><p>\u201cThe meatloaf wasn\u2019t half bad.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a half smile in return. \u201cActually, I think it was more than half good.\u201d</p><p>When the check came, she reached for it, but he got there first.</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to take the case. We\u2019re talking about the case...working, so I should pick this up,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the check,\u201d he said in a tone that brooked no interference.</p><p>\u201cChauvinist,\u201d she accused, but her tone was light.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re on the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bill you, then. But I\u2019ll still take the check.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, as they waited by the register for his credit card to be returned, he noticed the large wooden plaque over the doorway. It had a giant etched raven on the right side, with just a few words of Poe\u2019s immortal poem on the left.</p><p>Quoth the raven...</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Not everyone on the board of the venerable society was in attendance.</p><p>Thorne, of course, was dead.</p><p>Jared Bigelow, Thorne\u2019s son, and Mary Vincenzo, his sister-in-law, were understandably absent. Because Thorne\u2019s body had been held at the morgue, the funeral was planned for Monday, so both Jared and Mary had sent their regrets to Brook Avery, who was chairman of the board.</p><p>Sam Latham wasn\u2019t there, either. He was still in the hospital, but even if he hadn\u2019t been, he might not have been in the mood to attend.</p><p>Four missing. Eight in attendance, including Eileen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brook Avery was a tall, imposing man who was the publisher of a literary magazine. He had a full head of snow-white hair, broad, substantial shoulders and a muscular build, especially for a man of sixty-odd years.</p><p>As they gathered in a private room at the Algonquin, Joe noticed that, despite what Gen had said about guests being welcome, Avery was looking at him as if he were an interloper. But since Eileen Brideswell had insisted that they be there, the man limited his response to disapproving, even suspicious, stares.</p><p>Joe was happy to return suspicion for suspicion. In his mind, if the murder was connected to Poe, then everyone there, other than Gen and her mother, was a potential suspect.</p> <p>Including Brook Avery.</p><p>Joe looked around the room and considered the attendees one by one, starting with Don Tracy. Because he had never done film or TV, his name wasn\u2019t well-known, but he was seldom out of work as an actor.</p><p>Nat Halloway was a banker. Fortysomething, thinning hair. An interesting prospect, he had managed Bigelow\u2019s investments.</p><p>Lila Hawkins was a perfect society matron, big-breasted, tall, with an imperious manner and voice. She was involved with charities all over the city. She didn\u2019t work; her family owned several large buildings on Park Avenue. Barbara Hirshorn was her complete opposite: thin, shy, nervous and a working woman, a librarian.</p><p>Lou Sayles was actually Louisa Sayles. She was retired from the school board, an attractive woman with silver hair and bright blue eyes. Rounding out the list was Larry Levine, a newspaper reporter. The best word to describe him was medium. Medium height, with medium-colored brown hair and light brown eyes and a medium build.</p> <p>His work was much the same. He reported on events in New York. He wasn\u2019t bad, he wasn\u2019t great. He specialized in facts, ma\u2019am, just the facts, nothing more. He was a solid reporter. He was not imaginative.</p><p>Joe knew about Larry Levine because he read the paper and because he had met him a few times through the years at social events with his cousin Matt.</p><p>He knew about the rest of the group, because Raif had kept his word and had faxed over his files on the rest of the board members. Meeting them face-to-face, however, was interesting.</p><p>Like Brook Avery, they were all happy to greet Genevieve, but they looked at him as if he were some kind of alien. Eileen had introduced him as Genevieve\u2019s friend; she didn\u2019t mention that he was a private investigator working the case. His line of work was hardly a secret, though; his name had been all over the media when Gen\u2019s rescue and the truth behind the killings had come out.</p><p>Larry Levine definitely knew his line of work. He greeted Joe curiously as the group mingled over drinks. \u201cSo, Connolly. You working this?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just keeping an eye on Genevieve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood gig, eh?\u201d Larry asked, looking appreciatively in her direction.</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t help the tension and anger that rose in response to the other man\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cShe and her mother are fine people,\u201d he said, and changed the subject. \u201cVery sad about Thorne Bigelow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Larry lifted his glass. \u201cCan\u2019t say this too loud here, but Thorne was a pompous ass. Should anyone be murdered? Hell, no. But I doubt most people here are going to miss him much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople! Shall we get down to discussion?\u201d Brook Avery called.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s confusion as they all took seats around the large oblong table.</p><p>Joe was between Genevieve and Eileen. Brook Avery remained standing at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s discussion is slated to focus on the financial feasibility of planning a tour to follow the route Poe took in the days before his death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrook!\u201d Lila Hawkins interrupted sharply.</p><p>He was clearly displeased, but he paused and said patiently, \u201cLila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking!\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, my dear Lila, I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be,\u201d she informed him. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. We shouldn\u2019t be discussing business tonight. We should be discussing Thorne\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, what is there to discuss?\u201d Brook Avery asked, then cocked his head meaningfully, indicating that they had guests in the room.</p><p>Lila Hawkins rose. She was clearly a woman who could stand her ground. \u201cOh, let\u2019s all stop pussyfooting around. Genevieve is Eileen\u2019s daughter. And Mr. Connolly\u2014\u201d She looked at him, and she had made it sound as if his name were a curse word. \u201c\u2014Mr. Connolly is here as a private investigator.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him. It was obvious he was being given the floor to speak.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI should think you\u2019d all want to know exactly what happened to Thorne,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Lila spoke up again. \u201cOf course we want to know. The question is, just how honest are any of us going to be? Tonight. Here and now. Amongst one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t know what you could possibly mean, Lila,\u201d Barbara Hirshorn said. Her eyes darted around the room. \u201cIt was terrible, just terrible. The poor man was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe means that one of us might have done it, my dear,\u201d Don Tracy said. Joe wondered if the man was capable of speaking without sounding as if he were delivering a speech on stage.</p><p>Barbara gasped, clapping both hands over her mouth.</p><p>The rest of them stared at each other, suddenly suspicious of people they\u2019d known for years.</p><p>Then they stared as one at Gen\u2014as if she had brought the real monster, because the real monster might be the truth\u2014before turning to Joe again.</p><p>As they did so, he suddenly felt spotlighted, one degree removed from the people around him. It was almost like an out-of-body experience, as if this were just a scene in a film and he was watching it. A dead man had spoken to him, and then he himself had spoken to a girl claiming to be a psychic, and he had actually believed her. Which made all this totally unlike anything he had ever dealt with before.</p><p>Murder suddenly seemed so simple.</p><p>While death itself was not.</p><p>At last he stood. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at each other as if you\u2019ve all suddenly turned into the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are any number of other possibilities, and the police will be investigating all of them. Perhaps the murderer is counting on you all turning on each other. Perhaps he\u2014or she\u2014is hoping that the police will believe it\u2019s a member of the society. Nothing has been ruled out as yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t we try to rule out a few things?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, who here would have anything to gain by Thorne\u2019s death?\u201d Larry demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Eileen said evenly, glancing at her daughter. \u201cNo one,\u201d she repeated firmly. \u201cI very much doubt any of us are in Thorne\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is murder always for personal gain?\u201d Don Tracy demanded dramatically.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Think about Poe\u2019s stories. Characters were killed simply because they made the narrator crazy,\u201d Barbara Hirshorn said. \u201cSo...did Thorne drive any of us completely crazy?\u201d</p><p>Lila let out a laugh that sounded like a bark. \u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Barbara looked as if her feelings had been hurt, as if she thought that Lila was laughing at her.</p><p>But Lou Sayles set a hand on her arm. \u201cBarbara, dear, I don\u2019t believe Lila was laughing at you but simply because, well, which one of us didn\u2019t he drive crazy?\u201d</p><p>Nat Halloway cleared his throat. \u201cHe was a bit of a braggart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Jared isn\u2019t here to listen to what we\u2019re saying, so we might as well be honest. Braggart? He was obnoxious,\u201d Lila said.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead,\u201d Barbara said.</p><p>\u201cDeath doesn\u2019t change the truth,\u201d Larry said.</p><p>Don pointed at Larry and said, \u201cFace it, Larry. You\u2019ve always talked about writing a book on Poe, but Thorne went ahead and did it. You can\u2019t tell me you weren\u2019t at least a little bit jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have killed him for that,\u201d Larry protested indignantly.</p><p>\u201cReally? So what would you have killed him for?\u201d Lila demanded.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d Larry said, his face suffusing with color.</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cPeople, really, there\u2019s no need to start accusing each other,\u201d Joe told them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to talk about it,\u201d Lila said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that you stop talking about it,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI just think there are more constructive conversations to have. So...Thorne Bigelow was a man who aggravated his friends. And when was the last time you each saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him since our last meeting, a month ago,\u201d Barbara said, relief in her voice, as if she now considered herself free from suspicion. \u201cBut, we would all have seen him the night he died. We were slated to attend a dinner to benefit a literacy foundation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone would have been at that dinner?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cEven Gen was going to go. With me.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cOkay, he died a week ago. Barbara says she hadn\u2019t seen him in ages. What about the rest of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a meeting with him on Friday to discuss his finances,\u201d Nat Halloway admitted. \u201cI left him alive and well.\u201d</p><p>Larry waved a hand in the air. \u201cHe was at the Whiskey Bar on Thursday night. I saw him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him at the Whiskey Bar, too,\u201d Brook admitted.</p><p>\u201cLast month,\u201d Lila said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him since the last meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Brook said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lila demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou were at Dooley\u2019s Pub the Tuesday night before he was killed. I saw you there, and I saw Thorne there, too,\u201d Brook announced.</p><p>So much for this being a friendly group, Joe decided. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid anyone see him Saturday morning?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do any of you know if he had any plans for Saturday morning or afternoon?\u201d He wasn\u2019t expecting any of them to admit they had seen the man; what he was interested in was watching the interaction between them. There didn\u2019t seem to be any tight bonds here; it had already turned into every man for himself.</p><p>\u201cI talked to him Saturday morning,\u201d Nat said. \u201cI called him with the answer to a tax question he\u2019d asked me. He was excited about the evening, because the society was going to give him an award. He was in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything about seeing anyone before the dinner?\u201d Joe asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nat said. \u201cJust that Mary and Jared were both coming to his place, and that they\u2019d all be going over together,\u201d Nat said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the butler? He was there, too,\u201d Larry said irritably.</p><p>\u201cThe butler?\u201d Lila scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would his butler want to kill him?\u201d Eileen asked. \u201cThey got along quite well. Thorne paid him a very nice salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he must have been wretched as a boss,\u201d Larry said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, darling,\u201d Lila protested. \u201cIt\u2019s not the butler. That would be far too boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, a man is dead,\u201d Barbara reminded her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the plot for a novel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I still say it wasn\u2019t the butler,\u201d Lila insisted.</p><p>\u201cHaving a meeting tonight is pointless,\u201d Brook said with a sigh. \u201cWe should have cancelled. We\u2019re all too emotional.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve spoke up then. \u201cMaybe being emotional isn\u2019t so bad. What if whoever killed Thorne really does have something against the Ravens? Aren\u2019t you all frightened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019re frightened, darling!\u201d Lila exclaimed. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let ourselves get carried away. I know Sam was hurt, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think someone was able to cause that accident just to harm him, then get away unscathed himself. Good God, simply getting on that wretched highway is dangerous. So, Mr. Connolly, what do you suggest we do next?\u201d She stared at him pointedly.</p> <p>\u201cMy suggestion is to do what everyone should always do\u2014be careful. Don\u2019t park in dark garages, don\u2019t walk in dark alleys. Keep your doors locked,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cGood advice,\u201d Lou Sayles said, and offered him an awkward smile. \u201cBut what happens when the danger comes from someone you trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere we go again!\u201d Brook exploded. \u201cAccusing one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe helpful to the police in any way that you can. The sooner Thorne Bigelow\u2019s murder is solved, the sooner you\u2019ll feel safe. And enjoy one another\u2019s...society again,\u201d Joe said. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d</p><p>And yet, it was hard not to feel as if this entire thing weren\u2019t some kind of terrible joke.</p><p>The people here were...</p><p>Well, caricatures in a way, he thought. He had lived in New York City most of his life, and he loved New Yorkers. But tonight he felt as if he had walked in on a play satirizing the rich and the poor and everyone in between. They had the poor librarian, the angry columnist and several society matrons. Men who lived hard, men who thrived and men who were always thirsty.</p><p>A ripple of uneasy laughter reminded him of his last words.</p> <p>No pun intended.</p><p>Too bad Thorne Bigelow\u2019s murder was anything but a joke.</p><p>\u201cI feel better just for speaking honestly,\u201d Barbara said with a soft sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you feel better?\u201d Lila asked. \u201cAll we\u2019ve proven tonight is that we don\u2019t trust one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come, Lila,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI refuse to believe that any of us is capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Joe said, and all turned to stare at him. \u201cBut someone out there is. So, all of you, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we all need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>The statement came from the doorway. Joe turned around to see that a newcomer had joined them.</p><p>Jared Bigelow.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the man\u2019s picture in the papers and in the file Raif had faxed over. He was perhaps six feet in height, lean and wiry. He had dark, curling hair and a face with features so fine they were almost sharp. His eyes were deep set and dark. He was in his early thirties, casually dressed in chinos and a tweed jacket.</p><p>And he was not alone.</p><p>The woman standing behind him was in her late thirties or early forties. She was small and model thin. Her hair was blond and highlighted with an even lighter shade, and her eyes were enormous and a marbled blue-gray. She appeared both extremely artificial and extremely attractive at the same time, as if many things about her had been enhanced, but enhanced very well.</p><p>Mary Vincenzo, Thorne Bigelow\u2019s late brother\u2019s much younger wife. She had been in public relations before her marriage, according to the file Raif Green had sent. She had never changed her name.</p><p>The two newcomers walked into the room, and the others jumped to their feet and crowded around Jared, voicing the usual awkward and sympathetic words everyone came up with when someone died.</p><p>Genevieve, however, hung back, Joe noticed. As did Eileen. Interesting.</p><p>Only when the crowd around Jared had dispersed did they take the opportunity to murmur quiet sympathy. Joe found himself realizing that, despite all the jewels and silk, cosmetics, surgeries and expensive coiffures in evidence, there was no one in the room like Genevieve. Tall, slim, sleek and natural, everything about her whispered of innate perfection. He found himself glad for personal, as well as professional reasons that he had attended this very strange affair.</p><p>She had endured so much and was herself so strong. But no one should have to be alone after what she\u2019d been through, and he would protect her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jared said, lifting a hand and stepping back to address the group. He smiled awkwardly. \u201cI actually came here tonight to say the same thing to all of you that he...\u201d he indicated Joe with a nod of his head \u201c...that he told you. Please be careful.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIf one of you bastards didn\u2019t kill my father, or even if you did, we have to live with the fact that any one of us may be a target.\u201d</p><p>If one of you bastards didn\u2019t kill my father...</p><p>He had spoken the words lightly, Joe thought. Like a joke. But had he really meant them humorously?</p><p>Joe walked over and offered his hand to Jared. \u201cJoe Connolly,\u201d he said. \u201cI add my condolences on your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe private detective?\u201d Jared asked him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve engaged Mr. Connolly,\u201d Gen said, stepping up. \u201cTo look into your father\u2019s murder\u2014and to make sure that my mother and the rest of you aren\u2019t in any danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...this is a board meeting,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is actually an accusation fest,\u201d Larry said huffily.</p><p>\u201cLarry...\u201d Barbara chastised.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, right now it would be prudent for all of you to be careful. The police are investigating a number of possibilities, but until they have a suspect in custody, you all need to behave as if you could be next,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cBut this is a board meeting,\u201d Jared repeated, staring at Eileen Brideswell.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Jared. Anything that helps, right?\u201d Mary Vincenzo said, speaking up at last.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. All right. Well, get to it then, Mr. Connolly. Actually, I just stopped in to make sure everyone on the board was aware that we\u2019re having a special viewing of my father before the services Monday. Five o\u2019clock, at Philips Mortuary. I hope to see you all there.\u201d Jared looked from one to another. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll understand if I don\u2019t stay. Aunt Mary...?\u201d</p><p>They started to walk away, and then Jared, with Mary on his arm, paused at the door and turned back. \u201cMr. Connolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be there, I assume? In your...professional capacity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>He felt Genevieve lay her hand on his arm, and he watched as Jared Bigelow noted her movement, a curious glint entering his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUntil then,\u201d Jared said, and left.</p><p>Joe was acting strange lately, Genevieve thought.</p><p>The distance between them suddenly seemed far too great, far greater than it ever had before.</p><p>They had dropped Eileen at home, and then he\u2019d brought her to her place. Being Joe and ever the gentleman, he had seen her up to her apartment, his every move the epitome of courtesy.</p><p>But, to be quite honest, she didn\u2019t want courtesy any more than she wanted pity or to be treated like a fragile rose.</p><p>All of a sudden she realized the complete truth that had inexplicably eluded her until now.</p><p>In the days following her rescue and Leslie\u2019s death, she had been forced to find her own footing, to learn simply to go on again.</p><p>But since then, during the time they had spent together, she had begun to realize just how much she liked Joe. More than liked him.</p><p>He, of course, had been in love with Leslie, who in turn, had been in love with the fianc\u00e9, Joe\u2019s cousin, who had died before her. But if she had lived, would she have fallen for Joe in time? Or would she have fallen only for a shadow of her first love? Matt, like Joe, had been tall, with light hair, though Joe\u2019s was slightly darker, just as his eyes were greener. But Matt had been built with the same broad-shouldered strength. Maybe Joe would have wondered all his life if she had been truly in love with him, or only dreaming that he was someone else every time they made love.</p><p>Some questions could never be answered. Leslie and Matt were both dead now.</p><p>She found herself thinking of Shakespeare then, rather than Poe. Of Hamlet.</p><p>He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone. At his heels a grass green turf and at his head a stone...</p><p>Yes, Leslie MacIntyre was dead, but did Joe still dream about her?</p><p>Perhaps Joe could never be serious about anyone\u2014especially Gen herself, because she had been the cause of Leslie\u2019s death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But not intentionally. Never intentionally. She would never have allowed someone else to die in her place.</p><p>Joe knew that. She knew he did. And dwelling on the events of that fatal night would only serve to drive her insane. What had happened, had happened. And no one but the murderer himself had been at fault. She hadn\u2019t needed therapy to recognize the truth of that. And she knew that Joe knew it, too.</p><p>So why was he so strange and distant these days?</p> <p>And why did she insist on caring? Was she only hung up on him because he had been there in her darkest hour? According to Dr. Mowbry, women often fell in love with men they considered to be their saviors.</p><p>And he had saved her life. No doubt about it. But that wasn\u2019t why she had fallen for him. She was sure of that.</p><p>And now, here he was, and she didn\u2019t want him to be so gentle. She wanted him to crush her in his arms. She wanted to make wild, hot love with him. She didn\u2019t want him to see her as delicate or in need of protection. She was tempted to simply slip off her dress, fling her arms around him and do something so sensual and sexy that he couldn\u2019t resist her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, with just the right amount of curiosity and professional courtesy, \u201cwhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>She loved his rueful smile, she thought. Loved it when she had his full attention and could see on his face that certain dry amusement he felt for life, himself and everything around him.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I walked into a play filled with outsize characters who had to prove themselves and their innocence within the confines of two hours and one intermission,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, we\u2019re not that bad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anyone was bad.\u201d</p><p>He was hovering in the doorway. They\u2019d already argued about the fact she had refused to stay with Eileen at the mansion, even though she was worried about her mother, and even though everyone was worried about her, despite the fact that, as she kept pointing out, she wasn\u2019t a Raven. This time around, she wasn\u2019t the one who had something to worry about.</p><p>But her mother had live-in help and an excellent security system, and she still needed her own place, her own independence.</p><p>So that, if she ever got up the nerve, she could just strip off her little black dress, and do something so exotic and sensual and sexual that he couldn\u2019t stand it and...</p> <p>\u201cI know Larry,\u201d Joe said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a bad guy. And your mother is a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Rich people aren\u2019t all bad,\u201d she heard herself say defensively.</p><p>He laughed easily and shook his head. \u201cGen, I never said they were. It was just tonight...that group. Let\u2019s face it, I think everyone there was afraid someone else in that room did it. Lila was all bravado. Barbara was all denial. Brook Avery was pure pretense. And then...Jared showing up so dramatically...It was...interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI learned that no one there likes anyone else all that much, that no one liked Thorne, in particular, and that Jared Bigelow is sleeping with his aunt.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they aren\u2019t related by blood, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mary was married to Thorne\u2019s older brother, Steven. He was thirty-some years older than she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA real love match, huh?\u201d he said cynically.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly it was a good marriage,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d probably be good for that kind of money, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a skeptic, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Gen! You weren\u2019t just a little bit skeptical about that one yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He was laughing, and suddenly he seemed to be so easy with her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so she probably married Steven Bigelow for his money,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that people always marry rich people for their money.\u201d Why on earth had she said that? Could she be any more obvious about what was on her mind?</p><p>But he didn\u2019t even seem to notice. \u201cI\u2019m sure some women do fall in love with men who are older and richer,\u201d he said. \u201cJust not in that particular case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what made you so certain that they\u2019re sleeping together? Jared and Mary, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe possessive way she hung on his arm. The way he looked at you, and the way she looked at him for the way he looked at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading a lot into the way people look at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot to be read into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you think Jared killed his father, or his aunt killed his father or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there are a lot of suspects,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAnd a lot of motives. Greed and jealousy have both been strong inducements for murder over the centuries. Of course, tonight we were missing one of the traditional suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe butler, of course,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>She had to laugh. But then she assured him, \u201cBennet didn\u2019t murder Thorne, I can assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennet? You know him?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. My family and the Bigelows kind of run in the same circles, though I can\u2019t exactly say we were friends.\u201d She pointed a stern finger at him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare start in on rich people again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a doubting sniff.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about Bennet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, sixty-five, maybe. He\u2019s been with the family for as long as I can remember. You could talk to my mom. She would know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d like to talk to Bennet himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I hired you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you wanted to do everything yourself,\u201d he said irritably, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my help on this,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennet likes me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to talk to you if you\u2019re with me. He won\u2019t be so thrilled if you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, seriously\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t let me help, I will start doing things on my own,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He stared at her, frustrated.</p><p>She had him, and she knew it. He still had that protective thing going on, which wasn\u2019t what she wanted, but it would have to do for now.</p><p>\u201cSo what time are we going to see Bennet tomorrow?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him in the morning. He goes to church, and I\u2019m taking Mom to church, so I\u2019ll see him there. So let\u2019s say about...one?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyeing her cautiously, as if he had just realized she might be a species of dangerous animal he had misjudged.</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>Joe stood there in the doorway for a moment, and she couldn\u2019t help staring at him. Joe, whose sandy brown hair fell over his forehead in such a casual and sexy manner, whose eyes seemed to reflect the world and his knowledge of it. Whose shoulders filled the doorway, whose jaw could be so hard and stubborn. Joe...</p><p>For a split second she thought that he was going to move forward. Come closer. Even touch her.</p><p>And finally he did.</p><p>He reached out\u2014and tousled her hair.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, then, kid. See you. And until then....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone. And she locked the door\u2014as he told her to do from the other side.</p><p>When she went to bed, she found herself staring at the ceiling and thinking about loss, about death.</p><p>Leslie\u2019s death. And the deaths of the prostitutes she herself had tried so hard to help. They had been nothing but disposable members of society to so many people, but she had known them as women with hopes and dreams. So much loss.</p><p>Then there was the loss she faced herself...</p><p>The loss of a life once filled with promise but now controlled by fear. Not hers, but everyone else\u2019s for her.</p><p>The loss of a life never really lived...</p><p>By the time her phone rang Sunday morning, Lori Star had given up expecting anything good.</p><p>At first the news media had embraced her, but then they had dropped her like a hot potato. Perhaps they had found out about her arrests; she didn\u2019t know. Apparently they now believed she was some kind of a fake. Which she usually was...</p><p>But not this time.</p><p>It had been terrifying when she had first felt the sensation of being somewhere else, being someone else.</p><p>Not just because it was like some sort of out-of-body experience, but because there was more to it. That sense of pure malice and...evil had been terrifying.</p><p>She was shivering just from that thought, that memory, when the call came through.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Star? Miss Lori Star?\u201d The voice on the other end was cultured, courteous.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Her response was wary, despite the caller\u2019s tone.</p><p>But on a different level, she already felt excitement. She just knew that this was someone who believed in her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for disturbing you on a Sunday morning, but I\u2019m anxious to get out there with my story before anyone else beats me to it. I\u2019m from the New York Informant. You\u2019ve heard of it, I hope? We follow up on the stories other papers leave behind when they rush off to cover the latest celebrity scandal. We like to stick with things and cover them in depth.\u201d</p><p>She sank down on her sofa, very glad that she\u2019d been home to answer the phone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said, trying not to sound too eager. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019m familiar with the paper,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also willing to pay, and pay well, when someone helps us with a story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to be careful with her reply and not let on how curious she was as to just what he meant by paying well. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said simply, having decided not to ask how much. The amount he volunteered almost staggered her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet, then,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t mention that you\u2019re meeting me. I don\u2019t want any of my competitors to get wind that I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone asks me,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019ll just tell them I\u2019m off visiting an aunt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d her caller purred.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we meet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to jot down the address he gave her. She knew exactly where it was.</p><p>\u201cHow will I recognize you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll recognize you.\u201d</p> <p>New York City.</p><p>Talk about a mass of humanity.</p><p>People moved like ants. So many of them. So busy. All in such a hurry.</p><p>The mass of people crept and crawled, stopped and flowed. They congregated at street corners. They slid past one another. A light changed; a crossing sign flickered. And they moved in a giant mass, surging forward all at once, each individual following a personal agenda that led them to become a part of the massive back and forth.</p><p>Ants.</p><p>How many times had he walked in the city, in the country, on a sidewalk, through a house, across a yard, and seen ants? How easy it was\u2014amusing, even\u2014to step on a few and watch the confusion, the panic, of the others, as the instinct for survival took over and became the single thing that made them rush away.</p> <p>Did one ant really even care when another one was stepped on by the harsh supreme being that walked above? Or did it only care about its own survival?</p><p>They were just ants. All of them, just ants.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>One of the ants. Walking, stopping, moving again.</p><p>Would anyone really notice when she was stepped on by the supreme being above? Would they care?</p><p>Or would they just be afraid? Panicking. Scattering. Seeking, searching, running...</p><p>Desperate not to be stepped on themselves.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p> <p>Just as Gen had said, Bennet was in his sixties. Even so, he was as straight as a ramrod, with snow-white hair, with impeccable manners. And he wore a suit, complete with bow tie, to take care of the house.</p><p>Except, of course, he didn\u2019t really do the housework. He directed.</p><p>And he clearly had a soft spot for Genevieve. That much was evident from the minute he let them into the house.</p><p>He had pale eyes, a faded green. Still, they lit up like stars when he saw Gen.</p><p>\u201cMiss Genevieve, you\u2019re looking well. Color in your cheeks, flesh on your bones...oh, not too much flesh,\u201d he assured her as he held her hands and looked at her from arms\u2019 length. He let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m ever so grateful things went...well, I\u2019m quite grateful you\u2019re still with us, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Bennet,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNot like Thorny,\u201d he said.</p><p>Thorny, Joe noted. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cAnd it may be my fault,\u201d Bennet said sadly, shaking his head. Then he stopped, his lean, wrinkled face instantly suspicious, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou brought a friend, I see. And I know who he is,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>Inwardly, Joe winced. It was a lot easier to do his job if no one knew what he was. Oh, well. Too late for that.</p><p>He extended a hand. \u201cHow do you do? I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawrence Levine.\u201d Bennet started to say more, but then he drew himself up very straight and said stiffly, \u201cForgive my rudeness, Miss Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>So much for being full enough of himself to think the world knew who he was, Joe thought dryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Larry Levine,\u201d he told Bennet, his hand still out. \u201cI\u2019m Joe Connolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bennet returned the handshake. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you think I was Larry?\u201d</p><p>Bennet shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met him, but Mr. Bigelow talked about him all the time, so I just thought...\u201d He sighed softly. \u201cGod rest his pompous old soul.\u201d</p><p>His words surprised Joe.</p><p>But Genevieve gave Bennet a light punch in the shoulder and said, \u201cCome on, we all know you loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that I did,\u201d Bennet said, and suddenly the subtle undertone in the man\u2019s accent became clear to Joe. Though he was doing his best to impersonate a very proper English butler, Bennet was actually Irish. Did that mean anything?</p><p>Point noted and...</p><p>Shelved.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to see Mr. Jared?\u201d Bennet asked. \u201cIf so, I\u2019m sorry, but he isn\u2019t here. He has his own place, you know. Although I suppose this is his place now, too. And I\u2019m very much hoping he\u2019ll be keeping the house. It\u2019s a fine piece of property, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we\u2019ve come to see you, Mr. Bennet,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>The old man looked at Joe again, studying him. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be that reporter. But I have seen your face. You were in the papers, right? All that business with Miss Genevieve, right? You\u2019re that private detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Joe said simply.</p><p>\u201cAm I a murder suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>But Joe said, \u201cSorry, but yes. Everyone associated with Thorne Bigelow has to be a suspect until they can be cleared. I hope you understand that it\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do, and God forgive me, but I was right here when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Bennet waved a hand. \u201cCome into the kitchen. It\u2019s my domain for the moment. I\u2019ll put some tea on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea sounds lovely, Bennet, thanks so much,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>A few minutes later, they were seated around the huge butcher-block table in the kitchen. Bennet told them, \u201cMr. Bigelow\u2019s office is still closed off. I haven\u2019t touched a thing in it. I believe I could now, but...\u201d His voice faded away. Joe couldn\u2019t help but believe that the man had felt a genuine affection for his employer of so many years. \u201cNot even young Jared has had the heart to go in there.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked up at the rafters where copper pots and utensils were handsomely displayed. It was a great kitchen, with a big fireplace and every conceivable appliance. Then he poured a teaspoon of sugar into his cup and stirred. \u201cSo, Mr. Bennet, you said you were here when it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you saw and heard nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all. My apartment is on the third floor, you see. What was once the attic, but it\u2019s been renovated. You\u2019re welcome to come up and see for yourself. Once you shut that door...well, a bomb could go off downstairs, and you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cI think I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Bennet stirred his own tea, then shook his head, looking distressed. \u201cI talked to the police at length. Mr. Jared, of course, was distraught, and accused me of horrible things, but he apologized later. And the detectives cleared me. Who knows, maybe they figured I just wasn\u2019t literary enough to pull off something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your position now?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I imagine Mr. Thorne left me something in his will, but who knows? Jared asked that I stay on for now, while he figures out what he wants to do. We\u2019re keeping everything the same. The maids come in each morning still. They just stay away from Mr. Bigelow\u2019s office. And his room,\u201d Bennet added softly. He shrugged. \u201cIt was clean when he was killed. The police went through it, of course, looking for any information he might have kept in his personal quarters, rather than his office, but they were very diligent about putting things back as they were, and there\u2019s been no reason for anyone to go back in and clean as yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow and when did you know something had happened?\u201d Joe asked him.</p><p>\u201cI heard Jared screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you couldn\u2019t have heard a bomb go off,\u201d Joe said lightly.</p><p>Bennet had the grace to offer a rueful smile. \u201cYou never heard anything like the way Mr. Jared was screaming when he found his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the two got along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgued like cats and dogs\u2014but they lived for it,\u201d Bennet said. He leaned a little closer to speak more softly, as if they were surrounded by others and might be heard. \u201cI think it was one of those other fellows. Jealous. Those men are fanatics. I mean, take the actor fellow. Don Tracy. He thinks he\u2019s Lawrence Olivier! He and Mr. Bigelow fought all the time whenever they had those Poe meetings here. To be truthful, I think Mr. Bigelow would have loved to be on the stage himself. Half the time, I think he was acting. Or trying to aggravate Mr. Tracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bennet, when was the last time you saw Mr. Bigelow?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Bennet looked at him oddly. \u201cWell, before the ambulance took him away, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant, when was the last time you saw him alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I picked up his lunch tray that afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what time was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see...I brought lunch up to him around one, and I picked up the tray at about one-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one was here until Jared arrived?\u201d Joe asked, knowing the answer but wondering what Bennet would tell him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. He was expecting a guest, but he didn\u2019t tell me who it was, and he said I shouldn\u2019t worry, that he\u2019d answer the door himself.\u201d</p><p>Good enough, Joe thought. That fit with what the detectives had said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what time did Jared start screaming?\u201d Joe asked. He had the notes on the initial investigation that Raif Green had passed on to him, but it was always interesting to see if the eye witnesses\u2019 memories stayed the same.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it was about six-thirty. Somewhere around there. I didn\u2019t actually look at the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone dialed 9-1-1 immediately, right?\u201d Joe asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>\u201cWas it you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact, when I started running downstairs, I could already hear a siren.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Yes, it was, Joe thought.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. Bigelow was already gone?\u201d Joe prompted.</p><p>\u201cStone cold, poor Thorny was stone cold,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>\u201cStone cold?\u201d Joe repeated curiously.</p> <p>\u201cWell, cold to the touch,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cThere was so much confusion, though. Jared was trying to resuscitate his father, and Mary, his aunt, just kept saying he had to stop, that Mr. Bigelow was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when she said that...you touched him?\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Bennet frowned. \u201cI\u2019m thinking...trying to remember exactly what I did. There seemed to be so much confusion. Um, no, no, I didn\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you know that he was cold?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Bennet frowned. Not like a man who had lied, but like a man who was genuinely confused. \u201cI...I guess I did touch him,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cI must have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p> <p>Bennet looked distressed.</p><p>\u201cJoe...\u201d Genevieve murmured, distressed.</p><p>He gave her a fierce frown.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been right when the paramedics came in,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cYes, that was it. The first young man asked if anyone had tried to revive him, and I said that his son had tried, and I touched Thorny then, and he was cold.\u201d</p><p>Joe finished his tea. \u201cWhat about Mary? Mrs. Vincenzo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? She and Thorny always seemed to get along fine,\u201d Bennet assured him.</p><p>\u201cNo, did she touch him?\u201d</p><p>Again, Bennet appeared perplexed. \u201cI...no. No, I don\u2019t think so. She just kept crying, touching Jared, telling him to let his father be, he was dead. They were both so upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did they react to you coming down?\u201d Joe asked, filing away the question of what had made Mary so certain that Thorne was dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure they noticed me at first. Then Jared looked at me, and he shouted, \u2018Bennet, what the hell did you do to my father?\u2019 And of course I told him I\u2019d done nothing, nothing at all. And I asked him what had happened, and he said they\u2019d found his father keeled over on the desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeled over on the desk?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Jared moved him so he could do CPR?\u201d And didn\u2019t notice that the man was \u201cstone cold\u201d? This case was getting more and more interesting by the moment.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so. The man was beside himself. If he could have saved his father, he would have, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to defend him,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cConsidering he was so quick to accuse you of killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared was simply distraught, as I told you,\u201d Bennet explained.</p><p>\u201cDid he keep accusing you when the police came?\u201d Genevieve asked, looking at him sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>Joe seemed to feel he\u2019d gotten all the information he could at that point, because he thanked Bennet for the tea and for being so forthcoming, and in a few minutes he and Gen were on their way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re going with your questions,\u201d Genevieve told Joe when they were back out on the street. \u201cAll of this must be on the record already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to investigate,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice old guy, and you were practically attacking him, as if you were the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be willing to bet the police were much harder on him than I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t arrest him, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have the evidence to arrest him. Or anyone, if it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going in circles,\u201d Genevieve protested.</p><p>He arched a brow to her. \u201cWant to fire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I just...I just feel we should be doing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I feel,\u201d he told her, \u201cas if you should be staying with your mother.\u201d</p><p>She let out a long breath of aggravation. \u201cI will not let this situation put me back a hundred years, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you were worried about her,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, and when she\u2019s at home, she couldn\u2019t be safer,\u201d Genevieve told him. \u201cBertha never leaves the mansion, and Henry is there, too. And the security system is state of the art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like the one at Bigelow\u2019s mansion,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>He was immediately sorry he\u2019d spoken, as her face drained of color. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so horrifying. Bigelow must have known, maybe even trusted, his killer. How do you ever figure out who\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou catch them in a lie,\u201d he said, and glanced at his watch. Sunday afternoon was waning. \u201cI think I should take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she told him. \u201cI took you to talk to the butler. Now you can take me to talk to the psychic.\u201d</p><p>He knew her. Knew the dead-stubborn set to her jaw. They wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere or doing anything until he took her to see Candy Cane slash Lori Star.</p><p>\u201cJoe, please.\u201d She set a hand on his arm. It was such a little thing, but it sent a jolt of electricity through him as strongly as if he\u2019d been strapped into the chair at Sing-Sing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s go,\u201d he almost snapped. His voice sounded too deep, too husky, even to his own ears. He wondered if she really didn\u2019t know how she affected people, men\u2014him\u2014and if she was truly as blind to her own assets as she seemed to be.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were knocking at Candy Cane\u2019s door.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Joe was persistent, and he tried rapping harder. Down the hallway, a young woman poked her head out.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, buddy,\u201d she said, then looked at the two of them and softened. \u201cSorry...I was just watching television. I didn\u2019t mean to bite your heads off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, we\u2019re sorry,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Can\u2014where Lori is?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve took a step forward. \u201cDid you see her today? Did she say anything to you? I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but it\u2019s really important that we speak with her.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2014who was probably only in her late twenties but already acquiring the pinched look of someone years older\u2014took a long look at Genevieve. Then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cLet me try to remember. I was just coming up from the laundry room when she was going out. She was all excited when she left,\u201d the woman said. \u201cUm...she did tell me that it was a great day, and that she was going to go see a man about a horse. Then she laughed and said it was a race horse and she was going to be in the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Genevieve said, frowning and looking at Joe.</p><p>Joe looked at Lori\u2019s neighbor, and something about the way he looked at her clearly made her defensive.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t hooking,\u201d the woman snapped.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest she was,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou two cops?\u201d the woman demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Genevieve said quickly, and stepped forward, offering her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Genevieve O\u2019Brian, and this is Joe Connolly. We just wanted to talk to Lori, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s shoulders sagged, as if she didn\u2019t have the energy to be angry anymore. \u201cShe\u2019s really a sweet girl. She deserves a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she does,\u201d Joe said, and he was surprised to realize he wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. He had been stunned himself to feel that something about Lori Star\u2019s words had felt real and that she really had seemed like a nice kid.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Susie Norman, by the way, and I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you.\u201d She brightened. \u201cNext time I see Lori, I\u2019ll tell her you were here, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Joe said. He slipped a business card under Lori\u2019s door, then walked over and handed one to Susie. \u201cHere\u2019s my number, in case you think of anything to help us find her. And thanks again.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the street, Genevieve looked at Joe expectantly. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I have to check on some alibis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Where do we start?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking at her with exasperation. \u201cGenevieve, you hired me to do this job. That means I do the work, and you head on home and enjoy what\u2019s left of your Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019ve spent enough time closed up in my house. Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do some work on the computer and make some phone calls,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI have a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all my contact numbers and stuff are at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet your contact numbers are in your phone,\u201d Genevieve told him.</p><p>No way out of it. He let out a sigh of vast exasperation. \u201cThen you\u2019re coming to Brooklyn,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Sunday in New York. It seemed as if every dog owner in the city was out. A poodle took issue with a Doberman. The owners sounded as if they were barking right along with their dogs as they accused each other of causing the problem. A Maltese went trotting by with its owner, a shaggy-haired young girl. Both were oblivious to the shouting match as they walked by.</p><p>Joe hailed a cab for Genevieve\u2019s apartment, where they retrieved his car. The Sunday traffic wasn\u2019t bad, and she seemed to enjoy the ride, looking out the window, watching as they traveled over the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>Joe realized that although they had been friends for over a year, he\u2019d kept his distance. She had never been to his place before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lived in an old brownstone. It was three stories, plus a basement, and he had the basement and the first floor. He even had a reserved parking space, which was something of a coup in his neighborhood, which was residential, but just a block off a commercial boulevard, where he could go for coffee, or great Chinese, Italian or diner-style American food whenever he chose.</p><p>But entering his place with Genevieve brought with it a stab of pain.</p><p>Leslie was the last woman he\u2019d brought here.</p> <p>And she had told him about the ghost in his basement, a Civil War era musician who had wanted the work he\u2019d left behind to be found and performed.</p><p>Ghosts.</p><p>He\u2019d spent his life being logical. He hadn\u2019t believed in ghosts. But then he\u2019d met Leslie and through her, a man named Adam Harrison and some of his employees, a group of people who found it as natural to talk to ghosts as it was to converse with strangers at a party.</p><p>But despite everything he had come to know about Leslie and, through her, Adam Harrison and his group of paranormal investigators, he had fought against believing in any of it.</p><p>But then he had spoken to a dead man on the highway, and after that, a corpse had looked up at him at the morgue and spoken....</p> <p>Ridiculous. It was all ridiculous.</p><p>He\u2019d been working too hard. Or not getting enough sleep. Hell, maybe he actually needed to start drinking more.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself at home,\u201d he told Genevieve.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help watching her as she looked around his apartment.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t help wondering if he didn\u2019t have a little bit of a chip on his shoulder where she was concerned. He\u2019d always worked hard and made a decent income, and he was good at investing the extra, so finances weren\u2019t a worry. But Genevieve O\u2019Brien was the kind of rich that went beyond most people\u2019s dreams, including his.</p><p>Still, she had chosen a life of service to others, even before her kidnapping. She had worked the meanest streets in town. She had tried to save prostitutes and their children. She had fought against heroin and crack addiction, and dealt with those who were down and out and even those suffering from AIDS. She had never given any indication that she was a spoiled rich kid just because her family had obscene amounts of money.</p> <p>She smiled, her eyes meeting his. \u201cJoe, this place is great. That\u2019s one of the most fantastic fireplaces ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cKitchen is there, so help yourself if you want something to drink. I\u2019ve usually got beer, wine, soda. And food, if you\u2019re hungry. There\u2019s a TV over there, and a pool table downstairs, if you get bored. I\u2019ll be in my office, right down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m fine. Mind if I go through your CD collection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still feeling oddly awkward, and walked down the hall to his office. It was lined with oak bookshelves and three-drawer filing cabinets. His desk was an antique that might have belonged to Uriah Heap, if he\u2019d been real and not a character in a book.</p><p>He put through a call to Raif Green at his home.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe, got anything?\u201d Raif asked as soon as Joe identified himself.</p> <p>\u201cNo, sorry. I was hoping you might have something to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth...we basically have nothing,\u201d Raif admitted. \u201cExcept what we\u2019ve known from the beginning. Thorne Bigelow knew his killer. He let the person in, and he was willing to sit there and drink wine with him or her. So we\u2019re looking at friends and acquaintances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on the butler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, he \u2018buttled\u2019 very well,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cBut he was there the whole time,\u201d Joe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a thing on him. We searched the house, but there was no sign of poison anywhere, including in his quarters. Naturally we looked at his son, but there was nothing to prove he was there earlier. Same thing with the aunt. The two of them arrived together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m assuming the son had the most to gain from his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ve talked to Bigelow\u2019s attorney, and except for some special endowments and individual bequests, Jared Bigelow inherits everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve looked into the rest of the Ravens\u2019 alibis?\u201d Joe said.</p><p>He heard Raif\u2019s sigh. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to give me a list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry Levine was at the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a doorman vouched for him. Brook Avery was at home, watching television. He spoke to a neighbor around three o\u2019clock. Um, hang on. I\u2019ll get my notes.\u201d There was some shuffling. Joe could hear a woman\u2019s voice, calling Raif to dinner. He promised her that he\u2019d be right there. Joe tried to imagine Raif Green\u2019s domestic life. Sometimes he seemed sad and burned-out, but he had kids at home. And a wife. He investigated murders every day, then went home to kids and homework and meatloaf.</p><p>Raif came back on the line. \u201cNat Halloway was working on his clients\u2019 files at his office. He was seen by a cleaning woman. Don Tracy, the actor...was rehearsing a one-man play. We verified his alibi with the director and the rest of the cast. Lila Hawkins was at a blood-donation center, seen by a dozen people around four o\u2019clock. Barbara Hirshorn...home alone watching television. Verified by a neighbor, who saw Barbara when she went out for groceries. Lou Sayles was at an afternoon party for a retiring schoolteacher. Out in Brooklyn Heights. Verified by half a dozen people. I think we\u2019ve got them all covered. Oh, yeah, your friend. Eileen Brideswell. She was home, too, verified by Bertha Landry, her live-in maid, and Henry Grant, her...jack of all trades, I guess you\u2019d call him. Besides, I can guarantee you that Eileen Brideswell is as law-abiding as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut you know, Raif...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure any one of those is a really good alibi, the kind that guarantees someone didn\u2019t slip out to Bigelow\u2019s place for a half hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are laws, Joe,\u201d Raif said. \u201cI\u2019m a public servant. I can\u2019t just barge into people\u2019s houses and search them without a warrant. I haven\u2019t got a thing to hold anyone on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the accident on the FDR?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it? That\u2019s Traffic\u2019s job. I can\u2019t do a damned thing when there\u2019s no one out there who can give me anything more than a dark sedan that was driving erratically. I can\u2019t connect that accident\u2014even if Sam Latham is still in the hospital\u2014to Thorne Bigelow\u2019s murder. And if we\u2019re talking Poe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Poe had no vehicular homicides in his stories. Got ya,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re a private investigator...\u201d Raif reminded him, letting the words trail off suggestively.</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not subject to quite as much shit as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Are you going to get me out of jail when they lock me up for breaking and entering, or whatever it is you\u2019re suggesting I do?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I\u2019m not suggesting you do anything illegal,\u201d Raif protested. \u201cNot that you couldn\u2019t push the boundaries a little if you needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if Bigelow was killed because of the Poe thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you think the killer will end up striking again before he\u2019s caught, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>Joe heard the woman\u2019s voice calling out to Raif again. \u201cGo eat your dinner before it gets cold,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, I will. Don\u2019t forget, Joe, if you get anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll call you,\u201d Joe promised, and hung up.</p><p>He pulled out a map of Manhattan and started going through alibis one by one. Brook Avery lived uptown; if he was where he said he\u2019d been, getting down to Bigelow\u2019s place would have taken a while. Joe put his name on one list. On the other hand, Larry Levine\u2019s office was relatively close to Bigelow. He could have slipped out easily. His name went on a second list.</p><p>Joe kept going. Don Tracy. The theater was close enough, too. Don\u2019s name went under Larry\u2019s.</p><p>He put Jared Bigelow and Mary Vincenzo on that list, too.</p><p>Along with the butler.</p><p>Lou Sayles had the best alibi. He put her name on the list with Brook\u2019s. Lila Hawkins, big, pushy Lila, had been uptown at the blood-donation center. Her name, too, went on the \u201cimprobable\u201d list. He hesitated when he got to Barbara Hirshorn. She was afraid of her own shadow, but her home was near Bigelow\u2019s. He didn\u2019t really see her as a potential killer, but he put her name on the \u201cfollow up first\u201d list anyway.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the desk, then decided to start with Jared. Why not go for the obvious?</p><p>The butler had been an easy choice, but if the butler hadn\u2019t done it...</p><p>Patricide was as old as history. And Jared Bigelow was the one who would profit the most from his father\u2019s death.</p><p>Edgar Allan Poe, so they said, was the father of the detective story. And he and his Monsieur Dupin had used \u201cratiocination,\u201d or rational deduction, as their method of investigation.</p><p>So, rationally, who benefitted? And who not only had motive but opportunity?</p><p>He skipped over Poe and thought about Sherlock Holmes, who always told Watson that you needed to get rid of the impossible, and then what was left, no matter how improbable, had to be the truth.</p><p>Joe groaned softly, looking at his notes.</p><p>So far, nothing seemed to be impossible.</p><p>Not even talking to dead people.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s cell phone rang and she answered it absently. \u201cHello?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d It was her mother\u2019s voice.</p><p>Gen smiled. \u201cMother, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried calling the apartment,\u201d Eileen said, as if that were a perfectly acceptable explanation for sounding so worried.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Her mother adored Joe, Gen knew.</p><p>Yes, and why not? Without him, she might not be here.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m the one who should be calling, and panicking about you,\u201d Genevieve reminded her mother. \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t go anywhere alone. Or with any of the other Ravens,\u201d Genevieve said sternly.</p><p>\u201cThose people are my friends, you know. Most of them. Well, some of them,\u201d Eileen said.</p> <p>\u201cOne of them could be a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd poor Thorne might have been killed for some other reason entirely,\u201d Eileen reminded her. \u201cBut never mind, I didn\u2019t call to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you called to check up on me,\u201d Genevieve said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you blame me, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Genevieve promised.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you go, now that I know you\u2019re all right. Enjoy the rest of your day with Joe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. And thanks,\u201d Genevieve said, then rang off.</p><p>Enjoy her day with Joe?</p><p>He was in his office; she was here alone.</p><p>But at least she was here. For whatever good that did her.</p><p>Restlessly, she stood. He had a great CD collection, and an appreciation for music that went beyond eclectic and on to boundless. He had the classics, from Pavarotti to Wagner, country, soul, rhythm and blues, rock, even some trance. She put in a Buddy Holly CD and tried to relax.</p><p>No good. She was too restless.</p><p>He\u2019d told her to make herself at home. Since she wasn\u2019t hungry or thirsty, the kitchen held no great allure, so she decided to explore the basement.</p><p>It had been finished, and now it was perfect for intimate entertaining. That made her think about the way Joe thought about her. He had a dual vision of her.</p> <p>Little rich girl.</p><p>And damaged goods.</p><p>What could she do to change that?</p><p>Perhaps it couldn\u2019t be changed. Perhaps...</p><p>Perhaps he simply didn\u2019t find her attractive, she told herself.</p><p>Here she was, thinking about Joe, about being damaged, about the past, wondering why he wasn\u2019t making a move on her, when he was upstairs doing exactly what she had asked of him: working on the case.</p><p>And then something very strange happened.</p><p>She didn\u2019t close her eyes, but it was as if she were seeing something else besides this room. Almost as if she herself was someone else.</p><p>She was walking down the street, anxious and excited. She was going to meet someone, and that someone was going to change her life. It was all very hush-hush, because it was so important. Someone was going to take a chance.</p><p>On her.</p><p>For her.</p><p>This was her chance to be rich and famous. Well, he was going to pay her well, so rich, anyway.</p><p>And if things went the way they should...</p><p>She was almost at the place where they\u2019d planned to meet, and she hoped he wouldn\u2019t be late. That he would be there waiting for her.</p><p>She knew she hadn\u2019t been followed.</p><p>That no one knew where she was.</p><p>She was about to see a man about a horse....</p><p>Genevieve blinked. She was in Joe\u2019s basement again, staring at the pool table. For a moment, her hands shook. What the hell had that been? She couldn\u2019t believe she was seeing things.</p><p>Oh, great. Damaged goods to begin with, and now she was going crazy. No. She was not going to allow herself to crack.</p><p>She ran up the stairs. Joe was still in his office. He hadn\u2019t heard her; he obviously didn\u2019t know anything was wrong.</p><p>Because nothing was wrong.</p><p>She turned up Buddy Holly, then headed back to the basement, determined not to worry about her love life\u2014or complete lack thereof\u2014anymore.</p><p>Joe sighed, rose and stretched, surprised at how long he\u2019d been at his desk. He walked out to the living room.</p><p>Buddy Holly was playing on the stereo, but Genevieve was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>He noticed that the door to the basement stairway was open. Then he heard a series of clicking sounds and realized she was downstairs, playing pool.</p><p>He walked down to join her, and on the way he noticed the brick wall and remembered how Leslie had told him that he would find music there if he tore it out. She hadn\u2019t felt ready to admit that she talked to ghosts then, so she had just told him that she did a lot of research in the course of her work and had happened to stumble across some information about his building.</p><p>Yeah, right. Accidental research, right where he happened to live.</p><p>He remembered their conversations, too. How he had thought she simply needed time to get over Matt, because it had seemed clear that she was drawn to him. Well, she was with Matt now. Whether there was an afterlife or only a dark void, they were together.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Genevieve asked. She was standing by the pool table, her cue in hand, staring at him, and he realized that he must have been standing there, lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Eager to take his mind off his thoughts of a moment ago, he picked up a cue stick himself. \u201cI\u2019ll rack \u2019em,\u201d he said.</p><p>She watched while he gathered and set the balls. \u201cBreak?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She was an exceptional player. She almost cleaned the table with her break.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know rich kids got to be such sharks,\u201d he told her teasingly.</p><p>He was surprised when she paused, smoothing back a stray lock of her glorious auburn hair, and said, \u201cI really wish you would quit that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaring at me as if I grew up on another planet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the brick wall, picturing the day Leslie had been there. She had talked to dead people. And he had talked to a dead man on the FDR. No. The medics must have been wrong. The guy had somehow survived long enough to save his niece.</p><p>But what about the morgue?</p><p>He\u2019d been tired. Mind playing tricks.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d</p><p>She set her cue stick down. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home now, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re in the middle of your memories. And that\u2019s all right. But I\u2019d just like to go home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She was silent during the drive back to her place. Dusk was falling, and it seemed to have thrown a dark shadow over her. Over them.</p><p>As they neared her apartment, she said, \u201cYou can just drop me off in front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a doorman on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJoe, I...don\u2019t want or need to be protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t work this case unless you\u2019re careful and take every precaution.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands in a gesture of futility.</p><p>He parked the car, and walked with her past the doorman and the security guard on duty downstairs, and then up to her apartment.</p><p>When she opened her door, he just stood in the hallway, inhaling the scent of her perfume, light and evocative of summer breezes somewhere far from Manhattan.</p><p>Like the scent of her hair. Clean and inviting...</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop sleeping with her, you know,\u201d she told him softly, turning to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never slept with Leslie,\u201d he heard himself say, and his words were far more curt than he had intended.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s haunting you anyway,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLeslie is dead. Like Matt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m alive because of her,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with Leslie, even in my dreams,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was surprised when a slight smile curved her lips. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cGen...this is awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered, something he couldn\u2019t define in her tone.</p><p>He shook his head, feeling lost, a little bit confused and more than a little bit dazed by the scent of her perfume, her hair...her nearness.</p><p>What was there not to like about Genevieve?</p><p>What was there not to want about Genevieve?</p><p>Blue eyes, intelligent, direct, seductive, alluring...That hair, like dark auburn fire, as soft as silk. Her height, her shape, slim and perfectly curved. She was erotic and enticing, everything God had intended for a woman to be, but he had somehow kept his distance in the past because...</p><p>Because of everything she had been through.</p><p>He suddenly felt as if he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak, but he tried. \u201cI...I cared about Leslie, yes. Very much. But she was still in love with Matt. And now...I like to think that they\u2019re together now.\u201d He hadn\u2019t realized that he was touching her, but he was. His hands were on her shoulders. And she was close, actually leaning against him. He could feel the warmth of her. Every breath he took was filled with the scent of her.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re really not sleeping with her in your dreams?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you want to sleep with me. In the flesh.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve...\u201d</p><p>He felt alive in a way he hadn\u2019t felt in what seemed like eons. Fire was racing through his veins. He could feel her heartbeat. Her every breath.</p><p>\u201cGen...after everything you\u2019ve been through...\u201d</p><p>She clutched his hand, bringing it to her heart, her breast. \u201cI\u2019m alive, Joe. I\u2019m not broken, not dead and I need to feel alive. Please...\u201d She winced, almost backing away from him, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cTalk about awkward. Here I am, throwing myself at you, and you\u2019re turning me down. I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Enough.</p><p>He bent and kissed her. At first she was surprised. Then his mouth softened over hers, and she responded, rising on her toes, pressing against his body. Each cell in his body seemed to feel her slightest touch. Her mouth parted beneath his, wide, wet, deliciously decadent. She kissed with her tongue, erotic and sweet, the kind of thing that made a man forget everything in the world except her kiss. And she was still holding his hand against her breast. He kept kissing her, tasting her lips, playing with her tongue, seductive, suggestive....</p><p>He picked her up. She was tall for a woman, but small against his size. He knew the layout of her apartment and carried her to her bedroom, where he simply placed her on the bed, before lying down beside her.</p> <p>There was no neat, leisurely discarding of their clothing. The buttons of her blouse simply gave way to the ministration of his fingers as they slipped beneath the hem, stroking over the tautness of her abdomen to the fullness of her breast. Her bra was an annoyance that somehow went away as soon as he found the hook. And then his face was buried between her breasts, ministering to them with hot, wet kisses, tender and hungry, subtle and raw. And then her jeans disappeared. The snap first, then the zipper lowering, his hand sliding down to cradle her hip, dislodging the denim, then caressing her skin as it moved lower, until the jeans, along with the little string panties beneath them, were gone.</p><p>His shirt hung open, and his own pants lay on the floor, tangled with hers, though he had no idea how they\u2019d gotten there. His black briefs hit the floor, as well, and then she was crushed against him, the tip of her tongue sliding over his flesh. He groaned, his erection suddenly painful, but then he was lost in the sensation of her fingers on his flesh. Suddenly the two of them were a tangle of lips and tongues and teeth, and they were touching, touching....</p><p>He\u2019d always thought that he would be so tender, so careful, if the thought of making love to her that had teased his imagination had ever come to fruition.</p><p>Her kidnapper had been impotent and cruel, and she had survived by playing to the man\u2019s ego. Because of that, he should have been slow. Careful. Tender.</p><p>But she was like a lava flow in his arms, radiant, electrifyingly hot, her touch boldly erotic. She was a writhing cascade of carnal beauty and desire in his arms, and he couldn\u2019t be gentle, couldn\u2019t take the time for tender, as his senses sent him spiraling out of control. Later he would remember straddling her, kissing her lips and looking into her eyes, those dark pools of half-lidded blue, and then his mouth was caressing her breasts, and his fingers were sliding between her thighs, his body adjusting to her exquisite length as he slid against her. Then his lips were moving lower over her abdomen, to the concave mystery between her thighs. When she cried out and arched against him, he moved again, driving himself into her, so aroused that he felt as if he was about to crawl out of his own skin. The world came down to nothing but the two of them, their naked, hot, wet flesh, their hunger and need, and then, cataclysmically, a combustion of muscle, sinew and flesh as he felt her climax, then followed her as if rockets had flared in the night.</p> <p>And then...</p><p>He felt guilty. Torn.</p><p>But then she touched his face. Touched it so tenderly, as he slipped down by her side, cradling her against him.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said softly. And then, \u201cThank you. Thank you for being so...normal.\u201d</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t want to lose his heart so quickly. He may have lost his mind, but the world was still real, and they were who were they were, and normal or not, they were both still damaged.</p><p>\u201cNormal?\u201d he teased softly. \u201cNormal? Do you know how to flatter a guy, or what? How about, \u2018Oh, Joe, you were incredible\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed then, snuggling more tightly against him, and said, \u201cOh, Joe. You were incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept I had to coach you to say so,\u201d he said.</p><p>They lay together for a while, just breathing, just being...And then her delicate hands with their talented fingers were on him again and she whispered, \u201cIf you\u2019re just as good a second time, I promise you won\u2019t have to tell me what to say.\u201d</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>They made love again then, heedless of everything dangerous that might be lurking in the night.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it; he had to ask.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so psychic, how come you didn\u2019t see this coming, huh?\u201d</p><p>The girl hadn\u2019t been part of his original plan, but she hadn\u2019t given him any choice. She\u2019d wanted her moment in the public eye, her fifteen minutes of fame.</p> <p>Well, now her name would be blazoned across dozens of headlines. She would make the news again, this time in a spectacular way. She should really be thanking him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been the one slated to die this way. He\u2019d intended to go after someone else. Someone not only young and beautiful, but with a name and face so easily recognizable that the city would be in an absolute uproar.</p><p>\u201cYou will go down in history, my dear,\u201d he told her. She had been such an easy mark, her desire for fame and fortune blinding her to any possible danger.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at all grateful for the favor he was doing her, though.</p><p>Her eyes were bulging, and she kept making little mewling noises behind the gag. He was actually a little bit sorry, but not sorry enough to stop.</p><p>He had an agenda, and he couldn\u2019t let her get in the way of it any more than she already had. Now it was time. Time to finish her off.</p><p>She kept struggling, but he\u2019d been careful. No one would ever find any of his DNA under her fingernails, nor would they find his fingerprints, even if they could actually lift them off skin these days. Every killer left something behind or took something away, they said.</p><p>Not him.</p><p>He knew how to be careful.</p><p>Still...poison was much better. And so easy. You simply slipped it into the bastard\u2019s wine, he drank it and then he died.</p><p>Strangulation, on the other hand...</p><p>He\u2019d never figured it would be so hard. Everything leading up to it had been easy. She\u2019d fallen for the idea that they needed to keep their meeting secret. She\u2019d been willing to slip into the dark with him, go wherever he wanted to go. Even getting on his boat and going out on the water...</p><p>Such a sap. Such a fool.</p><p>She\u2019s jumped at the offer when he\u2019d suggested the champagne to seal their deal, but she hadn\u2019t gotten as drunk as he had thought she was. She wanted to live. He had her bound and gagged, but she was still struggling, and...</p><p>Those eyes!</p><p>He thought he might see her awful, bulging eyes forever.</p><p>And then, at last, they closed.</p><p>She stopped struggling, and the rest was easy. Distasteful, but easy. He hadn\u2019t done so well the last time, hadn\u2019t been able to carry out his literary parallel to the full extent he would have liked to. In this day and age, walling up old Thorne wouldn\u2019t have been easy.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t really use Poe as his road map. Not without chancing being caught.</p><p>So he would just do his best to follow the master\u2019s model.</p><p>In this case, Genevieve O\u2019Brien would have made a much more appropriate victim. She was far lovelier than the original cigar girl, Mary Rogers, not to mention Lori Star. But Lori had been too nosy, and though he didn\u2019t believe in psychics, someone else might, so she had had to become his Marie Roget.</p><p>Finally he was done, and he sent to her body to a watery grave. Of course, she would be discovered. It was, in fact, absolutely necessary that she be found.</p><p>As he headed back to the hustle and flow of life in New York, he contemplated the fact that he hadn\u2019t done a bad job. In fact, he was feeling quite satisfied with his efforts, even gleeful.</p><p>This was going to be fun.</p><p>Then he paused, arrested by a flash in his mind\u2019s eye. Those bulging eyes.</p><p>But for a minute, they hadn\u2019t belonged to the whore, the would-be psychic, Lori Star. They had been her eyes. The eyes of the beauty he had originally intended to take the victim\u2019s part in his reenactment of Poe\u2019s brilliant original. They had been the eyes of Genevieve O\u2019Brien. Beautiful and blue.</p><p>Watching him.</p><p>Seeing him.</p><p>Knowing him for who\u2014and what\u2014he was.</p><p>Genevieve!</p><p>She was at his side, Joe told himself. There in her bed.</p><p>Sleeping.</p><p>He, too, had been asleep. No, it hadn\u2019t been a dream, it had been a nightmare, a look into the hellish pit of his imagination.</p><p>He had seen her face, and she\u2019d been looking at him with those brilliantly blue eyes of hers.</p><p>Looking at him...in accusation.</p><p>And then those perfectly blue eyes had begun to bulge, her face growing red as it was suffused with blood, her throat darkening with the deep black and blue of bruises.</p><p>She was choking. Being choked. By the hands he could see around her throat. Powerful hands, squeezing, tightening, stealing her breath...stealing her life.</p><p>It had only been a dream, he told himself again. They were still in her bed, and she was next to him.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t sleeping. She sat up suddenly, staring ahead blankly into the shadows of the room.</p><p>\u201cGen?\u201d He was bathed in sweat, but already the Technicolor horror of the dream was fading.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him at first.</p><p>\u201cGen?\u201d he said again.</p><p>She blinked, then shuddered and turned to him. Tousled hair framed the delicate features of her face, and she smiled. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said back.</p><p>She lay down beside him again, as if nothing were wrong in the world.</p><p>Was anything wrong?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, but she sounded hesitant as she added, \u201cHow about you?\u201d He realized instantly that she was referring to what had transpired between them, that her question had nothing to do with what had been his nightmare. After all, people didn\u2019t share their dreams, their nightmares, not even if they had been intimate.</p><p>He shook off the dream. It was just a result of stress, he told himself. Just like thinking he\u2019d heard the dead speak. No matter how embarrassing it was, he was going to have to go see a shrink. How many cases had he worked on in his life? How many corpses had he seen? So why now? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, a shrink was definitely in order.</p><p>He reached out, slipping his arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m fine.

Please...</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Jared Bigelow was waiting when Joe entered his office.</p><p>He had a floor in a Midtown building where Bigelow, Inc., ran its investment business. Most of the family money had been in real estate, but online investigation had shown Joe that Thorne had weighed other options and diversified into computers and several other high-tech concerns. He\u2019d been president, but apparently he\u2019d left most of the day-to-day management to his son for many years. He\u2019d allowed himself the freedom to indulge his love of Edgar Allan Poe and to write the book that had brought him so much acclaim. And possibly led to his death.</p><p>A secretary let Joe in to see Jared, who indicated, without rising himself, that Joe should sit. There was a long sofa across from Bigelow\u2019s desk, but Joe opted to pull over a chair from the far side of the room; he wanted to be close enough to read the man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why are you here?\u201d Jared asked.</p> <p>\u201cTo talk about your father\u2019s death,\u201d Joe said, as if the answer should have been obvious. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you want his killer caught,\u201d he went on easily.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I do,\u201d Jared snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t mind helping me out.\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed, and for a moment he didn\u2019t look like such a blustering jackass, Joe thought. \u201cLook, my father was murdered. The police questioned me for hours. Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? I\u2019m obviously the first suspect on anyone\u2019s list. I inherited his money and this company, for one thing. But I loved my father, and we worked well together. You can question everyone from now until eternity, and they\u2019ll tell you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cLook, I know you talked to the police. And I know it has to be hard to lose your father, then have to deal with all the questions, knowing that people suspect you. But it will help me a lot if you just go over everything one more time. Everything that happened once you found him.\u201d</p><p>Jared Bigelow sat back in his chair, tapping a pencil against his desk and looking up at the ceiling, as if he could better recreate what had occurred.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, your aunt and your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your aunt was with you when you got to your father\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I picked her up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives closer to you than your father did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent direction,\u201d Jared said. He shook his head, then shrugged. \u201cWe got there. I have a key, so I unlocked the door and went in. I called for my father, but he didn\u2019t answer. I went into his office and...he was slumped over. I thought at first that he\u2019d just collapsed...maybe had a heart attack. I went a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried CPR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Joe was still trying to figure out how Thorne had ended up slumped over when the paramedics arrived, given that Jared had admitted to trying CPR on him, but he decided not to derail the man by asking about it now.</p><p>\u201cAnd your aunt called 9-1-1?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t think so. I remember seeing my father...my aunt being there...and then Bennet coming down. And sirens, and then a lot of people.\u201d He looked at Jared. \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>\u201cWhere was the wineglass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s wineglass. Where was it?\u201d</p><p>Jared frowned. \u201cIt was...on the desk. His desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the left, near the edge. What the hell does it matter?\u201d He sounded aggravated again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Jared cleared his throat. \u201cWell, then, if that\u2019s it...I have to get through today, and then his memorial service is tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his burial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being cremated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jared Bigelow asked impatiently. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more question,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been having an affair with your aunt?\u201d Joe asked easily.</p><p>The pencil dropped from Jared\u2019s fingers. His face turned a mottled shade of crimson and he stood up, enraged. \u201cGet out. Get out of my office, and don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be a man,\u201d Lila Hawkins announced.</p><p>She had decided to drop in on Eileen Brideswell for lunch. And Genevieve hadn\u2019t been about to let Lila Hawkins anywhere near her mother without being present herself. It didn\u2019t matter that Bertha was going to be preparing the food, and that she wouldn\u2019t leave Eileen alone for a minute. Genevieve intended to be there.</p><p>From there, it had somehow turned into a ladies\u2019 lunch. Lou Sayles and Barbara Hirshorn were both there, too, as they all congregated around Eileen\u2019s balcony table. Henry and Bertha hovered nearby, determined to keep an eye on Eileen at all times.</p><p>\u201cLila, he was poisoned, so why are you so sure his killer was a man?\u201d Eileen asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do we have to keep rehashing this?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even held Thorne\u2019s memorial yet,\u201d Lila said. \u201cI think it\u2019s only natural that we\u2019re talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still don\u2019t see why you think he had to be murdered by a man,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cA man did it. I just know it,\u201d Lila said.</p><p>\u201cPity you don\u2019t know what man,\u201d Genevieve said, drawing one of Lila\u2019s reprimanding stares.</p><p>\u201cLila, historically, women who commit murder often use poison,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Barbara Hirshorn demanded, looking horrified. \u201cThat\u2019s just too terrible. I can\u2019t believe a woman could have hurt the poor man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled him,\u201d Lou corrected.</p><p>Lila shook her head. \u201cIt was Larry Levine. He\u2019s always been jealous of Thorne. You know, sees himself as the real writer, while Thorne was just a businessman. Poor Thorne. It\u2019s a pity he ever wrote that book. It was his downfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila, it\u2019s reckless of you to accuse Larry this way,\u201d Eileen said firmly. \u201cAnd we have no idea if Thorne\u2019s book was really a factor or not.\u201d</p><p>For a moment they all paused, looking at one another awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that...Mary Vincenzo...could have...?\u201d Barbara asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lila said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t. I think they need to look at Larry. Hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Larry know that you think he\u2019s the killer?\u201d Barbara asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cOh, good heavens, I\u2019m not foolish enough to accuse him publicly,\u201d Lila said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying here is just between us...and Genevieve, of course. Although I strongly suspect some of our words will be repeated to that private investigator you hired.\u201d She pointed a finger at Genevieve. \u201cAll right, maybe I\u2019m saying this because I know it will be repeated, and there\u2019s where he should be looking. Tell that young man he needs to tear apart everything in Larry Levine\u2019s life. I promise you, Larry is\u2014or was, anyway\u2014viciously jealous of poor Thorne.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve held her tongue. Lila had talked about pompous Thorne when he\u2019d been alive, but now he was poor Thorne.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Joe what you suspect, Lila,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll investigate Larry.\u201d Along with everyone else, she added silently.</p><p>Lila nodded, as if pleased, and things were just as they should be. \u201cKeep an eye on him at the service tonight. Keep a close eye on him,\u201d she warned gravely.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lila,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>At first, the service for Thorne Bigelow could have been any memorial. The prayers were said, and the mourners looked duly sad.</p><p>Both Raif Green and Tom Dooley were there, but they remained at the rear of the church, just watching.</p><p>When the prayers were over, Jared tearfully talked about his father\u2019s brilliance and his love for literature. Then Mary Vincenzo spoke about her brother-in-law\u2019s philanthropic work. Afterward, Jared stepped back to the podium and invited any of the mourners who had something to say to come up, starting with those who had been in his father\u2019s beloved society.</p><p>And with that, the service turned into a Poe convention.</p><p>Brook Avery came up and read from \u201cAnnabelle Lee.\u201d Then Don Tracy did a dramatic reading of \u201cThe Raven.\u201d Nat Halloway, though awkward and stiff, announced that he was reading from a story that was a favorite of his, as well as Thorne Bigelow\u2019s, \u201cThe Masque of the Red Death.\u201d Larry Levine was just as awkward, but he stumbled through a passage from \u201cMS Found in a Bottle.\u201d</p><p>Lila Hawkins came up and briefly said that the community would mourn such a colorful man, and that the perpetrator of the crime must be caught. Lou Sayles spoke fondly of a man she would miss. Eileen was just as kind and brief. Sam Latham, though he remained in the hospital, sent his condolences through a coworker.</p><p>Barbara Hirshorn was shy and hesitant, but she commended Thorne Bigelow on all he had done for the literary community. When she finished, there was only scattered applause, because by then people were getting tired, and some had even slipped out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe noticed, however, that one person was soundly clapping.</p><p>Albee Bennet, the butler.</p><p>He caught Joe watching him and smiled sheepishly. Later, as they were filing out of the church, he stopped Joe, who was with Genevieve and Eileen, and said, \u201cThat poor shy woman. I had to clap. I mean, the whole place went crazy over that egomaniac Don Tracy, but she was the one who really deserved the applause.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was very kind of you,\u201d Eileen told him sincerely.</p><p>And then they were all outside. Raif and Tom had respectfully disappeared before the end of the service, Joe noticed, as he watched Jared escorting Mary toward a limousine. Jared turned and stared back at Joe, and it was a bitter and resentful stare. Then he and Mary got into the limo, which drove smoothly away.</p><p>But Joe noticed that, as it started down the street, it was being followed.</p><p>Apparently the cops were still keeping an eye on Jared and his aunt.</p><p>He made a mental note that tomorrow he would try interviewing Mary Vincenzo. She never appeared quite as assured as Jared. She might well be the one to give him a clue to Jared\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p> <p>\u201cThorne would have been horrified,\u201d Lila Hawkins announced, coming to stand beside them.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Eileen asked, surprised. \u201cI thought it was a lovely ceremony. A bit long, but Thorne would have enjoyed all the readings in his honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant he would have been horrified that Jared isn\u2019t having a reception, that he isn\u2019t inviting people back to his father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s still too upset,\u201d Eileen suggested.</p><p>Lila let out a snort and turned to Gen. \u201cDid you mention Larry Levine to Mr. Connolly?\u201d she asked, then looked meaningfully at Joe.</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been time,\u201d Genevieve said, then quickly told him about Lila\u2019s suspicions.</p> <p>\u201cIs there some reason why you suspect him, especially?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was always so jealous,\u201d Lila said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll certainly look into Larry\u2019s whereabouts at the time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood. And now, since nothing is on offer, I\u2019m off,\u201d Lila told them. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you gain anything from this?\u201d Genevieve asked him as they walked over to his car together.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLila is very suspicious of Larry, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it was my mother who mentioned that women tend to use poison to commit murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistorically speaking, that\u2019s true. Poison is generally thought of as a woman\u2019s weapon,\u201d Joe agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo do you think...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew what to think,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>They drove Eileen home. Henry and Bertha were there to see that she got safely inside. When they got to Genevieve\u2019s apartment, Joe parked and went with her to her door. Once there, he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, are you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want me to,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and smiled.</p><p>It was incredible, being with her. She was an exquisite lover, giving, exciting, tender, wild. He cared about her deeply, had been in danger of falling in love with her from the moment he had first seen her, as traumatic as it had been. Now, on only their second night together, they had already slipped easily into a close relationship, as if they were longtime lovers. He was physically exhausted and emotionally content when at last they slept.</p><p>There was no reason for the dream\u2014the nightmare\u2014to come again, but it did.</p><p>He was looking at her face, the perfect, sculpted beauty of it, and into her eyes. Those eyes, bluer than blue, filled with vibrancy, brilliance and life.</p><p>And then...</p><p>Then everything changed. Her eyes were suddenly huge and bulging, the red of broken capillaries spilling out around the blue, and bruises, blue and black, circled her neck, taking the form of handprints against the pale flesh of her throat....</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d</p><p>He heard her calling to him, but he was gasping, desperate to stop her murder but unable to figure out how. He couldn\u2019t see who was threatening her; he could only see the certain death that was facing her. He could only see her death...</p><p>As it happened.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d she called again.</p><p>He awoke with a start. She was next to him, her hands on his shoulders as she shook him awake.</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment before registering the fact that he was awake, and she was alive and well and at his side and that he had been experiencing a nightmare once again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak at first, just put his arms around her and pulled her against him. He felt a thundering and knew that it was his own heart.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she repeated again, struggling to free herself enough to look up and meet his eyes. \u201cJoe, what is it?\u201d</p><p>I keep seeing you die, he thought, but he had no intention of saying the words aloud. Instead, he shook his head to clear it. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told her gruffly.</p><p>She seemed perplexed. Her hair spilled around her face, like soft flames in the shadows. \u201cMaybe I should fire you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head, his eyes dead set on hers. \u201cYou can fire me if you want to, but I won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou...you really are incredible, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m good out of bed, too.\u201d</p><p>Her smile deepened, and she settled down at his side. As he drew her closer to him, she said, \u201cJoe, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYou know, you had some kind of strange dream last night, too,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he told her, thinking of the way she\u2019d been sitting bolt upright, as if she were looking at something, watching someone.</p><p>Great. They should both head straight to therapy.</p><p>Except that she didn\u2019t know that there was anything wrong. She didn\u2019t remember what she\u2019d been dreaming. She didn\u2019t know...</p><p>That he heard dead people speak.</p><p>\u201cJoe, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d she asked, sounding anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pressure you. I\u2019m awfully glad you\u2019re with me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe...you kept saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying what?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018No, don\u2019t die. You can\u2019t die.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He winced. Which would be worse? Lying and telling her that he had been dreaming about Leslie, or admitting that he was dreaming about someone murdering her?</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but I wasn\u2019t dreaming about Leslie,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She swallowed, looking at him, her eyes so caring, so concerned.</p><p>\u201cJoe, you were saying something else, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t talk to the dead. I don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m having some major-league nightmares, huh?\u201d he asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cJoe, have you been having these dreams for a long time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs it...me?\u201d she asked, sounding a little ill.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, no!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI would never want to hurt you, Joe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite,\u201d he told her. \u201cI would never hurt you. I would kill someone before I let them hurt you in any way.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face in that special way of hers. He felt as if he were melting.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with me. I\u2019ve wanted you here for...for a while, I admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a dream, do you understand?\u201d he asked passionately. \u201cYou are the best dream, and never a nightmare,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She seemed uncertain for a moment. Then she offered him a dry half smile. \u201cI know I have to be careful because of that big head of yours, but...you really are incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down the length of her back. Sleek. Arousing. Then he turned toward her. Kissed her.</p><p>Made love to her.</p><p>They slept again, and he had no more dreams that night.</p><p>There was something wrong with Joe. She was sure of it, no matter how hard he tried to deny it.</p><p>Over coffee the next morning, Genevieve sat in her den at her desk and mulled over the fact that something was seriously troubling him.</p><p>Something?</p><p>Oh, yeah. Something.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk to dead people. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She started to pick up the phone, hesitated, then set the receiver down again.</p><p>She really was worried.</p><p>Joe cared about her, she was certain. He was still protective, of course, but there was more to it than that. He made love to her with undeniable passion. He teased her, and when she teased him back, he responded with heartfelt laughter.</p><p>But he was having terrible nightmares. The kind that made him tense up like a coiled rattler in the middle of the night. The kind that seemed to grip him in a brutal vise.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t been having them for long. No, only since he\u2019d been sleeping with her.</p><p>That certainly didn\u2019t bode well for a lasting relationship.</p><p>She opened a desk drawer that she had closed a long time ago and hadn\u2019t opened since. It contained the newspaper articles from when she had been kidnapped.</p><p>And rescued.</p><p>There, in one of the pictures, was a man named Adam Harrison. He had come because he had been a friend of Leslie\u2019s. And Leslie had been a psychic. A real psychic.</p><p>She remembered Adam and his firm, Harrison Investigations, from that difficult time. Soft-spoken, reassuring and kind, he had never made her feel fragile, as if people had to walk on eggshells and whisper around her. Her mother also knew Adam, but differently. He, too, had been born wealthy, and they had met in the course of their various philanthropies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She logged on to the Internet and started searching. She found a number of articles about bizarre events that came to an end when Harrison Investigations got involved. There were even hints that the government had called in the company on occasion.</p><p>She found the official Web page for Harrison Investigations, but it made no claims for the group\u2019s ability to communicate with the occult. In fact, it made no claims at all.</p><p>It was simply a page with a \u201ccontact us\u201d form.</p> <p>She hesitated. Then she began to type in who she was...</p><p>And what was happening to Joe in his sleep.</p><p>Joe had made a lunch date with Larry Levine. They met at a sandwich shop within sight of St. Paul\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI read your article on the service this morning,\u201d Joe told Larry.</p><p>Larry smiled, deeply pleased. \u201cIt was good, huh?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. A fine tribute,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cHave you found anything out? Is there anything I can help you with?\u201d Larry asked him anxiously.</p><p>\u201cThat day...the day he died, you were working, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was in the newspaper office all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>All of a sudden, Larry didn\u2019t appear to be so eager to help. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not rich, and I have to work my ass off to make a living.\u201d</p> <p>Joe grinned without humor. \u201cYou work every day of the week, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I need to,\u201d Larry said grimly. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for a hot story. That\u2019s what a reporter does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a book? Have you ever wanted to write a book yourself? Like the kind of tribute to Poe and his life that Thorne wrote?\u201d</p><p>Larry hesitated, staring at him. He reached for the sugar and stirred some into his coffee. \u201cI was the one who suggested to Thorne that he write the book, using a lot of the information we\u2019d discussed at our meetings. You\u2019ve got to understand. We all have real lives\u2014we\u2019re not totally focused on the memory of a doomed poet. But Poe is an arresting subject. He was brilliant, but also sad. His own worst enemy. And did you know that the first reading of \u2018The Raven\u2019 was in Greenwich Village? Anyway...sure, one day I\u2019d like to write a book, maybe about Poe, maybe not. But that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that Thorne wrote a damn good biography of the man. I envied him his talent, sure. But I was at work the entire afternoon he was killed. I was going to attend the same dinner, and that\u2019s why I was at work. I\u2019d screwed around with some friends in from Buffalo on Friday, when I should have been finishing up a few routine articles, so I worked Saturday, instead. And you can check it out.\u201d</p><p>Larry certainly sounded sincere.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on the other folks on the board?\u201d Joe asked him.</p><p>Larry laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be my friends, but...you want it honestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Lila\u2019s place in society and her inheritance allow her to be a blowhard. On top of that, she\u2019s opinionated, and I think she had a crush on Thorne. Thorne, of course, would never have looked twice at her. With his kind of money, he got pretty young things hanging on him all the time. Lou, well, it\u2019s just not in her nature. Barbara is a mouse, but at least she\u2019s a mouse who loves Poe. Eileen? She\u2019s pure class. Mary Vincenzo was only around because of Thorne and Jared. Jared? Rich kid. Brat. Don Tracy likes to hear himself talk and hangs around with the literati so he can get his name in the papers. Brook Avery wants to be a literary giant, but he\u2019s got a long way to go. Nat Halloway is a money man who wants to hang with a more artistic crowd, and because of his connection with Thorne, he was able to do so. Sam Latham? Good man, and I hope he gets out of the hospital soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who killed Thorne, in your opinion?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cLila,\u201d Larry assured him knowingly.</p><p>When Joe left Larry, he had a notebook filled with the names and numbers of people Larry was convinced could assure Joe that he\u2019d been working all day when Thorne had been murdered. And he had a gut feeling\u2014which admittedly didn\u2019t prove anything\u2014that Larry was telling him the truth, at least about his own whereabouts. He wasn\u2019t convinced that Lila had killed Thorne, though. She was far too vocal about accusing Larry, making far too much of a fuss. Guilty people had a tendency to lie low. Lila was doing anything but.</p><p>It was growing late, and Joe found himself wandering the neighborhood. He loved Lower Manhattan, but he hated it, too, for everything he had lost here. Eventually he found himself standing on the sidewalk across the street from one of the area\u2019s prime historic landmarks, Hastings House. Matt had died in an explosion there, and Leslie had almost died at the same time. But she had lived to return to the city, and to Hastings House.</p><p>And then she had died after all, saving Genevieve.</p><p>He stared at the house. It was open to the public, but the last tour of the day was long over. As he stood there, though, the front door opened. To the best of his knowledge, Leslie had been the last one to stay at the restored colonial manor. The tunnels that had led from the house to the old subway line where Genevieve had been held prisoner had been closed. Blasted shut.</p><p>No one should have been there, and in fact, no one was in sight, yet the door had opened.</p><p>He instinctively felt for the concealed gun at his hip and walked across the street.</p><p>The gate to the front walk opened to his touch, though it should have been locked.</p><p>One of the staff could still be there. One of the costumed historians who welcomed tourists could still be working, and the unlocked door could simply have blown open.</p><p>He felt responsible for the house, though God knew why. Perhaps he felt he owed it to Leslie, he thought. Her appreciation for the past was something that had stayed with him.</p><p>And she had loved this house, even after Matt had died here.</p><p>He walked through the gate and headed up the steps.</p><p>The only light inside the house was the red glow of the security lights. He stepped through the doorway and paused. \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d he called out. He walked into the parlor and looked up the stairway. Darkness loomed above him.</p><p>\u201cHey, is anyone here?\u201d he said again.</p><p>He felt as if something brushed his cheek.</p><p>Joe.</p><p>It was just a whisper, so faint that he might almost have imagined it.</p><p>He was crazy. He had imagined it. He was tempted to go running from the house, screaming.</p><p>Hardly a macho thing to do.</p><p>Did he think of himself as macho?</p><p>No, but he\u2019d never thought of himself as an overimaginative coward, either.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is in here?\u201d he called out angrily.</p><p>Joe, it\u2019s all right. Just learn to listen.</p><p>There was a scurrying sound from the kitchen. He forced himself to walk toward it, though every instinct in him was screaming to get away. \u201cWho the hell are you? Show yourself now,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He heard the sound again.</p><p>Great. What the hell was he going to find? A ghostly figure, draped in white, floating above the ground?</p><p>He felt a brush of air again. It wasn\u2019t a cold breath but something warm, almost alive. Almost...tender. Joe, go easy. Please, Joe.</p><p>He kept himself under tight control and strode into the kitchen. While the rest of the house was furnished according to the period, the kitchen featured every modern convenience. He heard the scurrying sound again, and his hand tightened on the butt of his gun.</p><p>No, Joe...it\u2019s all right, the voice said.</p><p>But the voice and the scurrying weren\u2019t coming from the same place.</p><p>Something started to move. A shadow rising.</p><p>Joe, it\u2019s just a kid.</p><p>Then the shadow itself cried out, it\u2019s voice clearly young. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cShow yourself!\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>The shadow stood up by the refrigerator, and in the red security light he saw that it was a teenaged girl. She had tousled blond hair and a face that was pinched with hunger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot me! Please don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d</p><p>He let out the breath he hadn\u2019t realized he was holding. He\u2019d never been so relieved in his life. She was real. She was flesh and blood.</p><p>Except that...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d been whispering to him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, and what are you doing in here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect the response he got. The girl burst into tears and came running toward him, then threw herself against him. \u201cI\u2019m so scared!\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s all right,\u201d he said awkwardly. He drew away from her and realized that she must be a runaway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebbie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDebbie what?\u201d he pursued.</p><p>\u201cSmith,\u201d she said.</p><p>He almost laughed out loud. She was making it up.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Debbie...Smith, why are you so scared? And what are you doing in this house?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI...slipped in before they locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you left the door open,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She looked at him, shaking her head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, hang on,\u201d he said, and pulled out his phone, thinking he should call the police. But he didn\u2019t. He hesitated, and then he called Genevieve, instead.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d She sounded relieved to hear from him, but also uneasy. He wondered why, but there wasn\u2019t time now to ask her. \u201cGen, I, uh, I think I have need of your prowess as a social worker,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said, clearly curious. \u201cJoe, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHastings House,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cHastings House?\u201d She sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cThe door was open,\u201d he explained, leaving out the how of it. \u201cAnd I found a young...lady named Debbie Smith hiding inside, and now I\u2019m not sure what to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come down there right away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d He didn\u2019t want her going out alone, especially at night. In fact, he didn\u2019t want her going out alone at all, he realized, an opinion she would not appreciate.</p><p>\u201cFine. Come by and pick me up, then. You can bring her with you. I\u2019ll stand right by the doorman until you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d Then he hung up and looked at the girl, who looked eerie in the strange red light.</p> <p>\u201cYou...you won\u2019t call the police on me, will you?\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But let\u2019s get out of here and go see a friend of mine. I\u2019ll have to call someone to come lock this place up for the night,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t close the door as they left, but it closed behind him, and he heard a lock slide into place.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d the girl said, jumping.</p><p>\u201cIt must lock automatically,\u201d Joe said, glad not to have to call someone and try to explain what the hell he had been doing there. He led her down the front walk, and when they stepped out onto the sidewalk, the gate closed behind them, as well.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave me here, are you?\u201d Debbie asked, panic in her tone.</p><p>\u201cNo, I told you, we\u2019re going to see a friend of mine. She\u2019ll know what to do,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>The traffic was bad once they picked up his car, and Joe chafed at the thought of Genevieve standing out on the street, even with her doorman. He knew he was being paranoid, but he couldn\u2019t escape his dreams.</p><p>Nor the fear that his own sense of insanity seemed to be growing worse.</p><p>The girl at his side was silent. He realized that he wasn\u2019t helping matters, but he wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cSo, Debbie...where are you from?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>She stared at him as if he had just threatened her with torture. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. Like \u201cSmith,\u201d he knew it was a lie.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLet me try this one. What\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been staring straight ahead, but she looked at him then. \u201cAt this moment? Anything not out of a Dumpster,\u201d she told him, and he knew that, at least, was honest.</p><p>His nerves felt totally stretched by the time he finally pulled up in front of Genevieve\u2019s apartment, and then he was afraid he would snap like a bowstring from the tremendous sense of relief he felt when he saw her there, chatting with Mac, the doorman. She ran up to the car and hopped into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said cheerfully to Debbie. \u201cI\u2019m Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebbie,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d Joe asked, looking at Genevieve in the rearview mirror.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cO\u2019Malley\u2019s, of course.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and a few minutes later he let the two of them off in front of the pub and went in search of a parking space. Luckily, he found a place in a lot a block or so away. He made his way back as quickly as he could and found that Genevieve and Debbie were playing darts with his two favorite old timers, Angus MacHenry and Paddy O\u2019Leary, and had claimed a nearby booth as their own.</p> <p>\u201cJoseph Connolly, that took ye long enough,\u201d Paddy told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not as young as I used to be,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cWell, this young \u2019un is a pip at darts,\u201d Angus said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s a Douglas. A nice Scottish lass.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Genevieve, who shrugged and gave him a little grin. \u201cA Douglas from Philadelphia,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>To his surprise, Debbie walked over to him and gave him a quick hug, then looked at him with embarrassment.</p><p>He smiled at her, trying not to look as awkward as he felt. \u201cPhilly, hmm?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, then threw her next dart.</p><p>\u201cGood shot,\u201d Genevieve said encouragingly.</p><p>Joe watched as Angus challenged Debbie to a head-to-head match, and she replied with a laugh and a promise to best him.</p><p>\u201cRunaway?\u201d he whispered to Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cYes. But we\u2019ve called her parents. They\u2019re on their way.\u201d She turned to him, speaking softly. \u201cShe came up here with some older friends, who wound up leaving her on her own a few days ago when they decided to get warm and cuddly with a couple of druggies. There were some toughs on the street, and she got scared, so she ran into Hastings House. Luckily, they weren\u2019t able to follow her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t able to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Genevieve shrugged. \u201cStrange, huh?\u201d she said, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange?\u201d he asked, feeling as if he were choking.</p><p>\u201cWhen she was running, the gate and the door both opened. But as soon as she was inside, they both closed. And locked.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, staring at Genevieve. \u201cNo. They must have just decided to let her go. When I was on the street, both the gate and the door were open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Genevieve said, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe security system must be going haywire,\u201d he heard himself say.</p><p>\u201cHaywire,\u201d she echoed, but it didn\u2019t really sound as if she were agreeing with him.</p><p>\u201cWas everything all right with you today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She nodded and smiled. \u201cGreat. How did it go with Larry Levine?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI believe him,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo...we\u2019re not getting anywhere,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGen, you know as well as I do that finding out the truth can take a long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, biting her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cHamburgers coming up!\u201d Bridget, their waitress of a few nights back, called as she made her way through the crowd milling near the bar. Debbie all but clapped her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d she said fervently.</p><p>Angus punched Joe lightly on the arm. \u201cThank ye kindly, Joe. Gen said you\u2019d be buying tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Joe said, and laughed, then watched as Angus, Paddy and Debbie made themselves comfortable in the booth and started reaching for the ketchup and mustard.</p><p>\u201cYou did a good thing tonight, Joe,\u201d Gen told him.</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebbie just got in with a wrong crowd. She\u2019s been here five days. Her parents reported her missing, but...well, you know how that goes. Anyway, if you\u2019d called the police, it might have gotten complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then...I\u2019m glad I called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. So, do you want a hamburger, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll just go with the flow,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned and started toward the bar to find Bridget and put in his food order. He slid in beside Angus on the banquette.</p><p>\u201cDid ye hear about the way the old house welcomed the girl?\u201d Paddy asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Debbie looked at him. She was a pretty kid, with warm brown eyes. \u201cThat house saved me tonight,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cWell, you did, too, of course. But it was really weird, the way the house just let me in when I needed to get away from those guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity system,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t even believe that himself.</p><p>Because he\u2019d heard her.</p><p>That night, he\u2019d heard Leslie whisper to him, trying to make sure he knew Debbie wasn\u2019t a criminal, that he didn\u2019t shoot her.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t escape the sense that she\u2019d been trying to tell him something else, as well.</p><p>He gritted his teeth. Hard. \u201cSecurity system,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Debbie looked at him. \u201cThe house saved me,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cIt really did.\u201d</p><p>Hastings House, he thought. The place where Matt had died. The entry to the tunnel and the room where Leslie had died, where Genevieve had been kept prisoner.</p><p>The place was damned, he decided.</p><p>But not, he insisted to himself, haunted.</p><p>A moment later Genevieve came back and slipped into the booth next to him.</p><p>\u201cJust how old is she?\u201d Joe asked, indicating Debbie, who had finished her burger and gotten up to play darts again.</p><p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a kid,\u201d he said.</p><p>Genevieve arched a brow at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had to look for enough missing kids. Debbie is lucky, and you know it. Most of the time, a kid of fifteen, she\u2019s already on drugs. Then she\u2019s hooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s Candy Cane,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Genevieve said, studying him. \u201cHave you heard from her yet?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go back over tomorrow,\u201d he told her.</p><p>A few hours later, Debbie\u2019s parents walked in. There were a lot of tears as they embraced their daughter, then thanked Joe and Genevieve.</p><p>A few minutes later, when it was time to leave, Debbie gave Genevieve a long hug. After that, she walked over to Joe and looked at him solemnly. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cStick with the folks, huh?\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem like nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She hesitated, then whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s not my father. He married my mom. They have a new baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey still love you.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cLook, I know I was a jerk. I just thought it would be cool to see New York. And...I know this is gonna sound weird, but I think that house used me to get to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDebbie, it\u2019s just a house.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him gravely. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not just a house. That house...it breathes. It\u2019s like it has a heartbeat. Honest. It\u2019s not evil, though. I\u2019m telling you, it saved me. But it wanted you.\u201d</p><p>He felt a slight tremor shoot through him. There was a kid in front of him\u2014a kid\u2014telling him that Hastings House was...alive.</p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p>She had been scared, traumatized, that was all, and she was seeing things as spooky and chilling, when there was undoubtedly a perfectly logical explanation.</p><p>As soon Debbie had left with her parents, Joe decided that he needed a beer.</p><p>Later, he drove back to Genevieve\u2019s.</p><p>He pretended exhaustion. He couldn\u2019t help it. There was a whisper in his ear, and that whisper was Leslie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when he fell asleep, he dreamed again. And in his dream, Genevieve was walking toward him. They were on a beach, or maybe they were in the clouds. She was wearing something light that trailed behind her in the breeze. She was smiling, her expression radiant. Her hair whipped behind her like auburn silk.</p><p>And her eyes...</p><p>Her eyes were that endless blue.</p> <p>She smiled, excited, as if she were expecting something...something good.</p><p>Then the bruises began to appear on her throat, and her eyes widened and began to bulge as she stared at him, choking, gasping for breath.</p><p>He heard her whisper, Help me. Please, help me, and he woke with a start, bolting upright in the bed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wake her, though. Genevieve was asleep at his side in a soft yellow tank top and ladies\u2019 boxers, breathing easily. The light filtering in from beyond the drawn curtains played brilliant fire tricks with her hair.</p><p>He lay back down, convinced he really was losing his mind, then jerked into a sitting position again.</p> <p>Debbie had claimed that Hastings House seemed to breathe. That it had a heartbeat. That it had tried to save her.</p><p>And the house\u2014or someone in it\u2014had whispered to him.</p><p>Dead people whispered to him.</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling, teeth clenched. No. He didn\u2019t want to talk to ghosts. He didn\u2019t want to listen to dead people and he damned well didn\u2019t want to believe that a house could be haunted, much less alive.</p><p>Suddenly he was afraid, but not for himself. For Genevieve.</p><p>Afraid that his dreams meant something, that she was in danger.</p> <p>He perched on one elbow and watched her sleep, wanting to touch her, not wanting to awaken her.</p><p>But her eyelids fluttered suddenly, as if she sensed him, sensed his concern, even in the depths of her sleep.</p><p>Her eyes opened, and she caught him studying her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, and started to sit up.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just watching you,\u201d he said, knowing it was both a lie and the truth.</p><p>She reached up and touched his face in that special way of hers. Then her knuckles brushed down over his chest, and the next thing he knew, she was pushing him down against the mattress and straddling him. When he would have touched her in return, she whispered a soft but commanding, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She bent and quickly brushed her lips against his.</p><p>Then she teased his chest with her kiss and the silky caress of her hair.</p><p>Finally she moved lower, but not until he was so aroused that he couldn\u2019t stand it did she allow him to reach for her, lift her and bring her back down on his erection. He felt as if the world exploded along with him as he entered her.</p><p>Later she slept again, and he lay beside her knowing that he had kept the truth from her. That she didn\u2019t know he was crazy. That he had gone to Hastings House and heard the whisper of the woman with whom he\u2019d once been falling in love.</p><p>Leslie.</p><p>A dead woman.</p><p>And Gen didn\u2019t know that he kept seeing her eyes as the life was choked out of her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know that the man she was depending on was slowly losing his mind.</p><p>In the morning, he left before she woke up.</p><p>He was suddenly anxious, because Lori Star had never contacted him.</p><p>At Lori\u2019s apartment, he once again got no response to his knocking. Before he could move on to Susie\u2019s place, her door opened and she came out to speak to him. She was clearly distressed. \u201cI was going to call you today. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think Lori ever came home.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her since Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t know what to do. I mean, I\u2019m not her next of kin or anything. And I always heard that a person had to be missing for forty-eight hours before anyone could fill out a missing-persons report, but I don\u2019t even know if she is a missing person. Oh, God, I\u2019m so upset. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. But it\u2019s definitely time to fill out a missing-persons report. I\u2019ll go down to the police station with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice station?\u201d she said, and cleared her throat. \u201cUm, Mr. Connolly, you should know...I\u2019ve been arrested before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to go down to the station with him, he quickly realized, so he put through a call to Raif.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Missing Persons,\u201d Raif told him.</p><p>\u201cRaif, this is the woman who was on television after that pileup on the FDR, saying she was psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk to Traffic,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cRaif, dammit, Sam Latham was in that accident. It might be connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it might not!\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Joe held his temper. \u201cSo do you have any answers on the Thorne Bigelow murder yet?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raif admitted after a moment, then sighed. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll get someone from Missing Persons and come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get into the apartment,\u201d Joe added.</p><p>\u201cAsk her friend if she has a key,\u201d Raif told him. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s supposed to water the plants or something like that.\u201d</p><p>Raif turned to Susie. \u201cDo you have a key to the apartment?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head, and Joe went back to his call.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a missing person, Raif. Can\u2019t we get a warrant on probable cause to find out if she happens to be lying dead inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Raif said. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Eventually Raif showed up with, as promised, an officer from Missing Persons. Susie did her best to answer all the necessary questions, but it was difficult. If Lori had living parents or other family, Susie had never met them. She didn\u2019t even know if Lori Star was her real name.</p><p>While the officer worked with Susie, Raif, who had the warrant in his pocket, entered the apartment. Joe followed him in without asking permission.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing out of order,\u201d Raif said. He sighed, turning to Joe. \u201cLook, I know you thought there was something believable about her, but...the woman is a prostitute. Who knows? She wasn\u2019t bad-looking. Maybe she found someone she could, um, \u2018work\u2019 for a while. Maybe she\u2019s shacked up in a motel somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave with any of her belongings, not according to what Susie told us,\u201d Joe said. \u201cShe went \u2018to see a man about a horse.\u2019 It sounds to me like she went out to meet someone, and that it didn\u2019t go very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that,\u201d Raif argued, \u201cor she went to meet someone and it went very well. Didn\u2019t you see Pretty Woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaif, are you serious?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, but...I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Joe looked through Lori Star\u2019s apartment, but try as he might, he couldn\u2019t see anything out of order, either. Nor had she left a note of her destination scribbled down on her phone pad.</p><p>\u201cCan you trace her phone records, at least?\u201d Joe asked Raif.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get someone on it,\u201d Raif promised.</p><p>At last, with nothing else to do, Joe left, still entirely frustrated.</p><p>But as he left Lori\u2019s apartment, he thought of the first time Genevieve had come to him about Thorne Bigelow\u2019s murder.</p><p>Quoth the raven: die.</p><p>New York City hadn\u2019t been especially good to Poe. The man had been self-destructive, true, but he had come to New York to make his fortune. In the end, the city hadn\u2019t afforded him the fame he had craved, much less any riches. Down and out, he had left the city to take a job in Philadelphia.</p><p>After he had left the city, a murder had occurred, that of Mary Rogers, known in the papers of the day as the beautiful cigar girl. She had disappeared on a Sunday.</p><p>Just like Lori Star.</p><p>Mary had left her home of her own free will.</p><p>Just like Lori Star.</p><p>Suddenly a sense of panic seized him, and he was desperate to see Genevieve, to make sure she was all right. He raced to her building, gave his name to the security guard and was cleared to go up. She met him at her door, an anxious look on her face.</p><p>\u201cJoe, what is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLori Star never came home,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He barely noticed that she returned to the phone on the counter and told someone, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call the police about her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He met her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to my apartment,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He felt some of the tension easing out of him.</p><p>Genevieve was fine. There was no reason for him to keep feeling this awful sense of panic.</p><p>\u201cJoe, what\u2019s going on with you? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just...an uneasy time,\u201d he said, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy until we find Thorne Bigelow\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and nodded, but she knew there was more to what was bothering him than that. But arguing with him wasn\u2019t going to get her anywhere.</p><p>He tried to keep things light as they drove out to Brooklyn. He asked her about Eileen, making sure she was keeping in regular touch with her mother.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Genevieve asked him when they got to his place.</p><p>\u201cI live here,\u201d he said as lightly as he could.</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant what are we going to do while we\u2019re here? What are we looking for?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThis may be really farfetched and stupid,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s suppose that someone really is reenacting Poe\u2019s work with real victims. Thorne was the first victim. And Sam...maybe that was intentional, too, or maybe the killer just saw a convenient chance and took it. But if the two are connected, the murderer must have been scared shi\u2014alarmed when Lori Star started getting attention from the media.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven if they\u2019re not connected, Lori Star\u2019s certainty that she knew what happened on the highway might have disturbed someone,\u201d Genevieve pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s dead, don\u2019t you?\u201d Genevieve asked him.</p> <p>He started to deny it, but then he met her eyes and tried not to turn away. Tried not to imagine her being strangled, even though the vision haunted him night after night.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd...you think all three deaths are connected, don\u2019t you? Even though you\u2019re the one who told me that Poe\u2019s characters never committed vehicular homicide?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted flatly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what are we doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cResearch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn...?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Mystery of Marie Roget.\u2019 You take the story itself. I\u2019ll look up what really happened.\u201d</p><p>She looked skeptical, but she accepted his collection of Poe stories, while he turned to his computer. They worked in companionable silence for a while.</p><p>The Internet was full of leads, but also sent him from page to page following them up. He made notes as he went.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a forword to the story in your book, you know,\u201d Genevieve said. She had curled into the extra chair in his office.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was originally published in three segments. Poe probably knew the real girl, but he was living in Philadelphia when she was killed. He thought the story would put him on the literary map. He was convinced that the girl\u2019s first disappearance\u2014she had disappeared for several days a few years before her murder, then reappeared\u2014had something to do with her death. He had planned on making the murderer a Navy man, but then they discovered that she might have gone for an abortion, and that she might have died in a house in New Jersey, a small inn of sorts, owned by a woman named Loss who had three sons. They thought the sons might have tried to dispose of Mary\u2019s body. No one ever went to trial and, according to this preface, no one ever discovered the truth of her death. Poe altered his story before the final segment was published so it would agree with the latest facts in the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen her body was first found,\u201d Joe said, studying his monitor, \u201cthe coroner noted that she\u2019d been strangled. That there were bruises around her throat, and a piece of her torn dress was so tightly tied around her neck that it was embedded in the flesh.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Genevieve. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Mary Rogers died because of a botched abortion, though that might have been what sent her to New Jersey. I believe the coroner\u2019s initial report was right and she was strangled. But what I believe isn\u2019t important. What matters is that I think the murderer also believes that she was strangled. And that he acted on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, we don\u2019t even know for sure that Lori\u2019s dead, much less how she died,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a ride over to New Jersey,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find her in New Jersey?\u201d she asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cHer body will turn up in New Jersey,\u201d he said with complete certainty.</p> <p>Just then his cell phone started to ring. He answered it with a brief, \u201cConnolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, it\u2019s Raif.\u201d</p><p>His friend sounded strange, Joe thought, and asked, \u201cWhat is it? Have you found something?\u201d</p><p>He could hear the deep breath Raif took before answering.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found her body.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was staring at him, frowning intently.</p><p>\u201cLori Star?\u201d Joe asked, though he didn\u2019t really need to. He knew that it was her. And he could make an educated guess as to what condition they\u2019d found her in, too.</p><p>\u201cYeah, or so it seems. It\u2019s in pretty bad shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found it in the river on the New Jersey side, right?\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Raif demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read \u2018The Mystery of Marie Roget,\u2019\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, hell, a Poe story, right? Shit. I\u2019m going to have to brush up on my reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a real murder, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Raif said. \u201cJust what we need.\u201d Joe could see Raif in his mind\u2019s eye, sitting in the passenger seat and talking on the phone while Tom drove.</p><p>To Jersey?</p><p>\u201cSo this murder winds up in the hands of the New Jersey police, huh?\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the lead detective isn\u2019t a bad guy. I told him I had an interest, which he understood. I explained that we\u2019re all looking at a connection between Lori Star and our other vics. Folks can be territorial in law enforcement, but not usually stupid, so we\u2019re welcome to be in on it.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cCan I tag along?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you,\u201d Raif said. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way over to Jersey now.\u201d</p><p>Bingo, Joe thought. \u201cTell me where I\u2019m going and I\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d he said.</p><p>INTERLUDE</p><p>It\u2019s so damned hard, being a ghost. Trying to communicate.</p><p>It\u2019s just human nature, I suppose. We so badly want to know what lies beyond the world in which we live and breathe, but we\u2019re also terrified of that knowledge. It\u2019s so much easier to opt for denial, to pretend that we\u2019re immortal. That other people die, not us.</p><p>Even people with tremendous courage, the ones who will fight to the death for a cause, who will run into burning buildings to rescue others in danger, find something frightening about examining what lies beyond the veil.</p><p>What the living don\u2019t know is that sometimes, when you\u2019re very lucky, there is someone waiting there on the other side to help.</p><p>Matt says it\u2019s wrong to bring anyone into Hastings House, where I\u2019m at my best. And he keeps trying to help me leave. But the two of them came by, and I had to help. The thing is, both of them knew.</p><p>Well, at least I was able to help that girl. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Helping.</p><p>I\u2019m worried about Genevieve, though. I don\u2019t want to see her die, but I think someone else does.</p><p>We know what\u2019s happening in the world, Matt and I. He\u2019s figured out how to turn on the TV, and sometimes I can do it, too. A lot of the time we don\u2019t need to make that effort\u2014and trust me, it really is an effort\u2014though. The docents have it on a lot during the day anyway, and they leave newspapers lying around all the time, so we keep up with what\u2019s going on.</p><p>That\u2019s why Matt decided we had to try to get out beyond Hastings House and try to touch others. To help them.</p><p>It was exhausting. I seem to be able to move easily enough through the subway tunnels. I can even connect to the PATH train and get over to New Jersey. But outside of the tunnels...</p><p>It had to be done, though. We followed the tunnel under the Hudson, and then we went outside and started looking for her. I kept feeling myself fading, but Matt held on to me, and somehow kept me going. Kept me, well, alive, for lack of a better word.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy, but we did it. We found her.</p><p>We found Lori Star, and she was still so scared, so lost. And what she had to tell us...</p><p>Well, it helped. And then again...</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Genevieve was more disturbed than she had expected to find out for certain that Lori Star was dead.</p><p>The victim of a murderer.</p><p>Possibly\u2014no, probably\u2014the victim of the same killer who had murdered Thorne Bigelow.</p><p>She was certain that no one other than Joe and herself would instantly make that assumption. But Joe had known. He had known, before Lori was found, that she had been killed. And he had seemed to know that she would be found in New Jersey, as well.</p><p>She knew that he wasn\u2019t going to take her with him to meet with the police. His own position was going to be tenuous enough; he was just lucky that Raif was on his side, and Raif was lucky that the New Jersey homicide officers were willing to accept that there might be a connection to Thorne Bigelow\u2019s death and let the New York cops in on the case.</p><p>She was actually glad that she wouldn\u2019t have to come up with an excuse to get away from him that afternoon. She hadn\u2019t known how she was going to manage the feat, since he had been getting more and more adamant that she not go anywhere without him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mind that Joe was so determined to be with her, but she did mind that he continually seemed not just preoccupied but so...</p><p>Haunted.</p><p>She was worried about him. He had been so strange last night.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you keep in touch with me,\u201d she told him when he brought her back to her apartment. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you stay here. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around,\u201d she swore.</p><p>And she would be. Just not exactly at home.</p><p>Shortly after he left, she got the call she\u2019d been expecting from Adam Harrison. He had gotten her message, he said, and had arrived in town, where he would be happy to meet with her at her convenience. She asked him to come right over.</p><p>She felt that she knew him fairly well. He had been there when she was brought back into the light of day. And he had been at Leslie\u2019s funeral. She knew that Joe had also gotten to know him when Adam had come to New York City to help Leslie deal with her ghostly communications when Genevieve had still been a prisoner far beneath the ground in the abandoned subway tunnel.</p><p>Adam Harrison was regal and dignified, despite his advancing age. He was a tall man, slender, with snow-white hair and kind eyes that looked out on the world without judgment. Probably the best thing about him was his ability to listen without distraction.</p><p>He greeted her like a distant uncle, with warmth, but without presumption. He held her at arm\u2019s length for long seconds, studying her with discerning eyes before commending her on how well she looked.</p><p>She made tea and asked him about the weather in Virginia, and then about Brent and Nikki Blackhawk, the employees who had been with him in New York. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He asked about her mother.</p><p>And then they were seated together at the table and she couldn\u2019t quite start speaking.</p><p>He laid his hand gently over hers and looked at her encouragingly.</p> <p>She inhaled deeply, then plunged in. \u201cHave you ever heard of a man named Thorne Bigelow?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYes, actually. He wrote an excellent book about Poe,\u201d he responded. \u201cAnd he was murdered recently.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and he waited patiently for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cThere was a society. The New York Poe Society\u2014it still exists\u2014and the members are known as Ravens. He and my mother are both on the board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Adam murmured, and leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m going to take it that you hired Joe to work the case. Because your mother is a Raven and you\u2019re worried about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me what else has happened that has you so worried,\u201d he said.</p><p>She told him all she knew about Thorne Bigelow\u2019s murder, the accident on the highway, the disappearance of Lori Star\u2014and the very recent discovery of her body. He listened gravely.</p><p>\u201cDo the police seem competent?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cThe lead detectives on the case are friends of Joe,\u201d she said, then shrugged. \u201cAnd he seems to think they\u2019re more than competent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that my agency deals with the occult.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that you\u2019ve seen a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, then frowned, remembering the night she had dreamed she was someone else. When she had awakened and found that Joe had also had a strange dream.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, I can\u2019t help you if don\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled wistfully. \u201cYou know, Adam, I wanted to see a ghost. I even made myself think I saw one, at the cemetery, a year ago. I wanted to believe I saw Matt and Leslie, arm in arm, disappearing over a rise together. I wanted to believe that it was okay. I mean, don\u2019t you think that happens a lot of the time? We see and hear what we want to? We believe what we want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it this way,\u201d he answered. \u201cI know that our energy goes somewhere when we die, and that some people can see that energy. But you called me for a reason. Would you like to tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Joe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think something\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has he said to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...strange. It\u2019s as if...I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to explain any of it. But it all started...\u201d She hesitated, thinking back. \u201cIt all started when he was supposed to meet me at the museum. It was a fund-raiser in Leslie\u2019s honor, actually,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He nodded, and she went on.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up. When I called him, he was down at O\u2019Malley\u2019s. He said that he hadn\u2019t been able to get to the museum because of the traffic. There was this really bad accident on the FDR. He pulled a little girl out of a car. And Sam Latham, another Raven\u2014another member of the board\u2014was hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone killed in the accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The little girl\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Adam said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThen...last night he was at Hastings House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam said, his attention sharpening.</p><p>\u201cHe said he was just in the area and the house was open. So he went in and found a teenage girl hiding inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving, I hope?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but she was strange, too. She said the house saved her. She was being chased by some thugs, and she said the house...let her in. That it saved her. And then Joe was so strange after that. I kept thinking he must have been remembering Leslie. I tried to leave him alone, even later, when\u2014Even later.\u201d</p><p>A slight smile played across his lips. \u201cSo...you and Joe are together?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised at how easily she blushed. \u201cFor now, anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that maybe he just feels overly protective of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re overly protective,\u201d Adam said gently, \u201cyou sleep on a sofa. And that wasn\u2019t a sleeping-on-the-sofa blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid that he\u2019s in love with a ghost, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Adam asked her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to accept that there really were ghosts, so she said, \u201cI think a man can easily be in love with a memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemories tend to be golden,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAdam, Joe isn\u2019t the type to admit he sees ghosts,\u201d she said. \u201cBut from the way he reacted to what that girl said, I think maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Or what he thinks is happening, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019ve called me, does he?\u201d</p><p>She flushed again, shaking her head.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll see me anyway. Out of respect, if nothing else. I was a close friend of Leslie\u2019s, and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you...can you help, do you think?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when he was quiet for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI think that if Joe is seeing ghosts, one of them\u2014maybe Leslie\u2014is trying to tell him something,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was surprised at the misery she felt. They needed all the help they could get, so this was hardly the time to be jealous.</p><p>Especially of a ghost.</p><p>\u201cIs, um, that the way it usually works?\u201d she asked, and she could tell that her voice sounded distant.</p><p>\u201cLook, you hired Joe because you were worried, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou also hired him because you wanted him around.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head.</p><p>He touched her hand again. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m pretty sure Joe wanted to be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and looked at Adam curiously. \u201cSo how does it usually work? Do you...just walk down the street and see ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t have a gift of any kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you\u2019re the Harrison in Harrison Investigations,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stood, hands behind his back, and wandered to the window to look down at the street. \u201cI had a son...who is gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He\u2019s been gone a long time. But before he died, he did have a gift. He knew what was going to happen. And he knew he wasn\u2019t long for this world. He actually told me when he would die, what would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really leave,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>She kept smiling, but Adam Harrison could see right through her.</p><p>\u201cThe souls of those we love do linger sometimes. When they need to,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhen they need to?\u201d she repeated questioningly.</p><p>\u201cSometimes they just need to understand what happened to them. Sometimes they\u2019re lost. And other times it\u2019s as if they have a mission, something they have to do, someone they have to save.\u201d He paused, looking at her. \u201cLeslie MacIntyre had an exceptional gift. She helped so many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many of the dead?\u201d Genevieve asked. She had always liked to believe that her mind was open. She had even liked to believe that the souls of the departed were real, that in giving up her own life, Leslie MacIntyre had found eternity with her beloved Matt.</p><p>But now...</p><p>She just felt crazy. And a little scared.</p><p>What the hell was Joe going to say? She had called in the ghost hunters to save him.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Adam said lightly, \u201cthe gift seems to pass from one person to the next. After death,\u201d he added very softly.</p><p>Chills shot down her spine.</p><p>\u201cThen Joe might have...inherited Leslie\u2019s gift, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and sat down again, looking at her. \u201cMaybe Joe. Maybe you. Maybe both of you. I don\u2019t really know. There are no real rules that I know of, and there\u2019s certainly no manual.\u201d</p><p>Another chill shot through her. She shouldn\u2019t have called this man. Everything he said was just upsetting her more, not to mention how upset Joe was going to be with her.</p><p>As if he\u2019d read her mind, Adam said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, please. I really am friendly with Joe Connolly. He\u2019s not going to think it\u2019s all that strange to see me. I\u2019ll have to call in a few more people, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost hunters?\u201d she asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Joe is already acquainted with a few my \u2018ghost hunters,\u2019 as you call them. He likes Brent and Nikki, and so will you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met them. He\u2019s Native American, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThe other half is Irish. He\u2019ll fit right in at O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he was teasing or not. \u201cI don\u2019t think Joe is going to like any of this at all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re wrong, but either way, he needs it,\u201d Adam said firmly.</p><p>Her stomach had been fluttering, but now, as he looked at her, she was satisfied that she had done the only thing she could have. And that it was the right thing.</p><p>\u201cWe do have to get to the bottom of this,\u201d he said.</p><p>His expression was grave, and she suddenly wondered if she was in any personal danger.</p><p>Maybe she should have just stayed the hell out of it.</p><p>No. She couldn\u2019t have. She cared too much about Joe for that. But she was afraid, she realized.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a Raven, though, so shouldn\u2019t that mean she was safe, if they were right and the Poe Killer really was going after members of the society, not just trying to cover his tracks? But Lori Star hadn\u2019t been a Raven, either. She had simply been a young woman who had connected herself to the case because she\u2019d experienced something strange and told her story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, Gen thought, as a shudder rippled through her, much the same could be said of her. She\u2019d chosen to connect herself to the case, too.</p><p>There were certainly no obvious similarities between Marie Rogers\u2019 death in the eighteen-forties and the situation Joe found when he reached New Jersey.</p><p>He met Raif and Tom first, and they briefed him as they arrived at the mortuary, where the body had already been taken.</p> <p>\u201cThe corpse was dragged out of the river about an hour and a half before I spoke to you,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in the water some time,\u201d Tom told him.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, she isn\u2019t very pretty,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cWater really does a number on a body. Even after only a few days,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Joe knew that already. \u201cCause of death?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like strangulation,\u201d Raif told him. \u201cThough they won\u2019t know for sure until they finish the autopsy. We should be just in time for it to start. They\u2019re rushing it, just in case there\u2019s a connection to the Bigelow case,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me in on this,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAny trouble with the Jersey boys? Over me, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Vic says you\u2019ve worked with him before,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>Vic? It had to be Victor Nelson. He would be about fifty now, and he had apparently moved from Vice to Murder. Years ago, Joe had been hired to find a missing teenager. She\u2019d been living in a crack house in Jersey City. When he\u2019d found the girl, he\u2019d helped the cops\u2014including Victor Nelson\u2014close down the house, and as a bonus, they\u2019d broken up a gun ring that had been based there, too.</p><p>Victor Nelson greeted Joe and the others civilly inside one of the autopsy rooms. The doctor on duty was a man named Ben Sears. He nodded in acknowledgment as they came in, then got started.</p><p>Lori Star\u2019s skin was mottled, discolored, and her flesh gnawed. Fish and river creatures had already been busy, mostly on her extremities.</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see the bruises on her throat when she was wet,\u201d Victor said. He was a gruff man, a good, steady cop. His looked a little green around the gills, though, and Joe thought it was good to see that, even after all these years, the autopsy of a murder victim still bothered him.</p><p>The coroner explained that the bruises had appeared as the skin had dried out.</p><p>They were deep blue and black, forming a horrible necklace around the woman\u2019s throat, just like in Joe\u2019s dreams. Except that in his dreams...</p><p>They had been around Genevieve\u2019s throat.</p><p>He swallowed hard as he felt bile rise in the back of his throat. He\u2019d been to too many autopsies to get sick at one now. But if he were ever going to...</p><p>This would be the one.</p><p>Or was he only queasy because he had looked at the corpse\u2019s face and seen another? A face he knew intimately. Stared not into Lori\u2019s eyes but into Gen\u2019s. Eyes that he couldn\u2019t help thinking were staring back at him accusingly.</p><p>He found himself thinking back to a passage he had read online that morning.</p> <p>July 28th, 1841. A group of young men out for a casual walk along the shoreline of the Hudson River, on the New Jersey side, in an area of Hoboken known as Sybil\u2019s Cave, a place where people often come to escape the busy, hectic crowding of New York City, came across what appeared to be a mass of clothing in the water. When the young men hurriedly took a boat from a nearby dock and went to investigate, they discovered that what they had taken for clothing was really the body of a young woman. Her face seemed to have been severely battered. She was a terrible spectacle to behold.</p><p>They would never have associated the decomposing corpse drawn from the river with the missing girl who had been regaled by an entire city for her sheer loveliness.</p><p>Joe swallowed hard and forced himself to stare at Lori\u2019s ravaged face.</p><p>No one would readily associate this corpse with someone who had once been young and pretty.</p><p>There was no way that Lori Star was looking at him. It was difficult even to see where her eyes should be.</p><p>Ben Sears spoke in a clear, emotionless voice, directing his words to the microphone that hung down above the body as he worked on it. The corpse had already been photographed, washed and laid out for him. Additional pictures were being taken by a police photographer as Sears pointed out injuries done to the flesh, asking for close-ups.</p><p>\u201cMarks at the neck suggest manual strangulation. There is also a strip of lace, apparently from the young woman\u2019s blouse, that was tied around the neck so tightly that it sank into the flesh, even before postmortem swelling due to immersion. The pattern of bruising suggests that the killer is right-handed.\u201d</p><p>His voice droned on as he commented on the fact that the physical damage inflicted by her assailant appeared to be mainly to her face and head. The decomposition and damage done elsewhere on the body appeared to have been from her days in the river.</p><p>Joe stood by silently while the chest was opened and Sears stated firmly that strangulation was the cause of death, not drowning.</p><p>Organs were weighed.</p><p>Specimens were taken.</p><p>In the back of his mind, Joe was aware of the constant gurgle of running water washing away the fluids that leaked from the body as the medical examiner went about his work.</p><p>Scrapings taken from under the nails suggested that the victim had lacked the chance to fight back against her attacker, and ligature marks on the wrists suggested that her hands had been bound. Damage to the sexual organs was postmortem and possibly due to the depradations of the river creatures.</p><p>Sears ended the autopsy by asking his assistants to sew the body back up, and telling the microphone above the corpse that further comments on the death would come after he received the lab work on various samples he had taken.</p><p>Joe realized, looking at the cops assembled around the stainless-steel autopsy table, that the procedure had seemed to affect them all the same way it had affected him.</p><p>Every man there seemed frozen.</p><p>Finally they all roused themselves to walk out. There was no goodbye to the man at the front desk, nothing.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Vic said when they got outside, looking up at the sky and taking a huge gulp of fresh air.</p><p>\u201cThat was a bad one,\u201d Tom Dooley said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you think this murder\u2019s related to your guy?\u201d Vic asked the New York detectives.</p><p>\u201cI think we have to operate on that assumption,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>That assumption became fact a moment later, when one of the coroner\u2019s assistants came running out after them, holding a sealed evidence bag containing a torn piece of typing paper.</p><p>\u201cDetective Nelson?\u201d</p><p>Vic turned around.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Sears thought you should take this to the lab right away. It was in her pocket. We\u2019re sending the clothes over for analysis ourselves, but he thought you\u2019d want this first.\u201d</p><p>Vic held the bag up to the sun, so they could all see the contents.</p><p>It was just a ripped piece of what appeared to be run-of-the-mill printer paper, but there was something written on it that had all but faded away. Joe read the typed words aloud.</p><p>Quoth the raven: die.</p><p>There was a media frenzy.</p><p>Dr. Sears denied mentioning the scrap of paper to anyone, so maybe it had been one of his assistants. But it didn\u2019t really matter how word got out, only that it was out.</p><p>By the time the evening news aired, every station in the Tri-State Area was carrying the story, and linking the murder of Lori Star\u2014born Lori Spielberg, one of the stations discovered\u2014to that of Thorne Bigelow.</p><p>Someone had come up with a picture of Lori at her prettiest, and some enterprising reporter had made the Mary Rogers-Marie Roget connection, so she was now being compared to the beautiful cigar girl who had once worked at Anderson\u2019s Tobacco. The girl who had been given eternal life in her pathetic death by the great American author Edgar Allan Poe.</p><p>Lori was more famous than she ever could have imagined.</p><p>Her somewhat questionable past had been forgiven. She was the medium who had witnessed the accident through some spectral magic, connecting Sam Latham\u2019s injuries to Thorne Bigelow\u2019s death, a connection the police were now avidly following up on.</p><p>Joe had watched the news at a bar, sharing a beer with Vic, Raif and Tom. Then, disgusted with the over-the-top coverage, he excused himself and headed out. On the way to his car, he decided to follow the trail of the murder that had taken place in the eighteen-forties. He walked the Hoboken shoreline, but since he couldn\u2019t really go back in time over a hundred and fifty years, he could only close his eyes and try to imagine.</p><p>Of course, the contemporary killer couldn\u2019t possibly have gone back in time, either. And Joe didn\u2019t think the killer had done a particularly impressive job of murdering Thorne Bigelow \u00e0 la Poe, anyway. The man had died via his love of wine, true, but he hadn\u2019t been walled up to die slowly, gasping for air, thirsting, known that the end was coming. He had been poisoned, a somewhat less drawn-out method.</p><p>Poisoning the unsuspecting was easy, while strangling an eager and unsuspecting young woman, though not impossibly difficult, would taken a certain amount of strength.</p><p>Did that eliminate the women as suspects?</p><p>He walked the shoreline, and realized after a while that he\u2019d been waiting for something.</p><p>And then he knew what.</p><p>Dead people were talking to him.</p><p>He was hearing whispers in his ear when he shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>He spoke aloud to the breeze. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to go crazy, you might want to give me some useful information.\u201d</p><p>Luckily there was no one around to hear him and think right along with him that he was going nuts.</p><p>He felt like a fool anyway.</p><p>When it seemed as if the voices weren\u2019t going to tell him anything, he gave up and walked back to his car, ready to return to Manhattan.</p><p>This murder had changed everything. There couldn\u2019t possibly be a Raven who wasn\u2019t frightened now. Not that Lori Star had been a Raven, but she had connected Bigelow\u2019s death with Latham\u2019s accident, and that had been enough to paint a target on her back.</p><p>He put a call through to Genevieve\u2019s apartment, his irrational sense of fear for her growing again. She answered on the first ring, and he was glad to hear her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou saw the news?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t miss it. It\u2019s on every network,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. He thought of his last visit to a morgue, when the corpse had turned to him. Thank God Lori hadn\u2019t spoken to him through that broken face.</p><p>He asked after Eileen, who Gen assured him was safe at home, then told her that he would see her soon.</p><p>His thoughts turned to Sam Latham, who was still in the hospital\u2014and quite possibly in danger.</p> <p>When Joe reached the city, his first order of business was going to be to visit Sam, and to make sure that his wife, Dorothy, had indeed hired private security to watch over him. There was no longer any doubt. Whether Sam had been a target that day on the highway or not, there was a serial killer on the move, and Sam was certainly a sitting duck now.</p><p>When Joe arrived at the hospital, he was relieved to see that there was an imposing uniformed guard in a chair outside the door to Sam\u2019s room. The guard asked him who he was, and Joe showed his credentials.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve heard of you. I should have recognized you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have recognized me?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cYour face was just on the news,\u201d the man said, nodding toward the TV visible just inside the door to Sam\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Joe demanded.</p> <p>\u201cThe Lori Star murder. They linked it back to some literary group and a bunch of wealthy people, and one of them has a daughter, that Genevieve O\u2019Something who was kidnapped last year. And that led to you,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Joe stared at the man, who\u2019d sounded as calm as if he were reciting a chorus of \u201cThe hip bone\u2019s connected to the leg bone.\u201d</p><p>Damn it all, he cursed silently. He didn\u2019t want the city recognizing his face again, knowing him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Latham is sleeping, but his wife\u2019s in with him. I\u2019ll tell her you\u2019re here,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Joe nodded, still cursing fate.</p><p>When the guard ushered him into the room a moment later, Sam was sleeping, and Dorothy was sitting in a chair at his side, watching the small television with the sound turned down low.</p><p>\u201cMr. Connolly, so nice to see you,\u201d she said, and stood.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Latham,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you\u2019ve hired security for Sam\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, studying him. \u201cSam really was targeted by some madman, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked, worry evident in both her tone and her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure, but it\u2019s best to assume the worst and take precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit I\u2019m terrified now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful and smart, Mrs. Latham.\u201d</p><p>She smiled warmly. \u201cDorothy, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorothy,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joe,\u201d she said.</p><p>Even as she spoke, the machine monitoring Sam\u2019s vital signs began to beep shrilly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Dorothy gasped.</p><p>Joe frowned, staring at the IV leading into Sam\u2019s arm. \u201cWho\u2019s been in here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo one but one of the nurses a few minutes ago,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. Maybe he should have. But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He strode toward the man in the bed and ripped the IV from his arm.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>In Jared Bigelow\u2019s penthouse on Park Avenue, Mary Vincenzo watched the news as it unfolded.</p><p>She had just come in, and this was the first time she was seeing everything that was being plastered all over the news.</p><p>And plastered it was.</p><p>She was watching coverage of an interview with a police spokesman on one of the major networks, but she could see reporters for the other networks and at least half a dozen cable channels in the background.</p><p>On the channel she had randomly chosen, a handsome man with a lean build and silver-white hair was solemnly comparing Lori Star\u2019s murder to the one it had clearly been intended to emulate, that of Mary Rogers, so many years ago.</p><p>Mary Rogers. A woman with her own name. She couldn\u2019t help finding something creepy about the coincidence. The newsman kept using the name as he spoke, and it gave her the shivers.</p><p>She wondered why it bothered her so much. After all, the girl who had just died was named Lori.</p><p>Watching, she shook her head. She could visualize the girl who had been killed, remembering her from when she had been on the news after the accident on the FDR. What an idiot she\u2019d been to talk so publicly about what she knew. Of course, that was in retrospect. When Lori Star had gone to the news stations, she had surely never imagined herself as the next victim.</p><p>Mary watched, drawn like a moth to a flame. Had Lori\u2019s death been the work of the same killer who\u2019d murdered Thorne? True, there had been an identical note, but the police weren\u2019t saying whether they were convinced that the same perpetrator was responsible. Someone might have had it in for Lori and then decided to blame it on the Poe Killer to throw off suspicion.</p><p>Behind her, Jared Bigelow sniffed. \u201cPsychic actress, my ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? That doesn\u2019t automatically turn her into a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave some respect. She was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now she\u2019s dead and at peace\u2014which she didn\u2019t need to be. She talked a ton of trash, hogging the limelight, after that accident,\u201d Jared said.</p><p>Mary turned to him, troubled. \u201cJared, that\u2019s horrible. It sounds like you\u2019re saying she asked for what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour words, not mine,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shivered, hugging her arms around her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear Miss Mary,\u201d he said, using the nickname he had long ago given her. He walked over and sat down at her side, slipping his arms around her. \u201cShe was trash, Mary. Pure trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jared...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with me. You\u2019ll always be safe,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She looked at him. He was the only child and sole heir of a wealthy man. He was intelligent, courteous and extremely handsome in his slightly long-haired, artistic way. He\u2019d been given every earthly possession he had ever wanted. And despite all his advantages, he could be petulant, with a tendency to pout like a two-year-old.</p><p>She was just five years his senior.</p><p>She had started to fall in love with him when he\u2019d been just seventeen. But her husband had been alive then, a man who had demanded all her attention. He\u2019d been quite a bit older than she was, and rich. Very rich. A man with a family fortune and no children.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been a bad wife. She\u2019d been a faithful while he\u2019d been alive, grateful for all the doors the Bigelow money had opened for her. She\u2019d never had to work, unlike her sister back home in Iowa, who had grown old fast, serving hash and hamburgers at a roadside diner.</p><p>She had been grateful for her marriage, and if she\u2019d dreamed of younger men and attending trendier clubs, well, she had limited herself to dreaming. She had made herself be a good wife.</p><p>Then he died of a heart attack. And the ironic thing\u2014a truth somehow kept out of the papers\u2014was that he had died in the arms of a younger woman. She\u2019d almost found it amusing. She\u2019d been as true as the pure white snow, while he had gone after a younger lover.</p><p>He\u2019d been close to his brother and nephew, though.</p><p>So was she.</p><p>After all, she was family, and she remained family. And she had fallen more and more in love\u2014or maybe just lust\u2014with her nephew, who was, after all, only a nephew by marriage.</p><p>There was just something about him.</p><p>He could make her do anything, even when she knew he was behaving like a spoiled brat.</p><p>She looked at him now, though, and swallowed hard. \u201cI would think you, of all people, could be sympathetic. She died a terrible death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat death isn\u2019t terrible?\u201d he asked lightly. Then he wrapped his arms around her. His fingers teased suggestively against her breasts. She felt an instant surge of excitement sweep through her. He was young and handsome.</p><p>And rich.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help be afraid that he would lose interest in her. She needed to go on acting a little bit forbidden, to keep herself exciting and erotic.</p><p>She rose and lifted her skirt so she could straddle him, where he sat on the couch. She knew that he liked it when things seemed a little taboo. Dirty. He liked to sneak in quickies in places where they shouldn\u2019t be exposing themselves. He liked to do it when she was dressed, just lifting her skirt for access. Like this.</p><p>She moved her hand, playing with his trousers, pretending to struggle with his belt buckle and zipper. As if she were desperate.</p><p>He was actually so easy.</p><p>And he had a real thing for her. He lusted after her. Maybe he even loved her.</p><p>They made swift, frantic love there on the couch, and she relaxed against him.</p><p>She had forgotten the television while they were in the throes of passion, but now she could hear the anchorman again as he suggested that Lori had been sexually assaulted by her killer, that she had probably been killed soon after she had last been seen, somewhere between four and nine o\u2019clock on Sunday afternoon, and that several days in the water had accelerated the decomposition of her body.</p><p>Mary leaned against Jared and stared in his eyes. She could feel him growing hard again inside her.</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Where were you on Sunday evening?</p><p>But the words wouldn\u2019t form on her lips. She shook her head, closed her eyes and leaned against him again. Afraid.</p><p>Afraid that he might realize what she had been about to say.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, and started to move above him.</p><p>At O\u2019Malley\u2019s, Don Tracy, Brook Avery and Larry Levine were sharing a table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so horrible,\u201d Brook said, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cNevermore, indeed,\u201d Don said, lifting his beer.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Larry swore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brook set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cLarry, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Larry frowned. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll be all right. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d Don asked.</p> <p>\u201cI should have fucking been there!\u201d Larry said. \u201cCan you believe it? I\u2019m a Raven, and this is the story of the year, and I should be covering it.\u201d</p><p>Eileen Brideswell and the rest of the board members walked into the bar at that point, staring at the television as they walked over to join the others, who pulled over an empty table to make room for them.</p><p>Over in a corner, Paddy pulled out his phone. He hated feeling like a tattletale, but he couldn\u2019t help worrying about Eileen. In his opinion, Genevieve needed to know where her mother was.</p><p>In his robe, in his own room, Albee Bennet watched the evening news and lifted his teacup to the television.</p><p>\u201cQuoth the raven,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cAh, Thorne, you would have loved the irony.\u201d</p> <p>Then he set his teacup down and looked around.</p><p>The night had somehow become ominous.</p><p>He rose and locked the door to his room, even though the house had an excellent security system, and these days it was always set.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to end up like Thorne. He wouldn\u2019t trust anyone. He would be safe.</p><p>Even so, when he went to bed, early, he couldn\u2019t help feeling afraid.</p><p>She had hired Joe Connolly because he was good at his job, Genevieve told herself, even if she had to admit that other reasons might have lurked in the back corners of her mind. He was good, and she was living proof of that.</p> <p>Adam owned a place up by Central Park, so he had headed up there a while ago and was making arrangements for his employees to join him. Brent Blackhawk, who was coming with his wife, was a sheriff in Virginia. A lawman. That should mollify Joe, once he found out what she had done, she thought.</p><p>With Adam out of the house, she tried to think as Joe would think, to reason. The possibility remained that the killer had nothing to do with the New York Poe Society and was using the connection as a smoke screen. She started with simple deduction. Had the murders been carried out in a manner that definitely spoke of someone emulating Poe\u2019s writings?</p><p>No.</p><p>Poisoned wine didn\u2019t connect directly with any of Poe\u2019s stories, nor was it terribly unique.</p><p>Sam Latham had been hurt in a car accident, and there was certainly no vehicular homicide in any of Poe\u2019s stories. Nor had a note been found at the scene.</p><p>Lori\u2019s murder was the only one that really lined up with Poe\u2019s work, and even then, the parallels weren\u2019t definitive.</p><p>Was the killer trying to slay every member of the society, or at least the board? There was no way to know, but certainly the killer wasn\u2019t limiting himself to that group, though Lori Star had connected herself to the case.</p><p>Okay, she told herself. Time to try eliminating some possibilities.</p> <p>She made a list of the members of the board, then looked down it, considering each one as a suspect. She eliminated three names right off the bat: Thorne, because he was dead; Sam, because he was in the hospital; her mother...</p><p>Because she was her mother.</p><p>That left Jared Bigelow and Mary Vincenzo, whom she suspected were sleeping together. Both stood to gain from Thorne Bigelow\u2019s death\u2014Jared directly, and Mary through her relationship with Jared. Lila Hawkins, unlikely, but not impossible. Lou Sayles? God, she hoped not. The woman had worked with the city\u2019s children for years, and the thought of a murderer having that kind of access...She shuddered. Barbara Hirshorn, such a timid little bird, but you never knew...Still waters and all that.</p><p>It took ingenuity, not strength, to administer poison, but what had been done to Lori Star had taken strength.</p><p>Four men remained as possible suspects. Five, if she counted Albee Bennet, and she knew Joe would. After all, he had admitted being in the house when Thorne was murdered. So she added him to the list that still included Larry Levine, Brook Avery, Don Tracy and Nat Halloway.</p><p>She was anxious to talk to Joe now, but she was afraid, as well, given that she had called in the ghostbusters. But something was disturbing him deeply, and she couldn\u2019t help feeling that Adam Harrison was the man who could help.</p><p>Her phone rang, and she picked it up absently.</p><p>She could hear noise and Irish music in the background, and frowned. Someone was calling her from O\u2019Malley\u2019s, she thought.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that you, lovely Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>The slight Irish lilt was a giveaway.</p><p>\u201cPaddy? What\u2019s up? Why are you calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought you should know. Your mum is here. And all her bird society people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, the Poe Society? Thanks for letting me know, Paddy,\u201d she said, then hung up a moment later and leapt to her feet. What was Eileen doing going out without protection, and with that group, of all people? Disturbed, she grabbed her purse and headed out.</p><p>Joe had been shoved out of the way when the doctors and nurses rushed in, but he was quick to warn them that they needed to find out what had been in Sam\u2019s IV.</p><p>He\u2019d actually been afraid he was going to be tackled by the security guard, but Dorothy had jumped to his defense, and then, thank God, a nurse had shouted that she didn\u2019t like the look of the IV fluid, and taken the bag of fluids away for testing. One of the doctors suspected a morphine overdose, but final word would have to wait for the lab results.</p><p>Once the medical personnel got Sam stabilized\u2014though he was still unconscious\u2014inserted a fresh IV and left, Dorothy broke into sobs, and Joe tried to calm her.</p><p>\u201cI hired security and everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy does someone want to kill Sam?\u201d</p><p>Why indeed? Joe asked himself.</p><p>Two police officers arrived a few minutes later, men Joe didn\u2019t know. They started by interviewing the security guard, then Dorothy, then him, followed by all the medical personnel on duty on the floor, none of whom had been in to change Sam\u2019s IV.</p><p>The shift change had been at seven, about fifteen minutes before Joe had arrived, and Dorothy\u2019s best recollection was that someone had come in right in the middle of it to adjust the IV. It had been the perfect opportunity for someone to slip into hospital scrubs during the busy changeover, then casually walk in and inject something that shouldn\u2019t have been there into Sam\u2019s IV.</p><p>Dorothy wasn\u2019t certain she could identify whoever who had come in. She had dozed off and still been half asleep when the last person came in to adjust the IV.</p><p>The guard in the hallway swore up and down that no one who wasn\u2019t in proper hospital attire had gotten past him.</p><p>It seemed forever before things began to calm down. By then, Raif and Tom Dooley, looking seriously worse for wear, had arrived.</p><p>Another round of questioning began.</p><p>The police ordered official round-the-clock surveillance. Other than Dorothy and anyone she approved, no one wearing a surgical mask or without hospital ID was to be allowed into Sam\u2019s room, which was immediately changed. Records were altered so he was no longer listed under his own name.</p><p>A team of crime-scene investigators came in to examine the room, although everyone thought that it was a losing proposition. The would-be killer had been wearing scrubs, including latex gloves, so fingerprints were unlikely.</p><p>Around ten, Sam woke up, none the worse for an ordeal he\u2019d been totally unaware of, but he could add nothing to what the police had already found out, since he\u2019d slept through the IV change. After he heard the full story, he was simply grateful to be alive.</p><p>Genevieve was disturbed that her mother hadn\u2019t told her about her plans to go out with the Ravens, and she felt a keen sense of unease as she headed down to the garage to get her car. The garage wasn\u2019t ablaze with light, but it wasn\u2019t dark, either, though there were shadows. Still, it could only be accessed\u2014whether from the street or from the building itself\u2014with a resident\u2019s keycard.</p><p>Even so, the door had barely closed behind her before she felt a strange sensation sweep over her. It wasn\u2019t exactly fear. Not at first. It was more the sense that someone else was out there.</p><p>Then she felt the chill.</p><p>It was as if the shadows themselves were moving, as if darkness itself was snaking around her.</p><p>Touching her.</p><p>She started walking more quickly, looking around. She couldn\u2019t see anyone.</p><p>She almost raced back to the door to the building, actually pictured herself fumbling with the key, desperate to get inside as quickly as she could.</p><p>At that point her car was closer, so she started to run for it. And even though she had just seen that there was no one around, she felt that someone was there. Someone who was trying to stop her.</p><p>She reached her car, but her fingers were trembling, and she had trouble opening the door.</p><p>Darkness, like a living thing, seemed to be rising behind her. She could almost feel the whisper of its breath.</p><p>She got the door open at last and jumped inside, then slammed and locked the door behind her. She swallowed hard as paranoia seized her again, and turned around. She actually expected to see someone sitting in the backseat, someone who\u2019d hidden there, waiting, and who was now ready to pounce....</p><p>But no one was there. Of course.</p><p>Then...</p><p>She could have sworn she heard a whisper.</p><p>Help me!</p><p>She swallowed a scream and swung her head around, from side to side, in panic. She was ready to abandon the car and even opened the door.</p><p>Then she saw someone walking through the garage and plainly heard a cheerful whistle. Her blood seemed to freeze in her veins.</p><p>\u201cEvening, Miss O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>She sagged against the back of the seat and stared blankly at Tim Rindle, one of the night watchmen. Tim was a handsome twenty-something, clean cut, always cheerful. He had just gotten out of the service and was working nights to put himself through college.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, as he got closer and saw her face, which she knew must have been as pale as a ghost.</p><p>She swallowed hard. Straightened. Felt like a complete fool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Tim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Do you need me to help you up to your apartment or anything?\u201d he asked anxiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear was slipping away like a cast-off shawl. There was so obviously no one but the two of them in the garage.</p><p>She almost laughed aloud at herself. But then Tim\u2019s smile faded. \u201cMiss O\u2019Brien, you\u2019ve got to be careful out there, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the news except about that poor girl who was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful, Tim.\u201d</p><p>He was still looking at her, worried and frowning. \u201cI wish I was off duty\u2014I\u2019d go with you to make sure you get wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to O\u2019Malley\u2019s. I know everyone there, and they all know me. My mother is waiting for me there,\u201d she fibbed, \u201cand a bunch of other friends.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wave and started the engine. Then she paused and rolled down the window. \u201cTim?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two of you on duty tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anyone walking around down here, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I gave Mrs. Larson\u2014you know, in 10-D\u2014her cat back a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPussy Galore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s got to keep that cat inside. He\u2019s going to get run over one of these days if he doesn\u2019t stop sneaking through the door whenever anyone goes in or out.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and waved again. \u201cGood night. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>As she merged with the traffic, she decided that she was going a little bit crazy. It was all Joe\u2019s fault, she told herself, then admitted that maybe it was at least partly her own, too. After all, she was the one who had just called in Harrison Investigations.</p><p>She had to stop her mind from playing games, that was all. All she needed was to be careful, make sure she stuck to safe places, and that she didn\u2019t take chances.</p><p>And she needed to see to it that her mother did the same.</p><p>With that thought in mind, she searched the street for parking and found a place in a busy area not far from the pub. But when she stepped out of her car to put money in the meter, she once again felt as if someone eerie and not quite real was nearby. For a split second, she felt the sense of shadows and darkness and fear closing in around her.</p><p>She told herself that she was on a busy New York street, a stone\u2019s throw from the pub itself, not to mention that she had great lung capacity and could scream like a banshee, if need be.</p><p>She turned around and realized that there was someone near her.</p> <p>A bum.</p><p>\u201cLady, got some change?\u201d he whined.</p><p>She felt ridiculously relieved and handed him a dollar.</p><p>He offered her a toothless grin and walked off.</p><p>Shaking her head, she hurried on to the pub.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Everyone in the place seemed to be talking when she walked in, and the music playing in the background only added to the din.</p><p>Paddy, over by the dartboard, was the first to see her. \u201cGen!\u201d he called out, and made his way through a throng of people to reach her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Paddy,\u201d she said, and gave him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Paddy, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cEileen is at the table over yonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, there\u2019s a group of them tonight, there be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess everyone is shaken up.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice to a whisper, though he could have shouted and no one would have noticed. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be alone with those folks right now, and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her heart seemed to skip a beat. \u201cI agree,\u201d she whispered conspiratorially in return, then smiled and patted his shoulder. \u201cBut when she\u2019s here, I know she\u2019s fine. I know you and Angus will keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cAnd on you, Gen,\u201d he swore.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou always make me feel like I\u2019m...home. And safe. Give Angus a hug for me, huh? I\u2019m going to go see what\u2019s up with my mom, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. You ever need me, young lady, you call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He started to turn away, then paused. \u201cAdam Harrison is here, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d That did startle her.</p><p>He pointed. Adam was alone at the end of the bar, leaning against the wall, watching the room. He lifted his beer to her, and his eyes seemed to speak volumes.</p><p>In fact, they chided her. It was as if she could hear him saying, You shouldn\u2019t have come out on your own.</p><p>She smiled. Okay, first she would go over to see Adam, since a quick glance told her that her mother was fine and hadn\u2019t even noticed she was there.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d she said, reaching him. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Now you won\u2019t have to call to tell me you\u2019re on your way,\u201d he said.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI guess I should have called someone, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut honestly, Adam, this isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about Eileen.\u201d</p><p>He leaned low. \u201cShall we accost her together?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He finished his beer and set down the glass. \u201cGenevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder can happen anywhere at any time. And whether you like it or not, this Poe Killer thing is personal. Because of who you are, you have to be careful all the time, but now you need to be even more vigilant.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled. Exhaled. Remembered how terrified she had been in her own garage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn into a little old lady who\u2019s afraid to leave her own apartment,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I really am careful,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou drove down here alone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mother was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not being careful,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to come here?\u201d she asked, looking him in the eye.</p><p>He stared back at her. \u201cHunch,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, before we go over to see your mother, tell me who all those people with her are. A few of them look familiar, but a refresher course won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>She told him quickly who was whom, and then he took her hand and led her through the crowd.</p><p>When Eileen saw Genevieve\u2019s face, her own went a little white.</p><p>It was guilt.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t called Genevieve, and she was with the Ravens. Brook had called and asked her to join them for a drink at the pub, and she had agreed without really thinking.</p><p>But she had never thought she was in danger from any of them anyway\u2014or, to be honest, from anyone else. She spent her time worrying about Genevieve.</p><p>Then she saw Adam, and her face was suffused with color again, and she smiled delightedly. \u201cAdam!\u201d she called, interrupting the conversation around the table.</p><p>\u201cEileen,\u201d he replied, with a smile of his own.</p><p>She was sitting between Larry and Lila, but she quickly excused herself and got to her feet, hugging Adam, offering a kiss to Genevieve, then turning to introduce him to the others. He had indeed met several of them at various charity functions, and greetings went around the table.</p><p>With Eileen on her feet, talking to Adam, Larry and Lila, who had so vigorously pointed fingers at each other regarding Thorne\u2019s murder, were now next to one another\u2014and pointedly ignoring each other, Gen noticed. Suddenly Lila jumped up and demanded, \u201cSo, Adam Harrison, what are you doing in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not up here because of this dreadful business, are you?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cJust came up on business,\u201d Adam said lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you managed to arrive just when the city is going insane,\u201d Larry said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brook dragged over some extra chairs, and in a minute they were all seated.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, that murder is all that anyone is talking about,\u201d Larry said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s forgotten about war in the Middle East and global warming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis girl...\u201d Brook said. \u201cI can see why everyone\u2019s so interested in her. She was a lost child of New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lost child of New York. I like that. Can I steal it?\u201d Larry asked. \u201cIt\u2019ll make a great headline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead. I\u2019ll be looking for something deeper, something that gets into the psychology of the phenomenon, for the magazine,\u201d Brook said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both awful!\u201d Barbara exploded.</p><p>They all fell silent, staring at her. She flushed. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re complaining because people are treating this like the most devastating news in the world, and the next you\u2019re talking about the spin you\u2019re going to give the story yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBravo,\u201d Don Tracy said, and applauded, causing Barbara to turn an even deeper shade of crimson.</p><p>\u201cNot to mention that we\u2019re all forgetting what it means to us personally,\u201d Lou said quietly.</p><p>\u201cJust what does it mean to us?\u201d Nat Halloway asked.</p><p>\u201cMy dear money man, so sweet and accommodating\u2014and unimaginative,\u201d Lou said, but not unkindly. \u201cIt means there really is a psycho out there with a Poe fixation. And that no one in the city is safe\u2014especially us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how did you all end up here tonight?\u201d Adam asked pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cWell...we get together here all the time,\u201d Don said. Then he laughed. \u201cHell, I\u2019m here because I needed a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Eileen,\u201d Lou said. \u201cAnd she said we should call Lila, and Lila called Barbara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where we hang out,\u201d Larry said a little lamely.</p><p>\u201cJust like Cheers,\u201d Don said, lifting his glass. \u201cEverybody knows our names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needed comfort, if you ask me,\u201d Nat said, and they all fell silent, because unimaginative or not, he had hit on the truth.</p><p>The table was still quiet when Genevieve noticed, from the corner of her eye, that the front door had opened and someone else was coming into the crowded bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe.</p><p>She knew she should have tried to get hold of him, at least to let him know she was on her way here, even to invite him to join them. Then again, he had gone off on a trip she certainly hadn\u2019t been invited to share.</p><p>She certainly hadn\u2019t expected to see him here now, though.</p> <p>He saw them and made his way through the crowd and directly toward their table.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Joe said, as if he were greeting everyone at the table all at once. And he was. But his eyes were on Adam, and he wasn\u2019t pretending he wasn\u2019t surprised to see him.</p><p>Adam had risen, his hand out to greet Joe warmly, and apparently Joe wasn\u2019t going to be churlish enough to reject his greeting. They clasped hands, then joined in a quick embrace before drawing back to study each other in the way of two men who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a while.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Joe,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you. So what the hell brings you to town?\u201d Joe asked pleasantly, only his eyes betraying his suspicion.</p> <p>They had an audience, Genevieve knew. And Joe was playing the scene well. But when he looked at her, she stiffened. A shaft of cold air seemed to blast straight at her, his eyes were so cold.</p><p>He knew. Somehow he knew that she had called Adam.</p><p>\u201cI have some business here in the city,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNaturally I gave Genevieve a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Joe echoed dryly. \u201cAnd you just happened to show up here?\u201d he asked Genevieve, his tone still pleasant.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about the way we all gravitate to this place,\u201d Eileen said, giving Joe her most radiant smile.</p><p>If Joe admired anyone, Gen thought, it was Eileen. And in fact, his eyes did soften as he turned to her.</p> <p>\u201cJoe, what\u2019s your take on this murder?\u201d Brook asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who killed her, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared on Sunday,\u201d Barbara said, her gaze focused straight ahead, her eyes unseeing, as the words left her lips. \u201cMary Rogers. Eighteen forty-one. She left her home on a Sunday. She was found on a Wednesday. In the water. Just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting better,\u201d Don Tracy said darkly.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Don grimaced. \u201cFirst Thorne, a murder that had similarities to several of Poe\u2019s stories but didn\u2019t really parallel any of them. But this...this was on the money. She was found by the river. Relatively near the spot where Mary Rogers was found. Found in pretty much the same...state of decomposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this investigation will be very different,\u201d Eileen said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAnd how is that, Eileen?\u201d Nat asked her.</p> <p>\u201cScience,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cThe police have so much more to work with these days. What is it, Joe? At every crime scene, the killer inadvertently takes something away or leaves something behind. Isn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not a really clever killer,\u201d Barbara said, shuddering and turning to look at Joe with wide, frightened eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll catch this guy, I\u2019m certain,\u201d Joe said firmly.</p><p>Barbara nodded, as if she trusted his words.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope they catch him before\u2014Well, soon,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cShe was a slut,\u201d Lila pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lila!\u201d Nat Halloway protested. \u201cNo one deserves to die like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say she deserved to die like that,\u201d Lila said irritably. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...we reap what we sow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer will be caught,\u201d Joe said again, and his words were followed by an uncomfortable silence around the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, I, for one, should be calling it a night,\u201d Larry said. \u201cThe presses wait for no man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should probably all get moving,\u201d Lou suggested. \u201cIt was good to see everyone, though.\u201d</p><p>Goodbyes were said, and eventually only Eileen, Adam, Joe and Genevieve were left. Eileen slid back into her seat and patted the chair beside her. \u201cAdam, it\u2019s so nice to see you. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Joe was staring at Genevieve, who sat down across from her mother. She was dying to ask him about the afternoon, but this didn\u2019t feel like the right time.</p><p>Without waiting for an invitation, Joe sat down next to her and stared intently across the table at Adam. \u201cSo. Which one of them called you?\u201d he asked. \u201cEileen or Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>Lie, Genevieve silently begged Adam.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. \u201cGenevieve,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cRight. Well, this is a dangerous situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help,\u201d Adam told him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Genevieve and Eileen should leave town for a while,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d Gen began, ready to argue.</p><p>But Eileen laid her hand on her daughter\u2019s arm to silence her and looked at Joe. \u201cWe could. But, Joe, if someone out there is determined that Genevieve or I should die, that someone will find us wherever we go. I believe it would be best to stay here and get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you discover today?\u201d Adam asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cDon was right. The killer did a much better job of imitating Poe this time,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>His voice was cold and hard. Gen could only imagine what he had seen today. \u201cYou were in New Jersey all this time?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been at the hospital. To see Sam,\u201d he said. He looked around the table, meeting their eyes as his gaze went to each of them in turn. \u201cThere was another attempt on his life.\u201d</p><p>Gen told herself that it was natural for Joe to want some time alone, given everything he\u2019d seen and done that day. But inside, she knew that his decision not to be with her tonight had nothing to do with the day he\u2019d had and everything to do with the fact that she had called Adam\u2014and he was too smart not to suspect why.</p><p>The good thing was that at least Joe seemed to trust the older man. Of course. He\u2019d met Adam Harrison through Leslie. And at least Adam didn\u2019t correct Joe\u2019s apparent assumption that the three of them had all come to O\u2019Malley\u2019s together.</p><p>And so Joe left alone, after suggesting that Gen stay at her mother\u2019s house that night.</p><p>Genevieve would have protested, but Eileen said, \u201cPlease, dear. Just tonight.\u201d</p><p>So, an hour later, she was in the den, speaking with Adam, who had gone back with the women, ostensibly to make sure they were safe.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really angry that I called you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe had a bad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to an autopsy?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. But that\u2019s still not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve...he just needs time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Because he thinks I\u2019ve betrayed him somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him time. Let\u2019s talk about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I had a nightmare,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated then, feeling as if someone had taken a cube of ice and run it straight down her spine. \u201cIt was about being strangled,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as if I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking, Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as if I were Lori Star. It was Sunday night. The night she disappeared. Oh, God, Adam, I might have been having that nightmare right when...right when she was actually being killed.\u201d She gasped. \u201cI saw her on the news, and that\u2019s what she was saying. That it was like she was the driver of the car on the FDR. She felt anger and...intent. Malice.\u201d She stopped speaking. Her skin was crawling, and she wanted to go back, to pretend that she hadn\u2019t said what she had, that the horror would just go away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Adam said gently.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d she protested, horrified.</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cYou may be able to tap into the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTap into the victim?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell else do you want?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he repeated firmly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She realized that she was lying, that she didn\u2019t want to go any further, but she knew she had to. She groaned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, please,\u201d he said.</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cEarlier...when I was leaving tonight, I kept feeling as if there were someone in the garage...someone in the shadows. Or more...as if the shadows themselves were someone. Does that make any sense?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, in a way it does,\u201d he told her, then rose. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a spring chicken, you know. I need to get some sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd your mother has been kind enough to have a room made up for me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou drop these...bombshells on me, and then you go to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow will be a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you can see that it will be a long day?\u201d She wondered why she sounded so resentful. She was the one who had called him, after all.</p><p>She was frightened, that was why.</p><p>\u201cAdam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe will need help tomorrow,\u201d he said, and left the room.</p><p>Admittedly, he was angry.</p><p>What the hell had he done to cause Genevieve to call Adam Harrison? About him.</p><p>He\u2019d never told a soul about speaking to a dead man on the highway\u2014except for the med tech who had assured him that the man was dead, and he wouldn\u2019t have said a thing then, either, if he\u2019d known. He sure as hell had never told anyone about the corpse on the Gurney at the morgue.</p><p>When he left O\u2019Malley\u2019s, he didn\u2019t head for his car. He had too much on his mind to go home right away, so he walked. He loved walking, and New York was the city for it. And as he walked, he tried to be rational. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, rationally, he hated the fact that Genevieve had called Adam. Regarding him. There were far more serious matters at hand\u2014tonight\u2019s attempt on Sam\u2019s life, for one thing. The police had suggested that the news not be shared with the news media or anyone else, except for on a need-to-know basis. There was no escaping the fact that there was a serial killer out there, one with either a real or feigned Poe fetish, and holding some information back would help them separate the real killer from the pretenders who were bound to come forward.</p><p>The killer was real and needed his concentration. So think about that, he told himself. He\u2019d tried to eliminate at least some members of the New York Poe Society board by examining their alibis for the afternoon and evening when Thorne had been killed. Now the process of elimination would be easier, because he could find out where each of them had been this evening around seven, the night of the car crash and the night Lori went missing, then cross reference everything and eliminate more of them from his suspect pool.</p><p>They\u2019d all been at O\u2019Malley\u2019s tonight, but where they had they been beforehand?</p> <p>He would find out, he thought grimly. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he would have the killer in his sights. It was still possible that the killer was someone else, and there were millions of people out there in New York to choose from.</p><p>But not a million people that Thorne Bigelow would trust.</p><p>Joe suddenly realized that his steps had led him back to Hastings House.</p><p>Once again, it was closed, since it was only open at night for special functions, as it had been the night Matt was killed at the gala held to celebrate the house\u2019s rebirth as a museum. That night Matt had died and Leslie had touched the other side, but she had returned....</p><p>For a year.</p> <p>Enough time in which to capture his...what? His heart? Or his soul?</p><p>As he stood there on the sidewalk, he noticed that the gate was ajar. \u201cNo,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t stop himself. The compulsion was too great. He told himself it was his own determination to prove that nothing was going on that science couldn\u2019t explain, but...</p><p>But he knew he was looking for something more.</p><p>He let himself in through the open gate and slowly walked up the path to the steps. He looked up at the house and told himself that it was just that. A house. Brick, mortar, wood. A house. It didn\u2019t live and breathe. No matter what Debbie thought, the house hadn\u2019t saved her. Brick, mortar and wood would not\u2014could not\u2014reach out to help people.</p><p>But Leslie would.</p> <p>Great. Now he was going to force himself to walk into the house, where he would no doubt imagine that he could hear her voice. That she was still there.</p><p>No, he told himself. He was going to step into the house, discover that the wiring was shot and the security system was going haywire.</p><p>He walked up the steps to the porch.</p><p>The front door opened.</p><p>He walked in.</p><p>It looked just the same as it had the other night. He looked up the stairway, lit by the pale red security lights. He examined the furnishings there in the entry, checked out the runner that protected the hardwood floor. There was an oil painting on the wall, a rider in a tricorn hat. Candles in sconces.</p><p>There were no sounds this time, though. None at all.</p><p>Strangely, the house felt warm. It was a museum, he reminded himself. It had to be kept at a certain temperature to protect the antique furnishings. But it wasn\u2019t good, and it wasn\u2019t evil. It was simply a house.</p> <p>Joe...</p><p>The sense of warmth increased, as if he were being comforted, beckoned. He felt something brush against his cheek, the touch almost tender.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be here,\u201d he said aloud, feeling like a fool but unable to stop himself.</p><p>His cell phone started to ring. He answered it. \u201cConnolly.\u201d</p><p>There was no one there. \u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered aloud, and closed the phone.</p><p>Well, what the hell had he expected? That he was going to walk in and Leslie would be there, waiting for him in jeans and a T-shirt, hair loose and manner easy? That in her casual yet somehow intense manner, she would invite him in for tea?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He turned back toward the door.</p><p>Then he felt the hand. A hand, dammit. On his shoulder.</p><p>Joe...</p><p>He heard his name again, but it wasn\u2019t Leslie\u2019s voice.</p><p>It was Matt\u2019s!</p><p>Oh, hell, he really was crazy. Leslie wasn\u2019t here, welcoming him in. She was here with Matt. They had taken up residence in Hastings House, or maybe just within the tortured confines of his mind.</p><p>It\u2019s all right. Please, we can help.</p><p>He muttered a curt expletive and turned, staring intently into the shadows.</p><p>There! Had that shadow moved? Was there something misty taking shape in front of him? Would he be shaking hands with his cousin in a matter of moments?</p><p>He swore again. Maybe it really was time for that psychotherapy now.</p><p>He winced. \u201cIf...if you\u2019re there, leave me the hell alone, will you, please?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Crazy. He had gone completely crazy.</p><p>He turned around and left the house, hardly noticing when the lock clicked into place as the door shut behind him.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Lori Star made all the morning shows.</p><p>It was sad, Gen thought, that she would have been glad to know she was, even in such a horrible way, immortalized.</p><p>Genevieve had gotten up early and headed home. Now, watching television in her own apartment, she decided to call her mother and reinforce the need for her to stay home, where she would be safe. She was turning into a nagging parent, she realized. Too bad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going anywhere alone,\u201d she told her mother. \u201cOr with Lou or Lila or any of them,\u201d she added firmly.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, seriously. It can\u2019t be any of them,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I can\u2019t believe you went out last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust that group, and I don\u2019t want you trusting them, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust Adam. And Joe,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn this around. Just don\u2019t go anywhere today. Promise?\u201d</p><p>A sigh. \u201cI promise,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cSpeaking of which...I\u2019m curious. About Adam. You called him? You asked him to come?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeslie believed in him, you know. He was very dear to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I take it he\u2019s a friend of yours, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the families, you know. I\u2019ve met him at various functions over the years. And then, last year, when I hired Joe and everyone was looking for you...well, yes, I saw quite a lot of him then.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve waited for her mother to elaborate further. When she didn\u2019t, Gen asked, \u201cDid you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever need help with anything paranormal? No,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cBut Adam is a very good man.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cJoe knows that. I hope he\u2019ll trust him with...whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too. I...um, I love you, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. More than I can ever say,\u201d Eileen said softly.</p><p>At ten, Adam called Genevieve. \u201cMy friends have arrived,\u201d he told her. \u201cBrent and Nikki Blackhawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw how Joe was last night. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll want to meet with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he will. Brent has some information for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInformation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s not just a ghost hunter, you know,\u201d Adam said, and she couldn\u2019t tell if his voice was teasing or not. \u201cHe\u2019s a great investigator, and I think he can help Joe on this. Anyway, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll call Joe and set up lunch.\u201d</p><p>Great, she thought. Joe was going to be just thrilled. But all she said was, \u201cLet me know.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and walked back into her living room, where Lori Star\u2019s face was still front and center on the television. She turned away, then heard someone say, Help me.</p><p>She swung back to the television. For a moment Lori seemed to be staring straight at her, but then she realized that the video was from the night Lori had been on television claiming to have \u201cseen\u201d the accident. And that there was nothing unusual about it.</p><p>Even so, she had the strangest urge to escape her own apartment. All she wanted was to run.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t run away from herself, and she knew it. She remembered the strange sensation of being the other woman in the dream, remembered how she had seen the shadows come alive in the parking garage. And now she thought that a dead woman on television was looking at her, asking for help.</p><p>She thought about how strangely Joe was behaving. Perhaps he was running, as well.</p><p>Maybe they were both going crazy.</p><p>She turned off the television off, and as she did, she heard her cell phone ringing. It was Adam.</p><p>\u201cI made a reservation for one o\u2019clock. I\u2019ve got a car, so I\u2019ll be in front of your place at a quarter of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe is fine with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>She hung up, reflecting on the vast difference between \u201cHe\u2019ll be there\u201d and \u201cYes, he\u2019s fine with it.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Frank Arbitter was a homebody. It was just that his home seemed to be the morgue, Joe thought. The man could eat, drink, chat and read the comics, all with a corpse awaiting his attention, and apparently be no more worried about it than he was about the phone on his desk.</p><p>An elderly white woman lay beneath a sheet that morning, only her head visible, so Joe wasn\u2019t sure what stage her autopsy was at. As Frank welcomed him and indicated a chair by his desk, Joe paused. The other man watched but didn\u2019t comment when Joe gently pulled the sheet up to cover the woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe was murdered?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, she was just alone. It was a heart attack, I\u2019m fairly certain, but since no one was there, we have to do the autopsy. Hey, do you want a cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came in with her cat. They didn\u2019t know it was hiding in the blanket she had around her when she died.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrank, I\u2019m the last person in the world who should own a pet.

Furry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she died trying to brush it,\u201d Joe suggested.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I always thought you were a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask around. Raif Green has kids. Maybe they\u2019ll want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should reconsider, Joe. You have a place, not a home. A pet would make it a home. Let me take that back. A wife would make it a home. Hell, even just a live-in lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, give me a break. Can we move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sit.\u201d</p> <p>Joe took the offered chair. \u201cHave you talked to the guy over in Jersey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018the guy over in Jersey,\u2019 I\u2019m going to assume you mean the medical examiner in charge of Miss Star, Dr. Benjamin Sears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that guy,\u201d Joe agreed.</p><p>\u201cHe sent me a copy of his initial report,\u201d Frank said. \u201cBut why are you asking? You were at the autopsy. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSears said the bulk of the injuries were postmortem, including those to the genital region. What does that mean to you?\u201d</p><p>Frank frowned, looking at him. \u201cHey, I\u2019m basically a mechanic. I look at the pieces. I\u2019m not a psychologist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I guess I want collaboration. Do you think the killer could have been imitating a crime, rather than committing one out of personal passion?\u201d</p><p>Frank looked steadily at Joe. \u201cI watch the news. You want to know if he was mimicking a real crime, or maybe the literary version of it. Mary Rogers. Marie Roget. Did you know that a number of researchers have bemoaned the fact that there were two autopsies done on Mary Rogers, the original in New Jersey and one later, in New York? No one ever definitively answered the question of whether she died as the result of a botched abortion, or if she was assaulted and killed by a gang. Back then, the Five Points area was overrun by gangs. Most people wanted to think it was gang members, wanted to use that as ammunition to get the police to clean up the streets.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at him, surprised.</p><p>Frank grinned. \u201cHey, I live in New York. I may not be an expert on Poe, but I know my share of local history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your take on this theory?\u201d Joe asked, leaning forward. \u201cThe killer is an opportunist. Thorne Bigelow needed to die. The killer didn\u2019t want the finger of truth pointing back at him, so it had to look as if Thorne died for some reason other than the real one, so the killer left the note referencing Poe, even though he hadn\u2019t done a very good job of making the murder fit any of Poe\u2019s works. And maybe, almost by accident, Bigelow became the first in a series of killings. The killer happened to see Sam Latham on the FDR and figured if he took him out, it would really give credence to the Poe connection. He only landed Sam in the hospital, but it was still good enough for his purposes. Maybe too good. Lori Star sealed her own fate when she went on television, purporting to be a psychic and saying she knew what happened. He couldn\u2019t have that, but luckily for him\u2014or her\u2014Lori was easy to get rid of. All he had to do was convince her that he was a reporter or a writer or something, and that he was ready to make her really famous. He demanded to meet her alone, and you know the rest. This time, though, he had time to make a big deal of the Poe connection. With Lori dead, he should have felt safe, but then he started thinking about Sam and whether he might start remembering more of what happened on the highway, so he took steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to kill Sam? I didn\u2019t see anything about that in the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. The police are hoping that keeping something secret will give them an edge in finding the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the method?\u201d Frank asked, his brow creasing.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty sure it was an overdose of morphine, administered by someone in hospital scrubs and a mask. And if he\u2019d succeeded, I bet a note would have shown up, too. So what do you think about my theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds pretty convincing, but at this point it\u2019s only a theory, right? The police haven\u2019t actually figured anything out, have they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, no,\u201d Joe admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd it could have started out as a random killing that escalated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be random,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThorne Bigelow let his killer in. That wasn\u2019t random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Frank was quiet for a long moment. \u201cYou know, Joe, back then...the killer was never identified. There were theories, plenty of them. But no one ever went to trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But this can\u2019t end this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t end at all if this guy isn\u2019t stopped.\u201d Joe stood up suddenly. \u201cThanks Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. You just made me focus on a really important question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly why did Thorne have to die?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve paced in her apartment, feeling like a caged tiger.</p><p>She\u2019d spent her life being active, taking steps to make the world a better place, not just attending charity functions and luncheons. She\u2019d majored in social sciences, received a degree in psychology and another in social service. She\u2019d worked the streets convincing hookers to quit working for two-bit pimps, and she\u2019d gotten a lot of women real jobs. She knew how to keep herself safe on the streets. She\u2019d only been kidnapped because she\u2019d been taken unaware by someone she knew and had thought she could trust.</p><p>Just like Thorne Bigelow.</p><p>Who hadn\u2019t survived.</p><p>She thought about Lori Star and suddenly felt the urge to know her better.</p><p>It was a bit too late to get to know the woman herself, but there were other ways to find out more about her. Of course, Joe would be furious if she went out, investigating on her own.</p><p>Screw Joe. He certainly wasn\u2019t consulting her about his plans.</p><p>She grabbed her keys and hurried out, but she didn\u2019t take her car. Downstairs, she greeted the doorman, and asked him to hail her a cab. At Lori Star\u2019s building, she exited and walked up the three flights of steps.</p><p>There was crime-scene tape on Lori\u2019s door, but she hadn\u2019t come to see the apartment. She strode over to Susie\u2019s door.</p><p>Before she could knock, it opened and Susie, her face swollen, peered out, looked around warily, then quickly drew Gen inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry for acting so hush-hush. The press keep coming around, even though they\u2019re not supposed to be able to get into the building,\u201d Susie said.</p><p>\u201cOh? No one stopped me,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cI guess most of the cops have cleared away. And maybe whoever is down there decided you didn\u2019t look like a reporter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Gen didn\u2019t think the police were actually watching the building at all anymore. She didn\u2019t tell Susie so, but she suspected the reporters probably thought they\u2019d gotten all they could from the neighbors.</p><p>Susie had evidently been through the wringer. She looked as if she had cried a lot and might start crying again at any moment. Genevieve\u2019s heart went out to her.</p><p>\u201cSome guy down there offered me a bunch of money if I had any sexy shots of Lori, or if I could tell him any sordid stories,\u201d she said, and sniffed contemptuously. \u201cAnd they called her a whore! They\u2019re just a pack of pimps themselves. I\u2019d never sell out a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lori would have appreciated that,\u201d Genevieve said, touching her arm consolingly.</p><p>Susie sniffed again, and wiped her cheeks, then tried to smile. \u201cYou\u2019re different, you and that guy, Joe. He wanted to help. I know he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Susie frowned. \u201cSo, uh, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Susie asked, her tone slightly apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure,\u201d Genevieve admitted. \u201cI guess...I guess I just wanted to get to know Lori now, even if it\u2019s too late. I feel that...knowing more about her might somehow help.\u201d</p><p>Susie indicated her couch. It was worn, but the apartment was neat and tidy. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll tell you what I can. She really did want to be an actress, you know. She worked a lot as an extra, and she went to auditions...even got some callbacks. But she didn\u2019t get that one break she really needed.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve nodded encouragingly and waited for Susie to go on.</p><p>\u201cShe was...she was just real, I guess you could say.\u201d Susie hesitated. \u201cDid she turn tricks? Well, yes, but she was discreet. She went with guys she liked and accepted what she could get. But she really worked at being an actress, and I think she would have made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did she go by Candy Cane? Why did she give that name when she was arrested?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>Susie laughed with dry humor. \u201cI\u2019m Peppermint Patsy. We all use names when we go clubbing. You don\u2019t always want to be known. Hell, if I\u2019m out for a good time and need a little sustenance from a guy, I don\u2019t want him knowing who I really am.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve asked, \u201cDo you think she realized, when she went to the press, that they would check her out and discover her arrest record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she thought it was worth the risk. The thing is, when she talked about what she saw, she was telling the truth. She believed it with her whole heart. She wouldn\u2019t have lied to me.\u201d Another big tear fell on Susie\u2019s cheek. \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch and then you die. Sucks, huh?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve felt her old life suddenly wrapping around her. \u201cSusie, I can\u2019t help Lori now. But if you want to get a real job\u2014where you have to work hard, but you\u2019ll make good money\u2014I can manage that for you.\u201d</p><p>Susie grimaced. \u201cI work hard now. I just don\u2019t seem to get anywhere. I flipped hamburgers for a while, but I couldn\u2019t pay the rent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you. I know of a place where you can work out front and make good tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a pole involved?\u201d Susie asked skeptically.</p><p>Genevieve laughed. \u201cNo. It\u2019s an old Irish pub. They\u2019re always busy, so they\u2019re always looking for waitresses, and I swear, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can get me a job there?\u201d Susie was clearly still doubtful. \u201cWhere is it? I couldn\u2019t keep one job because even with the subway, it still meant a mile walk, and I was always either late or nearly getting mugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s walking distance from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowntown?\u201d Susie asked.</p><p>Gen nodded. To her distress, Susie suddenly burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Genevieve said quickly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just that Lori loved downtown so much. You know what she always told me she would have been, if she\u2019d ever made it through school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn archeologist. She loved all the old buildings downtown. Trinity Church, St. Paul\u2019s, City Hall...Fraunces Tavern, even though it\u2019s pretty much a made-up restoration. She spent her life hanging out in old places. She even liked cemeteries.\u201d</p><p>Susie started crying so hard at that point that she couldn\u2019t talk anymore, but Genevieve couldn\u2019t find the words to stop her. She was too busy thinking that Leslie MacIntyre would probably have loved to know Lori Star, no matter what she\u2019d done for a living. From what she\u2019d learned about Leslie, she hadn\u2019t been the kind of person to judge others.</p><p>She suddenly felt as if she really had gotten to know Lori Star. She rose quickly and extended her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll find out about that job for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you really do wield a lot of power,\u201d Susie said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I know people who do.\u201d</p><p>Susie was silent for another moment, then asked, \u201cDo you think you can find a way to keep Lori out of a pauper\u2019s grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Genevieve promised.</p><p>At the door to the apartment, Susie impulsively hugged her.</p><p>She hugged Susie in return, and thought back to the days before the kidnapping. She had known her way around then. She had changed things with indignation and by insisting that people do their jobs. Right now, though, she was just grateful that she had come from money, because there were promises that enabled her to make.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you, and don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not hot air. I\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Genevieve promised.</p><p>Susie thanked her, managing to regain her composure as she wiped her cheeks.</p><p>Genevieve noticed the time when she was out on the street. She had stayed longer than she intended. It was already midday, and finding a taxi to take her back to her apartment shouldn\u2019t have been hard. But short of throwing herself on top of one, she didn\u2019t seem to be able to get anyone to stop.</p> <p>Cursing beneath her breath, she simply started to walk.</p><p>Move fast. He\u2019s behind you.</p><p>She jumped, stopped and spun around, staring.</p><p>A man with a Yorkie on a leash was to her left. A priest nodded politely as he passed. Two black-clad goths, laughing together, were ambling along in her direction, and a woman in high heels, carrying a briefcase, was talking on her phone as she wove through the others.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, telling herself that she must have imagined the voice, she started walking again.</p><p>Hurry. Please hurry.</p><p>It was broad daylight, and the streets were bustling. She couldn\u2019t possibly be in any danger.</p><p>But just as that thought went through her mind, she passed a narrow alley that seemed to contain nothing but dirt and shadows, even at high noon. An attacker could simply push someone into it and...</p><p>She quickened her pace, noticing what she seldom did: that there were numerous little alcoves along the way\u2014between buildings, at construction sites\u2014where someone could suddenly take a step\u2014and then disappear.</p><p>And suddenly she knew with complete certainty that she was being stalked.</p><p>She hurried out to the street, her arm raised to attract a taxi, determined not to budge from the spot until she caught one.</p><p>Maybe the driver of the next taxi sensed her intense determination. Maybe she had managed to develop new powers of mind control. Who the hell knew?</p><p>The important thing was that he stopped, and she immediately slid into the backseat and gave him her address, then looked anxiously back at the sidewalk.</p><p>There were so many people there, but there was one man. His back was to her, and he was wearing a hat and a trench coat. She couldn\u2019t have said whether he was young or old, light or dark. But she got the strongest feeling that he had stopped and turned away because he knew she was looking back.</p><p>The taxi moved, and she told herself she was crazy. But she couldn\u2019t stop wondering why he\u2019d been staring so intently into the window of a women\u2019s shoe store.</p><p>When she got out of the cab in front of her building, she felt ridiculously grateful to see her longtime doorman, and she gave him a huge smile as she went over to chat. Adam was due in ten minutes, so she would just stay close to safety until he showed up, and worry about her sanity later.</p><p>Joe still couldn\u2019t quite believe that he was meeting what boiled down to a pack of psychics for lunch. He respected Adam Harrison, and he knew Leslie had loved the man, who had been her salvation after the explosion at Hastings House.</p><p>Joe had argued that he simply didn\u2019t believe in any of it. He\u2019d known even then that he had been lying, but it was almost as if by refusing to acknowledge what was going on, he could make it go away.</p><p>Adam Harrison, however, had a way of making believing in things simple.</p><p>\u201cIf my colleagues and I can help in any way, why not let us try?\u201d Adam had asked calmly. \u201cYou want to catch this guy sooner rather than later, right?\u201d</p><p>And Joe had pictured the body of Lori Star, lying on the autopsy table, then thought of the way she had died, and how he kept seeing Genevieve being throttled in his nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, what the hell.\u201d</p><p>But as one o\u2019clock loomed closer, he grew impatient. That morning, he had felt as if he were on to something at last, and what he was thinking required legwork. He wanted to know where every single member of the Ravens had been, not just at the time of Thorne Bigelow\u2019s death, but during every related incident. He had called Raif, who had assured him that he and Tom would be on it, and Joe knew they could check out alibis just as accurately as he could himself and probably a lot more easily. But...</p><p>But he preferred things he heard for himself. He believed them. Or, more important, sometimes he didn\u2019t believe them. Body language, tone of voice...those were things that were often far more honest than words.</p><p>But he had agreed to meet with Adam, so he found himself downtown at a quiet restaurant, one of the old steak houses that had been around forever. He gave his name at the door and was led to a table for five, where he saw that Brent Blackhawk was already waiting.</p><p>Blackhawk was an intriguing man, with the very strong features associated with Native Americans, but with light-colored eyes that made his face instantly arresting. He had the look of a natural athlete.</p><p>He was alone at the table, reading the menu. But when he saw Brent, the man rose, and his smile was natural and welcoming. \u201cHi, Joe. Good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>The two men hadn\u2019t seen each other since shortly after Leslie\u2019s funeral. Leslie had liked and trusted Brent, just as she had his wife, Nikki.</p><p>Blackhawk was a decent guy, Joe knew. He was smart, assertive without being aggressive, and he liked sports. He was a man\u2019s man. What the hell was not to like about him?</p><p>How about that he believed in a world around them that most people didn\u2019t see? And Joe had no intention of becoming someone like that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too, Brent,\u201d Joe said, but words were stiff, even though he tried hard to hide his wariness. \u201cHow\u2019s Nikki?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVery well. She\u2019ll be right here\u2014she just stopped off in the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Joe sat, wondering what the hell he was supposed to say now.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been doing?\u201d Brent asked, picking up the slack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here because Adam called you, so I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what you were doing. I asked how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, do I see Leslie in my dreams at night? No,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t add that he did hear her whisper at strange times, that he even thought his cousin, gone two years now, had talked to him.</p><p>He knew he was being offensive, but Brent didn\u2019t seem to be bothered. His shrug was easy.</p><p>At that moment Nikki walked over to the table. She was a beautiful woman, with light breezy hair, fine features and, like her husband, a natural ease of movement.</p><p>Both men rose.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Joe?\u201d Nikki had a radiant smile. She was so light and delicate. Brent was so dark and solid. They made a beautiful couple, Joe decided, and he couldn\u2019t help liking them. There was simply nothing about them to dislike, even if they did believe in ghosts.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut the circumstances in which we meet don\u2019t get any better, do they?\u201d There was that damned hostility in his tone again, he thought.</p><p>\u201cThe point is that we have to make the current circumstances better,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do so well last time, did we?\u201d Joe asked, then winced. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. We all tried. So hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Nikki said, laying her hand gently over his.</p><p>He looked into her eyes. They were large and filled with empathy. Not pity, empathy. \u201cYeah, well...So are we going to try some kind of hocus-pocus? Is that what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>A look flashed from Brent to Nikki, and Joe thought the other man\u2019s normal equanimity was about to break. Brent looked as if he were about to say something pointed, but apparently his wife kicked him beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cBrent\u2019s great with intuition\u2014and a computer,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNikki, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Brent said. \u201cWe all know where you and I...come from. But at the moment, I gather Joe\u2019s been having some different experiences of his own.\u201d</p><p>There was an edge to Brent\u2019s final words, and Joe had to admit, he deserved it. But as for his own \u201cdifferent\u201d experiences...he would be damned if he was going to admit to them.</p><p>\u201cHave you shown him the articles yet?\u201d Nikki asked her husband.</p> <p>\u201cWhat articles?\u201d Joe asked sharply.</p><p>Brent reached down for a briefcase beside his chair, pulled out a folder and pushed it toward Joe, who opened it to see several photocopied pages.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead them.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked down. The first article was from a Richmond paper, dated three years earlier. The headline read, \u201cPoe Scholar Found Dead in Own Basement.\u201d</p> <p>Joe glanced up. Brent\u2019s face was impassive, so he went back to reading. According to the article, a literature professor named William Morton had been found dead inside his brick-walled wine cellar. He had been strangled. There was no mention of a note being found with his body, but given the Poe angle, a connection to the murders of Thorne Bigelow and Lori Star had to be considered.</p><p>\u201cDid the killer leave anything?\u201d Joe asked the other two. \u201cWas there a note found with the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the cops who worked the case,\u201d Brent said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone cold, but it\u2019s still open. And no, there was no note found with the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you, um, work the case yourself?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI just happen to know the cops who landed it,\u201d Brent said. \u201cCheck out the next article.\u201d</p><p>It was from a Baltimore paper, and it was dated a year ago. This headline read, \u201cProfessor Found in Family Tomb. Noted Poe Scholar Dead of Heart Attack.\u201d</p> <p>Joe read quickly through the article. Bradley Hicks, fifty, had been found lying on the floor of his family\u2019s mausoleum. The door had been unlocked, but the coroner\u2019s supposition was that the man had thought he was trapped, and that his terror had brought on the heart attack that killed him.</p><p>Joe looked up at Brent Blackhawk and his wife, who looked back at him without saying anything, allowing him to reach his own conclusions.</p><p>Joe skimmed both articles again.</p><p>The second mentioned the professor\u2019s scholarly monographs, and the first touted William Morton\u2019s acclaimed fictional account of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cNo note found at the second scene, either?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know about the Baltimore death until Adam called and I started doing research. In fact, Hicks\u2019s death isn\u2019t even on the books as a murder. It\u2019s listed as accidental. The investigators concluded that he went into the family mausoleum for whatever reason, thought he\u2019d locked himself in, then panicked, had a heart attack and died. As far as William Morton goes, I don\u2019t think anyone ever thought his murder had anything to do with Poe. And maybe it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared thoughtfully into space. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. Blackhawk had presented him with some really solid research, the type that could give him what he needed to crack the case.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to find out if any of the New York board members were in either city at the relevant times,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNone of them,\u201d Brent said. \u201cAt least, none of them was living in either place.\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve already checked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cBut either one is easily reachable from here,\u201d Nikki put in. \u201cBy air or driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know if any of the board members were on vacation in either area at the time?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had time to pull their credit-card records. We\u2019re looking at three different cities and three different states, but we\u2019ll get there,\u201d Brent said. He tapped on the paper. \u201cI know William Morton\u2019s widow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Joe looked up at him. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I happened to meet her when I was in Richmond, doing some...some work at Hollywood Cemetery there. She had brought flowers. We talked. I\u2019d say she considers me a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we interview her?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. And here\u2019s something interesting. Her husband knew Thorne Bigelow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprising, given that they were both interested in Poe. Still, the police in both jurisdictions should start coordinating their investigations. In fact, the FBI should be involved,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they will be,\u201d Brent said, leaning back. \u201cBut we\u2019re still talking law-enforcement agencies, and lots of legal hurdles they can\u2019t circumvent.\u201d</p><p>Joe felt as if he were listening to Raif Green. Cops couldn\u2019t always do what he did. They were public servants.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Just then Brent looked past him and rose. Turning, Joe saw that Adam and Genevieve had arrived. Adam was wearing a suit and looked as if he belonged on Wall Street. And Genevieve...</p><p>He winced inwardly. Her eyes were on his, and they were full of hurt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away. He wondered if she could read his own feeling of betrayal in his eyes.</p><p>But despite that, he also felt an instant surge of appreciation for the fact that she was there. He realized, seeing her, the luster of her hair, the easy grace of her movements, even that look in her eyes, that, whether he liked it or not, she had come to mean so much to him. No, not so much. Everything.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He turned away. He couldn\u2019t help it. He was still angry. She had asked for his help, and he had given her his best. And she? She had betrayed him.</p><p>She had called in Adam Harrison.</p><p>And then she was there, exchanging hugs and hellos.</p><p>\u201cBrent, Nikki, it\u2019s wonderful to see you again. Thanks so much for coming.\u201d Her greeting was enthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said, after greeting the others.</p><p>Little enthusiasm there.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gen,\u201d he replied, and gave her an awkward kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cShall we order drinks?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cThere are some loose ends I\u2019d like to tie up here,\u201d Joe told Brent, getting back to business\u2014and trying hard not to look at Gen\u2014once they\u2019d ordered iced tea all around. \u201cBut then I\u2019d like to stop by the Baltimore police station, and get down to Richmond and interview your cop friends. And the dead man\u2019s widow, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cBrent found some similar deaths that just might be related to your murders up here\u2014and might bring us closer to the truth,\u201d Adam explained.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Genevieve asked. \u201cSo when are we leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the afternoon for those loose ends I mentioned,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI want to bring Raif Green and Tom Dooley up to speed on what I\u2019ve just learned, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else I think we need to take care of,\u201d Brent told him.</p><p>Why the hell was the man looking at him that way? Joe wondered.</p><p>\u201cI think you and I need take a trip together first,\u201d Blackhawk said.</p><p>\u201cA trip together? What are you talking about?\u201d Joe asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cHastings House,\u201d Blackhawk said.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Genevieve saw Joe\u2019s expression darken and knew he wasn\u2019t pleased, to say the least.</p><p>And yet, though she had enlisted Adam\u2019s help because of Joe, she was tempted to say, \u201cHey, what about me? I need some help, too.\u201d</p><p>But she had never mentioned her own strange experiences to Joe, any more than he had confided in her about what was preying on his mind and making him act so strangely. Maybe she was like him, determined not to acknowledge the reality of certain things. At the same time, the very fact that she had called Adam in meant she was at least a little bit more receptive than Joe was.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t eaten yet, but suddenly Joe stood and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. But you\u2019ll have to excuse me. I just remembered something I have to do. Enjoy your lunch,\u201d he added. Then he turned and left.</p><p>And that was it. Everyone else at the table was left staring after him.</p><p>\u201cHmm, that went well,\u201d Nikki said, after a moment.</p><p>And Genevieve had to laugh, even if there was just a hint of a sob in it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, that went well,\u201d Nikki repeated.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us all to go fuck ourselves, for one thing,\u201d Brent said, offering her an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cBrent...\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Then Adam waved the waiter over, and Gen realized they were still going to have lunch, though she was sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat a thing.</p><p>\u201cHow about you? How are you doing?\u201d Nikki asked her, once they\u2019d placed their orders.</p><p>Genevieve looked at the other woman, her senior by only a few years. She suddenly envied her tremendously. She was fully comfortable with her \u201cgift,\u201d whether other people believed in it or not, and she was also head over heels in love with her husband, who had an ever greater \u201cgift\u201d and who completely understood her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just the stress getting to me, because I thought...well, I mean, it\u2019s not like anyone was really even there,\u201d she said, then bit her lip. She hadn\u2019t really intended to say that out loud, had she?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brent asked, and flashed a glance at Nikki.</p><p>Genevieve winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Like I said, it\u2019s just the stress of worrying about my mother and the whole Poe thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Nikki mused, obviously sensing Gen\u2019s discomfort and willing to let her off the hook, at least for now, \u201cthere are Poe tours here in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting we take one?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was surprised to discover that the offer of the diversion was a welcome one, even for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While they waited for their meals, Adam made a call and set everything up, and as soon as they finished their meal, they were on their way. Their guide was knowledgeable, taking them around the city by minivan, pointing out Poe\u2019s familiar haunts in Greenwich Village, and describing what the Five Points area would have been like in the eighteen-forties so well that they could practically see gangs like the Forty-Thieves and the Plug-Uglies running rampant. Then he took them up to Fordham, in the Bronx, where they visited the Poe Cottage, where his beloved wife\u2014and cousin\u2014Virginia had died, finally succumbing to tuberculosis.</p><p>Brent didn\u2019t spend much time in the cottage. Genevieve came across him standing outside. It was a beautiful day, and his head was lifted up to the sunshine and the blue sky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not enjoying the tour?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot the cottage,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cDid, um, anyone in there...talk to you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, amused by her reticence to talk about something he considered totally normal, but he didn\u2019t answer directly. \u201cThere\u2019s just such an aura of sadness there.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything else, but she felt that as if she could read his thoughts, and she knew that being inside the cottage was actually painful for him.</p><p>She almost told him then about her feeling that someone had whispered in her ear, asking for help, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to say anything.</p><p>The tour ended at the cottage, and as they headed back into Manhattan, Adam suggested that they call Eileen and arrange to pick her up to have dinner.</p> <p>\u201cAt O\u2019Malley\u2019s?\u201d Genevieve teased.</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Still, when they returned to the Village and his driver picked them up, Adam leaned forward and gave him the address for Hastings House, rather than Eileen\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cI...thought we were picking up my mother?\u201d Gen said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and tell her we\u2019ll be a few minutes late,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>By the time they reached the street where the historic house sat, the workday was at an end, darkness was falling and the neighborhood seemed almost eerily quiet. Adam\u2019s driver parked and waited, while the rest of them got out and stood on the sidewalk, staring up at the house.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s closed by now,\u201d Genevieve said to Adam. \u201cIf you want to get in after hours, you can call tomorrow, and I\u2019m sure the powers that be will give you a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need a key,\u201d he said, and started across the street.</p><p>Gen looked at Brent and Nikki, hoping that they would linger behind, but they didn\u2019t. They followed Adam without hesitation.</p><p>As Adam approached the gate, it opened. Genevieve swallowed hard. She was afraid. She didn\u2019t want to be, but she was. A locked gate shouldn\u2019t have opened that way, without even being touched.</p><p>To add to her discomfort, it seemed that the sky went from dusk to full dark as she hurried across the street and followed the others up the path to the porch.</p><p>Joe had been here the other night and found Debbie, who had insisted that the house had opened up and saved her.</p><p>Genevieve wanted to run and almost did, but Nikki slipped an arm around her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing evil waiting for you here, I promise you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Gen was embarrassed, not wanting to appear cowardly. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she agreed.</p> <p>It was too hard to explain to Nikki that just because something wasn\u2019t evil, it could still be terrifying.</p><p>Gen followed the rest of them to the door.</p><p>Which opened.</p><p>Gen shuddered and told herself that Hastings House was good, It had saved Debbie. It was good.</p><p>It was also scary as hell.</p><p>But she walked in anyway.</p><p>\u201cLeslie?\u201d Nikki asked softly at her side. \u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve froze, not knowing what to expect, much less what she wanted to happen. She closed her eyes, terrified that when she opened them she would see a white mist turning into the woman she had known so briefly.</p><p>The woman who had died in her stead.</p><p>But nothing materialized. When she opened her eyes, there was no giant cloud of white mist. She could feel the air, though, and it wasn\u2019t cold or unpleasant. It felt as if it were moving around her with a comforting warmth. Almost as if it were holding her, trying to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d Adam asked very softly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brent told him.</p><p>\u201cDid they say why?\u201d the older man asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Joe and Genevieve,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in danger?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, because Joe didn\u2019t mean to, but he opened a door,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cSo why is Genevieve feeling things, hearing them?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cPlease ask them.\u201d</p><p>Brent turned to the older man, grinning. \u201cThey can hear you, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve felt ready to scream. They were acting so...normal, and she could feel her hair standing on end, despite the warmth swirling around her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Adam persisted.</p><p>But Brent didn\u2019t answer, walking away from them and seeming to tense up at something Gen could neither see nor hear.</p><p>\u201cBrent?\u201d Adam asked worriedly.</p><p>Brent turned to face them, his eyes reflecting the red security lights with an eerie glow. \u201cGenevieve was the intended target,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gen gasped.</p><p>\u201cThe killer wanted you,\u201d Brent said flatly. \u201cLori Star had to die because of what she saw, but in the killer\u2019s mind, you would have been the perfect victim. You\u2019re the beauty who held the city spellbound when you disappeared, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Adam urged.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s still on his list,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cThe killer still wants Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>Irish whiskey was not her favorite drink, but Gen managed to down quite a bit of it anyway. Beer just wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough.</p><p>Adam had called Eileen to explain that they would be a bit later than expected, only to have her tell him that she\u2019d realized she had to finish up some paperwork for one of her charities before she went out, so she would arrange for car service to drive her to the pub and meet them there.</p><p>\u201cGen, you\u2019ve got to calm down,\u201d Nikki told her, taking her hand from across the table.</p><p>\u201cCalm down? The man who killed Lori Star really wanted to kill me.\u201d She felt hysteria rising. \u201cNot to mention that we went to a house I know was locked that unlocked itself for us, and you and Brent talked to ghosts, who told me that I\u2019m still on the killer\u2019s list. And you want me to calm down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it that way...\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Adam put his hand on her chin, turning her to face him. \u201cLook, Genevieve, I know this is all a lot to take. But I know that you already know spirits can linger behind. And you\u2019re tough\u2014hell, you already survived one maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and being taken by a maniac should be like being struck by lightning, shouldn\u2019t it? I mean, the whole world is not peopled by maniacs, and lightning isn\u2019t supposed to strike twice in the same place,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s scary, but you needed to know,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>Brent leaned forward, taking both her hands and holding them until she looked at him. \u201cGenevieve, you have to stay with one of us at all times, or with Joe. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve taken a lot of self-defense classes.\u201d</p><p>Right, she thought. Like that really helped right now. She tried to get a grip on her emotions. Safe. She would be safe with this group.</p><p>Who the hell was ever really safe?</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment and listened to the band. They were singing \u201cDanny Boy,\u201d and it was beautiful.</p><p>It was also about death.</p><p>She swallowed another gulp of straight whiskey. She had to get a grip on herself, and she knew it. She took a deep breath and felt alcohol send pure heat streaming into her blood and bones. \u201cIf...if Matt and Leslie are really still in that house\u2014in their spiritual forms, at least\u2014and they know so much, why don\u2019t they just tell us who the killer is?\u201d she challenged, disbelief strong in her voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause they can only report on what\u2019s out there,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve lost me,\u201d Genevieve told him.</p><p>\u201cGhosts aren\u2019t all-seeing and all-knowing.\u201d He smiled. \u201cThey know things because they hear people talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they read the newspaper,\u201d Nikki offered.</p><p>Genevieve stared at her blankly. \u201cThey read the newspaper?\u201d she repeated. \u201cThey read the newspaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people who work there bring in the papers or a magazine, and then Leslie and Matt read them,\u201d Nikki explained. \u201cActually, that\u2019s one of the biggest clues that you have a spirit in your house. You come home, and you\u2019d swear you left a magazine by your favorite chair, but you find it on the kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve couldn\u2019t help it. She lifted a hand in a casual wave. \u201cWell, of course. How the hell could I have missed that? Of course spirits exist. I believe you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do believe, Genevieve. You called me,\u201d Adam reminded her. \u201cYou called me about Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd about yourself,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot at first, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut time to \u2019fess up,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been going on with you?\u201d</p><p>And so she told them. Told them about the nightmare, and then the whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be Lori,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cMatt was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt was right?\u201d Gen echoed skeptically. \u201cAnd what was Leslie\u2019s guess? Elvis?\u201d</p><p>Brent leaned forward. \u201cI know this all sounds really weird to you, but you have to understand...Matt is better at being a ghost than Leslie. He\u2019s been a ghost longer, and once you die, you have to learn everything all over again. You become pure energy, and you have to learn to do things by focusing that energy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why some places that are haunted have more obvious manifestations than others,\u201d Nikki explained. \u201cThe ghosts there have been around a while, and they\u2019ve learned to manifest more strongly and to affect the physical realm, even to leave \u2018their\u2019 place and go out into the world. Leslie isn\u2019t able to get out much yet,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cAnd Matt hates to leave her,\u201d Brent put in.</p><p>\u201cSo Matt can go out?\u201d Genevieve asked. She couldn\u2019t believe they were having this conversation.</p> <p>Nikki nodded. \u201cAnd he spoke to the spirit of Lori Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Genevieve said, feeling her skepticism disappearing in the face of their matter-of-fact belief. \u201cSo why doesn\u2019t she tell him who killed her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell can she not know?\u201d Genevieve demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was disguised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Did he dress up like a dragon or a giant turkey or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nikki said, laughing.</p><p>Genevieve took a deep breath. \u201cBut we do know she was killed by a man, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost certain. Because her killer was very strong,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost certain? How can she not know if it was a man or a woman? What was the killer dressed up as?\u201d</p><p>Nikki and Brent exchanged a glance. \u201cEdgar Allan Poe,\u201d he finally said.</p> <p>After he\u2019d walked out on lunch, Joe had pulled out his cell and given Raif a call and asked if the cops had come up with anything, but other than a stack of mostly anonymous and probably mistaken tips that Lori had been seen in various parts of the five boroughs, he had nothing.</p><p>\u201cShit, Joe. You know how it is,\u201d Raif said. \u201cWe have to check out every lead. Policework has to be thorough. And being thorough takes time.\u201d</p><p>Time.</p><p>Joe had a feeling he didn\u2019t have much of it.</p><p>Joe thanked Raif and hung up, knowing the detective was right. Legwork took time, and it was frequently tedious.</p><p>He went back to his apartment to be alone, to think, and to do some legwork of his own, including calling the Ravens, starting with the women. His plan was not to ask them about the Sunday night when Lori had disappeared but to start casually with the previous night, when what had now been confirmed as an extra dose of morphine had almost finished Sam Latham.</p><p>Barbara Hirshorn was first on his list. He tried her at the library where she worked, and after a few minutes the young man who had answered the phone found her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Connolly?\u201d she said curiously.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Barbara, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified, to tell you the truth. I\u2019m afraid to walk through the stacks. Last night I couldn\u2019t even stand to be at home after I left work. I was so glad everyone decided to go to the pub. Lila picked me up and saw me home, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now. I can\u2019t afford to take the car service everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you up to on Sunday, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave my apartment. I was too shaken up by Thorne\u2019s death. Honestly, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>He said something reassuring and hung up. According to what she\u2019d volunteered, she\u2019d gotten off work and gone straight home, but was there any proof of that? He was glad the police had decided to keep the attack on Sam a secret. Only the killer would know that anything had happened, so only he or she would think to come up with a lie, and lies could be found out.</p><p>He continued to make calls to see what the rest of the Ravens had to say. Last night Lila had gone straight from a fashion show to pick up her friends, and then she had gone to the pub. He could verify that, and he did. Lila Hawkins hadn\u2019t left the showing on Fifth Avenue until seven, and based on what Barbara had said, the rest of the timing fit, too. According to her, she\u2019d spent the Sunday at her daughter\u2019s house on Long Island, and he would verify that, too, if need be.</p><p>Lou Sayles had picked up her kids, which he confirmed by calling the school. She\u2019d spent Sunday with her family, at a Little League game, and the game checked out, though he would have to do more investigating to confirm that she had been there.</p><p>And Eileen...Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have told her about the attempt on Sam\u2019s life at the hospital, but it was too late to worry about that now.</p><p>He caught her at her desk. \u201cHi, Joe. I\u2019ll see you at dinner, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner? Where?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, I suppose we should all be getting a bit sick of it, but...O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I guess. Later,\u201d he said. \u201cSo are you with Genevieve?\u201d he asked, after satisfying himself as to her whereabouts at the times in question.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s out with Adam, and Nikki and Brent.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced. His own fault for walking out on the lunch, he supposed. \u201cThey would never leave her alone, would they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Eileen assured him. \u201cI thought that you were with them, as well.\u201d</p><p>He heard the slight reproach in that, but thanked her and told her that he would see her later.</p><p>He called Mary Vincenzo next. Just as he was expecting to get her machine, she answered, sounding as if she had been sleeping. Or smoking dope. There was an odd mockery mixed with sensuality in her voice tone. \u201cWhy, Mr. Connolly, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering where you were last night?\u201d he asked after the usual pleasantries, opting to be direct with her.</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she drawled.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind answering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s right. You\u2019re everyone\u2019s savior, aren\u2019t you, Mr. Connolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Vincenzo, if you would just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer being called Mary,\u201d she said, interrupting him.</p><p>\u201cMary, if you don\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at Jared\u2019s penthouse. If you must know, we were fucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see...Sunday. Hmm. Oh, we were fucking then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be quite the Energizer Bunny,\u201d he told her pleasantly.</p><p>She was silent for a moment, and he realized with a flash of insight that she hadn\u2019t been sleeping or getting stoned. She\u2019d been drinking.</p><p>\u201cCan anyone verify that you were there all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that we invite people in to watch us while we\u2019re fucking?\u201d she drawled insinuatingly.</p><p>\u201cCan anyone verify you were together at Jared\u2019s penthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have people over,\u201d she mused. \u201cI mean, they talk about us already. You talked about us. In fact, you knew about us. When others didn\u2019t. Maybe we should have you over. You could even join us, if you\u2019d like. How big are you down there, Mr. Connolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for talking to me, Mary,\u201d he said, and hung up, then put her name right under Jared\u2019s in the \u201cpotentially guilty\u201d column.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like her, so maybe that wasn\u2019t fair. If it came to that, he didn\u2019t like Jared, either. But the truth was that Jared was the major beneficiary of his father\u2019s death, and Mary benefitted through Jared.</p><p>He kept calling and making lists. He was certain the police were making the same lists and decided they ought to compare them.</p><p>Larry Levine had once again been at the newspaper, something Joe had no trouble verifying. The reporter couldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d done during the day on Sunday, but he\u2019d been drinking at O\u2019Malley\u2019s\u2014of course\u2014most of the evening, and a legitimate alibi for Sunday automatically made him a less likely suspect, so...scratch Larry.</p><p>Don Tracy had been at the theater until almost seven. He wouldn\u2019t have had much time to get to the hospital. Possible, but unlikely. Still...And on Sunday he\u2019d had a matinee, but matinees were over by five or five-thirty.</p><p>Nat Halloway had been at his office until he left for the pub, in plain view of half a dozen people yesterday afternoon. Sunday he\u2019d been home alone.</p><p>Finally Joe called the Bigelow mansion. Albee Bennet answered after the third ring.</p><p>\u201cHi, Albee. Joe Connolly here\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Connolly, hello. Can I help you in some way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoutine, Albee. Where were you on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Mr. Connolly. I don\u2019t seem to have the heart to do much else but stay home. Mr. Jared is still up in the air about what to do with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappily, I will be. I won\u2019t be rich, but I\u2019m sure that Thorny saw to it that I\u2019d be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stay home night and day, do you?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much so, Mr. Connolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much so, Mr. Joe. Last night I raided the DVD library. I watched three old movies, made some popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWell, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated then, thinking about the information Brent had passed on about the other two deaths. \u201cAlbee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Thorny\u2014Mr. Bigelow\u2014like to travel a lot? When he was researching his book, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, certainly. We got around. We spent a lot of time in Philly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Richmond, say, or Baltimore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember dates offhand, but, yes, we were down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Mr. Bigelow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. And Jared, of course. And Miss Mary.\u201d</p><p>Jared and Mary, too? Now things were really getting interesting, Joe thought.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>Genevieve had to admit to being surprised when she saw Joe walk into the pub.</p><p>\u201cJoe, hello,\u201d she slurred somewhat drunkenly as he pulled up a chair at the end of the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She saw him look questioningly at Adam, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLong day,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cReally? What did you do with your long day?\u201d Joe asked him.</p> <p>\u201cWe played tourist,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Eileen? Didn\u2019t she come with you?\u201d he asked, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cEileen is fine. She called about five minutes ago and made her apologies. She\u2019s tired and decided to stay home,\u201d Adam explained.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Adam asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Joe said, and glanced at Genevieve.</p> <p>She smiled pleasantly at him but kept silent and played with the condensation on her glass, knowing she was too far beyond tipsy to safely speak. She focused on the music, which was really quite good, she decided. And the whiskey wasn\u2019t half bad, either. In fact, the more she drank, the better it tasted.</p><p>Frowning, Joe returned his attention to Adam. \u201cI talked to the Ravens, and also to Albee Bennet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPoor old Albee,\u201d Genevieve put in, her words slurred.</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Joe asked, looking at Nikki.</p><p>Trust a guy, Gen thought, to figure only a woman would have another woman figured out. Chauvinist. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and I can speak for myself white...quite well, thank you,\u201d she told him, her delivery giving the lie to her words.</p><p>He studied her for a long moment, then clearly made the decision to ignore her. \u201cAlbee said that Thorne had traveled to research his book. He\u2019d been to Richmond, Baltimore and Philly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...Thorne was the victim,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t travel alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! The butler did do it!\u201d Genevieve said triumphantly and much too loudly.</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>Joe said, \u201cJared and Mary accompanied him on all his trips, along with Albee.\u201d</p><p>Brent frowned. \u201cThe son and the sister-in-law. They would be at cross concerns, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Mary. And I think she\u2019d lie in a second flat to give Jared an alibi,\u201d Joe said. \u201cThey\u2019re sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s his aunt,\u201d Nikki said.</p> <p>\u201cBy marriage,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Genevieve offered. \u201cThat\u2019s just...ewwww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think Jared did it?\u201d Adam asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him, so that probably adds to my conviction,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing to prove it. But he\u2019s the major beneficiary, and the person supporting him\u2014saying that he gave his father CPR, even though the body was found at the desk\u2014is Mary. It bothered me from the beginning, the position of the body. Everything could have an explanation, but it\u2019s all starting to add up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jared Bigelow could look like Poe,\u201d Genevieve announced happily.</p><p>Joe stared at her, frowning. \u201cWhat the hell is she talking about?\u201d he asked the table at large.</p><p>\u201cLong story, better left for another day,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Joe groaned.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019ll get my driver and see Genevieve home,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Joe stood. \u201cI\u2019ll take her home,\u201d he said in a tone that dared anyone to contradict him.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Genevieve said, and stared at Joe, trying to focus. It would have helped a lot if his head had stayed still. \u201cDon\u2019t you want dinner? And what if I want to stay?\u201d</p><p>Joe ignored her and turned to Brent. \u201cAre we still heading out tomorrow?\u201d When Brent nodded, Joe added, \u201cDo you mind an early start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Brent said. \u201cHow early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. We\u2019ll make it on down to Richmond, stay there overnight, then hit Baltimore on the way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange for a larger car,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cIs your car big enough?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Joe crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI thought just Brent, Nikki and I would go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you are just full of it?\u201d Genevieve said angrily.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe I\u2019m your employer,\u201d she said, trying to sound dignified, but she heard her own voice, and knew she just sounded snotty.</p><p>\u201cI quit, then,\u201d Joe told her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t quit. You...you owe my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, you need to go home and get some sleep,\u201d Nikki said gently. \u201cIn the morning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning Adam and I will be going with you on that trip or I will be doing whatever the hell I want back here in New York,\u201d she said icily, then winced. Oh, God, she really did sound like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take her home now,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAdam, we won\u2019t need a car service. I\u2019d like to drive, so we\u2019ll just rent something.\u201d He inhaled deeply as he clenched his teeth. \u201cSomething big enough that the five of us can be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Genevieve said primly, though she was tempted to cry. \u201cAnd now I need to go home,\u201d she said, standing and immediately starting to teeter as her head spun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Joe said, and put his arms around her to steady her.</p><p>The world was still spinning, but one thought occurred to her very clearly. Yes, you do have me. Too bad neither one of us can tell if you actually want me or not.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Joe said to the others. \u201cSee you at six o\u2019clock at Gen\u2019s, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And I\u2019ll arrange the rental,\u201d Adam said. \u201cJust one thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Joe replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything tomorrow, but for now, Genevieve can\u2019t be left alone. Not for a minute, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Joe said huskily.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t, Gen thought. Not yet, anyway. How on earth were they going to explain to him that the killer had dressed up as Poe to abduct Lori, even though she herself would have been his preferred victim, and that they knew this because Lori\u2019s ghost had passed the message through Leslie and Matt, who were still hanging around at Hastings House? That was so not going to go over well.</p><p>As they walked toward Joe\u2019s car, his arm still around her to keep her upright, he suddenly stopped and stared into the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied after a long moment.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there, you know,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Ghosts, she thought, but decided not to say so.</p><p>\u201cI heard footsteps. Real footsteps,\u201d he said, when she didn\u2019t answer his question.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cThat\u2019s because there are real people in this city, lots of them.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, and she could see him decide not to argue with her. It was scary, the way she was able to read his expressions, she thought, sure that if she hadn\u2019t been with him, he would have investigated further.</p><p>The sounds from the pub were distant, and the street was quiet. He stood still for a minute longer, then urged her on to his car.</p><p>He was quiet as they drove, and she concentrated on not being sick. She felt his eyes touch her now and then, but they reached her building in silence. He signed in so he could get a visitor\u2019s parking pass from Tim, who welcomed them both with a friendly smile.</p><p>As soon as Joe parked, she started to get out of the car on her own, certain she could accomplish the feat, but she fell back into the seat as she tried to stand, and the door swung back on her. By then Joe had rounded the car to help her, and he held the door open and helped her out, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re going to be up to traveling tomorrow morning or not, Miss O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit...tired. I assure you, I can handle my whiskey. It was Irish whiskey, after all, and I am Irish,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Irish, let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his overnight bag from the trunk, then supported her into the building and up to her apartment, where she made a studied point of getting her door open. \u201cCan I make you tea or something?\u201d she asked politely. The words were clear, but she ruined the effect by staggering.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Keep walking, straight to bed. Where are those hangover pills you gave me the other morning? Might help if you took a few now.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand in the direction of the bathroom. He led her to her bed, supporting her while pulling down the sheets, and left her sitting there on the edge of the mattress. A minute later he was back with the pills and a tumbler of water. As soon as she had taken the pills, he took off her shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really all right,\u201d she said, but she was shielding her eyes from the light that seemed to radiate like fire from the bedside lamp.</p><p>He turned it off, helped her lie down and pulled the covers over her.</p><p>\u201cIs the room spinning even with the light off?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope the pills kick in soon, then.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was both floating in her own wavering world and simultaneously aware that he had undressed and climbed in beside her. She inched closer to him. After a minute, she heard him sigh. And then his arm came around her, and he pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell made you do this?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cGhosts,\u201d she said, before she could stop herself.</p><p>He tensed, and she thought he was going to pull away from her, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have called Adam,\u201d he said. \u201cGhosts...can\u2019t help. All they can do is muddle your mind. Remnants of the past that tear at your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were in love with her,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI could have been in love with her,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut she loved Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with him now, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, they\u2019re both dead,\u201d he said.</p><p>And despite the liquor sloshing around in her body and confusing her mind, she propped herself up on one elbow and stared down at him. It was now or never.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re together. Really together. And they can help us, if we let them. If you need everything to be flesh and blood, to be real and physical, go ahead and think it\u2019s all in your mind. Think of it as the memories pointing you in the right direction. Do whatever works for you, but just don\u2019t discount it. Don\u2019t be afraid, because you know I always had the feeling that Joe Connolly wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. And don\u2019t be angry with me about calling Adam. Leslie believed in ghosts, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s dead now,\u201d he interrupted harshly.</p><p>Because I\u2019m alive, Genevieve almost said.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>And neither did he.</p><p>Despite that, the words hung in the air between them, as if they were ghosts themselves.</p> <p>She was sure there was more she needed to say, as if this were an argument she needed to win. But then she sighed, exhaling all the air that was in her, and there was nowhere else left to go.</p><p>She lay back down, and the darkness continued to spin, weird little squiggles of light dancing behind her eyelids. No wonder she had spent so many years hating whiskey.</p><p>There was nothing but silence, and she thought he must have fallen asleep, so she was startled when his voice came out of the darkness, deep and tormented.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Genevieve, don\u2019t you see? I don\u2019t want that for you. You\u2019ve already suffered more than anyone should. And if you keep going in this direction\u2014whether it\u2019s in your mind, real...whatever\u2014you\u2019ll just stay tortured. You\u2019ll always be trying to understand, searching for another clue...Oh, God, never mind. I can\u2019t explain, it\u2019s just that...that world is that world. The dead are dead and gone. Let them rest in peace.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned by the passion of his words, and she let several seconds go by. Then she felt the mattress shift and sensed him looking down at her. She stared back up at him in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t rest in peace? What if they\u2019re here because they\u2019re determined to help us, whether we\u2019re able to accept their help or not?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said softly, reaching up, delicately brushing her fingers over the rugged contours of his face. \u201cJoe, something is haunting you, I know it,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt started...it started that night at O\u2019Malley\u2019s when you were the one who got drunk.\u201d</p><p>He lay down on his back beside her again, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get some sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was an argument she wasn\u2019t going to win, she thought. Not tonight, anyway. But maybe even an argument was better than the angry silence they\u2019d shared before. Just then he reached for her and drew her to his side.</p><p>Protectively.</p><p>It felt good, she thought, to be exactly where she was, even if he was just there as her guardian, a sentinel determined to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cTake another couple of these.\u201d</p><p>Joe was standing above her. He\u2019d already showered, and his hair was still damp, but he was already dressed to face the day.</p> <p>\u201cWhat...time is it?\u201d She squinted against the painful light of early morning and sat up, accepting the pills. She felt disoriented, but not as sick as she knew she deserved to, after everything she\u2019d had to drink. She just wanted to go back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cFive-thirty,\u201d he said.</p><p>She swallowed the pills. \u201cTen more minutes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>He jerked the covers back, caught her arms and dragged her up. \u201cShower. Now. Unless you want to stay here, locked in this room, until we get back.\u201d</p><p>So she headed for the shower.</p><p>When she got out, she had about ten minutes left. Frantically, she began throwing things into an overnight case.</p><p>\u201cIf you forget something, we can buy it when we get there,\u201d he told her. \u201cHere.\u201d He was back in front of her with a cup of coffee.</p><p>She took it from him and drank gratefully.</p><p>To her surprise, he smiled at her and touched her chin. \u201cThat hair of yours is a mess,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She turned, ready to look for her brush.</p><p>\u201cHey, leave it. It\u2019s sort of sexy, in a hungover kind of way,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She cast him a glance of ice, causing him to laugh softly again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your bell\u2014they\u2019re here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, and quickly swallowed the rest of her coffee. He had added enough milk to keep it from scalding her throat, and it was good.</p><p>A road trip.</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t believe he was on a road trip with four other people. He expected the usual question to come from the backseat: Are we there yet? But his passengers were quiet.</p><p>Brent had brought an audio collection of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s work. As they drove, they listened to \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d and then \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum,\u201d moving on to the poems by the time they passed into Delaware.</p><p>Just over the Maryland line, Joe pulled over at a rest stop to get gas. Everybody decided to get something to eat at that point, and he was sure they would have to wake Genevieve, who had fallen asleep before they ever left Manhattan. She was awake, though, and he noticed with amusement that she\u2019d brushed her hair back into its usual sleek cascade.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you think we\u2019ll get there?\u201d Nikki asked, as they all sat down to have breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWith or without traffic?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing well so far,\u201d Brent said, and glanced at Joe. \u201cIf we keep moving fairly quickly, we can make it by one-thirty or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get there, you and I will interview the widow and stop by the police station,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cOh, really, and what about the rest of us?\u201d Genevieve demanded, looking none the worse for wear. She\u2019d apparently had a pretty decent sleep while he\u2019d been driving, Joe thought.</p><p>\u201cWe should look into Poe\u2019s history in the city,\u201d Nikki suggested. \u201cMaybe find another tour to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe is right,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHe and Brent won\u2019t be able to get much out of the police or the widow if we all come in like a traveling circus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother Poe tour,\u201d Genevieve mused, cradling her coffee cup. She looked up at Joe. He expected an argument, but got a smile instead. \u201cGood. I keep thinking that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Edgar will make an appearance?\u201d Joe asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking that maybe one of the guides will say something to give us a real clue to what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Joe agreed. He didn\u2019t believe it for a minute, though. The current killer had a modern agenda. Either he planned to accomplish it by the murders, or he was psychotic, and Joe didn\u2019t think it was the latter.</p><p>He was convinced that the killer was Jared. And that the agenda was greed.</p><p>Except that...</p><p>Was he behind the deaths in Richmond and Baltimore, as well? If so, the motive couldn\u2019t have been greed. Jealousy? That was the most logical second choice. But jealousy over what? Poe? Why? Thorne, not his son, had been the scholar.</p><p>Joe excused himself while they waited for their food and called Raif Green. They\u2019d talked the night before, as Joe was on his way to the pub, and this seemed like as good a time as any to check on what they\u2019d talked about.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d Raif said, and it sounded like a groan.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to get anyone assigned to follow Jared Bigelow?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best. This is a city of millions, you know. And the police department is always understaffed. I\u2019ve already got plainclothes people at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to watch Bigelow,\u201d Joe insisted.</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. You know how to work the system.\u201d</p><p>He heard Raif laugh. \u201cQuit worrying. Yes, I\u2019ve got someone watching him. I\u2019m working things from here, I swear. And as soon as you can give me something solid from another state, we\u2019ll have FBI access, as well. The chief\u2019s already called the bureau. Seems they\u2019d already been called by someone. Someone with clout,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>Adam Harrison, Joe thought, his first reaction irritation. Still, did it matter, if it got them where they needed to be?</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cJoe, you, of all people, should know this may take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that we don\u2019t have a lot of time. Bigelow, Lori Star...and now Sam. This guy\u2019s gone after three people in less than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, and we\u2019re working it.\u201d</p><p>Joe hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve got one more thing for you. Just a hunch that might prove interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull all the phone records. Say, from a week before Bigelow\u2019s murder until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the phone records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Ravens. Let\u2019s find out who was calling in, as well as who they called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will that prove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I told you, it\u2019s a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking. Do you know how big a project that is? The D.A. will have a fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you know the right people to get it done,\u201d Joe argued.</p><p>Raif started swearing, and Joe moved the phone away from his ear.</p><p>Finally Raif said, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He started swearing again, so Joe thanked him and hung up.</p><p>When Joe returned to the table, their food had arrived. He glanced at his watch and ate quickly, and then they were back on the road.</p><p>When they reached Richmond just before two, they checked into a bed-and-breakfast Adam had arranged for them. Then Joe and Brent headed back out on the road for the police station and an appointment with Nancy Morton, the widow of the man who had been found strangled in his own wine cellar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam sat down and started setting up his notebook computer and portable printer, and Nikki got out a map and started planning a self-guided tour of Poe\u2019s onetime haunts.</p><p>\u201cStay safe,\u201d he warned them.</p><p>\u201cAdam, stop worrying,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and the murderer is back in New York.\u201d</p> <p>Her logic was sound, but he frowned anyway. Then Nikki came to her defense. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be tourists, Adam. There will be plenty of people all around us.\u201d</p><p>Nikki got on the phone and arranged another rental car, and as soon as it was delivered they left for the Old Stone House, now a museum dedicated to all things Poe.</p><p>Poe had never lived in the Old Stone House, but he would have passed it in his early days as he walked to school. It had been built in seventeen-thirty-seven, and was the oldest house in Richmond. Inside, they studied the relics of Poe\u2019s everyday life. Furnishings from the home he had shared with his foster parents, clothing, documents, first editions of his work, even a lock of his hair. Genevieve found herself enjoying the museum, despite the stress of everything going on. It was fascinating, beginning to know someone who was long gone but had made such a deep and continuing impression on the literary world, and who continued to influence writers and moviemakers. Visiting sites dedicated to him, walking where he\u2019d walked, made him flesh and blood.</p><p>As they walked outside, they heard the words tortured genius and realized that a docent was giving a speech, so they hurried closer to listen to her.</p><p>\u201cPoe\u2019s pain began at an early age, when his father abandoned the family, and then he lost his mother before he was two years old. Scholars believe that many of his stories focus on this loss. So often he writes about a beautiful woman, taken far too soon. He felt himself caught between the very real world, in which he was constantly fighting a battle against poverty, and the ethereal world of the dead. John Allan, his foster father, was a stern man. A highly moral man. He never formally adopted Poe, and he meant to make of Poe a man in his own image, one who was responsible, stern and moral. As a result, they fought often.</p> <p>\u201cIn contrast, Poe loved his foster mother, but he was barely an adult when he lost her, as well, another motivating factor in the omnipresence of the dead, dying and decaying in so many of his works. He fell in love with and married his cousin, Virginia, and she, too, was frail, and died at a young age. Perhaps it was only natural that Poe should be obsessed with death. We recognize Poe now as one of the great literary geniuses of American history, but in his time, he struggled. He longed to be respected by his peers, but that respect was never forthcoming. The ironic tragedy is that he was on the verge of achieving all that he craved at the time of his death, and in fact, his own death was shrouded in mystery.</p><p>\u201cHe was in love with Elmira Shelton, who had been a childhood sweetheart and was then a widow. She had accepted his marriage proposal, and might have had the age and wisdom to curb the drinking that was his ongoing downfall. He had written happily to his aunt and mother-in-law, Maria Clemm, to say, \u2018I hope that our troubles are nearly over.\u2019 Here in Richmond, he was becoming a fixture on the lecture circuit. He wasn\u2019t getting rich, but he was being well received. And then...he headed for Baltimore. He disappeared for several days, then was discovered in the street, delirious, wearing another man\u2019s clothing. He died on October seventh, eighteen-forty-nine, and his last words were, \u2018God help my poor soul.\u2019 His life was a litany of depression, alcoholism, lost love and great sadness, his death a mystery as dark as any story he ever penned.\u201d</p><p>The docent nodded gravely, and her audience was spellbound as they followed her into the museum. All except for Gen and Nikki, who remained standing outside in the sunshine. Genevieve, frowning, kept watching the spot where the woman had stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat his death was a mystery?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...no. I\u2019ve heard all the theories on his disappearance. I have a feeling that it had to do with the voting scandal of the time.\u201d When Nikki looked at her curiously, she explained. \u201cA candidate\u2019s supporters would find a man, keep changing his looks and send him out to vote over and over again. By giving him a lot to drink, they kept him docile and willing to do whatever they told him. And then, when they were done with him, they assumed he would be all right and sent him on his way. Unfortunately, Poe was an alcoholic and he wasn\u2019t all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole tortured-genius concept,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cShe said, \u2018he longed to be respected by his peers.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why, but that just keeps coming back to me. The whole tortured-genius thing. If we were only looking at the murder of Thorne Bigelow, Jared would be the prime suspect. Even Lori Star was probably only killed to cover up the first murder. But if the deaths here and in Baltimore are related, we need to look at the bigger picture, at different motives. So...Poe was a tortured genius. Maybe the killer sees himself as a tortured genius, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be on to something,\u201d Nikki said. Then she grinned and said, \u201cBut don\u2019t torture yourself over it. We\u2019ll figure it out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so certain, Gen thought, and asked, \u201cWhere to next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do the churches. Monumental Episcopal and St. John\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Monumental had been built on the site where Elizabeth Poe, Edgar\u2019s mother, had once worked as an actress. They were able to sit in the same pew where Edgar Allan Poe had gone to services with his foster parents. From there, they moved on up East Broad Street to St. John\u2019s, the church where Patrick Henry had given his famous \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d speech. There the historical marker at the churchyard entry claimed two very famous grave sites, one for the patriot George Wythe, and another for Elizabeth Arnold Poe. A local guidebook that Nikki had picked up at the museum explained that Elizabeth\u2019s grave was at the far eastern edge of the churchyard for a reason.</p><p>She\u2019d been an actress. And that, in her day, had been scandalous. The congregation of the time had been appalled that she was allowed to be interred in their graveyard at all.</p> <p>As they walked the grounds, Genevieve kept her eyes on Nikki. But if the other woman was seeing ghosts, she gave no sign.</p><p>Inside the church, they couldn\u2019t help being swept up in the building\u2019s revolutionary history. But because her mind was so heavily on the task at hand, eventually Genevieve found it wandering to her own mystery.</p><p>Then she noticed the memorial. \u201cNikki, look.\u201d</p><p>It was the kind of marker that usually noted the fact that a certain person had been laid to rest beneath the floor. But this one wasn\u2019t old, and it didn\u2019t refer to anyone buried in the church. It was just a memorial.</p><p>To William Morton.</p><p>According to the inscription, he had not only attended the church, he had helped to keep up the building and grounds, and he had given generously of his time and his earnings.</p><p>And he was buried in a nearby cemetery.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>They hurried back out to the car, where Nikki glanced at a map for a moment, then started the engine and pulled back onto the road.</p><p>Genevieve read from the guidebook as they drove. \u201cThis says there are three presidents buried there,\u201d she told Nikki. \u201cJames Monroe and John Tyler and Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a technicality as to whether that makes it two or three, then,\u201d Nikki said with a laugh. \u201cOf course, some Southerners would say that the most important president ever is buried there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis book was written by an Englishman,\u201d Genevieve said, reading the cover blurb. \u201cWe\u2019ll assume that he really didn\u2019t take a side.\u201d</p><p>Nikki grinned, as they drove into the cemetery and parked. They went into the office, where they pretended to be relatives of William Morton so they could get directions to his grave.</p><p>As they started walking, Genevieve felt an odd sense of unease slipping over her, despite the beauty of the setting. \u201cNikki?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we here because you\u2019re hoping to, uh, talk to William Morton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? It\u2019s worth a try.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve found herself distracted when she saw a sign pointing to the grave of George Pickett, famous for Pickett\u2019s Charge at Gettysburg. She wandered over to the grave and studied it, saddened by thoughts of how much had been lost when the country had been torn in two by war.</p><p>\u201cNikki?\u201d she said, then realized the other woman wasn\u2019t with her, so she started walking again in what she hoped was the direction of William Morton\u2019s grave.</p><p>Then she turned a corner and froze.</p><p>There were ghosts, and she knew they were ghosts, standing right in front of her. A man, tall, slender, gaunt even, and very stately, with graying hair and strong, tormented features. And a woman. Very tall, as well, in eighteen-fifties dress. She was of medium build, a very handsome woman, but looking as tormented as the man.</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s jaw locked, and she shook her head.</p><p>They were just there on the path, surrounded by stone angels.</p><p>As she stood transfixed, another man came up to the pair. He wore a gray uniform with butternut trim, a handsome officer\u2019s jacket and a cockade hat. The officer said something to the couple, then tipped his hat and turned to walk down the path.</p><p>Right toward Genevieve.</p><p>As he got closer, she realized that she could see right through him.</p><p>He was a handsome man, and as he passed her, he tipped his hat as if it were perfectly natural that she should see him.</p><p>She sensed someone behind her, and she couldn\u2019t help it. She screamed.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve! What on earth is the matter?\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Nikki standing there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen someone,\u201d the other woman said.</p><p>All Genevieve could do at first was point.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jefferson Davis\u2019s grave. His wife is buried right next to him, and there are a number of Confederate officers nearby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Genevieve stared at Nikki. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t do this.\u201d She gulped for air. \u201cI just can\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust breathe and you\u2019ll be fine. And then I want you to come with me. I\u2019ve found William Morton\u2019s grave. It\u2019s just over there, and I was thinking you might be able to sense something, because you have a connection to this case that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see these people all the time?\u201d Genevieve asked, finally able to speak coherently again.</p> <p>\u201cNot all the time, but often enough. You really do get used to it,\u201d Nikki told her. \u201cI swear to you, Genevieve. You\u2019ll be all right. You haven\u2019t passed out, and that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>Why pass out when she was certifiably crazy? Gen thought.</p><p>Then she straightened her shoulders. It was still daylight. The cemetery wasn\u2019t shrouded in mist. In fact, it was beautiful, filled with monuments to the dead, to the persistence of love beyond the grave. She took a deep breath. \u201cShow me the grave,\u201d she said to Nikki.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>At first the police weren\u2019t as cooperative as Joe had hoped for, but then Brent asked to see Detective Ryan Wilkins, and after several minutes the detective came out and greeted Brent warmly, suggesting they go around the corner to a coffee shop to talk.</p> <p>The day was warm, so they sat at an outside table, and Wilkins produced a file. \u201cI copied everything we have for you. Told the chief about your research down here maybe helping put an end to our cold case, and he was obliging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. This is terrific,\u201d Joe said, opening the file.</p><p>A lot of the information was dry. He started with the medical examiner\u2019s report, and the cause of death was simple: strangulation by a right-handed killer.</p><p>\u201cWe had no clues. Nothing to go on. To begin with, the Mortons were very neat and orderly people. There was no dust on the basement floor, so...no footprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house hadn\u2019t been broken into?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Wilkins, a handsome black man of about forty, shook his head. \u201cNo. No sign of forced entry in any way. The house is out in the country. No close neighbors. Mrs. Morton was at a meeting of her garden club when it happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe discovered the body?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>Wilkins nodded. \u201cYes. She went down to the basement looking for him and found him in the wine cellar. She tried to revive him, so he\u2019d been moved when the paramedics, and then my partner at that time, Sharon Autry, and I arrived. We\u2019re pretty sure it was done by a friend of the family or someone smart enough to wear gloves, because we didn\u2019t find any fingerprints that didn\u2019t belong there. We talked to every single family friend, and everyone had an airtight alibi for when the murder occurred. We just ran out of clues and leads. Mrs. Morton still calls, and I tell her that I\u2019ll never really close the case while I\u2019m alive, but...\u201d He lifted his hand. \u201cCrime goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about any local Poe enthusiasts?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cThere must be some kind of Poe society here, with this being where Poe grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. And yes, we covered that angle, too. All our \u2018Poe people\u2019 were thoroughly checked out,\u201d Wilkins told them. \u201cThoroughly,\u201d he repeated for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cHow about a Poe researcher who was visiting from somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make some calls for you today, find out if any of those folks remember anyone else being in town. But, you know, anyone\u2019s free to come here to research Poe without having to check in anywhere,\u201d Wilkins pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate you seeing what you can find out. We\u2019re afraid we may have a serial killer on our hands who started off slowly but is building up speed,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Wilkins promised, then looked at Brent. \u201cSo you\u2019re off to see Nancy Morton, I hear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, how did you know?\u201d Brent asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe called me,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cShe wanted me to know you were coming, in case maybe you can find an answer to things I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Wilkins said easily. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn how things are solved, as long as the bad guys are stopped. Well, you know, so long as no one has to do anything too illegal.\u201d</p><p>Joe was certain that that too had been thrown in not just as a figure of speech, but with purpose.</p><p>A little while later, they all shook hands, and Wilkins headed back to the station. Back in the car, Brent directed while Joe drove, and in a little while they were on the outskirts of the city, where the houses became estates, and where neighbors could go months without seeing one another.</p><p>At last they drove up a long driveway to a porticoed house. It was new, but had the look of an old southern mansion. A maid in a cheery, flowered apron answered the door and led them in. Nancy Morton was waiting for them in the parlor, tea service at the ready on a silver tray. She was a slim woman of at least sixty. She looked younger, but had the slightly pinched look that came from plastic surgery, though it had been done well. Her hair was tinted an ash blond and was elegantly coifed.</p><p>She greeted Brent with a wide smile and rose up on tiptoe to plant a kiss on his cheek. Then she offered a hand to Joe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Joe Connolly, Mrs. Morton,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNancy, please,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two sit down? I\u2019ll tell you everything I can, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>They accepted tea, despite the fact that they\u2019d just had coffee. It seemed to be important to Nancy Morton that she provide them with something.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful house,\u201d Joe commented, taking his cup.</p><p>\u201cThank you. William designed it,\u201d Nancy said, and sighed. \u201cWe never had children. We didn\u2019t plan it that way, but we...we just never had them. But we were very lucky. We had a good marriage, got along well, enjoyed the same things. Gardens, literature, music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d Joe said quietly.</p><p>She smiled and absently touched the pearl necklace she wore. \u201cThank you. He was a good man.\u201d She smiled wistfully. \u201cDetective Wilkins is very sweet. I know he thinks I should move, but...this is my home. I still feel close to William here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to dredge all this up again, Nancy,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I don\u2019t mind. Especially if anything I say can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell us about that day? If it won\u2019t be too painful,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>She looked off into the distance, as if she could see into the past that way. \u201cI had gone out around ten. I had a meeting of the garden club. We were planting flowers in one of the local parks. I had dirt all over me when I came home. I had to explain that to Detective Wilkins, because at first the detectives thought that was suspicious. It was Sophia\u2019s day off, so William had been alone. I got home around one and left the car in the driveway, right where yours is now, because I thought I\u2019d hop into the shower, and then William and I could go to a late lunch. We\u2019d talked about that over breakfast. But when I came in and called him, he didn\u2019t answer. He kept his office down in the basement, with all his books and his computer. And of course, the wine cellar is down there. We don\u2019t have a fancy refrigeration system, just the old brick walls and wooden racks. I assumed he had to be downstairs, so I went down, but he wasn\u2019t at his desk. I walked into the wine cellar and...and there he was.\u201d Tears dampened her eyes. \u201cI tried mouth-to-mouth, but it didn\u2019t do any good. Then I called 9-1-1, and the paramedics came, and the police. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that if I had just gotten home sooner, I might have been able to save him, but the police said that he\u2019d been...strangled, and that he was already dead when the murderer left him there. But I\u2019ll still always wonder....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing was taken?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing I was aware of. Nothing valuable, certainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband had all kinds of files on Poe, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She stared at him, clear-eyed and frowning. \u201cFiles on Poe? Of course. He wrote a book. It was fiction, of course, but his research was impeccable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere any of his notes missing?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She was briefly silent. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t know. His desk appeared to be in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNancy, do you mind if we go downstairs and look around?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She led the way down a carpeted staircase. The basement was as she had described. There was a huge, polished desk with a computer in the center of the room. There were bookshelves lining two walls and a filing cabinet against a third wall.</p><p>The fourth wall was brick and held the door to the wine cellar.</p><p>They didn\u2019t need to ask her. She walked straight through the door and they followed. It wasn\u2019t a huge wine cellar, but it went beyond modest.</p><p>\u201cHe was lying over there,\u201d she said softly. \u201cRight by his favorite merlot.\u201d</p><p>The floor was as dust-free as Wilkins had described it. Nancy obviously liked a clean house.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I look through the filing cabinet?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Nancy told him.</p><p>There were many files on many authors. William Morton had kept newspaper clippings and magazine articles, along with his own notes. There was, as expected, a folder dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe, containing a few articles and some pictures that had been taken at various sites. But it was curiously...small.</p><p>A man who had written a book on Poe should have had far more information, Joe thought. Admittedly, this was the age of the online investigation, but still, when compared with all the information William had stored away regarding Thoreau, Emerson and others, his file on Poe seemed suspiciously slim.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever help your husband with his research, or with his filing?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Nancy played with her pearls again. \u201cGood heavens, no. I wouldn\u2019t have dared interfere.\u201d Nancy led them back upstairs then, and paused by the fireplace to pick up a framed photo of a clean-shaven man with graying hair and a pleasant, dimpled face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWilliam, right before he died,\u201d she said.</p><p>A few minutes later they thanked her for her time, and she asked them to notify her if they found out anything, or if she could do anything else for them.</p><p>As they drove away, Joe looked back at the house. He hadn\u2019t felt anything, hadn\u2019t seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. He looked at Brent and asked softly, \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>Brent shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing, except...you think his killer stole some of his files?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that help us any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brent was silent a moment. \u201cDid you see anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly in my mind\u2019s eye. A man, dead next to his favorite merlot. Poe, in a way, but badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was behind a brick wall, but he hadn\u2019t been bricked in, much less bricked in alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis killer wanted to be sure he was dead and to get away with murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Joe said darkly. \u201cAnd so far, he has.\u201d</p><p>There was an old stone bench next to William Morton\u2019s family mausoleum. The Federal-style tomb held the mortal remains of the family from eighteen-fifty-five onward, the latest burial being William\u2019s.</p> <p>His wife\u2019s name, with her date of birth and a blank expanse of marble where her date of death would one day be etched, was next to his.</p><p>Genevieve and Nikki sat on the bench together, and Gen tried to decide whether the world that had opened up to her was terrible or intriguing.</p><p>They were alone, yet the cemetery was crowded.</p><p>A child in knickers went running by, chasing a ball. A woman with a bustle went racing after him, calling out distractedly, Ethan Taylor, you come back here right now! She offered Genevieve and Nikki an apologetic smile as she passed.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t real, of course, and neither was her son.</p><p>After a while, Gen felt the softness of a breeze and looked toward the monument. A pleasant-looking man of sixtysomething was standing by the iron-gated doorway. He was wearing a suit and could have been out for a pleasant stroll in the historic cemetery, pausing momentarily to catch his breath.</p><p>Except that he wasn\u2019t going to catch his breath again. Ever.</p><p>\u201cSo sad,\u201d he said, looking at Genevieve.</p> <p>She forced herself to speak. \u201cMr. Morton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d he said, smiling crookedly. \u201cNot Will or Bill, much less Willie or Billy. I was always William. Don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>She stood slowly, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Nikki stood up with her, so at least she wasn\u2019t alone, but whether Nikki saw him or not, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He slammed a fist against the tomb, and Gen almost jumped back. But she realized he wasn\u2019t angry with her when he said emphatically, \u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYou were murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, don\u2019t you think I would tell you the name of my killer if I knew it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you must have let him into your house.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and stared at her as if daring her to dispute his next words. \u201cAll right. Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgar Allan Poe.\u201d</p><p>Apparently Nikki did see him, because she said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were getting ready for Poe Fest,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the doorbell rang, I assumed it was Beau Headley. He was supposed to come by so we could discuss the lectures we\u2019d be giving that Saturday night. I was busy, just finishing up on the computer, so I wasn\u2019t paying a great deal of attention when I opened the door. I said something like, \u2018Gee, Beau, great costume, let me just run down and turn off the computer.\u2019 But whoever it was followed me. I didn\u2019t realize it...until I was being throttled. I fought back, though. I gouged him pretty good on his chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his face,\u201d Genevieve protested. \u201cCan\u2019t you at least describe his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had on false whiskers and a wig. And his eyes were brown and the pupils seemed too big, so I\u2019m thinking he had on some kind of contact lenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you at least sure it was a man?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so,\u201d Genevieve said. She was amazed at how frustrated she was feeling. Last night she had been terrified by the very concept of ghosts, and today she was angry with one.</p><p>\u201cWe think he\u2019s killing other people, so if you can come up with anything else, it would really help,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was thoughtful, leaning against the tomb. He rubbed his chin. \u201cYou see me pretty well, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d both women said together.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t quite get the hang of getting out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cemetery, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t really help you there,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. From what I understand...you just keep trying. Others here may be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cTell me, please...how is my wife? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>Nikki glanced at Genevieve, then turned back to the ghost. \u201cMy husband is seeing her this afternoon,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe she\u2019s doing well, though I\u2019m certain she misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can, will you let her know that I love her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she knows,\u201d Nikki told him softly.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you can tell us that might help to solve your murder?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be able to go then?\u201d he asked wistfully, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think...I think I\u2019m waiting for Nancy. We did everything together. I can\u2019t take a major journey without her.\u201d</p><p>They both just looked at him, not knowing what to say.</p><p>And then William Morton was gone. He faded away, and then, there was nothing where he\u2019d been but the air.</p><p>They all met up back at the bed-and-breakfast just before seven. Adam had been busy on the computer all afternoon, and he had information.</p><p>\u201cThorne Bigelow and his family were here when William Morton was killed. They had come to attend a series of lectures at something called Poe Fest. They got here the day before he was killed and didn\u2019t leave until five days after.\u201d</p><p>He produced several pictures he had found online and printed out. \u201cThese were taken during the festivities.\u201d</p><p>One shot was of a man giving a lecture, and he was dressed like Poe.</p><p>Another was of a group at what appeared to be a garden tea party. The women wore period gowns, and several of the men were dressed like Poe.</p><p>\u201cKind of like trying to find a clown at a circus,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cIt had to be Jared,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBecause Thorne is dead, and Mary Vincenzo couldn\u2019t have carried it off\u2014not alone, anyway. What we need now is proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a dozen would-be Poes here,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cWould-be Poes? What does that have to do with it?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Gen cleared her throat. \u201cThe killer dresses up like Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d Joe demanded. He seemed tense. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve braced herself, lifted her chin and met his eyes squarely. \u201cWilliam Morton told us. This afternoon, at the cemetery. And...\u201d she paused, wincing \u201c...Leslie and Matt talked to Lori, and she said the same thing, that her killer was dressed up like Poe.\u201d</p><p>Joe rose. She was sure he was about to tell them that they were all crazy, but he didn\u2019t. He just ran his fingers through his hair and asked, \u201cDo you know what would happen if I were to call Raif Green and tell him that a ghost told me we\u2019re looking for a killer who dresses up like Edgar Allan Poe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere might be another way to make the suggestion,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Brent leaned forward. \u201cJoe, we all know that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t see what we do. But you learn not to talk about what\u2019s obvious to you to other people. You go around it. You call the cops, and you leave an anonymous tip that someone might have dressed up like Poe to kill Lori. Then someone starts checking the costume shops.\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned back and sighed thoughtfully. \u201cTrouble is, even if we can prove that Jared Bigelow rented a Poe costume, we still can\u2019t prove that he wore it to kill anyone.\u201d</p><p>Joe sat down again. \u201cWe have to come up with enough evidence for Raif to go to the D.A.\u2019s office with at least a strong circumstantial case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens tomorrow,\u201d Nikki advised. \u201cIn Baltimore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, I think dinner\u2019s in order,\u201d Brent said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast.\u201d</p><p>They picked an Italian restaurant, on their innkeeper\u2019s recommendation, and headed out. As they drove down Monument Avenue, Genevieve looked out at the statues that gave it its name, then gasped suddenly. \u201cStop!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Joe pulled off to the side of the road so quickly that the driver behind him blasted his horn as he passed by.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just...do you mind if I hop out for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Joe lifted his hands and let them fall, at last staring at her as if she were crazy.</p><p>She climbed out of the car, aware that Nikki was following her as she walked across the street to stare up at the equestrian statue that had caught her attention so dramatically. Then she read the plaque at the bottom, identifying it as General James Ewell Brown Stuart, C.S.A.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d Genevieve breathed.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Even Nikki sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cI saw him. I saw him today at the cemetery. He spoke with Jefferson Davis and his wife. He tipped his hat to me.\u201d</p><p>There was no denying it now, she thought as they walked back to the car. She really was seeing ghosts. She might have made up William Morton or somehow been influenced by Nikki\u2019s proximity, but there was no denying that she\u2019d seen General Stuart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Genevieve apologized when she got back in the car. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful statue that I just had to get a closer look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Joe said, and pulled back into traffic.</p><p>Genevieve had been given a large bedroom with a queen bed and a garden view. She wondered if Joe would be sharing it with her tonight, since she wasn\u2019t sure of their footing at the moment. He had stayed with her last night, but that could have been simply because he was a good guy. He wouldn\u2019t have left her alone, not when she had barely been able to stand.</p> <p>But she was glad when he took it for granted that they would be staying together and went with her to her room. \u201cThis place was really a nice choice,\u201d he told her, when she opened the door. \u201cLeave it to Adam.\u201d When she looked at him questioningly, he grimaced. \u201cI probably would have opted for a chain hotel.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAdam is good,\u201d she said simply, then headed into the bathroom to shower. She closed the door, but she didn\u2019t lock it. Then she turned the water on hot. And waited.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come. She sighed and picked up the soap.</p><p>You can initiate things, you know, she told herself. But she had already done that, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>She had already soaped herself when she heard the door open. And then he stepped in behind her. A swift sensation of gratitude was quickly replaced with simple physical pleasure as she felt the bulwark of his body behind her. He pulled her close, reaching for the soap, then running it up and down her body in sweet suggestion.</p> <p>She turned to face him. As steam and water cascaded around them, she looked up into his eyes, somehow feeling guilty, feeling that she should tell him everything.</p><p>But before she could say anything, he kissed her. Long and deep. It felt as if his tongue dipped down into the heart of her, as if they were locked together in the mist and heat. When his mouth lifted from hers, she met his eyes and would have spoken, but he whispered a soft, \u201cShh,\u201d and she was lost.</p><p>His hands caressed a path down her back and encircled her buttocks, lifting her closer to him. Excitement drove through her like fire, and she pressed herself flat against his body.</p><p>They clung to one another, and his mouth found hers again, hot and sensual, no tenderness involved, just a need that seemed to fill her every cell with a soaring sensuality. She ran her finger over the wet skin of his shoulders, then down his spine. He reached past her, groping for the faucet, turning it off, and then he lifted her against him, stepping from the tub.</p><p>They didn\u2019t bother with towels. On the bed, his tongue coursed over her, as if he could lick her dry. She gasped and shuddered, and the headboard hit the wall as he shifted above her.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he teased. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake the neighbors.\u201d</p> <p>She nipped his shoulder, pushing him back, pushing him down. She moved with abandon against him, her body slick as she rubbed against him. She kissed and teased the muscled flat of his stomach, stroked his thighs, caught his erection in her hand. She heard his breathing deepen, catch, heard the growl that escaped him as she crawled atop him.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and swept her beneath him. She met his gaze, smiling, alive, feeling ridiculously vital and excited. She locked her thighs around him, and a soft moan escaped her as he thrust into her.</p><p>They began to move.</p><p>And whisper.</p><p>Words that inspired, that caressed, that soared alongside their passion.</p><p>The air was cool, his body was fire, and each thrust and parry seemed to drive her more insane. His lips found hers, broke away, found them again, and she heard the bed squeaking and didn\u2019t care. The world began and ended with him.</p><p>She climaxed violently, her body a vise around him, shudders tearing through her at volatile speed. She felt his power as he climaxed with her, jerking into her, once, again and then again. Her arms tightened around him, and she clasped him tighter, feeling the matching drumbeats of their hearts. He caressed her head, smoothing back her damp hair, cradling her tenderly to him.</p><p>There was a loud thunk from the other side of the wall. They stared at each other, startled, then laughed.</p> <p>\u201cIs that Brent and Nikki\u2019s room?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d she teased.</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else. He held her, they dozed and then they made love again.</p><p>As she finally drifted to sleep, she wished that she could really talk to him, that she dared to pour her heart out to him, to tell him about the fear and the wonder of what was happening to her.</p><p>They were so close, and yet, there were still such...ghosts...between them.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>The next day Brent called Ryan Wilkins and told him that they suspected a visitor to the Poe Fest might have been responsible for the Morton murder, then suggested that he might want to talk to the costume shops that had rented out Poe costumes at the time. He also told Wilkins that Joe was convinced something had been taken from the house: the bulk of William Morton\u2019s notes on Poe.</p><p>Brent took the wheel when they left for Baltimore, because Joe was on the phone with Raif.</p><p>\u201cI got the phone records, but I\u2019ll be damned if I know what they prove,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cDid you find any calls between anyone in the society and Lori Star?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Were you expecting me to?\u201d Raif asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just hoping. Anything unusual at all?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cThey all called each other a lot, that\u2019s for certain. Let\u2019s see, there are more from Lila Hawkins to Eileen Brideswell than to any of the other members. And Larry seemed to call Thorne and Don more than he did anyone else. A lot of calls went out from Thorne to both Lou Sayles and Barbara Hirshorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, the weather can be interesting, too,\u201d Raif said wearily. \u201cI\u2019ve traipsed all over New Jersey\u2014with the blessing of the cops there\u2014and I\u2019ve still got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you checked on boats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t take a ferry over, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cNo, what about rental boats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you, my captain or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a play on words, or are you just being pissy?\u201d Joe asked him.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re checking on boat rentals,\u201d Raif said. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to check to see if anyone rented a Poe outfit anywhere,\u201d Joe said, wincing slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd check around with the neighbors about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, Bigelow\u2019s neighbors? Or Lori\u2019s? Doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve talked to the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t asked them if they saw anyone dressed up like Poe walking around\u2014\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey would have said so, don\u2019t you think? I mean, that would have been pretty weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s New York, Raif. Think about it. How much weird stuff do you walk by every day of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Raif said. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>They hung up, and Joe saw that Nikki and Genevieve were both looking back at him gravely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just glad that you mentioned the Poe costume idea, that\u2019s all,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>He turned away without replying. He wasn\u2019t admitting that ghosts were out there talking to people. He was simply...grabbing at any straw.</p><p>But he knew.</p><p>When they reached Baltimore, they went straight to the Poe house on Amity Street. Poe had gone to live there after one of his arguments with his foster father, and it was probably a place where he had found happiness. He had live there with his aunt, Maria Clemm, and his future wife, his cousin Virginia. He had done a lot of writing in the house, and though the house itself was the real attraction, it also held Poe\u2019s lap desk, which he used when traveling, his sextant, and a full-size color reproduction of the only known portrait of Virginia.</p><p>The house itself consisted of a living room and kitchen on the first floor, with two bedrooms above and an attic. It had been saved from demolition by the city\u2019s Poe society in nineteen-forty-one, and was reverently maintained.</p><p>They moved on to Church Hospital, where Poe had died.</p><p>It was originally called Washington College Hospital. Poe had arrived there in a carriage on October third, eighteen-forty-nine. He was attended by Dr. John J. Moran, who, later in life, made his living by telling the tale of Poe\u2019s death, which meant he had expanded on it so much that the truth was hard to discern from the fiction. But the facts seemed to be that Poe had arrived, after a disappearance of several days, in a state that appeared to be drunkenness. He was taken to a tower room, where alcoholics were usually kept to keep them from disturbing the other patients. Poe\u2019s cousin, Neilson Poe, tried to visit him on the sixth but was told that Poe was too excitable, so he left. Neither he nor any member of the family would ever see Edgar Allan Poe again, at least not alive.</p><p>His cause of death was listed as \u201ccongestion of the brain.\u201d</p><p>Because it was still a working hospital, they simply stood outside and looked at the building.</p><p>Genevieve realized that Joe was watching her, and she looked at him and smiled. \u201cIt was so sad, the way he died. His whole life was so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grave site?\u201d Adam suggested, and they moved on.</p><p>Even in death, poverty had followed Poe. He had originally been buried with no headstone. Later, Maria Clemm had written to the same cousin who had tried to visit Poe as he lay dying, and Neilson had commissioned a monument.</p><p>It would have been a nice one, Joe thought. Neilson had asked that the Latin for \u201cHere, at last, he is happy\u201d be inscribed on one side, while the other side would have read, \u201cSpare these remains.\u201d But the monument had been built near the train tracks, and a train wreck had destroyed it, and Neilson hadn\u2019t had the money to pay for another.</p><p>Poe\u2019s stone did not go up until eighteen-seventy-five. By then, Poe had at last received tribute from his fellow writers. Letters from Longfellow and Tennyson, among others, were read at the ceremony. Eventually Maria Clemm was buried beside him, and the remains of his beloved Virginia were brought from New York to rest with him, as well. Somehow, his birthday was mistakenly written as January twentieth instead of January nineteenth, an error that remained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a crowd of tourists around the grave, listening to a guide, and Joe couldn\u2019t help wondering if ghosts would appear to his friends when there were so many people in the area. Then he wondered if they would give any indication of what they saw even if they did see something.</p><p>What the hell was the point of all this, anyway? It was fine to acknowledge the sad life of a great writer, but he didn\u2019t see how that would be helpful in solving a series of modern murders.</p><p>When the guide, a lean man of about twenty-five who was dressed as the poet, was finished, Joe stepped forward and asked him if he knew anything about Bradley Hicks.</p> <p>\u201cPoor Bradley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And what a terrible way to die, frightened to death in his own family vault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he easily frightened?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>The man frowned, clearly curious as to Joe\u2019s line of questioning, so Joe showed him his license. \u201cMy friends and I are looking into the recent murders in New York,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou think...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m done here, so I can show you Bradley\u2019s grave, if you want. Poor guy. He died there, and now he\u2019s buried there. I\u2019m James Boer, by the way. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Joe made the introductions to the rest of the group, and then they got back in their car and followed James.</p><p>Bradley Hicks had been buried in a very old cemetery, rich with funerary art, slightly overgrown, and melancholy. The Hicks family had been in Baltimore for a long time. The first interment had been in eighteen-ten, and there were literally dozens of names inscribed on the tomb.</p><p>\u201cCan all of those people really fit in there?\u201d Nikki asked doubtfully.</p> <p>\u201cI imagine some are cremations,\u201d Joe said in reply.</p><p>\u201cThey found him in there, though. There are shelves on three sides, and a couple of tombs on the ground where you go in,\u201d James told them. \u201cHey, you can see for yourselves. You can look through the grating.\u201d</p><p>Joe stepped up and looked in. Though shadows hid some things, the interior was just as James had described it.</p><p>\u201cHere, use my flashlight,\u201d Adam volunteered, handing over his keychain, which had a small but powerful penlight attached. When Joe looked at him in surprise, the older man just shrugged. \u201cI encounter more tombs than you do,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>The beam showed Joe what he needed to know. On the other side of the grating was a wooden door, now open. Inside, there were four stone coffins on the ground and a number of others filling the shelves.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Bradley, over there,\u201d James said, moving up and pointing. Bradley Hicks was resting on the top shelf on the right-hand side.</p><p>\u201cWho keeps the keys to the mausoleums?\u201d Joe asked James.</p><p>\u201cThe families, of course, and the cemetery manager has one,\u201d James said.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to get in?\u201d Adam asked. Joe nodded, and Adam said, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the car,\u201d Brent suggested, tossing him the keys. \u201cIt\u2019s a long walk back to the office.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded, and Nikki decided to go with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to prove?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to see how he could have thought he\u2019d locked himself in,\u201d Joe explained, then was startled by a choked-off scream. He turned quickly to see Genevieve and Brent standing together on the narrow path leading to the tomb. The scream had come from behind them, where a young woman of about twenty was standing, carrying a bouquet of flowers.</p><p>Genevieve hurried over to her, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the young woman mouthed, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Genevieve said, touching her shoulder gently.</p><p>The woman ignored her, raised a finger and pointed at James. \u201cYou were here!\u201d she said accusingly. \u201cYou were here the day that man died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d James protested. He looked at the others, shaking his head. \u201cI swear, I was working.\u201d He turned back to the young woman. \u201cI\u2019m a tour guide,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI dress like this for work, but except for today, I\u2019ve never come here in costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, everyone,\u201d Joe said. \u201cMiss, were you here when Mr. Hicks died?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you related to him?\u201d When she shook her head, Joe went on, \u201cSo you were here because...?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She pointed to another family mausoleum about fifty yards away. In bold letters it announced the name \u2018Adair.\u2019</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d Genevieve asked, trying to draw her out.</p><p>Another nod, then, \u201cI\u2019m Sarah Adair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Genevieve pursued.</p><p>\u201cI...came to bring my grandmother flowers. I like to come. Our tomb is always open. It\u2019s like a little chapel,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Mr. Hicks that day?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cBefore he died?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I only heard about it later. But I saw him!\u201d She pointed at James.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d James said.</p><p>She studied his face. \u201cOkay. I saw someone who looked like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who looked like Edgar Allan Poe, you mean?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess. Like Poe.\u201d She suddenly clamped her hand over her mouth. \u201cThe paper said the man who died loved Poe. He wrote an article about him or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Adair,\u201d Joe said, \u201ccan you tell me about the day Mr. Hicks died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I came to bring flowers to my grandmother. When I left, I saw a man who looked like him\u2014like Poe\u2014walking in front of me, and the way the path runs, he must have come from over here. I didn\u2019t think anything about it. But then I heard on the news that Mr. Hicks had a heart attack in his tomb, so I told the police that I had seen someone in the cemetery. But they told me lots of people had been here, and that there was nothing suspicious, that no one had locked Mr. Hicks in and both doors were unlocked when they found him.\u201d</p><p>Just then Adam and Nikki returned. When they stepped out of the car, Adam was dangling a key triumphantly; then he frowned, noticing the addition to their party.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sarah Adair,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cAnd she was just telling us that there was a man dressed as Edgar Allan Poe in the cemetery the day Bradley Hicks died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam stared at her with renewed interest.</p><p>\u201cAre you going in?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cYou can go into any of the tombs. The keys are just hanging on the rack in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just leave them there for...whoever?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. People come from all over the country to visit relatives who are buried here,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>Joe took the key from Adam, fitted it into the lock and found that the iron grate swung open easily. Unless it had been oiled since Hicks\u2019s death\u2014something he would have to look into\u2014there was no way it would have stuck and trapped anyone inside. With Adam\u2019s flashlight in hand, he stepped in and closed both the outer grate and the inner wooden door behind him. Both opened instantly to his touch.</p><p>He closed the doors again and turned off the flashlight, then tried to imagine being Bradley Hicks.</p><p>Trying to open the door...</p><p>Not being able to.</p><p>He might have tried banging on the walls, but they were brick, and very thick.</p><p>But could anyone have counted on him to have a heart attack so conveniently?</p><p>He must have had a weak heart, and his killer must have known it.</p><p>He opened the doors again.</p><p>It was almost amusing. They\u2019d lined up in front of the tomb as if they were waiting for Lazarus to arise.</p><p>\u201cThe doors don\u2019t stick,\u201d Joe said briefly, then turned to James. \u201cYou said you knew him pretty well, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have a heart condition?\u201d</p><p>James nodded somberly. \u201cThat\u2019s why they figured he had the heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Joe agreed. Then he turned back and locked both doors to the tomb. \u201cI guess we\u2019re done here,\u201d he said. \u201cJames, thank you. And, Sarah, thank you, too.\u201d He handed her his card. \u201cJust in case you remember anything else about that day.\u201d</p><p>Joe slipped an arm around Genevieve, and with the others behind them, they started walking back to the car.</p><p>They decided to have an early dinner in Baltimore, and just after they\u2019d ordered, Joe\u2019s phone rang. He saw that it was Raif and excused himself to step outside.</p><p>\u201cI found it,\u201d Raif said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard from a fellow in the Richmond P. D. thirty minutes ago, said he wanted to let me know that an Edgar Allan Poe costume\u2014complete with wig, mustache, shoes, the whole bit\u2014was rented to a T. Bigelow the day William Morton was killed. And one of our cops here managed to find a shop here on Broadway that had rented another one just two days before Bigelow was murdered. It was rented to Thorne Bigelow, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCredit cards can get around, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who do you like for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared Bigelow. And I\u2019ve got him in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrested him for murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I still don\u2019t have any proof on that. Although we did find a lady who lives down the block from him who said she saw Edgar Allan Poe walking around the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She also told me that Martians had landed and were living in the house next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you have Jared on?\u201d</p><p>Raif chuckled softly. \u201cTraffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraffic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd attempted bribery. He seems to think he doesn\u2019t have to pay his parking tickets. He owes the city almost a thousand dollars, and the officer who stopped him wasn\u2019t impressed with his offer of a gratuity, so at this moment, he isn\u2019t getting out\u2014no matter what kind of fancy lawyer he has\u2014till the judge hears his case in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, hell, Raif, you know he\u2019ll make bail, so you don\u2019t really have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do if you can come up with something by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a prayer, Joe thought. No, he didn\u2019t even have the ghost of a chance. Still...</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Raif. I\u2019m still down in Maryland, but we\u2019re heading back as soon as we finish eating.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cThink you can fix it so I can talk to him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I can arrange that.\u201d</p><p>When Joe returned to the table, he quickly explained the situation.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll get out, won\u2019t he?\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we get back, I\u2019m going to talk to him and try to get him to trip himself up. And if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to write up all the circumstantial evidence we have, which hopefully will be enough for the D.A.\u2019s office to get a search warrant for his place and maybe even hold him.\u201d Joe looked around the table. \u201cThey found out that one of the Bigelows, using Jared\u2019s credit card, rented a Poe costume in Richmond and again in New York.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve let out her breath softly. \u201cSo Jared did do it. Oh, God. He dressed up like Poe and met Lori Star, and then...\u201d</p><p>She wondered if she looked as sick as she felt. Probably.</p><p>Their waitress arrived with their food. They ate quickly, then returned to the car and hit the road.</p><p>Adam promised that as soon as they got back he would get on the computer and start trying to place the Bigelows in Baltimore when Bradley Hicks had met his untimely demise, and also find out if Bigelow\u2019s credit card had been used to rent a Poe costume there, too.</p><p>When they reached the station and Joe got out, he paused and held Gen\u2019s eyes for a long moment. \u201cGenevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted softly. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI have my cell,\u201d he said. \u201cCall if you need me. For anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this might really be over,\u201d Genevieve breathed as Brent got behind the wheel and swung the car out into traffic.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Brent said. He met her gaze in the rearview mirror. \u201cWant to come back to Adam\u2019s place with us?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you, but no. I want to get home. Call my mom and talk for a bit. And no one has to babysit me, not tonight, anyway. Jared Bigelow is in jail.\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned. \u201cWe think we\u2019re on to the right man. We don\u2019t know it yet. Genevieve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go home, talk to my mother and...reconcile myself, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo?\u201d Nikki asked.</p><p>\u201cLife\u2014and death,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p> <p>Brent got the doorman to watch the car and carried her bag up, then went into the apartment with her, looked around to be sure it was safe, then smiled. \u201cYou going to be okay? I know it\u2019s got to be tough, getting used to seeing a different world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be fine. But you and Nikki aren\u2019t leaving right away, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll stay a few days.\u201d He sobered. \u201cWe still have to make sure the case against Jared will stand up in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cIf you need anything, just give us a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, alone in her apartment, Genevieve made a cup of tea and then called Eileen. She didn\u2019t tell her mother that she had started seeing ghosts. She simply told her that they might have found some solid evidence against Jared Bigelow.</p><p>\u201cJared!\u201d Eileen said. Genevieve could imagine her mother\u2019s stricken expression.</p><p>\u201cMom, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s a terrible shock, that he\u2019s such a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not. Does that mean I can go out with the other Ravens now? Maybe get a drink at O\u2019Malley\u2019s?\u201d Eileen asked.</p><p>Genevieve hesitated. \u201cMom, they may not be able to keep Jared in jail past tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to head out now, then. Darling, I\u2019m going stir-crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for a car and have Henry walk me straight to it, and I\u2019ll have it drop me off right at the door to O\u2019Malley\u2019s. I\u2019ll even have it wait until I\u2019m ready to go home, and get someone to walk me back to it, and I\u2019ll call Henry and have him meet me when I come back. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us?\u201d Eileen asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019ll probably just hang out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But you\u2019re welcome to come if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind,\u201d Genevieve promised.</p><p>They bade each other good-night, and Genevieve hung up the phone and started unpacking. When the phone rang a few minutes later, she hurried to answer it, hoping it was Joe.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve?\u201d It was a woman\u2019s voice, but not one she recognized.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wretched bitch!\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she stared at the receiver, then hurriedly put the phone down. When it rang again, she didn\u2019t answer it, just let her machine click on and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid wretched bitch! You were jealous of me, and I know it. You made that friend of yours come after Jared.\u201d</p><p>She realized that the caller had been drinking.</p><p>She also realized it was Mary Vincenzo.</p><p>She listened as the woman continued to rant into the phone until the built-in timer stopped Mary midvent.</p><p>The phone rang again. Determined to put Mary in her place, she started to pick it up, but the machine came on immediately. \u201cI\u2019m going to tear your hair out and cut your uppity rich little heart into pieces. You\u2019re always flirting with him, now that you know who your mommy is. Well, you\u2019re still just a bastard. A bastard she threw away at birth. And you should die. You deserve to die. And you know what? I\u2019m coming to get you. I am!\u201d</p><p>She walked over to the phone to pick it up to tell Mary what she should do with herself, but the phone clicked off.</p><p>A minute later it rang again. She picked up the receiver. \u201cLook, Mary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s not Mary,\u201d a shy, tentative voice interrupted her. \u201cIt\u2019s Barbara. Barbara Hirshorn,\u201d she said, as if afraid Genevieve might not remember her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Barbara. Sorry,\u201d Genevieve said quickly.</p><p>\u201cLou and I are going to meet your mother at O\u2019Malley\u2019s. We were thinking you might want to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to my mother a little while ago and told her I thought I\u2019d just stay home, but thanks for asking,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? We could swing by for you.\u201d</p><p>Gen hesitated. She might as well go. Her mother wanted to see her, she wanted to see her mother, and she had no idea whether Joe would be coming by or not.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I will come. But you don\u2019t need to pick me up. I\u2019ll take my own car. I\u2019ll see you all there in a little while.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Barbara hung up, Gen dialed Joe\u2019s cell. She didn\u2019t expect to get him, and she didn\u2019t, so she left a message. \u201cHey, Joe. It\u2019s Gen. I\u2019m going to be at O\u2019Malley\u2019s with my mother. Meet us there when you can. If you want to, I mean.\u201d</p><p>That done, she brushed her hair, put on some lipstick and headed out. She took the elevator down to the garage, but she hadn\u2019t taken two steps before she got the strange feeling that she was being followed. A ghost again? The ghost of Lori Star trying to reach her?</p><p>She felt the strongest temptation to run back to her apartment. All of a sudden she wanted to be anywhere but in the garage.</p><p>She heard a shuffling sound, followed by a breeze, like a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tim!\u201d she called loudly. Surely he was here somewhere.</p><p>\u201cTim?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, and she could still feel the softness of the breeze against her face, warm and....</p><p>Urgent.</p><p>Almost imperceptibly at first, the air began to take shape, forming into something both there and not there. She could have sworn she was seeing Leslie MacIntyre, and she was speaking, desperately and in a whispered rush.</p><p>Go back, Genevieve. Go back to your apartment. Lock the door and call the police. Now! Quickly!</p><p>Without questioning why, Gen raced for the door, her key card out and ready.</p><p>And then she heard footsteps behind her. Real footsteps. Panicked, she turned...</p><p>And saw Edgar Allan Poe coming for her.</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d she snapped, at a loss for any other option.</p><p>And for a moment, it worked. The would-be Poe seemed to trip, even though there was nothing in his path.</p><p>Genevieve thought she heard Leslie\u2019s voice again. Hurry!</p><p>She dropped her purse as she fumbled with the door. The damned thing wouldn\u2019t open. She realized too late that it had been jammed somehow. She hurriedly reached down for her purse, groping for the canister of Mace she always carried. She found it and turned, but she didn\u2019t get a chance to use it, because something hit her in the head so hard that she saw stars.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d she vaguely heard someone say.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t pass out, she told herself. If she did, she would be lost.</p><p>Who the hell was it? Mary Vincenzo? Had she come to make good on her threats?</p><p>She realized the canister was still in her hand, and she managed to aim it in the direction of her attacker and hit the spray button. She was rewarded with a howl of pain, but it was too late. Something came down on her head again, and she crashed to the garage floor.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Jared groaned when he saw Joe enter the private visitors\u2019 room.</p><p>\u201cOh, great. The brilliant P. I. Okay, you got me. I didn\u2019t pay my parking tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did kill your father.\u201d</p><p>Jared stared at him angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course I didn\u2019t kill my father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou killed your father, you killed William Morton and at the very least you contributed to the death of Bradley Hicks. You also murdered Lori Star and attempted to murder Sam Latham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jared cried.</p><p>His horror and his fierce frown of denial certainly seemed real, Joe thought.</p> <p>\u201cJared, I just came from Virginia, where you rented a Poe costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared asked, sounding truly confused.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cI can get the cops in here now, and they\u2019ll take your confession and help you work out a deal with the D.A. to avoid the death penalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe death\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d Jared said. \u201cWhat does renting a Poe costume in Virginia have to do with murder?\u201d</p><p>For once, he didn\u2019t look like a cocky rich kid, Joe thought. He looked genuinely frightened.</p> <p>An act?</p><p>\u201cJared, we have proof,\u201d Joe said, knowing he was stretching the truth pretty much to the breaking point.</p><p>\u201cProof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof that you used your father\u2019s card to rent a Poe costume, then drove out to William Morton\u2019s house and killed him.\u201d</p><p>Jared shook his head, staring wildly. \u201cMy father liked William Morton. He thought he was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you killed him? Because you were jealous that your father thought more of Morton than he did of you?\u201d</p> <p>He was stunned when Jared suddenly burst into tears. \u201cLook, I was...a jerk. I didn\u2019t think I had to pay my tickets. But I didn\u2019t kill anyone. I sure as hell didn\u2019t kill my father, I swear it. I wasn\u2019t even there when he died. I was working, and then I went down and bought a hot dog from the vendor outside the office. You can talk to him if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone about the hot-dog vendor before?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Sunday Lori Star was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He reddened. \u201cThere were drugs involved. I admit it. But I was home.\u201d He brightened. \u201cI saw someone then, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe window washer. I know he\u2019ll remember me. I had just poured myself a drink when I saw him out there, and I was joking around, pretending I was going to pour him a drink, too.\u201d \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell the police about this before?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>Jared shook his head. \u201cBecause...because I\u2019m Jared Bigelow. I shouldn\u2019t have to make excuses. I shouldn\u2019t need an alibi. I\u2019m Jared Bigelow,\u201d he repeated in a small, defeated voice.</p><p>Disgusted, Joe turned away. Dammit. He believed the bastard. His story would be easy enough to prove. His building would have a contract with a window-washing service, and it would be easy enough to find whoever had been working there on a Sunday, of all days. No doubt the hot-dog vendor could be found and questioned, too.</p><p>But if it hadn\u2019t been Jared...</p><p>It had to have been someone with Jared. With Thorne.</p><p>That left two people.</p><p>Mary Vincenzo. But did Mary have the strength to do what had been done to William Morton and Lori Star?</p><p>Or...</p><p>The butler.</p><p>Or there had been two killers. A woman and a man, working together.</p><p>One with the strength to strangle someone. And one who could slip into a hospital room in a nurse\u2019s uniform, and not be noticed.</p><p>He suddenly remembered something. Something that had struck him as interesting a few days ago and then been forgotten in the welter of events.</p><p>Joe.</p><p>Someone had spoken his name, and it wasn\u2019t Jared Bigelow.</p><p>And he recognized the voice.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Matt, or a semblance of Matt, was there. Matt, his cousin and best friend.</p><p>His dead cousin. His dead best friend.</p><p>Joe, she needs you. For the love of God, hurry!</p><p>Fear and urgency set in. If Jared wasn\u2019t the killer, then the killer was still out there. And if Matt was urging him on...</p><p>She needs you, Matt repeated.</p><p>Joe ran past the officer on duty outside the door without bothering to explain why he was in such a hurry. His cell phone was in his hand as he sprinted for the street. Genevieve didn\u2019t pick up at her apartment, and she didn\u2019t answer her cell. He tried Eileen\u2019s number as he wondered why the hell you could never find a cab in New York when you really needed one.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Eileen said, pleased. \u201cAre you joining us?\u201d</p><p>His heart leaped. \u201cGenevieve is with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she may show up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>Eileen told him, and when she didn\u2019t mention one name in particular, he knew he had just figured everything out at last, knew what had niggled at him since the funeral until he\u2019d remembered it just a few minutes ago.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to panic Eileen, so he just said, \u201cAsk Gen to call me if she shows up, all right? And don\u2019t leave O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Where? Where the hell would the killer have taken her?</p><p>Where else, but...</p><p>He was within walking distance, but he didn\u2019t walk.</p><p>He ran.</p><p>Genevieve woke up slowly. Her head was pounding as if a thousand trucks were running through it. Worse than that, though, her arms hurt, as if there was a dead weight pulling on them.</p><p>Wherever she was, it was stuffy and it smelled funny.</p><p>She realized that there really was a dead weight on her arms. When she tried to move them, she heard what sounded like chains rattling.</p><p>It was chains.</p><p>She blinked, and her eyes adjusted to the semidarkness. But she was chained, and the weird smell was...</p><p>Mortar.</p><p>Someone was bricking her up behind a wall!</p><p>She fought back panic, reminded herself that she had been locked up underground by a maniac for weeks, and she had survived that. She had used her wits, and she had survived.</p><p>But this...</p><p>She heard the trowel moving in the concrete mixture, heard the telltale sounds as another brick was shoved into place.</p><p>Should she scream? Would there be any hope for her if she did?</p><p>Once the last brick went in, how much time would she have?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake, I know it,\u201d said a female voice.</p><p>Not Mary Vincenzo\u2019s.</p><p>It was familiar, but it sounded different, more confident than she had ever heard it.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s awake. Join us, won\u2019t you, Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s voice, and it was familiar, too.</p><p>She fought the panic setting in, trying to figure out the best way to play for time.</p><p>Time?</p><p>Time for what?</p><p>For help to arrive? What help? Joe was at the police station, convinced that all clues led to Jared Bigelow.</p><p>\u201cBennet, what a surprise,\u201d Gen said flatly.</p><p>\u201cBennet? Come, come. You know my given name. Why not use it...Miss Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. The bricks that would eventually cover her face hadn\u2019t been laid yet.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Albee,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Or maybe I do. I suppose you\u2019re furious because Jared gets the Bigelow money, even after you put up with Thorny for all those years.\u201d</p><p>Feminine laughter rang out, and Barbara Hirshorn popped her head up behind Albee\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Barbara had lost the Poe mustache she had been wearing, and though she still had on a man\u2019s nineteenth-century suit and a black wig, her sharp features were now easily recognizable. \u201cIt\u2019s not that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gen said, frowning. \u201cThen explain things to me. How did you do it? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t understand anything, do you?\u201d Barbara demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe should. After that trip to Richmond and Baltimore,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>How the hell had he known where she\u2019d been? Gen didn\u2019t ask the question, but Barbara answered it anyway.</p><p>She giggled again, as if she were the most clever creature in the world. \u201cYour mother told me where you were, of course. I mean, who would worry about what they said to poor, meek little nobody Barbara?\u201d</p><p>Albee Bennet had stopped laying bricks for the moment, too busy grinning at her. Beaming with pride and pleasure. \u201cWe really are very clever, Barbara and I,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gen said. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t? You really don\u2019t?\u201d Bennet asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, setting his arm around Barbara\u2019s shoulders. \u201cActually, taking care of Thorne the way we did was Barbara\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison in the wine,\u201d Barbara said proudly. \u201cMy idea.\u201d</p><p>Her mother had been the one to say it first, but they\u2019d all agreed that, statistically speaking, poisoning was a woman\u2019s method of murder.</p><p>\u201cSo clever,\u201d Bennet said again.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Barbara said, blushing.</p><p>\u201cHe needed to die. It was justice, really. Just like those other two blowhards,\u201d Bennet explained. \u201cBest of all, there\u2019s no way for anyone to prove that I had anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is a way. They just haven\u2019t figured it out yet,\u201d Genevieve said as confidently as she could.</p><p>Barbara just rolled her eyes. \u201cBennet is the genius, don\u2019t you see? He knew Poe. He loved Poe. He can be Poe\u2014far more effectively than I can. Once Thorne understood just how much Bennet knew about Poe, how he empathized with Poe, comprehended his work and everything about him, he would make Bennet come down for discussions. And everything Bennet said found its way into Thorne\u2019s work. He used him! My brilliant Bennet. Thorne was horrible. He deserved to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lori Star?\u201d Genevieve demanded. \u201cWhat about Sam Latham? He\u2019s just a nice guy with a wife and two little kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Sam.\u201d Bennet sighed. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t look as if we were only trying to kill Thorne, could it? I just happened to be on the road when I saw him pass me. I suddenly realized how easy it would be to engineer his death, so I drove like a bat out of hell to catch up. Unfortunately, he survived.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut someone else died that night. You killed an innocent man,\u201d Genevieve told him. \u201cA stranger who might not even have known the name Poe.\u201d</p><p>Barbara gave that awful giggle again. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t know Poe\u2019s name, he definitely deserved to die,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that Lori Star...Well, I took care of her,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cShe was so easy. So desperate for fame and fortune. I rented the boat before I donned my costume, of course. I knocked her out first, then killed her on land. It ended up being a lovely recreation, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve\u2019s skin felt as if it were crawling with a thousand bugs. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said to Barbara. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be at O\u2019Malley\u2019s. You called and asked me to go with you and Lou. Do you really think people won\u2019t notice that you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really as stupid as you seem?\u201d Barbara asked. \u201cI conveniently developed a headache and decided to stay home.\u201d She turned to her partner in crime. \u201cAlbee, get busy,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Genevieve said quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bennet asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other men?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat fellow in Richmond?\u201d he asked, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? It was the same thing! His research was faulty. He knew nothing. Everything he used in that book of his came from me. And did he so much as offer me an acknowledgment? He did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get you, you know,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cSooner or later, they\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Barbara burst out laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll swear Bennet was with me that Sunday morning, if anyone asks. And your dear friend Joe can vouch for his Sunday afternoon\u2014you two came to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you managed everything on Sunday morning,\u201d Genevieve said, looking at Bennet. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI helped,\u201d Barbara said proudly. \u201cI was ready with the car over in Jersey. Even that road will lead back to Jared, though. We rented the boat with one of Jared\u2019s credit cards. The Bigelows were always a bit careless. Too much money! They had so much, they never noticed little things like missing credit cards. But enough is enough. I think it\u2019s past time for you to be dead. Albee, get going,\u201d Barbara said shrilly.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>They both started.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying. She\u2019s trying to slow us down,\u201d Barbara said.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference, dear,\u201d Bennet said.</p><p>\u201cIt could be Thorne Bigelow.\u201d</p><p>They both froze, staring at her.</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cGhosts do come back,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. But if it makes you happy, feel free to come back as a ghost,\u201d Barbara said.</p><p>Albee started to slather on mortar so he could lay another brick, but suddenly he went still. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he demanded, poised to listen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere can\u2019t be. The alarm is on, and the door is locked,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cStop paying attention to her. She\u2019s playing games, trying to make us think Thorne\u2019s coming back to haunt us. She\u2019s just trying to buy herself time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d Genevieve said. She managed to twist around a bit, and relieve some of the strain on her arms, but she couldn\u2019t help breathing in all the dust Albee\u2019s masonry was stirring up, and it was making her light-headed. She knew from the conversation that she had to be in Thorne Bigelow\u2019s basement, but it clearly hadn\u2019t been thoroughly cleaned in years.</p><p>And apparently they had built this special little niche just for her. When they were finished, no one would know there was anything behind it.</p><p>Oh, God. She had to keep them talking or she would panic.</p><p>Did it matter now whether she panicked or not?</p><p>\u201cAlbee, this is wrong,\u201d Barbara said, suddenly irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be begging and pleading and crying and all that,\u201d Barbara said peevishly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are my questions messing up your scenario?\u201d Genevieve demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re so smug, but actually, you\u2019ve messed up all your murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that noise?\u201d Bennet demanded, stopping.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, and finish!\u201d Barbara demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got five bricks to go.\u201d</p><p>Another brick slid into place.</p><p>Genevieve knew she had to keep him talking. Keep those last bricks out.</p><p>Someone would come. She knew that. Eventually, someone would come. But when? Long after her oxygen was gone...?</p><p>\u201cAlbee, I hear something, too,\u201d Barbara said suddenly. \u201cAnd...\u201d</p><p>Barbara\u2019s voice trailed off as she stared past him, and Genevieve strained to look in that direction, too.</p><p>There was someone in the room with them.</p><p>Someone, or...</p><p>Something.</p><p>She could make out a transparent, vaguely formed image of a person, and her heart leapt.</p><p>Leslie MacIntyre. And beyond Leslie...</p><p>Lori Star.</p><p>Leslie was trying hard to knock over the small pile of bricks that remained. Lori was staring at Bennet and tried to strike him, but her fist went right though him. He felt something, though, because he muttered fearfully, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lori,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>He paused, staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori\u2019s ghost is in here with us right now. I\u2019m not lying. She\u2019s with a friend of mine, Leslie MacIntyre. You\u2019ve heard of Leslie, of course. She saved my life before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s full of shit, Albee!\u201d Barbara cried.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you the truth. They\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut her up! Put that last brick in,\u201d Barbara demanded. \u201cDo it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara, there\u2019s something...I can feel it,\u201d Bennet insisted.</p><p>Could he really feel it? Perhaps. Because they were both very real, and they were doing their best to help her.</p><p>Barbara still looked unnerved, but she shouted at him, \u201cPut that brick in, you fool!\u201d</p><p>Then, miraculously, there was another voice.</p><p>A real voice. Hard, loud, firm.</p><p>\u201cPut that brick in and I\u2019ll shoot you right in the head!\u201d</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s muscles gave, and she sagged against the wall.</p><p>Joe!</p><p>How had he known to come here?</p><p>\u201cThe switch!\u201d Barbara yelled.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Joe shouted out.</p><p>But Barbara made a leap for the wall, and the single light in the basement went out just as a bullet exploded in the night, followed by the thuds and grunts of hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Genevieve was powerless to help in any way. She wrenched desperately at her chains and with the help of a surge of adrenaline, freed one hand. She pressed at the bricks, trying to topple the wall of her makeshift prison, but they wouldn\u2019t give.</p><p>And then the light went back on.</p><p>With her limited field of vision, she could see Joe and Albee rolling across the floor, locked in a deadly struggle for life or death.</p><p>Genevieve stretched out as far as she could, found a brick and threw it.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Barbara screamed and crashed to her knees.</p><p>Gen heard a sickening thud, and Albee screamed. He rose above Joe for a minute, then jumped back down on Joe in what looked like a wrestler\u2019s savage slam, but with one key difference.</p><p>Albee Bennet was dead from a bullet to the heart.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d Genevieve gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. He\u2019s just...heavy.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the body off, and as he staggered to his feet, she could see that he was torn and bleeding. And then, in the distance, she heard the blessed sound of sirens.</p><p>Joe tore down the wall Albee had built, then jerked the second chain from the wall, lifted her and held her close.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pull away until a dozen policemen hurried down to the basement. Even then, he didn\u2019t go far.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked into her eyes. Offered her a crooked grin. \u201c\u2018The Tell-Tale Heart\u2019?\u201d he suggested. \u201cMy heart is your heart, so I heard it from a distance?\u201d His smile faded. \u201cMatt told me,\u201d he said. \u201cMatt brought me to you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cLeslie and Lori were here,\u201d she told him, then smiled. Dirty and disheveled, he smiled in return.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>As I said, it\u2019s not easy being a ghost.</p><p>But it does get better.</p><p>The why of it, though, is something I\u2019m just beginning to understand.</p><p>One of the reasons we stayed behind, Matt and I\u2014one I see so clearly now\u2014was so we could help uncover the Poe Killer\u2014or Killers, as it turned out. Joe put the last pieces together when he remembered how hard Albee Bennet had clapped when Barbara Hirshorn had given her reading at Thorne Bigelow\u2019s funeral, a hint that that the man evidently had a crush on her. What he hadn\u2019t realized at the time was just how mutual and serious those feelings were, or how far they would go on each other\u2019s behalf.</p><p>The couple that kills together stays together?</p><p>They\u2019re not together now, though I suppose they may be in the future. I was there when Albee Bennet left this world, and, I assure you, he didn\u2019t go anywhere pleasant, with soft white clouds and harp music floating on a gentle breeze. Something came for him, something swift and oozing that reeked of brimstone and charred flesh.</p><p>Barbara Hirshorn, on the other hand, did not die that night. She\u2019s locked up now, and I expect she will be for quite some time.</p><p>As for Lori, though she did extremely well during her first outing as a ghost, she chose to leave us. That light is hard to resist. I hope she\u2019s finally gotten star billing. She deserves it.</p><p>Sam Latham made a full recovery and went home.</p><p>Sorting out some of the other details proved a more complex task. Apparently Barbara took a few days off from the library now and then, days that coincided with the Bigelows\u2019 travel schedule. It was easy enough for her to slip away to be with her secret lover. And for all that she adored and admired him, she would never have admitted to the affair, too afraid of what her fellow board members would say. A librarian was one thing. A librarian involved with a butler? She was certain she would have been ousted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She encouraged Albee to kill William Morton, helped him with his costume and drove him around. The police believe now that Barbara was the one to lure Bradley Hicks to his death. It was easy enough to arrange a meeting in the cemetery, and from there...</p><p>Sarah was lucky she wasn\u2019t seen, or she, too, might have been found in a tomb. Hopefully no one will ever tell her that.</p><p>Barbara had extracted the arsenic that killed Thorne from rat poison. As a librarian, she had Internet access and lots of time to read, and the method wasn\u2019t hard to come by.</p> <p>Larry Levine finally wrote a book. It was on the Poe Killings, and it was published by Brook Avery, in his first venture into book publishing. It was not only well-reviewed, it was a bestseller.</p><p>Don Tracy is scheduled to perform as Albee Bennet in an adaptation of the book that\u2019s coming to Broadway. It\u2019s going to be a musical. Go figure. It might be a short run. Then again, who knows?</p><p>Nat Halloway, executor of Thorne Bigelow\u2019s will, filed all the papers and did all the work. The New York Poe Society received a huge endowment. Jared, who inherited the bulk of the money, married Mary. She\u2019s still a closet drunk and a bit of a bitch. Which is sort of ironic and actually okay. They deserve each other.</p><p>At first Genevieve and Joe talked about running away to Vegas and doing something fun, like an Elvis wedding. But they both adore Eileen and didn\u2019t want to cheat her out of her chance to play mother of the bride, so instead they were married at St. Patrick\u2019s in a huge affair. Matt and I were there, of course, and I know they saw us.</p><p>They moved out to Joe\u2019s place in Brooklyn, but they\u2019re contemplating something a little wilder. Joe still has the urge to move out to Vegas.</p> <p>Matt and I...</p><p>We\u2019re still learning. Learning as we go.</p><p>It isn\u2019t easy being a ghost, but it has its rewards. Matt and I have everything we need most, in life and in death. We love, and we\u2019re loved in return. And isn\u2019t that what everybody wants? </p> </body></html>"]
