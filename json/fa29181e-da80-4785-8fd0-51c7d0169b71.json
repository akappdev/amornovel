He was drenched in sweat and panting from the force of his workout. Because he could not experience pleasure without physical suffering, the burn in his muscles had excited him.</p><p>As always, his gaze sought out his woman and he palmed the blade they preferred to use during their loveplay. She was sitting at the edge of their big bed, lovely features drawn tight as she studied the canvas in front of her. A canvas she\u2019d propped on an easel and lowered so that she had a direct view. Blond hair fell to her shoulders in wild disarray, as if she\u2019d tangled her fingers through the thick mass multiple times, and she was chewing on her bottom lip.Sex could wait. She was troubled, and he would be unable to think of anything else until he\u2019d solved this dilemma for her. So he sheathed the blade.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, angel?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes lifted and landed on him, worry in their emerald depths. She offered him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t I help you figure it out?\u201d Anything that bothered her, he would dispatch. No hesitation. For her happiness, he would do anything, kill anyone.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I shower before I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like you just how you are.\u201d</p> <p>Darling woman. But he didn\u2019t like the thought of dirtying her pretty clothes. He quickly grabbed a towel from the bathroom and rubbed himself dry. Only then did he settle behind his woman, his legs encasing hers, his arms wrapping around her waist. Breathing deeply of her wild storm scent, he rested his chin in the hollow of her neck and followed the direction of her gaze.</p><p>What he saw surprised him.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have. Her paintings were always vivid. As the All-Seeing Eye, an oracle of the gods and one of their most cherished aides, she could peer into heaven and hell. And did, every night, though she had no control over what she witnessed. Past, present, future, it didn\u2019t matter. Every morning, she painted what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>This one was of a man. A warrior, clearly. With that muscle mass, he had to be. A gold collar circled his neck, cinching tight. He was on his knees, legs spread. His arms rested on his thighs, palms raised. His dark head was thrown back, and he was roaring up at a domed ceiling. In pain, perhaps. Maybe even fury. There was blood smeared all over his chest, seeping from multiple wounds. Wounds that looked as if his skin had been carved away.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Reyes asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p> <p>Then they would reason this out as best they were able. \u201cWas he from heaven or hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven. Definitely. I think he\u2019s in Cronus\u2019s throne room.\u201d</p><p>A god, then? A few months ago, Titans had overthrown the Greeks and seized control of the divine throne. So, if this man was in Cronus\u2019s throne room, chained up, hurt, and Cronus was leader of the Titans, that must mean the warrior was a Greek. A slave who had been punished, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cYou saw only this image?\u201d Reyes asked. \u201cNot what got him to this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Danika said with a nod. \u201cI heard him scream, though. It was...\u201d She shuddered, and his arms squeezed her in comfort. \u201cI felt so sorry for him. Never have I heard so much rage and helplessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can summon Cronus.\u201d Cronus wasn\u2019t too fond of Reyes and his fellow Lords of the Underworld\u2014the very men who had opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the evil from inside. The men who had then been cursed to carry that evil inside themselves. But the god king hated their enemy, the Hunters, more, because Danika had seen Galen, the leader of the Hunters, chop off Cronus\u2019s head in a vision. Now the god king was determined to kill Galen before Galen could kill him. Even if that meant soliciting the aid of the Lords. \u201cWe can ask him if he knows this man.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed while Danika pondered his suggestion. Finally, she sighed, nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019d like that.\u201d Then she surprised him by turning to him and offering the sweetest smile he\u2019d ever seen. Well, all of her smiles were that way. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early in the morning to summon anyone, and besides, I think you had other things on your mind when you entered the room. Why don\u2019t you tell me about them?\u201d she suggested huskily.</p><p>He was rock hard in seconds\u2014that\u2019s what she did to him. \u201cThat would be my pleasure, angel.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed him to his back, smile widening. \u201cAnd mine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cBe still, Nike. You\u2019re only making this worse for yourself.\u201d Atlas, Titan god of Strength, stared down at the bane of his existence. Nike, Greek goddess of Strength. His godly counterpart. His enemy. And an all-around grade-A bitch.</p><p>Two of his best men held her arms and two held her legs. They should have been able to pin her without incident. She was collared, after all, and that collar prevented her from using any of her immortal powers. Even her legendary strength\u2014strength that was not on par with his, thank you. But never had a female been more stubborn\u2014or more determined to fell him. She continually struggled against their hold, punching, kicking and biting like a cornered animal.\u201cI will kill you for this,\u201d she growled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not doing anything to you that you didn\u2019t once have done to me.\u201d Motions clipped, Atlas tore his shirt over his head and tossed it aside, revealing his chest, the ropes of his stomach. There, in the center, in big black letters spanning from one tiny brown nipple to the other, was her name, spelled out for all the world to see. N.I.K.E.</p><p>She\u2019d branded him, reduced him to her property.</p><p>Had he deserved it? Maybe. Once, he\u2019d been a prisoner in this bleak realm. In Tartarus, a divine dungeon. He\u2019d been a god overthrown and locked away, forgotten, no better than rubbish. He\u2019d wanted out, and he had been willing to do anything to see it done. Anything. So he had seduced Nike, one of his guards, using her feelings for him against her.</p><p>Though she would deny it now, she truly had fallen a little in love with him. The proof: she\u2019d arranged his escape, a crime punishable by death. Yet she\u2019d been willing to risk it. For him. Only, just before she could remove his collar, allowing him to flash himself away\u2014moving from one place to another with only a thought\u2014she discovered that he had also seduced several other female guards. Why rely on one to get the job done when four could serve him better?</p><p>He\u2019d counted on the fact that none of the Greek females would want their affair with an enslaved Titan known. He\u2019d counted on their silence.</p><p>What he should have done was count on their jealousy.</p><p>Nike had realized she\u2019d been used, that his emotions had never really been engaged. Rather than throw him back into his cell and pretend he did not exist, rather than have him beaten, she\u2019d had him held down and marked permanently.</p><p>For years he\u2019d dreamed of returning the favor. Sometimes he thought the desire was the only thing that kept him sane as he wiled away century after century in this hellhole. Alone, darkness his only companion.</p><p>Imagine his delight when the prison walls began to crack. When the defenses began to crumble. When their collars fell away. It had taken a while, but he and his brethren had finally managed to work their way free. They\u2019d attacked the Greeks, brutally and without mercy.</p><p>In a matter of days, they had won.</p><p>The Greeks were defeated and now locked exactly where they\u2019d locked the Titans. Atlas had volunteered to oversee the realm and had thankfully been placed in charge. Finally, his day of vengeance had arrived. Nike would forever bear his mark.</p><p>\u201cYou should be grateful you\u2019re alive,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, evilly. \u201cYou\u2019ve done that, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her struggles increased. Increased so viciously she was soon panting and sweating right alongside his men.</p><p>\u201cFlip her over,\u201d he ordered them. No mercy. Atlas didn\u2019t have the patience to wait until she tired. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep tattooing until my name is clear enough to satisfy me.\u201d</p><p>With a frustrated, infuriated screech, she finally stilled. She knew he spoke true. He always spoke true. Threats were not something he wasted his breath uttering. Only promises.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Atlas strode forward and ripped the cloth from her back. The skin was tanned, smooth. Flawless. Once, he\u2019d caressed this back. Once, he\u2019d kissed and licked it. And yes, being with her had been more satisfying than being with any of the others, but he would not be ruled by his dick and release her before branding her, all in the hopes that he could get her into bed again. He would do this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I did to you,\u201d Nike rasped. \u201cI didn\u2019t mark your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would rather I brand your lovely breasts?\u201d</p><p>At that, she held her tongue.</p><p>Good. He didn\u2019t want to mar her chest. Her breasts were a work of art, surely the world\u2019s finest creation. \u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d he muttered. He held out his hand and someone slapped the needed supplies in his palm. \u201cAt least you won\u2019t have to look at my name every day of your too-long life.\u201d As he had to do.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she suddenly cried. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d She turned her head and there were tears in her brown eyes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman. Could barely be called pretty. Her nose was a little too long, and her cheeks a little too sharp. She had ordinary brown hair cut to hit her too-wide shoulders, and the body of a warrior. But there was something about her that had always drawn him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cDry the fake tears, Nike.\u201d And he knew they were fake. She wasn\u2019t prone to displays of emotion. \u201cThey don\u2019t affect me and they certainly don\u2019t become you.\u201d</p><p>Instantly her eyelids narrowed, the tears miraculously gone. \u201cFine. But I will make you regret this. I vow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your attempts.\u201d Truth. Sparring with her had always excited him.</p><p>Without a single beat of hesitation, he pressed the ink gun just below her shoulder blade. His grip was steady as he etched the outline of the first letter. A. Not once did she flinch. Not once did she act as if she felt a single ounce of pain. He knew it hurt, though. Oh, did he know. To permanently mark an immortal, ambrosia had to be mixed into the colored liquid and that ambrosia burned like acid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She remained silent as he finished each of the outlines. Silent, still, as he filled in the letters. When he finished, he sat back on his haunches and surveyed his work: A.T.L.A.S.</p><p>He expected satisfaction to overtake him, so long had he waited for this moment. It didn\u2019t. He expected relief to overwhelm him; vengeance had been achieved. It didn\u2019t. What he didn\u2019t expect was a white-hot sweep of possessiveness, but that\u2019s exactly what he experienced.</p><p>Nike now belonged to him. Forever. And all the world would know it.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Nike paced the confines of her cell. A cell she shared with several others. Knowing her temper as intimately as they did, they were careful to stay out of her way. Still. Roommates sucked. She could feel their eyes boring into her robe-clad back, as if they could see the name now branded there.</p><p>If they dared say a single word about it...There hadn\u2019t been enough cells to contain all of the Greeks, so they\u2019d been crammed into each chamber in groups. Male, female, it hadn\u2019t mattered. Maybe the Titans hadn\u2019t cared about the mixing of the sexes, or maybe they\u2019d done it to increase the torment of each prisoner. The latter was probably the case. Husbands had not been paired with wives and friend had not been paired with friend. No, rival had been paired with rival.</p><p>For her, that rival was Erebos, the minor god of darkness. Once, Erebos had treated her like a queen. Once, she\u2019d really liked him. Had even considered marrying him. But then she\u2019d fallen in love with Atlas\u2014that womanizing, lying bastard Atlas\u2014so she\u2019d cut Erebos loose. Then she\u2019d discovered that Atlas had never really wanted her, that Atlas had only been using her. Love had quickly morphed into rage.</p><p>The rage, though, had eventually cooled. She\u2019d forgotten him. For the most part. Now, with his name decorating her back, she hated him with every fiber of her being.</p> <p>Maybe\u2014maybe\u2014she\u2019d overreacted when she\u2019d done the same to him. Branded him forever. Impulsiveness had always been her downfall, after all. For years, she\u2019d even regretted her decision. Not that she would ever admit such a thing to him. Regret was not what she felt now, however.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t lied to him. She would kill him for this.</p><p>First, she would have to find a way to remove the stupid collar around her neck. As long as she wore it, she was powerless. Second, she would have to find a way to escape this realm.</p><p>The first, in theory, should have been easy. Yet she\u2019d already tried clawing and beating at it, and had even attempted to melt it from her neck. All she\u2019d done was cut her skin, bruise her tender flesh and singe her hair off. The second, in theory and reality, seemed impossible.</p><p>Her gaze circled her surroundings. After the Titans escaped, they\u2019d reinforced everything. How, she didn\u2019t know. The prison was supposedly bound to Tartarus, the Greek god of Confinement who\u2019d once kept guard over the Titans, and when he\u2019d begun to weaken for no apparent reason, the realm had weakened, as well. Everything in it became structurally unsound. But now, Tartarus was missing. The Titans didn\u2019t have him and no one knew where he was. There was no reason the realm should be as strong as it was in his absence.</p><p>The walls and floor were comprised of godly stone, something only special godly tools\u2014tools she didn\u2019t have\u2014could break through, and yet, even without Tartarus\u2019s presence, there was not a crack in sight.</p> <p>The thick silver bars that allowed a glimpse of the guard\u2019s station below had been constructed by Hephaistos, and only Hephaistos could melt such a metal. Unfortunately, he resided somewhere else. As with Tartarus, no one knew where. Still, without Tartarus, she should have been able to bend that metal. She couldn\u2019t; she\u2019d already tried.</p><p>\u201cCould you settle the hell down?\u201d Erebos grumbled from one of the cots. From his dark hair to his dark skin, from his handsome features to his strong body, he was the picture of unhappy male, all of that unhappiness pointed at her. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to plan an escape here.\u201d</p><p>They were always planning an escape.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201cyour ugly face is giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo suck yourself,\u201d she replied. Though she\u2019d been the one to hurt him all those centuries ago\u2014unintentionally\u2014he\u2019d repaid her a thousand times over. Purposefully. Not emotionally, but physically. He liked nothing better than to \u201caccidentally\u201d trip her, bump into her and send her flying, as well as to eat what little portion of food was meant for her before she could fight her way to the front of the line, starving her. If she hadn\u2019t been wearing the collar, he never would have been able to do those things. She would have been too strong. Another reason to despise her captivity.</p><p>\u201cSucking myself would probably elicit better results than when you did it,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>The handful of gods and goddesses around him snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, as if the taunt didn\u2019t bother her. Except, her cheeks did flush. She was the epitome of strength\u2014or she was supposed to be\u2014and she\u2019d always been more mannish than feminine. That was why Atlas\u2019s attention had so surprised and delighted her. That gorgeous man could have won anyone, yet he\u2019d chosen her. Or so she\u2019d thought. And she\u2019d fallen for his act because he\u2019d somehow made her feel like a delicate, beautiful woman.</p> <p>Just then, Atlas strode into the guard\u2019s station. She didn\u2019t have to see him to know. She felt him. Always she felt his heat. When her gaze found him, she discovered that he had his arm wrapped around a leggy blonde. A blonde who cuddled herself into his side as if she belonged there\u2014and had rested there many times before.</p><p>The thought angered Nike. It shouldn\u2019t have; she despised Atlas with all of her being and didn\u2019t care who he slept with. Didn\u2019t care who he pleasured. And yes, he would have pleasured the blonde with those talented hands and seeking lips. He was an amazing lover whose touch still haunted Nike\u2019s dreams. But there it was. Anger.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to, but found herself striding to the bars and gripping them for a better, closer look at him. Three other guards stood around him, all talking and laughing. While prisoners wore white, guards wore black, and he wore that darkness well. It was the perfect complement to his dark, chopped hair and sea-colored eyes.</p><p>His face had been chiseled by a master artist, everything about him perfectly proportioned. His eyes were the perfect distance apart, his nose the perfect length, his cheeks the perfect sharpness, his lips the perfect shape and color and his chin a perfect, stubborn square.</p><p>She should have known he was playing her the moment he\u2019d turned those dangerous eyes on her and they lit with \u201cinterest.\u201d Men just didn\u2019t look at her like that. Not even Erebos had, and he had loved her.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she muttered, the curse for both the men in her past.</p><p>As if he heard her, Atlas lifted his gaze. The moment their eyes met, she wanted to release the bars. She wanted to step away, out of sight. But she didn\u2019t allow herself that luxury. That would have been cowardly, and this man had seen her weak one too many times.</p><p>Just to taunt him, and hopefully make him feel as out of control as he always made her feel, she allowed her attention to fall to his chest, exactly where her name rested. She smiled smugly before raising her gaze and arching a brow. Score. A muscle ticked in his jaw.</p><p>What does your lover think of your mark? she wanted to shout. What does the blonde think of my name on your body?</p><p>He jerked the stupid blonde deeper into his side and, without breaking eye contact with Nike, planted a lush, wet kiss on her mouth. Of course, she reacted as any other woman would have. She wrapped her arms around him and held on for dear life. As Nike well knew, that man could make a woman come with the expertise of his kiss.</p><p>Nike\u2019s anger intensified. Had she been able, she would have stomped down there and ripped them apart. Then she would have killed them both. Not because she wanted Atlas for herself\u2014she didn\u2019t\u2014but because he was clearly using yet another woman. Passion did not glow from his expression. Only determination did.</p><p>Nike would be doing the female population a favor by snuffing him out.</p><p>\u201cErebos,\u201d she called. \u201cCome here. I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped out, his shock clear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a kiss or not? Get over here. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>There was a rustling of clothing behind her and then her former lover was beside her. He was a prisoner, and sex was a rarity. He would take what he could get, even from someone he loathed. That much she knew.</p><p>Nike turned to him; he was already leaning down. Like the blonde, she wrapped her arms around her companion\u2019s neck and held on tight. Only, she didn\u2019t enjoy the kiss, familiar as it was. Erebos\u2019s taste was too...what? Different from Atlas\u2019s, she realized, and that ratcheted her anger another notch. No man should have that much power over her.</p><p>Still. She let Erebos continue. Atlas needed to realize that she no longer desired him. He needed to realize that he would never, never play her emotions again. She was not an idealistic little girl anymore. He\u2019d made sure of that.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Rage. Absolute rage filled Atlas. He released his companion\u2014he couldn\u2019t recall her name\u2014and she gasped in protest at the abruptness of his actions. He didn\u2019t bother explaining what he was about as he stomped away from her. The rage continued to spread as he climbed the stairs that led to the prisoner\u2019s cages and to the cell holding Nike.</p><p>His name was on her back. How dare she allow another man to put his lips on her?When he reached his destination, he raised his arm, and the sensor he\u2019d had embedded in his wrist caused the bars to slide open. Several prisoners were seated against the far wall. Rapturous longing colored their faces as they watched the minor god of Darkness and the goddess of Strength clean each other\u2019s tonsils. So absorbed were they, in fact, that they didn\u2019t rush Atlas and try to escape. Or maybe that had something to do with the pain they would feel if they did so. He had only to press a button, and their collars would ravage their brains.</p><p>Nike moaned, as if she really liked what was being done to her. Red flickered through Atlas\u2019s vision. How. Dare. She. Teeth grinding, he grabbed Nike by the collar of her robe and jerked her into the hard line of his body, away from Erebos. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A gasp escaped her. Unlike when the blonde had gasped, he did not remain unaffected. He wanted to swallow the sound\u2014and do something, anything, to cause Nike to make it again.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Erebos snapped, foolishly reaching for her to finish what had been started. \u201cWe were busy.\u201d</p> <p>Scowling, Atlas kicked him in the chest. The smaller man flew backward, slamming into his fellow prisoners. He jumped to his feet to attack, saw who had rendered the blow and stilled, nostrils flaring.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again,\u201d Atlas said, \u201cand I\u2019ll remove your collar\u2014right along with your head.\u201d</p><p>The god paled, perhaps even whimpered. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t worth it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Atlas might kill him for his words, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Nike demanded, suddenly coming to life and drawing his attention. She whirled on him, glaring up at him. \u201cI can sleep with whoever I want. And hey, I might even pick one of your friends.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her heated words, she wasn\u2019t breathless as she would have been if Atlas had been the one kissing her, and her cheeks weren\u2019t flushed. Her nipples weren\u2019t even hard. Finally, something cooled the hottest flames of his rage.</p><p>\u201cJust zip your mouth.\u201d He latched on to Nike\u2019s upper arm and dragged her out of the cell with him. Automatically, the bars closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she said again, tugging against his hold. She\u2019d never been one to obey him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing?\u201d he countered. When he reached the bottom of the steps, he stopped. The blonde, who just happened to be the goddess of memory\u2014damn it, what was her name? Mini? No, but close. M and M? Minisong? Closer. Mnemosyne. Yes, that was it\u2014Mnemosyne, as well as the three other warriors chosen to guard Tartarus today, were gaping at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped. At least Nike stopped resisting him. She stilled at his side, attention darting from him to the others, the others to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just remove a prisoner,\u201d Hyperion, god of light, said. He was a handsome man, though as pale as his title suggested, and Nike had better not be eyeing him as a possible bedmate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not removing her,\u201d Atlas replied stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m relocating her.\u201d To a cell of her own, where no one could put their dirty, disgusting lips on her. Where no one could put their roving hands on her body. There was nothing sexual about this decision, either. He simply didn\u2019t want her experiencing any type of pleasure. She didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mnemosyne regarded him curiously, not a single thread of upset or jealously in her expression.</p><p>Why? he wondered himself. She\u2019d been eager to date him for months, summoning him constantly. Last night, she\u2019d even shown up at his home naked.</p><p>She was beautiful, yes, and he\u2019d almost given in and slept with her. His body had been worked into a frenzy after what had transpired with Nike, and he\u2019d been desperate for release. But before he sealed the deal, he\u2019d sent the determined goddess away. He\u2019d felt too guilty to continue. As if he were cheating on Nike. Which was ridiculous. The only relationship he had with Nike was one of hate.</p><p>Besides, who wanted to spend time with a female who would never forget your mistakes? A female who would remember your every transgression? Not him. Yet he\u2019d flashed to Mnemosyne\u2019s home this morning and asked her to spend the day with him, just so he could bring her to the prison this morning. He\u2019d been strangely jubilant at the thought of parading her in front of Nike.</p><p>So again, he wondered why Mnemosyne did not feel as if Nike were a threat. Though most females didn\u2019t, he knew. He\u2019d heard them talk. Nike was too tall, too muscled, they said. She was too hard, and too coarse. But those were the things that had first sparked his interest in her. She could handle his strength. She gave as good as she got. She would never wither under his glare. She would never run from his anger. She would always face him head-on. And he liked that. A lot. No other female he\u2019d ever encountered had that kind of courage.</p><p>And she was pretty, he thought. Yes, only yesterday he\u2019d thought her barely so, but, just now, that seemed wrong on every level. Only a short while ago, when he\u2019d first walked into the prison, he\u2019d felt her gaze on him and had looked up. For a second, only a second, her defenses had been lowered. She hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been watching her, so she hadn\u2019t guarded her expression. An expression that had been soft, wistful, her eyes luminous. The sight of her had heated his blood as if he\u2019d been caught on fire.</p><p>That still didn\u2019t mean he desired her, his enemy. The fact that his name was spelled across her back was simply playing havoc with his mind, his sense of possession, he was sure.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mnemosyne prompted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nike said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for an answer.\u201d</p><p>To what? Oh, yeah. Why was he moving her. He raised his chin, refusing to look down at her. Not that he would have had to look far. At six foot, she was nearly as tall as he was. \u201cI don\u2019t need a reason. I\u2019m responsible for this prison and everyone in it. Therefore, if I want to move you, I can.\u201d</p><p>The last was meant for the Titans. They would do well not to question him.</p><p>Without another word, he dragged Nike away. Where should he take her? To his office, he decided. At the moment, there wasn\u2019t an empty cell in the entire realm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t have that bastard slain,\u201d he said when he was sure the others couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cthat bastard\u201d was. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>For touching what\u2019s mine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have permission to consort with you.\u201d Atlas snaked a corner, and there at the end of the hallway was his door.</p><p>\u201cConsort with me?\u201d She laughed without humor. \u201cOh, wait. I get it. You can screw anyone you want, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Good. They were on the same page. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He pushed his way inside and finally released her. His hands itched to return to her, but he kept them at his sides. Rather than settle behind his desk, he faced her, placing them nose to nose. \u201cYou are to suffer in solitude.\u201d Gods, she smelled good. Like passion. Pure, white-hot passion.</p><p>\u201cAs if. I have more fun with myself, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The image those words evoked nearly sent him to his knees. He should back away. Before he did something stupid.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed, you know. You\u2019re as much of an ass now as you were years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t just insulted him. Stupid, be damned. She was here, and they were alone. \u201cIf you need to be kissed, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>There was no time to protest. In less than it took to blink, Nike found herself smashed into the wall, Atlas pressing against her, solid chest to soft breasts, his hands pinning her temples, his mouth slamming into hers. His tongue thrust deep, without warning, forcing its way past her teeth.</p><p>She could have bitten him. Wanted to bite him, actually, and not in affection. She wanted to draw blood, pain. Instead, her body became his slave, as if centuries of hatred hadn\u2019t passed, and she welcomed him inside. She wound her arms around him and arched into his erection. Erection? Oh, yes. He was hard. Hard and long and thick.His taste was decadent, wild and burning, like dark spices. His muscles were tensed under her palms. Up she moved them, until her fingers were tangled in his hair. The short spikes abraded deliciously, causing her to shiver.</p><p>Touch me, she wanted to shout. It had been so long, so damned long, since she\u2019d experienced this. Oh, she\u2019d been with other men since giving herself so foolishly to Atlas, because she\u2019d been searching for something as intense as what they had shared. But each experience had left her hollow, unsatisfied. And then she had been captured\u2014by Atlas himself\u2014and unceremoniously stuffed into this prison.</p><p>With the lack of privacy, there\u2019d been no opportunities to find companionship. Not that she would have wanted to or had even tried. No one drew her anymore. No one but Atlas, damn him.</p><p>Yes, damn him. Him. The man who had held her down only yesterday and etched his name into her flesh. What was she doing, allowing this? He would think she still cared for him. He would think she still pined for him, dreamed of him...craved him. That might be true, curse it, but she would never allow him to know it.</p><p>Panting, she tore her mouth away. \u201cI don\u2019t want you,\u201d she lied. \u201cLet me go. Now.\u201d</p><p>A low growl erupted from his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want you, either.\u201d Once, twice, he rubbed his shaft against her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Tremors slid the length of her spine. Sweet heaven. He\u2019d hit her sweet spot, and sensation rocketed through her. Then one of his hands lowered and cupped her breast, and her knees almost buckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word was a mere whimper. And why was she allowing him the choice? Why wasn\u2019t she ripping away from him? You are Strength. Act like it.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I let you go?\u201d He rolled her hardened nipple between his fingers.</p><p>That was why she remained as she was, she thought, dazed. The pleasure was building, flowing through her veins, burning her up, recreating her into a new being. Someone who lived for satisfaction alone. Someone who didn\u2019t care that the one responsible for her desire was an enemy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I...\u201d Those fingers tightened, stinging her a little. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>Their mouths met again, and this time she rose on her tiptoes to meet him. She couldn\u2019t stop herself. As their tongues clashed and warred, he cupped her ass and lifted her feet off the floor. Forcing him to hold her weight would have been fun, but not nearly as pleasurable as winding her legs around his waist and pressing her needy core against his shaft.</p><p>With her braced against the wall, he was able to tunnel both of his hands under her robe. Their bodies were too close together for him to reach her slick center, where she wanted him most, but having his hands on her cheeks, skin against skin, was almost as welcome. He was hotter than she remembered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips left hers, but before she could moan her disappointment, he was kissing and licking his way down her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d His nose nuzzled the golden slave collar as if it were a trinket rather than a device that could kill her. For once, she even liked the collar.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d More. At the moment, that was the only word she was capable of. Unless...did he think to make her beg?</p><p>Fury suddenly blended with desire. Well, she would show him. She would beg for nothing. Not even this. Especially this. Not for him.</p><p>\u201cThen more you shall have,\u201d he said, shocking her. He tugged the fabric of her robe down, revealing her breasts. Air hissed through his teeth. \u201cSo lovely. So perfect.\u201d His tongue flicked out and circled the nipple he\u2019d pinched just a short while ago. \u201cSo mine.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, and her nails scratched at his back. So good. The heat...the wetness...the\u2014\u201cYes!\u201d The suction. He was sucking at her so forcefully, her stomach muscles were quivering. \u201cAtlas,\u201d she groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d A command, not a plea.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d He straightened, his narrowed gaze suddenly pinning her in place far more effectively than his body. \u201cI want you. All of you.\u201d</p> <p>She struggled to regain her breath. Her senses. \u201cYou mean sex?\u201d Yes, yes, yes. Here, now.</p><p>A clipped nod was the only answer she received. She opened her mouth to reply, but somehow found the strength to stop herself. She drank in the sight of him\u2014a sight that delighted her almost as much as it angered her. Angered? Why? His nostrils were flared, his lips pulled tight. He looked as if he barely had himself under control.</p><p>Did he want her that badly? she wondered. Or was he merely that good an actor?</p><p>Yes, she mused darkly. He was that good an actor. And that was where the anger sprang from. He\u2019d looked at her like that once before, the last time they\u2019d had sex. That look had been the catalyst to her decision to free him, despite the consequences to herself. Consequences that could have resulted in a death sentence. But, she\u2019d thought, he truly loves me with the same intensity that I love him. She\u2019d thought anything worth the risk of freeing him. Of possibly being with him for eternity.</p><p>How they would have managed that, she hadn\u2019t known. But she\u2019d wanted to try. He had not.</p><p>Thank the gods she\u2019d encountered one of the members of his skank parade mere minutes after escorting him from the building and into the clouds outside, where he would have been able to flash. He\u2019d still had his collar on\u2014she hadn\u2019t wanted to remove it until they\u2019d bypassed every single guard. That way, everyone who saw them walking together would have assumed she was simply moving a prisoner.</p> <p>But outside, they\u2019d been seen. No one could flash out of or into the prison itself, so everyone had to walk through the front door. Aergia, the goddess of laziness, of all things, had decided to come to work early, surprise, surprise\u2014just to be with Atlas again. She\u2019d stopped Nike to question where he was being taken.</p><p>I\u2019m taunting him with what he can never have again, Nike had claimed.</p><p>The goddess had frowned. Well, take him to my office when you\u2019re done.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The frown became a slow, sensual smile. So I can dish my brand of...punishment to him.</p><p>Dread had sparked inside her. And how do you punish him?</p><p>How do you think? But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll leave him begging for more. I always do.</p><p>Atlas had tried to run then, mowing right over them both, but with his collar still in place, he hadn\u2019t gotten far. Nike had locked him back up and, suspicious, questioned all the female guards. Nearly every single one of them had had a go at him. And he\u2019d told them all the same thing: You are beautiful. I want to spend my life with you. All I need is my freedom, and I will be your slave for eternity.</p> <p>So, have sex with him again? \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he snapped. His grip tightened on her, his fingers digging deep, bruising. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she knew what this little make-out session was about. He planned to sleep with her, make her fall in love with him all over again, and then dump her. He\u2019d grind up her pride, spit it out and stomp all over it. All to punish her, she was sure, for daring to tattoo him as she had. Marking her with his name clearly wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cWanting you dead and wanting your body aren\u2019t the same things.\u201d With a sugar-sweet grin, she patted his cheek. \u201cAnd I can promise you that while I do want the first, I was only teasing you about the second.\u201d Now who was playing who? \u201cSo...if we\u2019re done here...?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. His arms fell away from her, and he stepped back. She nearly collapsed, but managed to shift her legs and absorb her own weight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d he said, his tone clipped. \u201cWe are definitely done.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Atlas had to empty a cell of its seven occupants and place those gods and goddesses within other, already cramped cells to make a place for Nike. The time and effort was worth it, though. He couldn\u2019t tolerate the thought of her with that bastard, Erebos, doing the same things to him that she\u2019d once done to Atlas.</p><p>Not. Going. To. Happen.And maybe, perhaps, there was a slight chance it had nothing to do with punishing her and everything to do with the pleasure he\u2019d earlier denied. In her arms, he\u2019d come alive. That had happened last time, too, but he\u2019d written it off as prisoner insanity. Now, he couldn\u2019t write it off. He wasn\u2019t a prisoner; he was a warden. He\u2019d come alive, and he needed more. Of her, only her. Yet she claimed she\u2019d merely been playing him.</p><p>He wanted that to be a lie more than he wanted to take his next breath. Which he didn\u2019t understand. She was doomed to spend eternity hidden away, which meant they could not have any kind of life together. Not even if he freed her. He would then be locked away or put to death.</p><p>For a week, Atlas lamented his plight and pondered what to do. All the while, he stayed away from Nike\u2019s new cell. That didn\u2019t stop him from thinking about her, however. What was she doing? Did she think of him? Did she dream of him and that shattering kiss?</p><p>He did. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the passion glowing from her face. A face that was exquisite. From barely passable, to pretty, to exquisite, all in a week\u2019s time. He shook his head in wonder. But she deserved the praise. Her lashes were long and as rich as black velvet. Velvet that framed sensual chocolate eyes. Her cheeks were smooth, perfect for caressing, and her lush, red lips were sweeter than ambrosia. And all that strength...his shaft filled and lengthened just remembering it. She\u2019d gripped and scratched him with savage abandon. He still bore the marks.</p><p>They definitely weren\u2019t done. Not even close. He had to experience that again.</p><p>Finally, he could stand the separation no longer. Thankfully, his shift was over. A shift that had consisted of walking the prison halls, watching the prisoners inside their cells and ensuring everyone remained calm.</p><p>That should have bored him. After all, he was a warrior. But bore him it didn\u2019t. And that should have irritated him. After all, he\u2019d spent countless centuries in this place and had sworn never to return once he\u2019d escaped. But again, irritation was not what he felt. He\u2019d wanted this job to be close to Nike. To have his vengeance, he\u2019d once told himself. Now, he wasn\u2019t so sure. Today, and all week really, he\u2019d walked the halls invigorated, knowing all he had to do to catch sight of her was turn a corner.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to do so. Until now. Finally, he would see her.</p><p>The moment she came into view, his blood heated, blistering. His breath followed suit, flaming his lungs to ash. She sat atop her cot, arms gripping the rail, knees drawn up while she leaned slightly forward. Her hair was finger-combed to perfection, and her eyes were narrowed, shielding her irises and the emotion banked there, but at least he could see the shadows her lashes cast over her cheeks. Shadows he might trace with a fingertip.</p><p>Oh, yes. She was exquisite.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d Her voice was smooth as silk. Just beneath that silk, however, he thought he caught a tendril of fury.</p><p>Was she mad that he\u2019d come? Or mad that he\u2019d stayed away so long?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cToo bad for you that whores never commit.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was the whore that she spoke of, and popped his jaw. But he deserved that, he supposed. \u201cI did what I had to do to escape, Nike. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d No. Oh, no. He would not go down that road. He hadn\u2019t wanted to feel anything for her, but he had. That hadn\u2019t stopped him from using her, so she\u2019d never like what he had to say about the matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do anything to escape, as well.\u201d</p><p>Her expression darkened, but she did not refute his words. \u201cSo, did you come to free me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here? We have nothing more to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re all I think about anymore. He never should have marked her.</p><p>This might have been avoided. Or not. He might have slept with others all those years ago because he\u2019d been desperate to flee this place, but it had been her face he\u2019d imagined when he\u2019d done so.</p><p>Without looking away from her, he leaned back against the bar behind him and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to say. About the kiss.\u201d</p><p>She yawned, patting her beautiful mouth. A mouth he wanted all over his body. \u201cI\u2019d rather sleep.\u201d</p><p>So. She still wanted him to think she had been unaffected. Part of him believed it. An insecure part of him that had never really known how to deal with her, his equal in every way. Yes, even strength, though he often liked to deny it. The other part of him, the masculine part, knew she had liked everything he\u2019d done. She\u2019d shouted his name, for gods\u2019 sake, and he hadn\u2019t even made her climax.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want me?\u201d he asked as silkily as she had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He rested his fingers at the waist of his pants, twisting the button, and her eyes followed the movement. His cock was already hard, already straining, rising over the top. Moisture glistened there. \u201cNot even a tiny, tiny bit?\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cN-no.\u201d The word was croaked. \u201cBut you are. Tiny, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Liar. She did. She wanted him. And he was huge, thank you very much. The sense of possessiveness returned, all the more intense because it was joined by satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll have you yet, Nike. That I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...go away,\u201d she said, suddenly sounding almost...dejected. She eased to her side, then rolled to her back, facing away from him. \u201cWe\u2019re done with each other. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Wrong move. Seeing her back, even covered by that baggy robe, reminded him of what he\u2019d done and that set fire to his blood anew. Whatever he had to do, he was going to have this woman.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out,\u201d he told her before walking away.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p> <p>Atlas pushed past the double doors that led into Cronus\u2019s throne room. Armed guards, immortal warriors Cronus himself had created, were stationed along the edges of the walls. Each held a spear, and swords swung from the sheaths at their waists. They stood at attention, waiting for an order or a threat. They would spring into action for both.</p><p>Of course, there were also warriors lining both sides of the purple lamb\u2019s fleece carpet that led to the bejeweled dais, crowding Atlas as he made his way forward. His weapons had already been removed, but they were taking no chances, eyeing his every movement with distrust.He wondered if, when she had been a free woman, Nike had ever been summoned to this room, albeit to meet with Zeus, her king. And if she had, had it been for a reward or a punishment?</p><p>Stop thinking about her. Concentrate on Cronus. He\u2019s wily, that one. The god king was not the same man he\u2019d been before his incarceration. The thousands of years inside Tartarus had changed him; he was harder, harsher. Utterly unforgiving. Any weakness, he pounced upon.</p><p>Nowadays, Cronus refused to stay in the heavens without an army to shield him. But then, a man at war with his own wife couldn\u2019t be too careful. Especially when that wife was a queen with powerful abilities and allies of her own. A wife who\u2014</p><p>Dizziness spun through Atlas\u2019s head, fragmenting his thoughts, and he frowned. Frowned but didn\u2019t stop until he reached the end of the fleece. He kept his attention, foggy as it was, fixed on Cronus.</p><p>The king was seated atop a throne of solid gold. Dark strands were threaded through his silver hair, and his beard had thinned since the last time Atlas had seen him. Some of the age lines had even disappeared from his weathered features. He wore a long white robe, much like the prisoners of Tartarus. Why? He\u2019d often wondered.</p> <p>Only two explanations made any sense. He\u2019d worn the garment for centuries and now felt most comfortable in it. Or he did not want to forget what he\u2019d once been\u2014and could be again if he weren\u2019t careful. Atlas had been more than happy to shed his own robe. Would Nike do the same, if ever she gained her freedom? Not that she would.</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about her again.</p><p>A woman stood beside the throne. She possessed one of the plainest faces Atlas had ever seen, and had pale, freckled skin. She was reed thin, with dark, curling hair and delicate shoulders. Power did not hum from her. Rather, she seemed...insubstantial. Ethereal, as he imagined a ghost might look. There, but see-through. There, but wavering. Her eyes were shadowy, vacant, as if no one was home.</p><p>When she reached up and brushed a lock of hair from her brow, he could only gape. The elegance of the movement was awe inspiring. More graceful than a dancer, more delicate than a butterfly wing. Someone was indeed home, she just didn\u2019t care about what was happening around her.</p><p>Atlas pulled his attention from the female and studied the chamber. There were thousands of chandeliers overhead, each dripping with glistening teardrops. Multihued glitter sparkled in the air. Odd, he thought, head tilting to the side for a better view. That air was even sweetly scented with...He inhaled deeply. Ambrosia. Ah. Now he understood the dizziness and the glitter. Dried ambrosia was being pumped through the room. To keep him docile?</p><p>\u201cAtlas, god of Strength,\u201d Cronus said with a nod of greeting, drawing him from his musings.</p><p>Atlas bowed, as was proper. \u201cMy king. It\u2019s an honor to have this audience with you.\u201d</p><p>Cronus leaned forward, silver eyes bright with anxiety. \u201cAll is well in Tartarus, yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost assuredly.\u201d</p><p>Relief instantly replaced the anxiety. \u201cWhy, then, did you request this meeting?\u201d</p><p>There was no one who hated the Greeks more than this man, this Titan sovereign, and with very good reason. They\u2019d stripped him of his power, humiliated him in front of his people. Even Nike had been a participant.</p><p>Just tell him. Get this over with. \u201cI want to remove a woman from the prison and set her up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop there.\u201d Scowling, Cronus raised a hand. \u201cThere will be no removing anyone from Tartarus. It is too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected that answer. However, he persevered. \u201cPerhaps the reward is worth the danger. I would keep her locked inside my home, Majesty. I would never remove her collar\u2014\u201d well, except to whisk her to his home, for she couldn\u2019t be flashed out of Tartarus with it on, but he would recollar her the moment they reached their destination \u201c\u2014and she would be my personal slave. I would ensure her misery.\u201d His first lie of the day, but probably not his last. He only wanted to give Nike pleasure.</p><p>Had he forgiven her for what she\u2019d done to him? He wasn\u2019t sure. All he knew was that he no longer wanted to kill her when he thought about it. He would tire of her eventually, and he looked forward to the day. Until then, this was his only recourse.</p><p>The king ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cOf which her do you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNike. Greek goddess of Strength.\u201d He did not allow a single bit of affection to lace his tone.</p><p>The king\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe one who...\u201d Now those eyes dropped to Atlas\u2019s chest, where his shirt covered his tattoos.</p><p>\u201cYes. The very one.\u201d Hear my anger, only my anger. Except, what she\u2019d done no longer angered him. The marks were as much a part of him now as his were a part of her.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Cronus leaned back in the throne, the picture of contemplation. \u201cDo you not think she is being made to suffer enough inside Tartarus?\u201d</p><p>Time for his second lie. \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d In truth, as dejected as she\u2019d sounded at their last meeting, the goddess was suffering. And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do to increase her suffering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as she hates me\u2014\u201d desires me, he added inside his head, so that he wouldn\u2019t reveal the depths of irritation thoughts of her possible loathing elicited \u201c\u2014she will take particular displeasure in cleaning my home, preparing my food and warming my bed.\u201d</p><p>The king smiled up at the ghostly girl. \u201cWhat you\u2019d like to do to your Paris, eh, my Sienna? Make him your slave.\u201d</p><p>Her expression never changed. She offered no response, either.</p><p>Paris who? Atlas wondered, and then shrugged. He didn\u2019t care. Nike was his only concern at the moment.</p><p>\u201cMy king?\u201d Atlas prompted. \u201cI lack only your permission to begin Nike\u2019s torment. My determination is unparalleled.\u201d</p><p>Cronus faced him once again, his smile falling away. A minute passed in silence, then another. Then the king sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my answer has to be no. While I like the thought of Nike\u2019s anguish intensified at your hands, I\u2019m unwilling to risk the removal of her collar, even for the few seconds required to flash her. She is Strength, and were she to somehow escape you and free her brethren, another heavenly war would erupt. I cannot afford to have my attention divided now. Well, not any more than it already is. I find I spend most of my time observing the Lords of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>The Lords of the Underworld? Who were they? Didn\u2019t matter, really. As he\u2019d spoken, Atlas\u2019s own sense of dejection had bloomed. He wanted to stalk up that dais, grab the king and shake him. How dare his request be denied? How dare his desires be discarded? Instead, he said, \u201cVery well, my king. I thank you for your time,\u201d and pivoted on his heel. He strode from the chamber before he did something foolish, as he had done with Nike in his office. Only, his goal would not be climaxing.</p><p>He\u2019d already decided that nothing would keep him from claiming Nike. Now he realized that not even this would do so. The king\u2019s will be damned. He would have his woman, just as he wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Nike\u2019s heart raced at the sound of that deep voice. Hesitant, she rolled over on her cot. Sure enough. Her skin tingled when her gaze found Atlas. Gorgeous as ever, he stood at the bars\u2014bars that were now open. His hand was extended, and he was waving her over. There was fury in his too-tight expression.What had she done this time?</p><p>She\u2019d tried to ignore him. She\u2019d tried to pretend that she felt nothing for him. Anything to stop the madness. But gods, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about their kiss. She couldn\u2019t stop wishing she\u2019d allowed him to take her all the way. That she\u2019d have experienced everything before being taken back to nothing.</p><p>So what if he would have tired of her afterward? So what if he would have been smug about her capitulation? So what if he found someone else and paraded her before Nike? For a few blessed hours\u2014who was she kidding?\u2014for a few blessed minutes, because it wasn\u2019t as if either one of them would last beyond that, she would have known the joy of being with him again. Of simply feeling, giving, taking, sharing...loving.</p><p>Have all the rest, common sense piped up, but deny the love.</p><p>That would be my pleasure. But I have to get him to offer me the rest first.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>What did he have planned?</p><p>Slowly she sat up. Her hair was in desperate need of a brush, and gods, the rest of her needed a shower. How long since she\u2019d had one? Prisoners were given a bowl of water each day and that was it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cDo you want to spend a few hours outside the prison or not?\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? Leave Tartarus? She was on her feet before her brain could process what she was doing. Her knees almost buckled, she\u2019d spent so much time prone, bored, but she managed to stay upright. She even reached out and twined their fingers together. The heat of his skin should not have shocked her, but it did. The calluses should not have ignited a fire in her blood, but they did.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But do not say a word when we reach the guard\u2019s station. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This could be a trick. A trick to build up her hopes only to dash them cruelly, but she didn\u2019t care. If there was a chance, slight though it was, that he would actually stay true to his word, she would do anything he asked.</p><p>Without a word, he led her from the cell and down the hall. Other prisoners spotted her and gasped. Some began to murmur amongst themselves, gossiping as they\u2019d once enjoyed doing in the heavens. Some gripped their bars and simply watched her through wistful eyes.</p><p>Erebos even shouted, \u201cHey, where are you going with her now?\u201d</p> <p>Atlas ignored him, and Nike followed suit. A sense of urgency pounded through her. If Atlas did this, took her outside, even for a few hours...Why would he do such a thing?</p><p>\u201cDid you get permission for this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not at the guard\u2019s station yet, so it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get permission.\u201d His words were curt, clearly meant to end the conversation.</p><p>As if she\u2019d ever done what was expected of her. \u201cThen why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll shut you up my favorite way.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. Did he mean he\u2019d shut her up with a kiss? Or by pushing a button on her collar and shooting painful lances through her brain? It was fifty-fifty, she thought. His proclamation had the desired results, however. She was too busy pondering his meaning to talk.</p><p>In the guard\u2019s station, two Titans were laughingly making bets about the prisoners. They looked up at Atlas and nodded politely in greeting\u2014only to freeze when they spotted her. As promised, she remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe try to escape?\u201d one demanded, obviously ready to beat her for doing so.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m taking her out for a bit,\u201d Atlas replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the other gasped out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to taunt her with what she cannot have.\u201d</p><p>The very words she\u2019d once offered Aergia, the goddess of laziness. He\u2019d remembered.</p> <p>Still the guard persisted. \u201cHas this been cleared with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge of this prison and the people inside it. Now shut up and do your job.\u201d With that, Atlas ushered her out of the building and into the daylight. No one else tried to stop him.</p><p>As the first ray hit her skin, she jerked free of his hold and stopped, simply basking in the moment. Clouds. Sun. She closed her eyes, head thrown back, arms splayed. The warmth, followed by a cooling breeze...the brightness\u2014her skin soaked them up greedily. Oh, how she\u2019d missed them. She would have loved to have seen temples and golden streets and people, as well, but she would take what she could get without complaint.</p><p>Strong arms suddenly banded around her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Atlas whispered, his nose nuzzling her ear, practically purring. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I look like.\u201d Her lashes fluttered open. Her heart was hammering against her ribs, and she couldn\u2019t have stopped herself from flattening her hands on his chest to save her life. His own heart was racing, she realized with astonishment. Was he...could he be as affected by her as she was by him? The clouds enveloped him, creating a dream haze. \u201cAnd beautiful is not a word that describes me.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted, and he gazed down at her. Tenderness softened his expression, and she thought he\u2019d never been more appealing. \u201cThen you don\u2019t see yourself as I do.\u201d</p><p>How did he see her? As much as he hated her\u2014but did he hate her still? How could he, when he\u2019d just escorted her to paradise?\u2014she would have guessed he pictured her with horns, fangs and a tail.</p><p>She cleared her throat, too afraid to ask. \u201cWhy did you do this for me?\u201d A much easier question, with an answer that probably wouldn\u2019t destroy what little was left of her feminine pride.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons,\u201d was all he said. \u201cNow, as much as I\u2019d love to stay in this exact spot with you, we only have a short amount of time. Do you want to spend it here or eating the food I\u2019ve prepared, as well as bathing? I know those are the two things I missed most during my tenure here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat...eating. Bathing.\u201d Was this really happening? Or was she merely dreaming about him again? Nothing else explained this change in him, in her situation.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cThen food and a bath you shall have. Come. Since I can\u2019t flash you outside of this realm, and there are no homes, inns or shops here, I\u2019ve set up camp a mile north, out of view of the prison.\u201d</p><p>Dreaming, surely. Perhaps a trick, as she\u2019d first supposed. But she allowed him to lead her through the clouds without protest.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>By the time they reached the camp he\u2019d set up, Atlas was hard and aching. Nike had been pressed against his side the entire mile, her female scent in his nose, her heat radiating into his body.</p><p>When she spied the tent he\u2019d erected, she gasped. Wide brown eyes flicked up to him with wonder before she raced forward, not slowing as she barreled through the front flap. He heard another gasp.Grinning, Atlas followed her inside. He liked this softer side of her. She stood in the center, twirling, clearly trying to take everything in at once. He\u2019d spread furs on the floor and had even carted a small round table here and piled it high with her favorite foods. There was a porcelain tub already filled with steaming water, rose petals floating on the surface.</p><p>Never let it be said that the Titan god of Strength did not know how to romance a woman.</p><p>Nike\u2019s hand fluttered over her heart, her gaze glued to the plate of strawberries and Feta. \u201cHow did you know I liked those?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d always been hyperaware of her every action. He\u2019d watched her from his cell while she\u2019d eaten them with her friends and he\u2019d fumed that he was not the one with her, basking in her good humor. That was not something he\u2019d admit to, however.</p><p>\u201cGood guess,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She peered down at the rug and kicked out her bare, dirty foot. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this, Atlas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he replied gruffly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enjoy it, Nike. It\u2019s all I can give you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered up, and her gaze pinned him. \u201cBut why would you want to give me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop analyzing my reasons. This isn\u2019t a ploy or a punishment, I promise you. And the food is not poisoned, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d He closed the distance between them, placed his hands on her shoulders and urged her to the table.</p><p>There, they ate in silence. The rapture on her face, rapture that increased with every bite, delighted him. The wine she savored sip by sip, moaning with every swallow.</p><p>Bringing her here was worth the risk of Cronus\u2019s wrath, he thought.</p><p>Although Cronus had merely ordered him to keep her in Tartarus. Which he had done. The clouds around the prison were part of the realm. So technically he had not broken any rules. Cronus, though, being Cronus, would not see it that way.</p><p>Still, Atlas couldn\u2019t regret it. He had never seen this joyful, eager side of the Greek goddess, and he found that he liked it just as much as he liked everything else about her. Which was way more than he should have.</p><p>When every crumb had been consumed, she turned her attention to the bath. \u201cThat\u2019s for me?\u201d Utter longing radiated from her, yet she didn\u2019t move toward it.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t leave you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip and nodded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, I can bathe with you watching or not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to fight him on that. Hell, she could have refused outright. What he did not expect was for her to push to her feet and discard her robe without hesitation. At the sight of her nakedness, he hissed in a breath. Already he\u2019d thought her exquisite...but now, now...holy gods. She was the finest creature the gods had ever produced.</p><p>Her skin, so golden and smooth, covered lean muscle and succulent curves. Her breasts were soft, perfect for his hands, and her nipples were as pretty a pink as he remembered. His mouth watered for them.</p><p>She walked to the tub and stepped inside. Her ass, her back...his name. He was on his feet before he realized what he\u2019d done. He wanted to kiss those tattoos, something she would probably fight him over. He wouldn\u2019t apologize for having given them to her, though. Hell, no. He liked them too much.</p><p>Nike pivoted slowly, and her gaze met his as she sank into the water. There was no hiding the desire he felt\u2014it consumed him, ate him up and left him as bare as she was. Her expression, however, was blank.</p><p>Slowly, she worked the bar of soap he\u2019d brought her over her entire body. She seemed completely unabashed as the suds danced over her, sliding down those magnificent breasts and hiding beneath the rose petals. She washed her hair, too, and soon the locks were dripping down her face and shoulders.</p><p>With every move she made, he inched a little closer to her. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. Finally she finished and stood. Another feast for his eyes. All those curves he craved more than anything else in the world were now wet. He wanted to lick away every drop.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked. Her voice was as devoid of emotion as her expression.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he managed to croak past the lump in his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally. A reaction. Relief and desire, such intense desire, claimed her, and she grinned a siren\u2019s smile. \u201cThen have me you shall.\u201d</p><p>They were a mimic of his earlier words, and completely unexpected. But, as he\u2019d told her earlier, there was no good reason to analyze a change of heart. Not in either of them. Not now. He had the distance between them defeated a split second later. Had his arms wrapped around her, jerking her into him, a second after that. Their lips met in a wild tangle, their tongues seeking, rolling together. On and on the kiss continued, drowning him in all that she was.</p><p>He hated to stop, even for a moment, but he had to remove his clothes. If he didn\u2019t experience skin-to-skin contact soon, he was going to ignite into flames. Panting, he tore away his shirt, his boots, then his pants.</p> <p>He pulled her back into his embrace. Finally. Blessedly. Skin to skin. Both of them groaned at the headiness. Her nipples rubbed against his chest, his tattoos, while their lower bodies thrust together. Then she was bending down, tracing those letters with her tongue\u2014and gods, he had never been happier that he had them.</p><p>After she\u2019d traced the last one, she kissed her way down his stomach. She dropped to her knees.</p><p>Was she going to...please, please, please...but she didn\u2019t like him enough to do it. Did she? \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She sucked his cock deep into her mouth.</p><p>His head fell back, and he roared. All that wet heat was ecstasy, surely the first he\u2019d ever truly known, for nothing had ever felt this damned good. Up and down she moved, allowing him to hit the back of her throat.</p> <p>\u201cGods! Don\u2019t make me come.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, pulled off and licked his sac. \u201cWhen have I ever listened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVixen.\u201d With a growl, he dropped to his knees, as well. She could taste his seed. Later. More than anything, even more of that ecstasy, he wanted inside her, and he didn\u2019t want to have to wait for it. \u201cSpread your legs for me.\u201d</p><p>The moment she obeyed, he had two fingers buried deep. More wet heat. And to his delight...\u201cYou\u2019re ready for me.\u201d Never had he been more proud that he\u2019d brought a female to this point.</p><p>She trembled, had to grip his shoulders to remain upright. \u201cI\u2019m ready for you every damn time I see you.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t like it, he could tell from her tone, but he could only bask in the admission. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p> <p>At first, she blinked, as if she couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe him. So vulnerable she appeared, so\u2014dare he wish?\u2014hopeful. Then she placed a sweet kiss on his lips and breathed him in. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I spoke true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they a-affect me.\u201d</p><p>Headier words had never been spoken. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this before I combust, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He was sweating, panting, as he settled back on his ass, reached out and cupped hers. He jerked her onto his lap, forcing her to wrap her thighs around his waist. As her hands tangled in his hair, he lifted her, placing her eager core at the tip of his erection.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked hoarsely. This was it. The moment he felt he\u2019d been waiting forever for.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p> <p>He thrust up and she pushed down, and then he was all the way in, surrounded by the very thing he had defied his king, his sovereign, to possess. It was better than he remembered, better than he could have imagined. He couldn\u2019t pause, couldn\u2019t give her time to adjust. Over and over he pushed in, pulled out, too overwhelmed by pleasure to do anything but ride out the storm. Perhaps it was the same for her. Her nails scored his back, and her moans rang in his ears.</p><p>Gods, he was close. On fire. Burning. Desperate. He reached between their bodies and pressed his thumb against his new favorite place.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d she shouted, her inner walls suddenly milking him.</p><p>She was climaxing, lost to all that he was, and the thought drove him over the last bit of the edge, as well. He jetted inside her, lost to all that she was, the most intense orgasm of his life claiming him.</p><p>Together, they fell backward, onto the softness of the fur. He kept his arms around her, unwilling to let her go. Now...always?</p><p>Yes, always, he thought, and his eyes widened. He wanted her always. Wanted more of this. Had to have more of this. When he\u2019d forgiven her completely, he didn\u2019t know. When he\u2019d softened, he didn\u2019t know, either. He only knew that she\u2019d become an important part of his life. Perhaps she always had been; he\u2019d just been too foolish to realize it.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do? They could be together each night after his shift, but they\u2019d never have privacy, and her pride would soon chafe at his amorous attentions, all while he refused to set her free. It would have been the same for him when the situation had been reversed. Besides, she was too precious to hurt in that way. But the problem was, he couldn\u2019t be without her. He\u2019d proven that already.</p><p>Damn, he thought next, suddenly sick to his stomach. Damn!</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>She loved him, Nike thought. Again. I\u2019m hopeless.</p><p>He\u2019d just...he\u2019d been so amazing. He\u2019d whisked her away, given her everything she\u2019d craved: food, water and his body. Gods, had he given her that delectable body. She\u2019d savored every moment. Savored his taste, his touch, the feel of him pounding inside her.Four days had since passed, but she craved more. Always she craved more. She\u2019d spent the time locked inside her cell, pacing, trying to think of ways for them to be together. If he still wanted her, that is. Atlas had come by at least once a day to make sure she was properly fed and that her basin of water was filled, but he\u2019d never said a word to her. Actually, they hadn\u2019t spoken since leaving the tent.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d felt too raw, too exposed. She\u2019d feared her feelings for him had been shining in her eyes, so they most assuredly would have seeped from her voice. He was everything she\u2019d ever wanted in a mate. His strength matched hers. She would never have to worry about hurting him. He was witty and charming. He was a protector, a warrior. He was deliciously vengeful, she knew firsthand.</p><p>She smiled, wishing she could reach between her shoulder blades and feel his name. She was certain the letters would be as hot as the man himself. But...</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he spoken to her?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t you speak to him?</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t known what to say. Did he still want her? Did he feel anything for her? How would she react if he didn\u2019t, which was most likely the case? Part of her wanted to take anything he would give her. The other part of her knew her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to do such a thing. But there at the end, when they\u2019d returned to Tartarus and he\u2019d closed the bars to her cell, she had thought she\u2019d glimpsed regret. Regret that he had to seal her inside. Regret that they couldn\u2019t spend more time together\u2014in bed and out.</p><p>Nike tugged at her collar and screeched. Damn this. She was the epitome of strength, yet was as helpless as a babe. How could she win a man\u2019s heart when she couldn\u2019t even win her own freedom?</p><p>Atlas heard a screech of frustration and knew immediately who had uttered it. Nike. His Nike. His beautiful Nike. He\u2019d deliberated about what to do, how they could be together, for four days. Well, the time for thinking was over, it seemed. She was close to her breaking point. She\u2019d tasted freedom; being sequestered now had to be a thousand times worse than before.</p><p>He hated that she was locked up, and he knew they could never be together while she was. He also knew they could not be together if he released her. She would most likely run, and he would most definitely be punished.</p><p>Maybe she loved him, maybe she didn\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019d stay with him. Or try to. She liked him and was attracted to him, he would go so far as to say. After everything that had transpired between them, she wouldn\u2019t have slept with him otherwise. But love? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t matter, really. He loved her. Perhaps he always had. He\u2019d never felt so strongly about a woman. He\u2019d never wanted to spend his every waking minute with someone before, had never wanted to cuddle someone into his side for every sleeping minute. He\u2019d never wanted to eat every meal together. To talk and laugh about their days. To spar, verbally and physically. But he did with her.</p><p>And since they couldn\u2019t be together, no matter what way things panned out, there was only one thing to do.</p><p>He pounded up the stairs and to her cell. She was banging a fist into the wall, plumes of dust forming around her. The sight of her nearly undid him. He wanted to kiss her, put his fingers all over her, sink inside her. Harden your heart. Do what is needed. His hand was shaking as he lifted the sensor.</p><p>She heard the slid of the bars and turned. A gasp parted her beautiful lips. Without a word, he held out his palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as she accepted.</p><p>Still silent, he pulled her along the same path he had just taken. The same path they\u2019d taken those four days ago. No one tried to stop him this time. In fact, as he passed the guard\u2019s station, the two gods on duty rolled their eyes.</p><p>Outside, with the clouds all around him, he whirled on Nike. He still wanted to kiss her, but knew that if he did so, he would not be able to let her go. And he had to let her go.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d she said with a seductive grin. She tried to wrap her arms around his neck. \u201cAnother outing? I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and placed his fingers on the designated indentions in the collar. Cool metal met his touch. Then he leaned down and fit his lips over the center.</p><p>Her grin fell away. A tremor moved through her. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d He drew in a deep breath, held it...held it...and then slowly released it. As that breath slithered through the inside of the collar, the metal loosened...finally splitting down the center and tumbling to the ground.</p><p>Eyes wide, she reached up, felt her bare neck. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. They were the same words she\u2019d spoken before. He hadn\u2019t had an answer then. He did now. He loved her, but he could never tell her that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cFlash somewhere. Maybe earth. And whatever you do, stay hidden. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlas...no.\u201d She shook her head violently, even fisted his shirt. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. When they discover I\u2019m gone for good, and they will, you\u2019ll be charged with a crime. You\u2019ll be locked away, placed with the Greeks who hate you. Or, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll be killed.\u201d</p><p>She felt, he realized, both amazed and saddened. She cared for him, which meant she would suffer without him. If anything, that only increased his determination to save her. She did not deserve a life behind bars.</p> <p>He forced his expression to harden. Forced himself to jerk away from her. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to look at you anymore. I\u2019ve had you, and now I\u2019m bored with you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms dropped to her sides as if weighed down by rocks, but she quickly pulled them around her middle. \u201cThen keep me locked up and stay away from me. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Still willing to give up her freedom to be near him? Damn her. He fell a little more in love with her. \u201cGo! I can\u2019t stand the sight of you anymore. Don\u2019t you get it? You make me sick, Nike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. Real godsdamned tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You can\u2019t mean that.\u201d The last was whispered brokenly.</p><p>His heart constricted painfully. Do it. Finish it. \u201cI\u2019d rather be killed or locked away than look at you another moment. Because every time I look at you, I\u2019m reminded of what we did and I\u2014I want to vomit. I was using you, wanting to punish you, but I took things too far. Even for me.\u201d Hating himself, he turned away from her. \u201cSo do us both a favor and go.\u201d</p> <p>For a long while, she didn\u2019t speak. He knew she didn\u2019t flash away, either, for he heard no rustle of clothing. But then, he did hear a whimper. A sob. More of those tears must be falling.</p><p>Gods, he couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t send her away like this. He spun, meaning to grab on to her and tell her the truth, to force her to listen. To make her leave another way. But she was gone before their eyes could meet and his hands encountered only air.</p><p>\u201cYou insolent fool!\u201d</p><p>Atlas peered up at the fuming Cronus. Not like he could do anything else. His wrists were chained to poles, forcing him to remain on his knees. The very collar he\u2019d removed from Nike was now wrapped around his own neck.</p><p>He\u2019d known this would happen, but he hadn\u2019t cared. He still didn\u2019t. Nike was free, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say for yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Greek can raise an army. That army can attack us. Ruin us. I told you that, and still you defied me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNike won\u2019t do that,\u201d he said confidently. He trusted her to disappear. Even as angry as she had to be with him, she would not endanger herself to save people she had never truly liked.</p><p>Cronus slammed his fist against the arm of his throne, ever the petulant child. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that! You aren\u2019t my All-Seeing Eye.\u201d</p><p>Atlas arched a brow, refusing to be cowed. \u201cWould you risk being imprisoned again to help your fellow Titans? I may not be able to see all the secrets of the heavens and hell, yet I know you would not.\u201d</p><p>The king had no response to that, but that didn\u2019t stop him from growling. \u201cYou disobeyed a direct order, and you will be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He offered the statement without hesitation. It was the truth. He understood that the god king had to make an example out of him. Otherwise, others would see him as weak. They would disobey him as Atlas had.</p><p>\u201cI think you actually do.\u201d Some of Cronus\u2019s fury abated. \u201cOnly this morning I saw a portrait of you. A portrait painted by my Eye. With it, she showed me exactly how to punish you.\u201d The king smiled evilly and looked to the ghostlike girl still standing at his side. \u201cYou know what to do, sweet Sienna.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna strode forward, a knife appearing in her hand. She stopped in front of Atlas and dropped to her knees, placing them eye to eye. So this was it, he thought. The end. As an immortal, he\u2019d never thought to reach this point. Still. He found he only regretted that he hadn\u2019t had more time with Nike, that he hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to apologize for his harsh words the last time they were together and that he would never have the chance to confess his love.</p><p>With absolutely no emotion on her face, the girl dug the tip of the blade into his wrist and cut out his sensor, rather than chop off his head. That\u2019s when he realized Cronus meant to lock him away rather than kill him. Good. More time to think about Nike and what could have been.</p><p>But then Sienna moved the blade to his chest and pressed, slicing. It stung, but that was not what made him struggle against her ministrations. No, it was the fact that she began carving Nike\u2019s name from his chest. He roared loud and long, fighting for all he was worth. Guards were called over and hard hands settled over him, pressing him down, holding him steady. Still he fought, but in the end, they managed to remove all four letters.</p><p>As they walked away from him, he glanced down at himself through burning, watery eyes. Blood poured down his chest and four open wounds stared up at him, the muscles torn, the skin completely gone. He might have hated that brand at one point in his life, but he\u2019d grown to love it as much as the woman who\u2019d given it to him. More than that, it had been the last remaining evidence of her presence.</p><p>His hands fisted, and his back straightened. Blood and sweat mingled, stinging further. Another roar burst from his lips, and he tossed it to the domed ceiling. He didn\u2019t stop until his throat was shredded from the strain.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d Cronus asked him.</p><p>His gaze fell to the dais, narrowing. \u201cI will destroy you for this,\u201d his vowed brokenly. \u201cOne day you will die by my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. Take him to Tartarus,\u201d the king told his guards, unconcerned. \u201cWhere he will rot for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>It took her two days, but Nike finally located Atlas\u2019s home, a sprawling estate in Olympus. The amount of wealth he\u2019d needed to acquire such a place astonished her. But then, she supposed he\u2019d considered every cent worth it. After living in a tiny cell for thousands of years, he\u2019d most likely wanted every bit of space he could get. And every amenity.</p><p>There was a swimming pool, more than thirty bedrooms, two winding, marble staircases and four fireplaces, and all the walls were comprised of solid gold. None of that interested her, however. Only his bedroom did.There, she discovered more about the man who had sent her on her way. A man who would not have risked this just to avoid her face, as he\u2019d claimed. A man who would not have risked his life for anything other than love.</p><p>He owned a huge bed and had covered it with black silk sheets. The walls were painted with murals of the sun and sky, and the furniture smelled of rich mahogany. There were multiple bookcases, each filled with leather-bound books. Beaded pillows were strategically placed along the floor. Places for him to lounge and read, she supposed.</p><p>What held her attention, however, was the portrait hanging above the hearth. A portrait of her.</p><p>He must have commissioned it after their time inside that tent, for she was reclined in a porcelain tub, bubbles sliding over her shoulder and chest, her hair soaked. She would have looked as plain and masculine as always, except he\u2019d had the artist add a sensual light to her dark eyes and a come-and-get-me curve to her lips.</p><p>Finally she knew how he saw her. As someone beautiful. Worthy.</p><p>Only a man in love would do such a thing. Only a man in love would keep such a thing in such a prominent place. Only a man in love would want to see a woman\u2019s portrait every night before he fell asleep, then wake up looking at it.</p><p>Oh, yes. He loved her.</p><p>There, outside of Tartarus, she\u2019d thought, hoped, that he did so, but she had let his words scrape against her already low self-esteem. How could so beautiful and sensual a man want her? she\u2019d wondered. But he did. He loved her. Proof: he\u2019d risked everything for her.</p><p>She could do no less for him.</p><p>Nike strode through the bedroom, knowing her lover would have a weapons case stashed somewhere\u2014and knowing exactly what to do with it.</p><p>Atlas was not given a cell of his own\u2014not at first. Still bleeding and frantic, fighting, he had been thrust into a cell with Erebos. Of course, that\u2019s who had been chosen as his cell mate, he\u2019d thought, rage filling him. A male who had once thought to claim his Nike. A male who had then stolen food from her, pushed her around and called her terrible names.</p><p>Atlas had seen it happen on numerous occasions. He hadn\u2019t done anything about it then, telling himself she deserved what she got, but he\u2019d wanted to. And there was no better time than now.</p><p>Even with his strength corralled by the collar and half his blood dried to his chest, even with his still-seeping wounds splitting open with every move he made, Atlas managed to defeat Erebos in record time. He punched, he kicked, he did not play fair, kneeing the god in the balls while he was down. In the end, a broken, bloody Erebos lay crying on the dirty floor, right alongside everyone who had tried to save him.</p><p>That\u2019s when Atlas was moved to the empty cell Nike had occupied. He stretched out on the cot, simply breathing in her lingering essence. His sweet, sweet Nike. He would have to spend eternity without her. Without even her brand. Once again, he roared.</p><p>What was she doing now? If she sought solace in the arms of another man, even in the years to come, he would tear this prison apart stone by stone and kill the bastard. As if. You sent her on her way to do just that. You want her happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the racket? Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he was hearing her voice now. Locked up two days, and he was already headed into insanity.</p><p>His bars rattled, slid open. He rolled to his side, determined to send whoever it was away. When he caught sight of his beloved Nike, he blinked. Oh, yes, he was indeed going insane. She stood before him, draped in a black leather bra top and black leather pants. Her hair was slicked back in a smooth ponytail. Blood splattered her cheeks. Never had she looked more beautiful. Her strength was there for all to see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d she said, clearly impatient. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d</p><p>Slowly he sat up. He didn\u2019t want this moment to end. Didn\u2019t want to lose sight of her. \u201cI missed you. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted an apology. I much prefer this.\u201d She grinned, practically beaming. \u201cI missed you, too, but we\u2019ll have to catch up later.\u201d Her gaze fell to his chest, and she gaped in astonishment. Then she growled. \u201cDid the god king cut my name off you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was holding a knife, he saw, and her knuckles bleached of color. \u201cI. Will. Kill. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready promised to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it together, then. After we get out of here.\u201d Her attention flicked behind her, urgent, before returning to him. \u201cCome on. We have to go before someone realizes what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me look at you. Just let me enjoy this moment. Let me apologize for what I said to you. You said you wanted an apology, yes? I didn\u2019t mean it, not a word I said that last day, but I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She closed the distance between them and slapped him. Hard. The blow knocked him back against the cot and caused stars to wink over his vision.</p><p>Once more, he blinked at her. \u201cYou hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ll do it again if you don\u2019t get your ass in gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re real.\u201d He sat up, saying the words but not truly absorbing them. This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p> <p>She dropped to her knees. \u201cAgain, yes.\u201d Just as he\u2019d once done to her, she placed her fingers over his collar and blew into the center. As the metal softened, he finally understood what his brain had been trying to tell him. Nike was here. She was really here. And she was saving his life.</p><p>With a scowl, he jumped to his feet. \u201cI told you to go to earth, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, not the reaction I expected.\u201d She stood and pressed a swift kiss to his lips. \u201cGood thing I never listen to you. Now let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve already taken out the guards below. And no, I didn\u2019t kill your friends. Just made them wish they were dead.\u201d As she spoke, she latched on to his hand and dragged him out of the cell. \u201cCronus could realize what\u2019s going down at any moment and appear, and then we\u2019ll both be in trouble. As long as we\u2019re here, we\u2019re easy pickings.\u201d</p><p>True. Nike was a fugitive now; he wanted her out of this prison, out of this realm, as soon as possible. \u201cYou risked your life to save me, you fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you risked your life to save me.\u201d</p><p>Down the stairs they pounded and, sure enough, all three of the guards were flat on their faces, motionless. \u201cBut you were free. You had what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d she threw over her shoulder.</p><p>Okay, wow. She\u2019d just admitted she wanted him more than freedom. Atlas couldn\u2019t help himself. He gave a tug, propelling her backward, into his arms. \u201cI love you,\u201d he finally proclaimed, and mashed their lips together. His tongue thrust deep, tasting, demanding.</p> <p>She only allowed the kiss for a few seconds, her hands fisting his hair and taking everything he had to give, before she pulled away, panting. \u201cI love you, too. But let\u2019s get the hell out of here. I need your pretty head connected to your body.\u201d</p><p>Once again, they surged forward. Still, he almost couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. It was too much like a dream. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the rest of eternity making up for what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think I\u2019ll like seeing you grovel. But just for the record, I love my tattoo and I know why you said those nasty things. Sure, I would have found a better way to get you to safety, but then, I\u2019m smarter than you are, so really, I can\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Gods, he loved this woman. \u201cVixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine. Always. You\u2019ll mark me again just as soon as my skin heals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready planned on it.\u201d</p><p>Good. He wouldn\u2019t feel complete until she did. \u201cSo where are we going to live?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered me to hide on earth. I thought we could do so\u2014together. Though I hate that you have to give up your amazing house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d He found he really liked the thought of her there, surrounded by his things, breathing in his essence.</p><p>\u201cI, well, I broke in.\u201d</p><p>A laugh boomed from him. There was no woman more perfect for him. He would have done the same thing. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll miss from that house is the portrait of you. But now I have the real thing.\u201d He placed a swift kiss on her lips. \u201cBack to our new living arrangements. There are other gods out there, Greeks like you, who are in hiding. Cronus has never been able to find them. That means there are places he can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find them and join them. We are Strength, after all. We can succeed where he has failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, we might even try to find the Lords of the Underworld. Cronus mentioned being distracted by them, whoever they are. If they are his enemies, they might be good friends for us to have.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI know of whom you speak. They were Zeus\u2019s immortal warriors long ago, but now they house the demons once locked inside Pandora\u2019s box. Cronus will have his hands tied for a long, long time. They would be very good friends to have.\u201d</p><p>They reached the door and burst outside, all without incident. Clouds instantly enveloped them, the sun shining brightly. Nike whirled and threw herself in his arms, placing nips and kisses all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWe did it. Now take us somewhere. Anywhere. As long as we can be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again, then did exactly as his woman had ordered. </p> </body></html>"]
