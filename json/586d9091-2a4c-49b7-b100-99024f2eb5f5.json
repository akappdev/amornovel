There was so much noise. The siren was a constant assault to her ears. The radio blatted voices\u2014the dispatcher, other drivers, hospitals.</p><p>There were no windows, and even if there had been, she couldn\u2019t have made sense of it. She didn\u2019t even try. All of her energy was focused on the pale woman strapped to the gurney, struggling to live. She squeezed Janey\u2019s hand harder, willing her to fight, to know that she wasn\u2019t alone, that there was someone here who cared, who knew the truth of what had happened. Not what it looked like, but what it was.</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I need you to let go of her hand.\u201d The EMT\u2019s voice was brisk and businesslike. Janey was just another patient to him, one more casualty of the war on drugs. Lines in, needles out, pump up the cuff, write something down. He was in constant motion, and even though Sid knew he was working to save Janey\u2019s life, that he had to maintain that one emotional step away in order to do his job, she resented his detachment.</p><p>Janey wasn\u2019t just another junkie. She was dying because someone wanted her dead, and no one cared. No one but Sid, and who was she? She\u2019d lied to the police and said she was family, but the truth was Sid didn\u2019t even know if Janey had a family. She didn\u2019t know her birthday, her favorite song, didn\u2019t know if Janey was even her real name. All Sid knew for sure was that someone had done this. Someone had stuck that needle in Janey\u2019s vein, had sent a lethal dose of pure heroin on a straight path to her heart. Someone wanted Janey out of the way, wanted her dead, and that was Sid\u2019s fault. That\u2019s what she had brought to her friend\u2019s life. Nothing but death.</p><p>\u201cYou have to let go,\u201d the EMT repeated, more strongly this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sid said, letting Janey\u2019s limp fingers fall back to the gurney, bowing forward over her knees, getting as close as she could to her friend without touching. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Janey,\u201d she whispered. She felt hot tears rolling down her cheeks and didn\u2019t try to stop them.</p><p>The EMT glanced up. \u201cIs this her first OD? Do you know what drugs she was taking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo drugs,\u201d Sid insisted.</p><p>The EMT gave her a pitying glance. \u201cLook, lady. She\u2019s OD\u2019ing on something, probably heroin, and I need to know if there\u2019s anything else in there. You\u2019re not doing her any good by pretending she\u2019s not a junkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. Someone did this.\u201d</p><p>Medical alarms blared, drowning out the wail of the siren as they pitched around another curve.</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d the EMT ordered tightly, then ripped the sheet off Janey\u2019s chest, baring her small, pale breasts, and oh, how her friend would have hated that. The smell of something burning filled Sid\u2019s nostrils as the EMT tried to jolt Janey\u2019s heart back to life, her back bowing off the gurney. The EMT swore as the monitor continued to show nothing but flat line, and then the ambulance doors banged open, and Janey was gone, whisked through the double doors, surrounded by men and women who probably saw cases like this every night. Just one more junkie overdose.</p><p>But Janey wasn\u2019t a junkie. Someone had killed her to send a message. Well, message received. But Sid wasn\u2019t backing off. She was going to find out who had done this, and she was going to make them pay.</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>Six months later</p><p>SID GAZED AROUND the crowded ballroom, fighting against the urge to pinch herself. She\u2019d done it. She was actually standing in the midst of the most powerful vampires on the North American continent while they decided who would be the next Midwestern Vampire Lord.</p><p>She\u2019d be the first to admit that she didn\u2019t know precisely what that meant, didn\u2019t know the boundaries of the territory, or what powers such a vampire possessed. But what she did know was enough. The winner of this competition\u2014and she wasn\u2019t entirely clear on what sort of competition it was either\u2014would rule Chicago. That meant he\u2019d also be the one picking up the reins of the white slavery ring the old vampire lord, Klemens, had operated out of this city for nearly twenty years before his death. And that was something Sid did know about. She\u2019d spent all the last year, and especially the six months since Janey\u2019s death, researching and writing the stories about Chicago\u2019s connection to sex trafficking.</p><p>Ostensibly, the series was for her hometown newspaper, the only piece of serious journalism in a paper that was better known for covering the high school basketball team\u2019s pancake breakfast. The town was a distant suburb of Chicago, an upscale community that did its best to resemble Mayberry in everything except its property values and fashion sense. Her stories often motivated little old ladies to stop her on the street and chastise her for reporting on the kind of ugliness they\u2019d moved to suburbia to get away from. Couldn\u2019t she find something nice to write about? But Sid didn\u2019t care about nice. She wanted to make a difference, and since her father owned the paper . . . well, she might hate the idea of riding on the coattails of her daddy\u2019s money, but if that was the only way she could get the story told, then that\u2019s what she\u2019d do.</p><p>Because Chicago wasn\u2019t simply a convenient marketplace for slaves. When it came to this particular trafficking ring, the city was the transit hub to the rest of the United States. Shut the Chicago operation down, take out the vampires operating it, and you would disrupt the entire supply chain. And that\u2019s what Sid wanted, to shut them down. She wasn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to believe that would end the problem. As long as there was a demand for sex slaves, someone would come up with the supply. But shutting down the Chicago pipeline would deal a major blow to the traffickers, and that was a good first step.</p><p>It was also a very dangerous step. The traffickers would do almost anything to stop her from exposing their disgusting, but extremely profitable, business. She\u2019d learned that the hard way, although it was Janey who\u2019d paid the price. Janey had been one of those slaves, but she\u2019d been luckier than most. When her owner had decided he had no more use for her, he\u2019d given her a hundred dollars and dropped her on a corner.</p><p>But Janey hadn\u2019t stayed on that corner. She\u2019d found a shelter and a program. She\u2019d gotten off the streets, earned her GRE, and was working as a waitress when Sid happened to stop at her diner one night. And when she found out what Sid was investigating, Janey had offered to help. Which had gotten her dead.</p> <p>The slavers hadn\u2019t dared go after Sid directly; her father had too much money, too much influence. Sid\u2019s death would have brought in the police and the press, would have triggered a real investigation. But not Janey\u2019s. Her death had gone all but unnoticed by everyone except Sid.</p><p>And while Janey\u2019s death hadn\u2019t changed Sid\u2019s mind about exposing the ugly truth, it had convinced her to try going to the cops. She\u2019d called in every favor, had thrown her family name around, but eventually even the cops had stopped taking her calls and wouldn\u2019t return her messages. They had more important crimes to solve, crimes with American victims, monied victims, high-profile victims. The women caught in the slavers\u2019 web were nameless, faceless foreigners, and by the time they arrived in the US, most were hopelessly addicted to heroin. Their story was lumped in and buried beneath the overall problem of drugs, and nobody cared about one more heroin addict or how she got that way.</p><p>What Sid needed was a blowout story, something no one could ignore, and the vampire angle was it. She was determined to do whatever it took to get close to the big honcho vampire, to get her story from the inside. Vampires needed blood, and Sid had plenty of blood. She just needed to meet the right vampire. Past experience had taught her she could draw the attention of any man she set her sights on, and a male vampire couldn\u2019t be all that different from any other male, right?</p><p>A bit of research had led her to Claudia Dresner, a sociology professor at University of Illinois who was writing a book on vampires. Dresner had tenure and so couldn\u2019t be fired for her choice of subject, but that didn\u2019t mean her colleagues respected her work. Sid had provided a sympathetic and interested ear for the professor and in the process gleaned a wealth of information on vampires, including the existence of something called a blood house, a place where vamp groupies and wannabes went to mingle with the real thing and offer blood on the hoof, so to speak. There were several in a city the size of Chicago, but Professor Dresner had taken her to the one closest to the center of power, a club where she\u2019d insisted Sid could meet the kind of vampire who could take her to the top. Dresner had only gone with her that first time, but she\u2019d pointed out a couple of possibilities. Not the big guys themselves, but vampires who could get her access to the big guys, the vampires powerful enough to go all the way to the top.</p><p>Sid had been an excellent pupil, and her reward was the vampire standing next to her, the one who\u2019d wrangled an invite for her to this highest of vampire galas. His name was Travis, and if she\u2019d met him under any other circumstances, she\u2019d have seen nothing more than an easy-going surfer dude who had somehow been displaced to Chicago. Just over six feet, he had the sleek, muscled body of a swimmer, with the sharp edges of a tribal tattoo visible below the right sleeve of the black T-shirt he wore like a uniform. And underneath the hustler attitude, he was a surprisingly sweet guy.</p><p>\u201cExciting, huh, babe?\u201d Trav was standing too close, his body constantly brushing her ass as he fidgeted from side to side. If anyone was excited, it was Travis. He was like a little kid about to meet his superhero for the first time. Either that or a dog with a juicy piece of meat that he worried would be stolen by a much bigger dog at any moment. Unfortunately, that made Sid the meat. And she wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s dinner, not yet anyway. She\u2019d managed to avoid actually letting Travis drink from her, although she\u2019d have been willing to go that far, if necessary. And she had a feeling that the next time she met him, Trav would be asking for payment for getting her in here tonight, but for now, at least, she was off the menu. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Sid said, taking a sidling step away from Trav\u2019s nervous twitching. \u201cAny idea who\u2019s going to win this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no question. See the big guy over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a lot of big guys, Trav. Just point him out for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, great idea! These guys are pumping adrenaline like prize fighters on cocaine, but I\u2019ll just stick my finger at the baddest guy in the room for you. You can scoop up my ashes later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic. Can you at least give me a clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one standing alone over there, no drink in his hand.\u201d</p><p>Sid scanned the crowd in the direction Travis indicated and huffed an exasperated breath. For fuck\u2019s sake, most of the vampires here were standing alone. According to Travis in his less dramatic moments, tonight was about the contenders displaying their power, kind of like animals giving off aggression pheromones during the rut or something. She figured it wouldn\u2019t be long before one of these guys pulled out his dick and start spraying everything in sight. The mental image had her snickering, but her laughter died in her throat when her gaze fell on him.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Trav had been right. He was standing alone. But his aloneness was more than a physical separation, it was an invisible wall that kept anyone from getting too close, a force field of get the fuck away from me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d she whispered, afraid he could hear her somehow from across the room.</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d Travis supplied, and his voice was quiet and drenched in awe . . . and something else. Worship?</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. I mean, we\u2019re not buds or anything, but . . . he\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet him.\u201d</p><p>Travis laughed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she said, tugging on his hand. \u201cIntroduce me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIntroduce yourself, babe. Just make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Sid tightened her hold on Travis\u2019s fingers, though whether it was to keep herself from moving or to drag him along with, she couldn\u2019t have said. Either way, it didn\u2019t matter, because Trav had a mind of his own, and he was a vampire. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere he didn\u2019t want to. He shook his fingers free.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own for this one,\u201d he said, \u201cbut take a tip from someone who knows . . . be polite.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cI\u2019m always polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSid, what\u2019s your gut telling you right now? Be honest.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him in surprise. This was more serious than she\u2019d ever seen Travis, and it made her swallow the clever response on her tongue and go with the truth instead. \u201cMy gut\u2019s afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a smart gut. Talk to him if you want, but listen to your gut and watch what you say.\u201d</p> <p>Sid flattened her lips in irritation, then quickly rolled them together, not wanting to ruin her lipstick. She hated using her looks instead of her brain, but first impressions mattered, and she\u2019d use every weapon she had. She found herself considering a dash to the restroom for a quick makeup check and discarded that idea, seeing it for the act of cowardice it was. This was what she\u2019d been waiting for, what she\u2019d spent the last several months working toward, a chance to meet someone who could make a difference. And if this Aden really was going to be the next vampire lord, she couldn\u2019t afford to blow it.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and started across the room. She took a roundabout path, moving from cluster to cluster of gala goers, both human and vampire, stopping for a few minutes and pretending to join in the conversation, then moving on. And all the while she kept an eye on her target, studying him.</p><p>As she\u2019d told Trav, there were a lot of big guys in the room. And not just big, but unusually good-looking. Professor Dresner had offered the theory that what she called the vampire symbiote\u2014the thing that turned an ordinary human into a vampire\u2014worked a lot of physiological changes on its host for its own survival. The most obvious changes were the new vampire\u2019s need for blood and an aversion to sunlight. But there were additional, more subtle, changes that happened over time, things that made vampires better hunters, made them more attractive to their human prey. The professor had suggested that vamps eventually became better looking, because the longer they were a vampire, the more time the symbiote had to work on them.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t know if that was true or not, but she did know that there were a hell of a lot of gorgeous men here. Far too many for it to be random.</p><p>But even in a room filled with handsome men, Aden stood out. He was beautiful and wild, an untamed beast who\u2019d donned a tuxedo for the night. It was a thin veneer of civility, and one that barely managed to contain his savagery as he scanned the gathering with a predator\u2019s gaze, a single breath away from ripping out someone\u2019s throat.</p><p>She glanced away, then back, and caught him watching her. She shifted her gaze quickly, but not before she saw that he hadn\u2019t bothered to do the same. He stared at her unabashedly, his eyes so dark that at first she\u2019d thought they were black. But then the light caught them just right, and she realized they were the deepest dark blue, with thick, black lashes that flirted with his sharp cheekbones on every lazy blink. His wavy hair was as black as his lashes, a little too long and curling above the stiff white collar of his formal shirt. He had a sexy mouth, full and soft-looking, but saved from pure sensuality by a touch of cruelty that tilted his lips into a small smile as he eyed her approach.</p><p>Sid closed the final few steps between them and stopped, shocked, now that she was closer to him, at how big he really was. Not just tall, though he was well over six feet, but with broad shoulders and a deep chest that hinted at plenty of muscle mass underneath the designer tux.</p><p>She drew a breath and plunged ahead. \u201cLord Aden,\u201d she greeted him, going with a friendly but respectful approach.</p><p>He raised a single eyebrow in response. She waited for him to do more, to say something, anything. To ask how she knew his name, if nothing else. But the eyebrow was the only reaction she got.</p><p>Sid gave a careless shrug. \u201cI do my homework like any other reporter,\u201d she said, pretending he\u2019d actually asked the question. \u201cI asked my sources which vampire was the most likely to win this . . . whatever you call it,\u201d she said, gesturing at the gathering of vampires. \u201cAnd your name was the only one that came up.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her a moment longer before his gaze dropped in a typical male response and did a quick toe to chest scan, starting with her Louboutin peep-toe pumps\u2014far too cold for a Chicago winter\u2014raking up silk-clad legs, taking in her short, form-fitting silk sheath, with its bare shoulders and arms, and ending with a sneering glance at the mandarin neckline, which was so high that it nearly met her chin.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Ms. Reid?\u201d he asked, his voice a deep growl of sound that had her heart kicking into high gear even before she\u2019d processed what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Her eyes flashed to his face. \u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and it wasn\u2019t a happy sound. \u201cYou played Travis for three weeks to get into this party. I created him three decades before you were born. Do you really think he\u2019d bring a human around without my permission? I do my homework, too, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much is obvious. So, why are you here? Not for the party, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d he added, eyeing her unsubtle choice of neckwear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She was going to tell him she didn\u2019t play in vampire circles, that she was no one\u2019s food, but something in his eyes made her stop. She froze beneath that gaze, abruptly aware of every breath moving in and out of her lungs, of her heart pounding within her chest until she was sure he could see it thumping beneath the second skin of her tight dress. She bit her lip nervously, and Aden\u2019s hooded gaze grew heavier. God, he was beautiful. She wondered just for a moment what it would be like to bed someone like him. A powerful vampire. Sexy, savage, uncontrollable. An image flashed across her brain of a naked Aden lying beneath her, muscles flexing, strong hands locked on her hips, slamming deep between her thighs with every upward thrust as she thrashed helplessly above him.</p><p>And she realized her body was already responding to the vision. Heat was pooling between her thighs, right where she\u2019d imagined him pounding into her, and she was afraid to look down for fear she\u2019d find her nipples visibly swollen and demanding attention.</p><p>She shot a nervous glance at Aden and saw one corner of his sensuous mouth curve slowly upward, as if he knew what she was thinking, knew what her body was feeling. She pushed such thoughts forcibly out of her head. She had no intention of falling under any vampire\u2019s spell, much less one as dangerous as Aden.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d he prodded her smugly.</p><p>Sid wished viciously for a nice sharp stake.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the next vampire lord,\u201d she said intentionally, \u201cthen I\u2019d like to meet with you. There are things going on in this city, crimes against humanity that you may not be aware of.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not the place, Lord Aden. But know this: they enslaved and killed a friend of mine, and I intend to expose every\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze hardened, every bit of seduction vanishing in an instant. \u201cYou will come to my office tomorrow night.\u201d He reached into an inner pocket and produced a thick white business card, flipping it through his fingers as he held it out to her.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t take well to orders, especially not from rude, but sexy, vampires. Her gut reaction was to tell him to shove it, but that would have been stupid. And stupidity was not one of her many faults. This was what she\u2019d wanted\u2014a private meeting with the next Midwestern Vampire Lord\u2014and he was offering it to her. Okay, so he\u2019d pretty much ordered her to show up, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue semantics when the inside track she needed was being offered up on a platter. Or, in this case, a business card. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took the card. It held an address and phone number, nothing else.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no name on this. How do I know whose office it is?\u201d</p><p>He gave her the raised eyebrow again. \u201cBecause I just handed you the card,\u201d he said slowly, as if speaking to a nitwit. \u201cBe there two hours after sunset tomorrow evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t know when sunset is?\u201d she asked, just to be obnoxious. She knew exactly when sunset was. She\u2019d been checking it daily for the last several months, ever since she\u2019d decided to try and get inside vampire society.</p><p>\u201cThen check your father\u2019s newspaper,\u201d he said impatiently, proving that he knew far more about her than she did about him.</p><p>She was trying to think of an appropriate comeback when he abruptly shifted his gaze over her head and gave someone a curt nod. Sid spun, but whoever he\u2019d been signaling was too far away for her to identify. She started to turn back and nearly crashed into Aden. He reached out to steady her, curving the fingers of one big hand over her hip.</p><p>Taking advantage, he leaned in and put his lips right next to her ear. \u201cDo wear something more suitable tomorrow night, Ms. Reid. I\u2019m rather fond of redheads.\u201d</p><p>Sid gasped at his temerity, but he was already gone, walking easily through the crowded room, a path clearing before him like magic. She watched him go, his height and size making him easy to follow until he joined a small group of men and women who stood apart from the rest. She stared until Travis sidled up next to her once again.</p> <p>\u201cWas I right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cRight about what?\u201d she asked absently.</p><p>\u201cAbout Aden. He\u2019s going to be the one, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him she had no idea, no basis to judge something like that. But then she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cBut I think you might be right.\u201d</p><p>Travis grinned proudly. \u201cYou see those guys over there?\u201d he asked, nodding toward the small group which now included Aden. \u201cThe one in the back, looks like a rich Wall Street exec? That\u2019s Raphael, probably the most powerful vampire on the planet. The two closest to him are Lucas and Duncan, but all of them up there are vampire lords, Sidonie. The real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the women?\u201d she asked, noting in particular the tall, black-haired one who looked like a model in a long-sleeved Stella McCartney that covered everything, but still managed to look provocative as hell. She was greeting Aden with a big smile, and Sid experienced an unwelcome jolt of pure envy. She scowled at her own reaction. What did she care if Aden hustled some other woman? Hadn\u2019t she just persuaded herself that she wasn\u2019t interested in him or any other vampire?</p> <p>\u201cThe short and curvy dark-haired one is actually Sophia. She\u2019s Lord of the Canadian Territories and the only female on the Council. The rest of the women are human. The one talking to Aden right now is Cynthia Leighton, Raphael\u2019s mate. Don\u2019t know the others\u2019 names, but they\u2019re all mated to the lords. So don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re way off limits to Aden.\u201d</p><p>Sid shot him a surprised look. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d she said, turning back to watch as Aden spoke to the Leighton woman. \u201cThis is simply business for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh. Well, how about you and I do a little business of our own then?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over and did a double take when she saw his fangs on full display.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my thing, Trav. I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock it until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I appreciate you bringing me here and all, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said agreeably. So agreeably that she suspected he\u2019d been acting under Aden\u2019s orders all along, that he\u2019d never really expected her to put out. The thought made her frown.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame a guy for trying,\u201d Trav was saying. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to mingle now. Plenty of willing flesh here tonight. See you around, babe.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a little wave, glad he was making it easy, even as she suspected she\u2019d been manipulated. She took a final look across the ballroom, but Aden and the others were gone. She sighed and glanced down at the business card in her hand. She\u2019d have to be careful with this one. Aden wasn\u2019t Travis, and she had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t be making anything easy for her.</p><p>ADEN GAVE Raphael a respectful bow, then turned and deliberately disappeared into the crowd. There\u2019d been nothing untoward about his interaction with Raphael tonight, nothing to indicate that he or any of the lords favored Aden over the other candidates. But then, nothing was ever what it seemed with vampires, and he knew the rumor mill would already be rife with rumors about secret meetings with powerful vampire lords. He knew, because he\u2019d been the one to make sure the rumors got started. Aden had no doubt he could defeat his opponents handily on his own, but it never hurt to pad the odds in his favor by making his enemies worry about powerful friends.</p><p>He faded back into the shadows to better watch the crowd. He was aware of his effect on people, even vampires. His size and attitude were intimidating even without the aura of power that his vampire nature granted him. It was something he often used to great effect, but there were times when he needed to disappear. And his vampire nature had gifted him with that, too: the power to wrap himself in darkness and hide in the shadows.</p><p>He caught the flash of copper-colored hair and watched with hooded eyes as Sidonie Reid wove her way through the crowded room. Her dress was tighter than she was probably used to. It made her stride unconsciously seductive, emphasizing the glide of silken thighs, the sway of her hips above nicely toned legs. More than one head turned to follow her progress, vampire nostrils flaring as she passed, scenting the bouquet of her blood beneath that delicate skin. She had a striking beauty, not classic, but unique, with crystal blue eyes and a curly mass of red hair that tumbled artfully down her back. She\u2019d been raised with money and privilege, and it showed in the arrogant assumption that she was safe in this room full of predators.</p><p>The truth was that her blood would have been tasted long ago if he hadn\u2019t ordered otherwise. She was lucky that it had been Travis she\u2019d approached seeking information in that blood bar. Trav could fake stupidity with the best of them, but there was a calculating mind behind that scruffy blond exterior. As soon as Trav had discovered who she was, he\u2019d called Aden, and Sidonie Reid\u2019s fate had been set.</p><p>She made her way toward the exit, oblivious to the effect of her passage. Covetous eyes followed her, but turned away when Aden emerged from the shadows to lay claim. Sidonie had come here tonight to seduce him, thinking that would give her power. But she had a lot to learn. He smiled privately, anticipating his meeting with her the next night.</p><p>He did love redheads. Their pale skin marked so very prettily under the lash.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>ADEN STRODE swiftly through the halls of the hotel. His business tonight was finished. From here on out, the competition would be mostly guerilla-style ambush and attack, although some might go old-school and issue formal challenges. There was only one real rule, and that was no human audiences or casualties. As long as no bodies were left for the humans to find, there was little chance of accidental discovery, and in the event humans chanced upon a challenge battle, the participants were responsible for wiping the humans\u2019 memories. Anyone who failed in that responsibility would face the combined wrath of the Council, which was a far worse fate than any challenger could pose.</p><p>Aden\u2019s lieutenant, Sebastien, emerged from one of the side hallways, matching his pace as they headed for the exit. Bastien was nearly as tall as Aden and just as dark. He was a warrior in his blood and bone, a former officer in the French Foreign Legion who still wore the Legion\u2019s grenade and colors in a tattoo on his left forearm.</p><p>Aden had four vampires who called him Sire, but Bastien had been his first, turned before Aden ever left Europe. Aden\u2019s Mistress, the female who\u2019d made him Vampire, had released him from her service decades earlier, but when he\u2019d arrived in America and met Lucas, he\u2019d known that this was a master he could willingly serve. So, Aden had sworn to Lucas, and Lucas had not only permitted Bastien to remain bound to Aden, he\u2019d taken it a step further and encouraged Aden to make more children of his own. It was a gift that Aden would never forget, one that had demonstrated Lucas\u2019s confidence in Aden\u2014that he was loyal and no threat to his master. But it had also been solid proof of Lucas\u2019s belief that Aden was meant for greater things. Because in order to achieve the lofty position of vampire lord, one needed children of one\u2019s own to rely on for both loyalty and raw power. If it came down to a duel between powerful vampires, the strength of one\u2019s children could sometimes make all the difference in the world.</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d Aden asked Sebastien.</p><p>\u201cThe usual rumblings, Sire. Lots of gossip floating around about Magda and how she died, even though no one seems to have considered her a serious contender. My favorite rumor is that Lucas took her out to advance your cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if she was in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I estimate half of those spreading that particular fantasy will be gone by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. But others will suffer a more permanent departure. The weaker challengers are trying to boost their confidence by killing each other off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating. Anyone I need to worry about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at that level. One moment, Sire.\u201d Bastien strode ahead of him and pushed open the heavy door leading to the loading docks, where their limo should be waiting.</p><p>Some of the other contenders went for glitz, arriving and departing under the porte-coch\u00e8re of the hotel like some sort of rock star. Word had gotten out\u2014or more likely some fool had intentionally pushed it out\u2014that there was a big vampire gathering at the hotel, and there were actual paparazzi waiting out front. Aden shook his head. The last thing he wanted was his picture splashed across a gossip magazine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Sire,\u201d Bastien said and held the door open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden proceeded through to the loading dock without pause, welcoming the blast of cold air after the stuffy heat of the hotel corridors. The dock was empty this time of night, or rather morning. It was nearly 3:00 A.M., midday for vampires, but dead of the night for most humans. In a couple of hours the dock would be bustling, but for now it was quiet and, more importantly, private.</p><p>One of Aden\u2019s other children, Freddy, was driving the limo tonight. He\u2019d just stepped out of the vehicle and opened the rear passenger door when two SUVs came roaring around the corner.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d Bastien said, his voice urgent, but controlled as the SUVs moved to box them in.</p> <p>\u201cWe fight,\u201d Aden said calmly, already probing the arriving vampires, weighing their strength against his . . . and finding them sorely lacking. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who can hurt us.\u201d</p><p>Bastien flashed him a vicious grin, in part because he\u2019d detected the disappointment in his Sire\u2019s voice at what was bound to be an easy victory. But the other part of Bastien\u2019s grin was because he was a bloody-minded warrior who loved a good fight. Or any fight, really.</p><p>Freddy reached into the limo and tossed Bastien a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun with one hand, even as he came up shooting with the other, his MP5 spitting death and destruction before the attacking vampires had managed to do more than raise their weapons. He rolled over the hood of the limo to reach Aden\u2019s side, taking up a position in front of his Sire as he urged him into the protection of the limo\u2019s armored body.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re going with guns, my lord,\u201d Freddy called, his joyous laugh piercing the gunfire, sounding like the cackle of a madman. Aden had a moment to ponder the fact that his two closest advisors were both what would have been called berserkers in the old country, but then the guns went silent, and the SUV\u2019s door opened to reveal a familiar figure.</p><p>\u201cStig Lakanen,\u201d Aden said, identifying the most powerful of this current batch of foes, although that wasn\u2019t saying much. Stig\u2019s presence explained the choice of weapons. Most vampires avoided using guns. They were noisy and drew the attention of human authorities. Of course, Stig\u2019s presence also explained the sudden lack of gunfire. He wouldn\u2019t want to risk getting killed by a stray bullet from one of his own. He\u2019d probably hoped to catch Aden unawares by coming in guns blazing, hoped to weaken Aden by killing off his children with a surprise first strike.</p> <p>Too bad that hadn\u2019t worked out for him.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d Aden told his vampires, never taking his eyes off of Stig. \u201cDeal with these others however you please, but make it quick. I have more important things to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dual grins greeted his decision as Freddy and Bastien engaged their enemy with cheerful zeal, wading in with knives and fists, blood flying. Aden ignored their battle, confident in the abilities of his people to get the job done. He focused instead on the leader of this poorly-conceived ambush who was hiding back by one of the SUVs, looking more worried by the minute. Stig Lakanen was one of Lucas\u2019s children. His usual haunt was Minneapolis where he was a rank and file warrior at best. He had no chance in hell against Aden in a stand-up fight, and his wary stance indicated he knew it. Unfortunately, once a challenge was issued, there was no taking it back.</p><p>Aden strode over to confront the challenger, more interested in getting this done than wasting time on posturing bullshit. The two of them faced off, both seeming oblivious to the bloodshed behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Stig?\u201d Aden asked, eyeing the vampire\u2019s long, greasy hair. \u201cCouldn\u2019t even shower for the big gala?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d the blond vampire snarled. \u201cPut up or shut up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you so eager to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not my type, and I have places to be.\u201d Aden attacked without warning, using a slap of power to pin Stig to the SUV, letting a bare smile of satisfaction tilt his lips when Stig\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who put you up to this, Stiggy,\u201d he said, using a nickname the other vampire hated. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find out. Tell me who it was, and I\u2019ll make this easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aden hit him with a second punch of power, slamming it into his chest with enough force to crush his ribcage. Stig gasped as he strained to draw breath with lungs that no longer worked. Aden could feel him struggling to gather his power, to fight back.</p><p>\u201cOne more chance, Stig. Save me some time, tell me who put you up to this, and I\u2019ll make it easy.\u201d</p><p>Stig\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief, bloody with broken capillaries as he slowly suffocated. He stared at Aden, and Aden saw the first signs of pleading enter his expression. But Aden had no pity. Stig had known what the game was before he joined it. Or, he should have.</p> <p>\u201cThe name, Stig.\u201d</p><p>The other vampire\u2019s mouth opened, his lips moving as they tried to form a word. Talking was difficult with no breath to drawn upon, but his teeth finally clenched around a hiss of air that was a name. \u201cSilas.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded, unsurprised. Stig clamped his fist around Aden\u2019s cuff in a last bid for mercy, but Aden had none to give. He\u2019d promised to make it easy. He would do that much, but no more. Extending his right hand, he slammed his fist directly into Stig\u2019s chest and grasped his heart. The organ thumped once against his palm, and Aden smiled absently at the sensation before closing his fist and squeezing until muscle and blood slithered between his fingers.</p><p>Stig\u2019s final cry sang in his ears as he focused his power once more, and the heart burst into flame, becoming nothing more than ash snowing down to join the pile of clothes and dust that had been Stig Lakanen.</p><p>Aden brushed his hands together and shook his head in disgust. What a waste. Stig hadn\u2019t been the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he\u2019d been a perfectly fine warrior. Silas had wound him up and set him on Aden\u2019s trail knowing full well Stig would die. Maybe hoping to at least do some damage. But had Silas really thought Stig Lakanen could weaken Aden in any meaningful way?</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>He turned at the sound of Bastien\u2019s voice, becoming aware of the silence all around him. Lifting his gaze, he quickly located Freddy who gave him a jaunty salute despite the copious amount of blood staining his tux.</p><p>\u201cFreddy?\u201d Aden said, eyeing the blood.</p><p>\u201cMost of it belonged to your enemies, Sire. I\u2019ll be healed by the time we reach the office.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded. \u201cCall someone to get rid of these trucks,\u201d he said, indicating the attackers\u2019 two SUVs.</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d Bastien said from behind him. \u201cWe should leave now, my lord, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Aden knew what he meant. Stig had been used as Silas\u2019s sacrificial lamb, very possibly to weaken Aden in advance of a real attack which could come at any moment.</p><p>They all piled into the limousine for the short ride to the six-story building where Aden had set up his headquarters two months ago. It was an elegant structure of mixed use, with many of his fellow residents using the space for home offices. It also had excellent security, although Aden had augmented his top two floors with safety measures of his own, especially since he and his vamps spent their daylight hours in the living quarters adjacent to the offices.</p><p>Most importantly, the sixth floor penthouse couldn\u2019t be reached directly from the lobby. One took the main elevator to the fifth floor and a private elevator from there. None of Aden\u2019s offices or living quarters were on the fifth. It was occupied solely by his contingent of daylight guards, many of whom lived there.</p><p>Aden\u2019s limo was en route to his offices when the phone signaled an incoming call.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Aden answered, recognizing Lucas\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cNot much longer, my friend,\u201d Lucas said, making a veiled reference to the challenge. \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d he continued. \u201cStig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed audibly. \u201cI chose him for his skill on the battlefield, not his IQ. I wouldn\u2019t have predicted he\u2019d go for the territory, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone charged him up and sent him off to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely. He admitted as much before he died. Could have been part of the feint, I suppose, but I wouldn\u2019t credit Silas with that much influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStig was always willing to obey orders. It\u2019s part of what made him a good warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy throw in with Silas, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas was his commanding officer back in the day. Good with a blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas or Stig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, actually, but I was thinking of Stig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should have gone with his strengths then. His people came out firing MP5s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid. Oh well, onward and upward. Stay alive, my friend. The real battle is ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on it, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Aden tucked the phone back in his pocket thoughtfully. \u201cBastien, I\u2019d like confirmation of Silas\u2019s involvement in this as soon as possible. I need to know if there\u2019s another player out there. If someone has enough cunning to use Stig against both of us, I need to know who it is before we end up as dead as Stig.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cDO WEAR SOMETHING more suitable, Ms. Reid,\u201d Sidonie simpered, mocking Aden\u2019s parting words to her. She lowered her voice to better replicate the vampire\u2019s rumbling bass for the rest of it. \u201cI\u2019m rather fond of redheads.\u201d She frowned, wondering what the hell he\u2019d meant by that last remark, her suspicious nature not letting her believe he\u2019d simply been admiring her coloring.</p><p>Her frown deepened as she stared at the full-length mirror. Or not so much at the mirror, which was an antique and rather lovely, but at her own reflection which was . . . not. Her hair wasn\u2019t having a good day, flying everywhere, and she had circles under her eyes thanks to several weeks of night-owling with vampires. She wasn\u2019t exactly a morning person normally, more of a midday person, preferring to stay up late and sleep late. But there was a big difference between staying up late and staying up all damn night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that she cared about her sleep-deprived looks, or not overmuch, anyway. Her blood would taste the same whether she was tired or not. Her scowl was aimed at the scooped neckline of the sweater she\u2019d chosen for the evening. She wanted to seduce Aden, the overbearing jerk, but she didn\u2019t want to hang out an all-you-can-eat sign. Still, she\u2019d chosen the sweater with seduction in mind, and it did fit perfectly. It accented the figure she worked hard to maintain, and the burnt-gold color brought out the copper highlights in her hair. Also, being cashmere, it wouldn\u2019t shed all over her black wool slacks. It was just that neckline.</p><p>Her phone rang, and she spun away from the mirror, grabbing it and checking caller ID, frowning when it wasn\u2019t the call she was waiting for. She answered anyway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Will,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Sid. Let\u2019s do dinner tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in town?\u201d she asked, ignoring the obvious that, of course, he\u2019d be in town, or why else would he be asking her to dinner?</p><p>\u201cDriving up in the morning, staying until Saturday,\u201d Will said cheerfully. He didn\u2019t even call her on the stupid question, but then he wouldn\u2019t. William W. Englehart was a genuinely nice guy. The guy her parents assumed would be her husband someday. Once upon a time, Sid had thought so, too. He was handsome and charming and had outstanding career prospects. He was a considerate lover and an excellent dinner companion. All the checkmarks were in the right column on the perfect boyfriend list.</p><p>There was only one thing missing. Passion. Sid didn\u2019t love him. At least, not that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about dinner,\u201d she told him now. \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot of work at night. How about lunch on Wednesday instead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill doing the big story?\u201d From someone else, the question might have sounded mocking, but not from Will.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m making progress, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. It\u2019s a date. Lunch Wednesday, and maybe I\u2019ll talk you into dinner later.\u201d</p><p>That was the other thing about Will. He didn\u2019t love her that way either, but he was more than willing to marry her, because he agreed with their parents. They would be an excellent match, and he bought into the whole dynastic marriage idea. In her more depressing moments, she sometimes envisioned their future together, with each of them discreetly finding the passion they desired outside their marriage, and neither one caring as long as the only children\u2014and, of course, there would be children\u2014were unquestionably from the marital bed.</p><p>Sid sighed. \u201cCall me Wednesday morning. We\u2019ll set a place and time,\u201d she told him. Her phone beeped an incoming call. She checked the ID. At last, she thought to herself, and tried to keep the relief out of her voice when she told Will, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get that. I\u2019ll see you then, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRighto. See you then.\u201d</p> <p>Righto. That was Will in a nutshell.</p><p>Shoving aside all thoughts of Will and their parents\u2019 plans for a wedding, she clicked over to Professor Dresner\u2019s incoming call. She\u2019d phoned the professor hours ago, hoping to get tips on how best to go about getting what she wanted from Aden tonight. She\u2019d all but given up on getting a call back in time for her meeting with the big vampire.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Dresner,\u201d she answered the phone. \u201cThanks for calling back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sidonie. I was at a wedding. They actually made an announcement before the ceremony, asking everyone to turn off their phones. Just like they do in the movies, although the wedding was far less entertaining, unfortunately. But what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Aden last night,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those you told me about, right? The ones you think are most likely to win the entire challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAden, yes. He\u2019s one of half a dozen, but certainly in the running. So you met him?\u201d</p><p>Sid nodded in her excitement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to do much more than exchange numbers, but he\u2019s invited me to meet him at his office tonight. And that\u2019s why I called you. I need to know the best approach. Do I seduce him? Or go for a business approach? And what about clothes? I\u2019m afraid if I show too much skin, he won\u2019t take me seriously. But if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSid, Sid,\u201d Dresner said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve overthinking this. First, I need to know how serious you are. How far are you willing to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what it takes,\u201d Sid said determinedly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. You need to go all in and dress for seduction. You have to understand that the only thing most vampires want or need from humans is blood. And that\u2019s doubly true for the really powerful ones, many of whom are so distanced from their human roots that they barely see us as sentient anymore.\u201d</p><p>Sid groaned.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you about what might be necessary when you first set out on this path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sid sighed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll do what it takes. I might hate it, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. I\u2019m sorry, Sid, but if there\u2019s nothing else, my feet are killing me, and there\u2019s a hot bath calling my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. Thank you so much for calling back and for the advice. I really do appreciate your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. This is one of the more interesting things I\u2019ve done lately. Academics isn\u2019t all excitement and adventure, you know.\u201d</p><p>Sid laughed dutifully, though she had no idea what the woman meant by that. Was she suggesting that academics sometimes was exciting? That didn\u2019t seem likely, especially in sociology, but it took all kinds, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sid said, avoiding the whole excitement issue. \u201cEnjoy your bath, and I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the phone onto the bed, then turned to face the reality staring back at her from the mirror. Was her outfit sexy enough? Damn. She stepped out of her heels and unzipped the wool slacks, then stomped over to her closet, thinking all the while that she must be certifiable. It was fucking freezing outside, and here she was trading in her tights and wool slacks for silk stockings and a skirt.</p><p>She cursed as she smoothed the tight skirt over her hips, wishing her target could have been anyone but a vampire. She had to admit that the skirt looked better, though. And, in any other context, the sweater would have been considered modest. There was no cleavage. It was only her neck that was on full display. But then she was seducing a vampire, and if she wanted Aden\u2019s cooperation, she was going to have to play his game. Hadn\u2019t she just told Dresner that she\u2019d do whatever it took to get revenge for Janey\u2019s death? Well, whatever it took had just become the necessity of flashing some skin.</p><p>And if it also meant letting Aden take a bite, as it almost certainly would?</p><p>She ignored the thrill of excitement that thought generated, telling herself that her nipples were peaking because there was a cold draft in the room. This was Chicago, after all, and the wind was a nearly constant buffeting against the windows.</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s it,\u201d she told her reflection. \u201cBuck up, Sid.\u201d</p><p>But she still felt better once she\u2019d pulled on her long, wool coat along with a warm scarf. Maybe it would be cold in Aden\u2019s office. Maybe she\u2019d have an excuse to keep the scarf on.</p><p>\u201cSIDONIE REID IS here, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Aden swung the chair around from his contemplation of the Chicago skyline and met Bastien\u2019s amused expression.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a scarf,\u201d Bastien explained.</p><p>\u201cShow her in,\u201d Aden said. \u201cAnd, Bastien,\u201d he added before his lieutenant could open the door. \u201cTurn up the heat.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cRight away, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Aden leaned back, not bothering to get up when Sidonie marched into his office. And that\u2019s what she did. She marched, determination furrowing her brow and tightening her full lips into a pinched pout. Did she realize that her resolve to resist his seduction only made her that much more irresistible? That her very defiance was a blatant challenge to his dominance as an apex predator? He smirked privately, thinking of the many ways he could deal with her deliberate provocation, and he would deal with it. But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t play with her first.</p><p>\u201cMs. Reid,\u201d he said lazily, \u201cyou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, and he wondered if she\u2019d expected him to pounce on her the minute she walked through the door.</p><p>\u201cIt . . . I couldn\u2019t get a taxi, and it was too cold to walk. I had to wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called. I would have sent my car.\u201d</p><p>Her pouty lips opened in a silent oh before she visibly gathered her wits and came closer to his desk. She surprised him by unwinding her scarf and shouldering out of her winter coat. So he surprised her in turn, using his vampire speed to get behind her and play the gentleman by helping her with the coat, then tossing it over the couch against the far wall.</p><p>She gasped in startlement, giving him a surprised look over her shoulder. A look that quickly reverted to irritation when she saw Aden\u2019s satisfied smile. But his smile only grew broader when he saw the elegant line of pale skin bared by the swooping neckline of her sweater.</p><p>Well played, Ms. Reid, he thought to himself. Well played, indeed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely sweater,\u201d he commented, enjoying the flush of color the compliment brought to her cheeks. With skin like that, she\u2019d be hard-pressed to conceal her emotions. Not that he needed visible proof of such things. Her fluttering pulse and pounding heart, her delightful scent, told him much more than her blush. But he appreciated the beauty of it all the same.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, showing the first sign of real nerves since she\u2019d walked into the room. She eyed the chairs in front of his desk, but clearly didn\u2019t know if she should simply sit down or ask if he minded first.</p><p>Not wanting the desk between them, Aden walked over and gestured at the flat expanse of window where the Chicago skyline was now decorated by a few fitful flakes of snow being tossed wildly in the ever-present wind. \u201cDo you live in Chicago, Ms. Reid?\u201d He knew she was staying here, but didn\u2019t know if she considered this home, and he wanted to hear what she\u2019d say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall me Sidonie,\u201d she responded politely, coming to stand next to him by the window. \u201cMy family home is in the distant suburbs. So distant, it barely qualifies as such, but I\u2019ve been living in the city for nearly a year while I research my latest story. But you probably know all of that.\u201d</p><p>Aden dipped his head in acknowledgment. \u201cTrue, but you\u2019re a reporter, so you understand the polite fiction of pretending you haven\u2019t already investigated someone you\u2019re meeting for the first time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over and gave him a half smile. The first real smile he\u2019d gotten from her. \u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know far more about me than I do about you. You\u2019re a difficult man to vet, Lord Aden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a lord yet, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He turned and gave her a patient look. \u201cI did mention that Travis belonged to me? I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019s explained the process to you. Because I told him to.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes widened. \u201cYou knew all along who I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis suspected something was up. You\u2019re not exactly the blood groupie type, and he\u2019s far smarter than he sometimes chooses to seem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy let him invite me to the big shindig then?\u201d</p><p>Aden shrugged. \u201cYou were very determined, and I was curious. What is it you really want, Sidonie?\u201d He reached out to trace one finger along the delicate curve of her collarbone, leaning close enough to draw in the sweet bouquet of her blood. She shivered, and he scented her fear. She was excited, too, by him, or maybe simply by the thought of having a vampire drink from her. But there was fear there. And that was far more arousing to him than any sexual curiosity.</p><p>Still, it wouldn\u2019t do to play into her desires. This wasn\u2019t a blood bar, and he wasn\u2019t some lust-driven idiot on a blood-drunk.</p><p>He skimmed his finger sideways, as if he was about to tug her sweater down and bare her shoulder, but then lifted his hand and stepped deliberately away from her. She sucked in a breath, her face registering obvious dismay at his abrupt departure.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why you\u2019re here,\u201d he said absently, crossing over to sit behind his desk. He brushed idly at his pant leg and gave her an inquisitive look.</p><p>She was still over by the windows, her heart fluttering, her breathing rapid, as she stared at him. A spark of something lit her eyes suddenly\u2014embarrassment maybe, or even anger that he\u2019d left her standing there while he sat.</p> <p>She blinked several times, then pressed a hand to her throat and said, \u201cI think\u2014\u201d She coughed drily, and he gestured at the wet bar at the other end of the room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bottled water in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disbelieving look. A polite man would have gotten the water for her, would have ushered her to a chair as if she wasn\u2019t fully capable of planting herself there. But then, he was neither polite nor a man. Besides, he didn\u2019t trust himself not to taste her... and more... if he touched her again, so it was best that he keep his distance. He had other things on his mind tonight. Tomorrow was another matter entirely, however.</p><p>He watched her walk over to the bar, hips swaying in her tight skirt. She bent over to the small refrigerator, displaying a nicely heart-shaped ass. Oh, yeah. As Travis would have said, he was definitely going to tap that before this was all over.</p><p>She turned, bottle in hand, and he let her catch him watching. Her heart sped up again, and he smiled lazily, which only made her heart act up even more. A blush pinked her cheeks, and he pictured the same rush of blood coloring the imprint of his hand while she was bent over his desk, begging him prettily for release.</p><p>\u201cLord Aden,\u201d she chastised breathlessly, as if she knew what he was thinking. She took a sip of water, then pressed the cold bottle to her overheated face.</p><p>He gave her a smug look and gestured at the two chairs in front of his desk. \u201cHave a seat, Sidonie. You seem overcome.\u201d</p><p>Her soft lips tightened in irritation, but only briefly. Whatever it was she wanted from him, it was important to her. Important enough that she\u2019d sought him out, enough that she was willing to put up with his toying with her. And yet she hadn\u2019t told Travis anything at all, clearly not willing to give up her purpose until she had the right audience. Interesting.</p> <p>She sat down, crossing her long legs with a slide of silk stockings. Aden gave her a blatant once-over, starting with her legs, traveling to her chest, and finally to her very annoyed expression.</p><p>\u201cWe have business in common,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>\u201cAnd what business would that be?\u201d he asked, letting his doubt, and his amusement, show.</p><p>\u201cThe late, and unlamented, Klemens was a drug dealer, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was the least\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s phone rang, interrupting the woman\u2019s discourse on Klemens\u2019s many dissolute ways. He was both relieved and disappointed at the same time. Relieved because he really wasn\u2019t up to a lecture on the evils of drugs in modern culture, and disappointed, because he\u2019d expected better of Sidonie Reid. She\u2019d gone to all this trouble only to tell him what he already knew? That Klemens had derived the bulk of his income from various illegal activities, including drugs? How very ordinary.</p><p>He picked up the phone. \u201cBastien, what is it?\u201d he asked, hoping it was something worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found Silas, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the others. We\u2019re leaving immediately.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected disappointment, but Sidonie\u2019s look was more one of disbelief than anything else. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDuty calls,\u201d he said abruptly, not feeling any particular need to explain himself. \u201cI\u2019ll have my car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll get a cab. Is it the challenge?\u201d</p><p>Aden was already halfway to the door, but her question made him stop and stare at her. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuriosity,\u201d she admitted, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather unique process, one we know little about. And it\u2019s not exactly front page news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Aden said flatly. \u201cAnd we intend to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve no interest in writing an article on the inner workings of vampire politics. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Klemens\u2019s dirty business got a friend of mine killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance? Klemens is dead already. There\u2019s not much else you can do to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the others aren\u2019t, the ones who worked for him. I want to see them destroyed, too. Them and their whole network.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded, only half-listening. His thoughts were already on the fight ahead. Silas was very possibly the strongest opponent he had in this challenge, and Aden couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted. \u201cBe here tomorrow night,\u201d he told her, not because he cared about her personal war on drugs, but because he wanted her. And he always got what he wanted. \u201cSame time,\u201d he added, not bothering to ask if the date and time were convenient for her.</p><p>He started to turn away, but then looked back and skimmed his gaze over the bare skin of her neck, the snug sweater and form-fitting skirt, the spike heels. And he bared his teeth in what some might call a smile. \u201cI do like the sweater,\u201d he said, then strode out of the office without another word.</p><p>\u201cTHE MOST ARROGANT, high-handed, rude man I have ever\u2014\u201d Sid paused in her muttered imprecations against Aden long enough to flash a reassuring smile at the building\u2019s doorman and ask him politely to call her a cab. She\u2019d been surprised initially that Aden\u2019s office was in Chicago\u2019s Loop District. It was an older building, although completely renovated, and the neighborhood was very expensive for a supposedly temporary office, especially when that office took up two entire floors. Not that she\u2019d seen much of the fifth floor. It seemed to be little more than a transfer point for the private elevator.</p><p>She gave the doorman another smile and a generous tip, then climbed into the back seat of the cab and immediately pulled out her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d Professor Dresner answered, her voice laced with surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to hear from you tonight. Did Aden cancel your appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you could call what we had a meeting, but a very unsatisfactory one. I\u2019ve never dealt with such an arrogant\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dresner interrupted her with a laugh. \u201cOh, my dear. They\u2019re all like that, the more powerful the vampire, the more arrogant he\u2019ll be. And, yes, they can seem rude, though I\u2019m not sure they see it that way. I think they simply have no time for the slow thought processes of a lesser species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesser . . . you mean us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans, yes. You must have gathered by now that they don\u2019t consider themselves human anymore, but rather something superior, more evolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet they need us lesser types to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we need cows and chickens, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Sid scowled. She hadn\u2019t thought of it exactly that way and didn\u2019t particularly care to. \u201cIt would serve him right if I wrote an article on him instead of Klemens and his criminal network.\u201d</p><p>Dresner\u2019s response was instant and surprisingly prim. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I already got that lecture from Aden. No writing stories about secret vampire stuff, or at least not the challenge, which is the only thing I know about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dresner said, still sounding a bit stiff, but clearly trying not to. \u201cI would imagine he wouldn\u2019t like that. Vampires are very secretive about their society. It\u2019s why I was so surprised you managed to get an invitation to their challenge gala. Although, as I said before, there are always a certain number of attractive humans invited to these things for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there were a lot of those reasons going on in the corners by the time I left the party last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dresner\u2019s mood swung to a delighted laugh so quickly, it made Sid\u2019s head spin. \u201cI can imagine,\u201d she giggled, sounding far more girlish that she ever should.</p><p>That was one thing Sid found rather uncomfortable about the good professor. She didn\u2019t only study vampires, she seemed enamored of them. And though Dresner had never said as much, Sid was convinced that her vampire expert had \u201cdonated\u201d blood on more than one occasion.</p><p>Sid winced as the professor\u2019s giggle finally trailed off. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnyway, as I was saying, I\u2019d barely begun to tell Aden what I was there for, when he got a phone call from someone named Bastien. I think that must be his assistant, the guy who met me at the elevator.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis lieutenant, you mean, and he\u2019s far more important than you might think. His full name is Sebastien Dufort. His friends call him Bastien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLieutenant, gotcha. I don\u2019t know what he said, but Aden told him they were leaving immediately, then hustled me out of there.\u201d</p><p>Professor Dresner made a noise that sounded suspiciously like disappointment. Had she been hoping for tales of Sid\u2019s adventures in vampire debauchery? But when the professor spoke, it was to ask something else entirely. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say where he was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sid responded drily. \u201cHe barely said good-bye. But I overheard one of the guys on the phone on my way out. Maybe Bastien, I don\u2019t know, but he was saying something about Silas. Whatever that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a what, a who,\u201d Dresner said absently. There was a pause during which Sid could hear her shuffling something on the other end, then she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, I\u2019ve just received a message, and I have to respond to this. Different time zone, you understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, of course. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. By the way, Aden asked me to come back tomorrow night\u2014ordered me actually, but\u2014shall I call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do. I hate to rush, but I really must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk\u2014\u201d But she was already gone. Sid frowned at the phone, then shrugged philosophically. Dresner was an odd duck, but a useful one. Sid tucked her cell phone away and wondered who Silas was to Aden that he went rushing off so suddenly. And the more she thought about it, she also wondered why Dresner\u2019s entire demeanor had changed when Sid mentioned the name Silas. The prof knew a lot more about local vampires than she\u2019d been willing to tell, almost as if she worried that Sid would scoop her big story. In fact, the only way Sid had gotten her to tell as much as she did was by promising a quid pro quo. Sid would tell her everything that happened, everything she discovered, once she managed to meet the right vampire, and in exchange Dresner would tell her how to make that meeting possible.</p><p>Sid pondered the possibilities. Maybe Dresner knew where this Silas was. Maybe Silas was another challenger, and Dresner was rushing off to be there for the big showdown between the two powerful vampires.</p><p>For all of a minute, Sid considered calling Dresner back and asking to go along. But a minute was all it was. The prof might delight in the vampires\u2019 brutal natures, but Sid was more cautious. The little she\u2019d learned about vamps told her a challenge at this level would be bloody. And Sid was more concerned about making sure that none of the blood flowing tonight was hers, than she was interested in watching a big, bloody vampire showdown.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>ADEN TRANSFERRED from the private to the main elevator along with his vampires. These four were his own, his children. Once he became a vampire lord, they would form the core of his command structure. He trusted them with his life and quite literally held their lives in his hands. He also loved them in a way it was difficult to admit, even to himself. He had sworn off caring about anyone so long ago that he\u2019d have thought he\u2019d forgotten what it felt like. The most shocking thing to him, when he\u2019d created Sebastien more than a hundred years ago, was the powerful bond he\u2019d felt toward the new vampire. Even then, he\u2019d assumed it was only because Bastien was his first. But with every new child he brought into the world of Vampire, the bonds became tighter to all of them.</p><p>That reality had nearly dissuaded him from becoming a vampire lord, the idea of all those vampires, hundreds, maybe thousands, looking to him for their very lives. So many hearts beating in cadence with his own, so many ties binding him ever more tightly.</p><p>But it was in his nature to seek power. Whatever it was that had made him Vampire had gifted him with the power of a vampire lord, and he could no more resist the lure of that power than he could his thirst for blood. And tonight, he would take one more step toward that goal.</p><p>Silas was a child of Klemens\u2019s, one of the dead lord\u2019s favorites by all accounts. Many of Klemens\u2019s surviving vampires\u2014ignoring the fact that they only continued to live because Lucas had offered them protection after their Sire\u2019s demise\u2014now looked to Silas as their next lord. It made Aden\u2019s challenge even greater, and it meant he\u2019d have to kill many more than just Silas before his rule was secure.</p><p>But Aden had never shied from death. Some people deserved to die. And others, like Silas, chose their own path, placing themselves in death\u2019s way. Or Aden\u2019s, which was usually the same thing.</p><p>\u201cBastien, do we have confirmation on Silas\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. Our source called a second time to confirm that Silas is at the West Loop blood house.\u201d</p><p>Aden frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a public club, isn\u2019t it? How many humans are we going to have to deal with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe club has a private room, my lord,\u201d Travis supplied. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll find Silas and whatever humans have been chosen for the night. Shouldn\u2019t be more than a few once we get past the main room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the layout of the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. There\u2019s a rough sketch on your phone.\u201d</p><p>Aden pulled out his cell phone and checked the diagram. The club was in a former warehouse, and the layout was straightforward.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we go in the front and directly to the back room. Silas might have a watcher, but that won\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like we can conceal our entry, anyway. Once in, it\u2019s take no prisoners. It\u2019s safe to assume Silas will have more fighters than the five of us, but power and skill count for more than numbers. We show no mercy, gentlemen. None of Silas\u2019s people are to leave that room alive. I\u2019ll handle Silas myself.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of murmured assents met his orders, and then the elevator hit the ground floor, and they flowed through the lobby and out onto the Chicago street. It was a cold night, and the few pedestrians who happened to be passing by shrank back as the five determined males pushed through the glass doors and into the long SUV waiting at the curb.</p><p>Aden took note of every single person in his vicinity, categorizing and dismissing them as he went. He\u2019d been born a slave, but the warrior blood of his Scottish ancestors flowed in his veins. Those genetic gifts had been honed to perfection on behalf of his vampire Mistress, until he had become a superb fighter and a brilliant strategist, the most lethal weapon in her arsenal. And now those skills, that lethality, were about to make him the next vampire lord in North America.</p><p>The drive to the West Loop and the renovated warehouse was short. Klemens had established the warehouse as a blood house long before his death at Lucas\u2019s hands. Aden had to admire the strength and discipline it must be taking for Lucas to maintain control not only of his own territory, but all of Klemens\u2019s former territory as well. Especially when at least some of those vampires didn\u2019t welcome him as their new lord. Fortunately, his friend wouldn\u2019t have to carry that burden much longer.</p><p>Aden and his crew parked a short block away from the warehouse entrance. They were too big and too noticeable to approach unremarked upon, whether walking or driving, so Travis took the nearest parking spot that could handle the big SUV.</p><p>There was a line of customers waiting in front of the club, every one of them eager to donate blood to whatever vampire crooked a finger. Aden had been to plenty of blood houses over the years. He and Lucas had shut a few down back in the day. But it wasn\u2019t his choice of donor. He much preferred a private party for two with someone like Sidonie Reid. In fact, before too much longer, he and the lovely Sidonie would be having that party. But first . . . there was Silas.</p><p>The club was crowded inside. Being a warehouse, it had high ceilings, rough brick walls, and a floor that was cold concrete beneath his boots. But it was no more than 2,000 square feet, rectangular in shape, and with a brightly-lit bar running nearly the full length of the back wall.</p><p>Aden and the others shoved their way through the crowd, ignoring the delighted squeals of blood groupies and the occasional groping hand. A few vampires objected loudly to their sudden appearance, but quickly fell back when they got a good look at who the newcomers were. A path cleared before them rather quickly, as vampires faded into the crowd and took their human companions with them.</p><p>\u201cThe private room, Sire,\u201d Bastien said in his ear, nodding at a wide metal door to one side of the long bar. It was painted an unimaginative bright red, but at least the color made it easy to spot in the flickering light of the dark warehouse.</p><p>Trav reached the door first. It had an ordinary metal door knob, which he twisted experimentally, finding it unlocked. He shared a skeptical look with Aden. Where was the security on this supposedly private room?</p><p>\u201cIs there an anteroom inside? A second door?\u201d he asked Travis, needing to shout to be heard over the noise, despite their enhanced hearing.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen, Sire,\u201d Trav shouted back.</p><p>Bastien came up on Aden\u2019s other side. \u201cSomething\u2019s not right here,\u201d Aden told him. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting us.\u201d</p><p>Bastien looked up and met his eyes. \u201cYou think our source was playing both sides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s too late now. This changes nothing, except that now we know they\u2019re waiting for us. Stupid of them. They should have left a guard on the door. Ready, gentlemen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His question was met by vicious grins and nods all around. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Travis yanked the door open on his signal.</p><p>They were outnumbered four to one. No, Aden corrected, five to one. And Silas was nowhere to be found. Typical. First, the coward sent a team of incompetents to ambush him outside the hotel, and now this. Silas couldn\u2019t dredge up enough courage to face Aden one-on-one, but wanted to be the next Lord of the Midwest.</p> <p>Not gonna happen, but that showdown would come later. Right now, Aden had to deal with the current threat, had to keep his own people alive. Because Silas or not, there were plenty of enemies here, all trying to kill him and his.</p><p>Aden waded into the crowd of hostile vampires, his power lashing left and right, thundering off the walls of the small room. There was a small bar against one wall, and the stench of alcohol permeated the air quickly as bottle after bottle shattered. Glasses rattled and fell from shelves, while the industrial lights overhead swayed alarmingly on their unadorned cables. Gradually, the air filled with a fine gray dust as vampire after vampire fell before the combined might of Aden and his cadre.</p><p>From the depths of Aden\u2019s power, a dark force lifted its head and scented death, demanding to be set free. Drawing on two centuries of discipline, Aden flexed his will and forced it down, unwilling to permit Silas\u2019s spies to carry word of his true abilities back to their master. But a taste of that dark cruelty must have shown in his gaze, in the midnight glow of his eyes, because Silas\u2019s followers took one look at Aden standing there covered in blood and saw their deaths. They broke for the exit, but Bastien and the others got there first. No mercy, Aden had told his people, and they granted none.</p><p>Finally, Aden stood in the middle of the room, smelling the dust and blood that were the inevitable remains of a vampire\u2019s battlefield, searching for an enemy among the shattered remains of tables and chairs, the pile of glass and wood that had once been an antique bar front. No one rose from the rubble to challenge him. No heart beat within the twenty-by-twenty confines of the private room, but for those four who were under Aden\u2019s care. And Aden himself.</p><p>He knew what he looked like. Knew the cold glow of his eyes, the curl of his fingers into claws, and the gleam of his fangs dripping blood. Even his own children hesitated to approach him with echoes of his power still bouncing off the walls. Only Sebastien knew what the night\u2019s work had cost him, the effort it took to contain the unique and gruesome ability that had come to him with his vampire blood. But he\u2019d learned the necessity of rigid control as a child, a never-forgotten lesson that had stood him in good stead since he\u2019d become Vampire. When he finally ran Silas to ground and forced a fight between them, he would hold nothing back, but the lesser vampires she\u2019d left to die tonight had been more of her sacrificial lambs.</p> <p>Silence slowly filled the room. The dust settled, and the last shattered bottle drained its contents onto the debris.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d It was Bastien, of course. Of all of them, it was his eldest who had the least fear of him, no matter the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cAny humans?\u201d Aden growled, barely able to form the word from the depths of his anger.</p><p>\u201cThere were none in this room, my lord. A small grace, but Silas must have cleared them out in anticipation of your arrival.\u201d</p><p>Aden clenched his jaw against the incontrovertible conclusion from that bit of information. Silas had known he was coming. But how?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want to speak directly to your source tomorrow, Bastien. Someone warned Silas we were coming, and I want to know who it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur action was unplanned, my lord,\u201d Bastien protested. \u201cNo one knew except\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aden turned sharply to regard him. \u201cExcept who?\u201d</p><p>His lieutenant eyed him warily, then drew a deep breath and ventured, \u201cMs. Reid, Sire. I was on the phone when she walked past. She might have overheard.\u201d</p><p>Aden frowned. Was that the real reason Sidonie had approached him when she did? Was her story of a dead friend and drugs simply a cover to get her into his office, like a silk-clad Trojan horse? The thought made him so angry, he nearly choked on it. He wanted to storm over to her home and confront her, wanted to tear the truth from her mind until she begged for death.</p><p>But it was late, and he had others to protect.</p><p>\u201cSidonie will be joining us again tomorrow,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cIf it was she who betrayed us, I\u2019ll know it before the night is over.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>SID STOOD IN FRONT of the mirror, once again trying to decide what to wear for a meeting with Aden. She kept glancing at the clock. She didn\u2019t want to be late, didn\u2019t want to give him any reason to turn her away. She was determined not to be sidetracked tonight. She was going to confront Aden with what she knew about Klemens\u2019s sick enterprises and ask him what he planned to do about it. She was also curious, after her conversation with Dresner last night, about what had happened between Aden and Silas. She even admitted to being a little afraid that Aden had been defeated and that there\u2019d be no one to meet with her when she arrived at his office. Or even worse, there\u2019d be some strange vampire that she couldn\u2019t trust.</p> <p>Not that she trusted Aden. She wasn\u2019t that na\u00efve. But he seemed, if not honest, then at least businesslike. And maybe a little intrigued by her sexually. And, okay, maybe she was intrigued right back at him, which made her wonder at her own sanity. But she couldn\u2019t get the image out of her head of Aden\u2019s mouth on her neck, his breath warm as his fangs slowly emerged from his gums, as they pierced her vein . . .</p><p>Damn. She shook herself mentally. Was this why so many women, and men, too, lined up for those blood houses? Did the vamps exude some sort of pheromone that made regular humans lose every ounce of survival instinct?</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it!\u201d Sid told herself sharply, then laughed. She really was going nuts. She stepped into the green wool sheath she\u2019d decided to wear tonight, pulling it up over her hips and reaching back to zip it before eyeing herself critically. It was a nice enough dress, but she\u2019d chosen it for the neckline. Most of her winter clothes had turtlenecks, because they were winter clothes. This was Chicago, after all. The sweater she\u2019d worn last night and this dress were probably the only exceptions in her closet.</p><p>She smoothed the soft wool over her hips, fighting the instinct to find a cardigan to cover the sweetheart neckline, which not only bared her neck, but also showed a fair amount of cleavage. With a deep sigh, she stepped into a pair of simple black pumps. Simple in that they were unadorned, but the heels were high and spiky, and there was a tiny bow on the back that transformed them from businesslike to sexy. Or so she thought. Hopefully, Aden would, too.</p><p>With another long-suffering sigh, she pulled on her warm coat and headed off to walk voluntarily into the lion\u2019s den once more.</p><p>ADEN STOOD BEHIND his desk as Sidonie Reid entered his office. Not for the first time, he wished his vampire gift had included a greater telepathic component, especially when it came to humans. He could work his will on them easily enough. If he\u2019d wanted, he could have had Miss Reid stripping herself naked and on her knees before him in no time at all. He rarely did such things, however. He preferred seduction, drawing his victims in until they begged for the very thing he\u2019d wanted from them all along, even when they\u2019d denied him only moments before.</p><p>Some vampires used their ability to mesmerize humans to enrich themselves. But it was never money or gold that Aden wanted. He had plenty of both and could always get more. No, what he desired was sexual surrender. And he was a master at getting what he wanted.</p><p>Take Sidonie, for example. She wanted something from him and was willing to use her sexuality to get it. She probably had no intention of following through on her seductive advances. No doubt she was used to confusing men into giving her what she wanted and then dancing away without ever having to deliver. She and Aden were alike in their use of seduction, except that Aden always delivered. That was half the fun, after all.</p><p>She dropped her coat onto the sofa and turned with a polite smile. The dress was a dark green that flattered her hair and accented the pink hue of her pale skin, especially along the curve of her breasts which were showcased by the curved neckline. She wasn\u2019t quite comfortable with the dress. He could tell by her frequent, aborted attempts to tug the neckline higher. He smiled in amusement at her modesty, especially when contrasted with the fuck-me heels she was wearing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just watched and waited, as an embarrassed flush crept up over her neck and face.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked, managing to stop her hand halfway to another tug at her neckline.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cIs there?\u201d</p><p>She tried to cover her irritation, but two little crease lines appeared between her brows.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go last night, Sidonie?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter you left here.\u201d</p><p>The crease lines deepened into a scowl. \u201cI went home. Why, what\u2019d you do?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Aden\u2019s lips curved into a slight smile as he strolled over to face her. She stared up at him with wide eyes and started to take step back. But then she squared her shoulders and glared, her lips flattened defiantly.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he purred and smoothed the back of his fingers down her silken cheek.</p><p>She blinked rapidly, her clear blue eyes meeting his, her heart pounding so loudly in his ears that she had to be hearing it herself. She swallowed and whispered, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t say yes too quickly, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured, letting his fingers continue downward, over the curve of her elegant neck, and down even farther to skim the swell of her breasts. He leaned forward until his lips were nearly touching her ear. \u201cI like the dress even better than the sweater,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She sucked in a startled breath, and he was standing so close that her breasts brushed against his chest. But rather than backing away, as a gentleman might have done, he stepped even closer and rested one hand on her hip.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been bitten, Sidonie?\u201d he asked, his mouth hovering above hers as he slid his hand around to caress her lower back, just above the curve of her ass. It was a light touch, but enough to hold her in place, enough to let her know she was his to control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head, her eyes wide, pupils dilated with desire. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to be? Is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>She seemed to have trouble coming up with an answer for that. Did she think she could lie to him? Impossible. A vampire of his power could detect all of the subtle changes that affected humans when they lied. But maybe she didn\u2019t know that. Her tongue darted out to moisten her lips.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d She drew a deep breath, her breasts once again brushing against his chest, even more so this time. He was holding her so closely that he felt the scrape of her erect nipples and heard the soft hitch in her breath that she probably hadn\u2019t intended him to hear.</p><p>Aden\u2019s lip curled in pleasure. She wanted to feel the kiss of his fangs, but she didn\u2019t want to want it. This was what he loved. This was what made him hard. His cock swelled, thick and hot beneath the fine wool of his slacks, and he shifted slightly, letting her feel it.</p><p>She sucked in a breath. Her hand came up to press against his chest, her fingers curled slightly, as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether to stop him or drag him closer.</p><p>Aden dipped his head and drew in the scent of her, her arousal, her blood so close to the surface, rushing through the big vein beneath her ear, thick and warm. He trailed his tongue along the path of her jugular, then lifted his head and blew softly on the wet skin.</p><p>Sidonie shivered and made a little sound of pleasure, and Aden smiled.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you go last night?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>SID LAID HER HAND on Aden\u2019s chest and sighed with pleasure. He was so big, the muscles beneath her fingers like iron. And she was going to do this thing. He\u2019d started in on her almost the minute she walked through the door tonight, crooning at her in that low, sexy, voice, his dark eyes caressing every curve of her body, every inhaled breath that plumped her breasts over the low-cut neckline. Maybe he was hungry, maybe whatever had happened last night had drained him, and he needed blood. Maybe that was why he was doing the full-court press right off the starting line. The part of her brain that was a writer chided her for the mixed metaphor, but she told it to shut the fuck up.</p><p>She shivered as Aden bent closer, his wet tongue gliding over the skin beneath her ear, his breath warm, just as she\u2019d imagined it would be. She couldn\u2019t stop the tiny sound of pleasure that escaped her lips. Hadn\u2019t she known all along it would come to this? Hadn\u2019t she dressed this way to seduce him, to have his teeth on her neck? And what could it hurt? It was just a little bit of blood, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go last night?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Sid blinked, the unexpected question like a slap in the face. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, and shoved at his chest to no effect.</p> <p>Aden straightened and stared down at her, every inch of him cold and arrogant, the seductive lover gone. \u201cFor whom are you working?\u201d</p><p>She shoved harder and stumbled slightly on her spike heels when he abruptly let her go. \u201cI\u2019m not working for anyone, you ass,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you for days why I\u2019m here, but you\u2019ve been so busy being Mr. Important that you haven\u2019t taken the time to listen.\u201d</p><p>Aden closed the space between them again, looming over her, his size suddenly more threatening than sexy. \u201cWhat did you hear last night? And whom did you tell?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie had grown up with two older brothers. She\u2019d been dealing with bigger males all of her life. She rammed her shoulder against Aden\u2019s chest, trying to force him to move, but he only laughed, and she felt her anger boiling up. Most people never saw it, but she had a temper. She didn\u2019t hold grudges and she couldn\u2019t hold a mad for long, but when her anger finally bubbled to the surface, it came up hot.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He gave her a gloating smile and said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With a shriek of anger, Sidonie swung her hand back in a fist aimed at his smug face, just as she would have one of her brothers. But Aden caught her hand and glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you talk to last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, damn it. I live alone. There\u2019s no one . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded, correctly interpreting her hesitation.</p><p>Sid\u2019s thoughts were racing. Professor Dresner. It had to be. She remembered Dresner\u2019s reaction as soon as she\u2019d mentioned Aden leaving, how she\u2019d pumped Sid for information, then almost immediately cut off the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d she whispered, looking up at him. \u201cDid somebody die?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, but then he said, \u201cA lot of vampires died. None of them were mine.\u201d</p><p>Sid nearly choked on the guilt clogging her throat. Had those vampires died because of her? \u201cWhat about Silas?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Aden\u2019s gaze narrowed dangerously. \u201cWhat do you know about Silas?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. I heard the name when I was leaving last night. Bastien was on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told someone. Who was it?\u201d</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t want to say. Surely she owed Professor Dresner that much. They weren\u2019t exactly friends, and it sounded as if she\u2019d betrayed Sid\u2019s trust, but they were both human. Didn\u2019t that count for something? Some shred of loyalty?</p><p>\u201cSomeone warned Silas last night,\u201d Aden growled. \u201cYou want to know who\u2019s really responsible for all those dead vampires? Look to your friend who sent word that we were coming, and to Silas who ran, knowing what I would do to the vampires left behind.\u201d</p><p>Sid nodded faintly. Somehow everything had gotten turned around. She\u2019d started this to save lives, and now it seemed she\u2019d cost them instead. Or Dresner had. But wasn\u2019t she responsible, too?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working with someone,\u201d she whispered. Aden\u2019s hand gripped her hip once more, his fingers tight. \u201cShe\u2019s sort of an expert on vampire behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s a professor at the university. She\u2019s the one who told me about that bar where I met Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name?\u201d</p><p>Sid frowned up at him worriedly. \u201cWhat are you going to do if I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends, doesn\u2019t it? What would you humans do to someone who\u2019d set up an ambush that resulted in several deaths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she\u2019d go to jail, conspiracy to murder or something.\u201d</p><p>Aden shrugged. \u201cVampire justice is somewhat less ambiguous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you who she is, but only if you take me with you when you go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly in a position to make demands,\u201d he growled, tugging her closer until she was flush with his hard body. And he was hard . . . all over. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my offer,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>Aden regarded her silently, and Sid stared as his eyes seemed to glow, taking on a deep blue hue like moonlight on a cloudy winter night. His gaze skimmed her face, down to the swell of her breasts and back up again.</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to take it,\u201d he crooned in that deep voice.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>SID SHIVERED. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d she whispered, then had to swallow on a dry throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said smugly. \u201cI just wanted my intentions to be clear.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back abruptly, and the loss of his heat, of his strength, was sharp.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where she is. But she knew I was meeting you tonight, so she\u2019ll expect me to call. I can tell her I need to see her in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But watch what you say, Sidonie, because I\u2019ll be listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop threatening me,\u201d she demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Aden laughed again, but it was genuine amusement this time, not like before. \u201cJust make the call,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what your professor friend has to say for herself.\u201d</p><p>As Sid dug her cell phone out of her coat pocket and brought up Dresner\u2019s number, she considered the possibility that the professor wouldn\u2019t want to talk to her. If Dresner had tipped off Silas about Aden, and if she knew the plan had backfired\u2014after all, Aden was still alive, which clearly hadn\u2019t been what Silas was hoping for\u2014she might want to distance herself from Sid, at least for a time. But as it turned out, Dresner didn\u2019t seem troubled at all. She was either secure in assuming Sid didn\u2019t know anything about what was going on with the vamps, or she actually hadn\u2019t been the one who warned Silas that Aden was coming.</p><p>Sidonie was willing to consider both possibilities. Unlike Aden, she wasn\u2019t prepared to hang a guilty sign on Dresner just yet.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d she said, answering the phone. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your call until later. Was your meeting with Aden cancelled again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just the opposite,\u201d Sid said, letting just a touch of anxiety flavor her words. She didn\u2019t want to overplay it, but there had to be a reason for her to insist on a face-to-face meeting. \u201cI have some information for you, but it\u2019s... it\u2019s pretty explosive. I\u2019d really like to meet you on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but are you all right? You sound shaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess . . . I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? Can you come to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Wrigleyville, on Lakeview. I\u2019ll text you the address. How soon can you be here?\u201d</p><p>Sid looked up and met Aden\u2019s dark stare. \u201cI\u2019d rather not take a cab this late. Is it okay if a friend drives me? We could be there in half an hour or so.\u201d Aden\u2019s sensuous lips curved slightly in what she supposed could be called a smile, if it hadn\u2019t been for the cold calculation in his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA friend . . .\u201d Dresner repeated hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHe lives here in Chicago.

Don\u2019t ring the bell, though, just knock. The neighbors complain about my late-night visitors.\u201d She hung up without saying good-bye.</p> <p>Aden took the phone from Sid\u2019s nerveless fingers and pressed the button to disconnect before saying, \u201cVery good, Sidonie. Is lying one of the skills you learned as a journalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to that, just raised a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cAre you still determined to go along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get your coat. We don\u2019t want to keep the good professor waiting.\u201d</p> <p>IT TOOK EVEN less time than Sid had expected to get to Dresner\u2019s house. Aden\u2019s driver seemed to know where he was going, and this late at night\u2014it was after midnight in the middle of the work week\u2014there were few traffic tie-ups. Having a driver at one\u2019s disposal helped, too. No public transpo for Aden. Sid didn\u2019t worry about money, but she didn\u2019t have a private driver at her beck and call, either.</p><p>\u201cAre all vampires rich?\u201d she asked, sitting next to Aden and trying not to think about what was going to happen when they confronted Professor Dresner.</p><p>Her question seemed to amuse him. He stretched a powerful arm over the back of the seat behind her, dropping one finger down to toy with a lock of her hair. \u201cAn interesting question,\u201d he said. \u201cAre all humans rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would all vampires be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said irritably. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got this big truck\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Chevy Suburban, hardly exotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and a private driver,\u201d she persisted, determined to make her point. \u201cAnd your supposedly temporary office occupies two entire floors of some of the most expensive square footage in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne must make an impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if one can afford it.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened into something almost genuine, but Sid found herself irked all the same. She didn\u2019t want him to be amused. She needed him to take her seriously if he was going to help her destroy Klemens\u2019s network.</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question. Are all vamps rich?\u201d</p><p>His smile vanished, replaced by a haughty stare. That wasn\u2019t a word she thought of often, but Aden did haughty really well. Maybe he\u2019d been born to money back when he\u2019d been human. Maybe he\u2019d always been rich.</p><p>\u201cWere you like a prince or something back in the day?\u201d she asked and knew right away that she\u2019d made a mistake. His fingers stopped toying with her hair, and his expression went cold and distant, the look in his eyes so far away that it was as if she was suddenly all alone in the back seat.</p> <p>Morocco, 1756</p><p>ADEN RACED through the halls of the palace, bare feet slapping the cool marble floor as he dodged silk-clad ladies and ignored the frowns of overfed gentlemen. The former only tittered in annoyance, but the latter would have swatted him to the ground if they\u2019d dared. His father owned this particular palace, although Aden was a bastard and would never inherit a single copper falus. Still, his mother was the favorite among his father\u2019s concubines, and one could never be certain what standing young Aden had on any given day.</p><p>That same uncertainty made Aden wary, however, and he made a point of avoiding the better-traveled corridors whenever possible. On this particular day, however, he\u2019d been summoned to see his mother, which was unusual enough that he hadn\u2019t wanted to waste any time getting to her. Not that he didn\u2019t see his mother often. After all, he was still very much a child and so lived in the harem. But his time with her was heavily dependent on his father\u2019s presence in the palace and his taste for female companionship on a given day. Not to mention the considerable amount of time his mother spent on efforts to maintain her beauty and fitness in order to maintain a pleasing appearance.</p><p>Aden\u2019s mother was a rare flower in the harem. He\u2019d heard her described that way by the harem\u2019s matron, and not without a certain amount of bitterness either. Which made him think it was true.</p><p>His father called his mother Aini, which meant flower in Arabic, but her real name was Aileen, and she was a slave. A pampered one to be sure, but a slave nonetheless. She\u2019d told Aden the story of how she came to be living in this palace, how she ended up in a land where five-year-old Aden spoke the native tongue far better than she ever would.</p><p>Her father, Aden\u2019s grandfather, whose name was also Aden, had been a sea trader in a place called Scotland, which was far away from this palace in Morocco. But it wasn\u2019t so far that pirates couldn\u2019t raid there, and they did so regularly, looking mostly for slaves\u2014sailors like his uncles and grandfather, and women like his mother. She\u2019d been lucky, she\u2019d told Aden\u2014although he didn\u2019t see much luck in being stolen from her life and made a slave. But her pale skin and blond hair, not to mention her intact virginity, had caught the eye of the slave master who\u2019d known his own master\u2019s tastes very well. He\u2019d made a private bid, thus sparing her the indignity of being auctioned on the block.</p><p>Aileen had been sold into the harem of the wealthy merchant who called her Aini, and some months later Aden had been the result. She\u2019d learned after that to use herbs to prevent pregnancy, which ensured her continued favor with her master.</p><p>As for his father, Aden never saw him at all, unless by accident, and had never spoken two words with the man. Bastards were frowned upon by wealthy men and their families. They complicated lines of succession and made wives\u2014particularly wives who\u2019d been unable to produce male heirs\u2014unhappy.</p><p>Aden scooted past the harem guards. They were used to his comings and goings and barely registered his passage. Once inside, he slid along back hallways until he reached his mother\u2019s rooms. He ducked through the curtained doorway.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d he whispered excitedly and raced over to her. She held him off when he would have embraced her, and he swallowed the small pang of hurt. Sometimes she was already dressed and perfumed and couldn\u2019t risk his dirty little boy hands messing her up. She always kissed him on the cheek after telling him such things, so he knew she loved him.</p><p>\u201cSit, Aden,\u201d she said, touching his cheek and leaving behind her flowery scent.</p><p>He plopped down obediently at her feet and was surprised when she took one of his brown hands in her own pale fingers. He had his Scottish grandfather\u2019s name, but his Moroccan father\u2019s coloring. There seemed to be little of his mother\u2019s Scottish blood in him, except for his size, which already made him bigger than any other boy his age, and several of the older ones, too.</p><p>\u201cAden, mah sweit son, you love your mama, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, Mama,\u201d Aden said quickly, ignoring the little pang of unease that tightened his chest, despite her use of the endearment. She never asked him if he loved her. It was assumed. Of course he loved her. She was his world.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d she continued in her soft voice. \u201cProbably too young to understand what I have to tell you, but I need you to understand.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded, more alarmed than ever when he saw the tears blurring his mother\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour father . . .\u201d She looked away, then down at their joined hands, brown against white. \u201cHe\u2019s given me a command. You\u2019re big for your age, much bigger than the other boys. Someday you\u2019ll be a big man, like my father and brothers, and I hope the fates are kinder to you than they were to them. But, Aden . . .\u201d She sighed, still refusing to look at him directly. \u201cI must choose. I can take you and leave the harem\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s heart swelled with excitement.</p><p>\u201c\u2014to become a common slave in some other household, or I can stay here as your father\u2019s favorite for as long as my beauty lasts\u2014which is many years yet\u2014and then perhaps become matron to the harem and serve him that way.\u201d</p><p>Aden frowned in confusion. Surely it would be better for them to remain here? Why should there be any question?</p><p>\u201cBut if I remain, then you must go.\u201d She lifted her head at last, and Aden saw her decision in the sadness of her eyes. \u201cYou will leave tonight to begin serving your new master.\u201d</p><p>Aden stared, not quite understanding what she was telling him. A new master? But... \u201cWhen will I see you, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, firming her lips. \u201cIt is not unlike the fostering that my people used to do. Children were often sent to live with families far away, never seeing their parents again until they were grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I see you when I am grown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Aden was no longer a baby. He knew what perhaps meant. He swallowed the knot in his throat and stood, pulling his fingers from his mother\u2019s soft grasp. Apparently, he\u2019d gotten more than size from his Scotsman grandfather. He had his pride. She had chosen her master over her own flesh and blood. So be it.</p><p>\u201cInsha\u2019Allah, we will meet again,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>His mother glanced up at him in surprise. But whether it was due to the casting of his fate to Allah rather than the Christian god of her youth, or his quiet acceptance of her decision, he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t care. All that mattered now was that he\u2019d been sold, that he\u2019d wake up tomorrow in a new household. He would no longer be the bastard son of anyone, whether rich or poor. He would be only a boy, a slave with no friends in the world.</p><p>Aden turned and left the way he\u2019d come, taking the slaves\u2019 hallways, which was only appropriate, since that\u2019s all he was now. A slave.</p><p>Chicago, IL, present day</p><p>\u201cSHALL I COME with you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Bastien\u2019s question brought Aden back to the present with a jolt. He\u2019d never seen his mother again after that day. He hadn\u2019t even thought about her in a very long time, and it didn\u2019t please him that he was thinking about her now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDresner\u2019s not expecting a crowd,\u201d he told Bastien. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll need an invitation into the house. Sidonie and I will go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she recognizes you?\u201d Sidonie asked, staring nervously at the brownstone they\u2019d parked in front of. \u201cShe knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay to the shadows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has a porch light.\u201d</p><p>Aden slanted a look at her. \u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cJust get us in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. No need to get snippy about it.\u201d</p><p>Aden reminded himself that he needed this woman to get close to Dresner, that Dresner was probably the one who\u2019d betrayed him to Silas. He also promised himself that in the very near future, he would lay Sidonie Reid out on his bed and leave his mark on every inch of her pale skin. That alone made it worthwhile to put up with her disrespect.</p><p>The attitude was something he\u2019d come to expect from modern women, something he didn\u2019t consider to be a change for the better. But he was also minded of Raphael\u2019s recent admonition, that some women had skills to contribute to an investigation, or, as in this case, information and contacts.</p> <p>So, he didn\u2019t take Sidonie over his lap, pull up her skirt, and redden her ass like he wanted to. At least not yet.</p><p>SID SNUCK A sideways glance at Aden as they made their way up the walk. Wherever he\u2019d gone during the last few miles of their drive here, he was fully back with her now. She could feel his awareness of their surroundings like a faint electrical charge in the cold night air. He fairly buzzed with energy as they stepped up onto the covered porch. It was like the static charge one got on a hot, dry day. She expected to see blue sparks shooting off of him. Plus, she didn\u2019t know how she was supposed to keep Dresner from seeing him once the porch light came on. It wasn\u2019t as if he could hide behind a potted plant, after all. He was nearly as big as the whole porch.</p><p>Okay, so that was an exaggeration, but knowing that didn\u2019t give her any better idea of how to conceal . . . oh.</p><p>She stared at the place where Aden used to be, seeing nothing but shadow, even though she could still feel the static electricity of his presence. Frowning, she reached out and touched a hard-muscled arm.</p><p>\u201cAden?\u201d she whispered, her eyes straining to see what her fingers told her was there.</p><p>\u201cControl yourself, Sidonie,\u201d he said drily. \u201cYour friend is about to open her door.\u201d</p> <p>Sid snatched her fingers away. He was such a jerk all the time. Well, maybe not all the time. He\u2019d seemed almost human for a while back there in his office. Better than human, actually. She\u2019d never met a human male who was as seductive as Aden, much less one whose seduction she\u2019d so willingly succumbed to. But then he\u2019d turned off the seduction like a switch, which made her think it had all been a pose, just a game he played to see if he could get away with it. She figured he must have lots of notches on his bedpost. Maybe hundreds if he was as old as she thought he had to be.</p><p>The porch light came on, and the door opened, forcing Sid\u2019s attention back to their current problem, which was Dresner. The prof was standing in her open doorway, giving Sid a curious look.</p><p>Remembering the ruse she\u2019d used to arrange this late night visit, Sid painted a nervous smile on her face and said, \u201cProfessor, thank you for letting us come over so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seemed upset,\u201d Dresner said absently. She tilted her head and leaned to one side, trying to get a look through the screen door at Sid\u2019s supposed friend. But the shadows Aden had wrapped around himself were too thick, concealing him while appearing to be nothing more than the natural shadow thrown by the yellow porch light.</p><p>\u201cCould we come in?\u201d Sid asked, nudging Dresner cautiously.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the professor said at once. \u201cWhere are my manners, leaving you out in the cold? Come in, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sid murmured, trying not to show the depths of the relief she was feeling. What would have happened if Dresner had refused? Or if she\u2019d phrased her welcome to include Sidonie only?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look for problems,\u201d Aden muttered against her ear. The concealing darkness dissipated as if it had never been more than a trick of the eye. He stepped up to her side, pulled open the screen door, and gestured for her to go ahead of him, looking all too pleased with himself.</p> <p>Sid scowled over her shoulder. Had he read her mind? She knew that some vampires could do that.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t read your mind. Your concerns were written on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she snapped. The asshole just grinned and stepped inside, closing the door behind them.</p><p>Dresner had backed up a few steps, making polite room for them as they came through the door. But once she got a good look at Aden, she backed all the way to the open archway leading to her living room, her knuckles going white as she gripped the elegant molding.</p><p>\u201cIntroduce us, Sidonie,\u201d Aden drawled, his dark eyes heavy-lidded as he watched the professor shrink away from him, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Dresner,\u201d Sid said obediently. \u201cThis is Lord Aden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Dresner said, her words defiant, despite her obvious fear. \u201cYou think you\u2019re going to be the next Lord of the Midwest,\u201d she sneered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d Aden responded dismissively. \u201cI know. No one, not even your precious Silas, will stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant bastard,\u201d Dresner hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re not fit to lick Lord Klemens\u2019s boots. He was a giant, a genius. And it won\u2019t be someone like you who takes his place, a masterless bastard from God-knows-where. Silas is his child and rightful heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same Silas who has run twice from a stand-up fight? Who sends minions to kill me, while waiting in safety? That Silas? Silas isn\u2019t fit to run a dockside blood house, much less a territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart,\u201d Dresner persisted. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Aden took a long step forward, until he was towering over her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI will see. You\u2019re going to show it to me.\u201d</p><p>She glared up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you nothing. I\u2019ll tell you nothing.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s sensuous lips curved up in a confident smile. \u201cWrong,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Sid stared as Dresner\u2019s defiant stance softened into something almost dreamy. Her entire body relaxed, her lips tilting into a peaceful smile. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d she agreed happily. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you warn Silas about me coming to the club the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dresner said, nodding eagerly. \u201cWhen Sidonie mentioned Silas\u2019s name, I knew that\u2019s where you had to be going, so I called and warned them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why won\u2019t Silas meet me directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d she cooed. \u201cSilas is afraid. If my master Lord Klemens was still\u2014\u201d She cut off her words with a wince.</p><p>\u201cWho is your master, Claudia?\u201d Aden demanded. And it took Sid a moment to remember that Dresner\u2019s first name was Claudia. She\u2019d never called her anything but Professor Dresner.</p><p>\u201cYou are my master, Lord Aden,\u201d Dresner responded fervently.</p><p>Sid tuned out their voices as Aden continued his interrogation. She was more than a little creeped out by what he was doing and how Dresner was acting. Aden had somehow taken over Dresner\u2019s mind and was making her act against everything she believed in. He was quite literally making her a slave to his will. Would he do that to Sid, too, if she disagreed with him about something? Was this the vampire she\u2019d thought would help her wipe out Klemens\u2019s old slave network?</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she whispered, staring appalled at the simpering Dresner. Then more strongly, \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>Aden glanced over. \u201cStop what?\u201d he asked distractedly.</p><p>\u201cStop what you\u2019re doing to her. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re stealing her will, enslaving her.\u201d</p><p>Aden lifted a hand, halting the flow of information from Dresner. He gave Sid a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forcing her to do things she doesn\u2019t want to, things she\u2019d never do willingly. That\u2019s slavery, and that\u2019s not why I brought you here, not why I sought you out in the first place. I wanted you to get rid of Klemens\u2019s old slave network, not create your own.\u201d</p><p>Aden crossed the room in three hard strides, until he was standing only inches away from Sid. He stared down at her, and Sid had to admit he was pretty intimidating with his size and dark glowering looks. But Sid wasn\u2019t the now pathetic Dresner, and she wasn\u2019t cowed. She glared wordlessly right back at him, getting up in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about slaves?\u201d he demanded distinctly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew,\u201d she said, her glare becoming a frown of confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat. Do. You. Know?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Sid recoiled, realizing abruptly that he was way more than pissed off. If he\u2019d been intimidating before, he was truly scary now. She hadn\u2019t gotten this far by scaring easily, but a little common sense wouldn\u2019t hurt, either, so she answered his question and didn\u2019t give him any attitude.</p><p>\u201cKlemens used his drug network to bring slaves into the country,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cChicago was his hub, his distribution center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia!\u201d he barked, without looking away from Sid.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Dresner said instantly.</p><p>\u201cYou will tell no one of our conversation. You will cease all communication with Silas, or any other vampire, other than myself, is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. Thank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You,\u201d he said, locking gazes with Sid, \u201ccome with me.\u201d</p><p>Sid narrowed her eyes irritably and didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>His scowl intensified. \u201cWhat does it matter? You say you want Klemens\u2019s slave network shut down. Then you will tell me what you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works.

This is vampire business, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot\u2014\u201d Sid couldn\u2019t form the right words around the anger choking her throat. \u201cThe women they\u2019re kidnapping and selling are human, Lord Fucking Aden. That makes this my business. And you wouldn\u2019t have known any of this if I hadn\u2019t told you about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. I have my own sources. You just made it easier. Now, either tell me what you know, or go play reporter somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Sid stared at him in disbelief. What a total asshole. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been ready to let him . . . Fuck. She couldn\u2019t even think about what she\u2019d almost let him do.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, Aden,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d And with that, she spun on her heel and stormed out of the house.</p><p>Bastien was waiting on the porch, probably worried about his precious asshole of a vampire lord. He looked up questioningly when she banged open the screen door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d she snapped, then almost growled out loud when she caught Bastien\u2019s quick look over her head. He was obviously checking with Aden to see if she was allowed to leave. She didn\u2019t wait to find out. She didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission, no matter what these vampires seemed to think. Reaching the street, she looked both ways, calculating her best chance of catching a cab.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Sidonie,\u201d Aden said from right behind her.</p><p>She spun around, fighting the urge to jump, but knew she hadn\u2019t succeeded when she saw one side of his mouth curl up knowingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride back to your condo,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said primly. She turned away from him and started walking.</p><p>\u201cHave it your way,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut don\u2019t blame me if Silas finds you.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her. She spun to face him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>His thick shoulders moved in a careless shrug. \u201cDresner told Silas how she knew I was coming. Your name came up.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that great? Sid pulled her cell out of her pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d</p><p>Aden strode forward until he was blocking the street light, and she was standing in his shadow. His deep voice curled around her. \u201cLet me give you a ride, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>Sid swayed closer, then realized what he was doing. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do that to me!\u201d she gasped. \u201cI am not some pathetic vampire groupie you can mesmerize into becoming your slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warned her. \u201cMy patience is not unlimited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth hurts, Lord Aden. Good-bye.\u201d Sidonie turned her back on him and started off toward Clark and Wrightwood. There were a few clubs up there in Lincoln Park that had music seven days a week. She should be able to find a cab there, or at least she\u2019d have other people to hang out with until one could arrive.</p><p>It was a short walk to the corner, and she felt Aden\u2019s stare against her back every step of the way. She kept waiting for his crooning voice to drift over her shoulder, for his big hand to wrap around her waist. But it never did. He let her go. And she told herself it didn\u2019t matter. That the disappointed ache she was feeling was only because she was losing a powerful ally in her efforts to close down Klemens\u2019s old network.</p><p>And she nearly believed it.</p> <p>ADEN WATCHED Sidonie storm away down the street, as if she were in control. As if she could escape him. He let her go . . . for tonight. There were only a few hours before sunrise, and he had a lot to do before then. He\u2019d pretty much drained Dresner of any useful information, but he wanted to pursue Sidonie\u2019s claims regarding Klemens. His vampire sources had hinted at the existence of a slave ring here in Chicago, something he found deeply troubling. He wasn\u2019t a total innocent. He knew many vampires indulged their darker natures and ignored human laws. Aden himself frequently bypassed the human legal system, considering it irrelevant to most vampire affairs.</p><p>But slavery was one thing he would never permit in his territory. He knew the emotional toll of being owned, of having one\u2019s very existence dependent on the whim of another. Sidonie thought he\u2019d enslaved Dresner by capturing her mind and compelling her to tell him what she knew. But what he\u2019d done to Dresner was temporary and harmless. He hadn\u2019t altered her memories, though he could have, and he hadn\u2019t stripped her mind bare, although he could have done that, too. Once he\u2019d dealt with Silas permanently, Dresner could go back to her sad devotion to the dead Klemens, and Aden would have nothing more to do with her.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t slavery.</p><p>Sidonie Reid had no idea what it truly meant to be a slave.</p><p>Morocco, 1763</p><p>ADEN OPENED HIS eyes and shivered in the cold morning. It was raining. His master Hafiz would be in a foul mood again today. Hafiz hated the rain. He claimed it lowered his profits, and Aden supposed that must be true, since he doubted people would want to stand in the rain and bid on shivering, wet slaves. But what Aden knew for certain was that if business was slow, his master would take out his unhappiness on his own slaves, and that included Aden. Especially Aden. It was as if Hafiz derived particular pleasure in beating the bastard son of one of the wealthiest merchants in the city. More than once, Aden had wondered if his father had known the kind of treatment he\u2019d receive at Hafiz\u2019s hand, and if he\u2019d chosen the slave master for that very reason. Had his father wanted to punish him for being born? For taking even a small part of his mother\u2019s love? Though that love had obviously meant nothing to her. She\u2019d sent him away willingly enough.</p><p>He poured freezing water from the cracked pitcher on the wooden table next to his bed, filling the crude pottery bowl. He no longer even thought about the elegant furnishings he\u2019d left behind in his father\u2019s home, things like smooth pottery and fresh-smelling soaps. As the bastard son, Aden had made do with the lowest quality available in his father\u2019s palace, and yet they were still a thousand times better than what he had now. He splashed water on his face and washed his hands with the harsh soap. It hurt his skin, but he did it anyway, knowing it would earn him lashes if he failed to present a neat appearance. Not that he wouldn\u2019t be whipped anyway, but he\u2019d discovered there were degrees of pain.</p><p>There was no need to change clothes. He had only the one set, and it had been too cold last night to sleep naked. The shirt was ragged and unhemmed, the pants torn and too short for his long legs, but they were the only ones he possessed. And even these were owned by his master. Aden owned nothing. He was nothing. He was a thing, a possession, easily discarded and of very little value.</p><p>\u201cAden!\u201d</p><p>He heard his master\u2019s bellow and rushed from his room, drying his hands on his pants as he went.</p><p>Dropping to his knees at the open door to his master\u2019s morning room, he bent nearly in half, face to the floor, and shouted, \u201cHow may this useless one serve you, master?\u201d</p><p>His master\u2019s laugh greeted his query. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d Hafiz chortled. \u201cPerfectly biddable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said,\u201d a woman\u2019s husky voice responded.</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t move from his prostrate position, but he was intrigued. His master didn\u2019t entertain many women. Boys were far more his style, and only the smallest, weakest ones at that. It was one thing Aden had to be grateful for, that his Scottish blood had made him too big to suit Hafiz\u2019s perverted taste in sexual amusement. Even at the age of five, when Hafiz had first purchased him from his father, Aden had been too strong, his attitude too arrogant. The arrogance had been beaten out of him quickly enough, but his size and strength were there to stay.</p><p>\u201cGet in here, worm,\u201d Hafiz\u2019s hated voice called.</p><p>Aden lifted himself from the floor, and, keeping his head lowered, eyes downcast, he shuffled into his master\u2019s audience chamber, where he promptly prostrated himself once again.</p><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>He felt the sharp end of Hafiz\u2019s cane dig into his shoulder and tensed, but then the woman intervened.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply, and amazingly, Hafiz stopped his poking. \u201cStand up, boy,\u201d she commanded. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Aden froze uncertainly. The woman had given him an order, but Hafiz had not. If he stood without his master\u2019s permission, he would be beaten. But if he ignored the command of his master\u2019s guest, he might very well be beaten, too. Though perhaps not as severely. So he remained prostrate.</p><p>\u201cDo it, imbecile.\u201d</p><p>Aden stifled a sigh of relief, jumping to his feet at his master\u2019s order.</p><p>\u201cRaise your head,\u201d the woman said. His mind told him the words were a command, but his gut felt it was a request. He chose not to obey either his brain or his gut, because the words didn\u2019t come in his master\u2019s voice.</p><p>Hafiz sighed deeply. \u201cThis is becoming tiresome. Do whatever she says, worm.\u201d</p><p>Aden lifted his head and tried not to stare. He barely managed not to meet the woman\u2019s eyes, which would have earned him far more than a lashing in punishment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s very big for his age,\u201d the woman observed, standing suddenly and coming close to Aden. He fought the shiver that tried to race along his nerves at her nearness. No female had been this close to him since he\u2019d bid his mother good-bye. Hafiz didn\u2019t own female slaves, didn\u2019t have a wife or a mistress. His entire staff was male.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d she said quietly, leaning close enough that he caught the flowery scent of her perfume. It confused him for a moment, because it reminded him again of the last time he\u2019d seen his mother.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes, boy.\u201d</p><p>Hafiz\u2019s harsh command broke through his confusion, and he jumped to obey. Slaves had no souls, but Aden had gained enough religion before being sold to know that it was unseemly for this woman to see him naked. But that didn\u2019t stop him. Modesty of any kind was something he\u2019d lost long ago. He loosened the tie on his pants and let them fall to the floor as he tugged the rough garment that was his shirt over his head. Stepping out of the pants, he folded both pieces neatly and set them aside before standing straight once more, eyes cast downward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman\u2019s delicate laugh tightened his gut with fear. Did she find his nakedness amusing? Was there some flaw that proved him unacceptable and would result in his punishment for embarrassing Hafiz?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly tidy,\u201d she said over her laugh. \u201cAnd very pretty, too.\u201d</p><p>Aden surrendered to the shudder that rolled through him as her soft hand stroked over his skin, starting at his back and caressing his buttocks, the trail of her fingers following her slow steps around to his chest. He fought against his body\u2019s instinctive reaction, but he was a twelve-year-old boy who\u2019d never been touched by a woman like this. His abdomen clenched with an entirely different kind of fear as her slender fingers glided down to his belly and lower, finally grasping his erect cock with a boldness that shocked him. And terrified him.</p> <p>\u201cLovely,\u201d she commented. \u201cThough you\u2019ve marked him more than once, Hafiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys require discipline,\u201d Hafiz said casually, as if the beatings he subjected his slaves to were for their own good and nothing to remark upon.</p><p>\u201cFortunately,\u201d the woman said, \u201cthe marks will fade with proper treatment. It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t appreciate true male beauty. Still, your loss is my gain. I\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the price?\u201d Hafiz inquired in his oily voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet your price,\u201d she said negligently. \u201cBut he goes with me this morning. I know you and your discipline. I\u2019ll not have you marking him out of spite. The last boy I bought from you couldn\u2019t work for nearly two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Aden listened to this exchange and wondered what it meant. Clearly, his master had sold him to this woman, and that was a good thing. Or so he hoped. Aden was untutored, but not stupid. As much as he despised Hafiz, he knew there were far worse fates that could be his. It seemed unlikely, however, that this woman ran a slave ship, or any of the other detestable positions he could find himself in, especially given her admonishment to Hafiz about not marking him. He took that as a good sign, but, in truth, he had no idea what it meant.</p><p>His head still lowered, Aden watched from the corner of his eye as the woman picked up his clothes and fingered them with distaste.</p><p>\u201cPut these back on for now. The matron will clothe you more suitably later.\u201d She turned away dismissively as he began to dress. \u201cOur business is complete, Hafiz. Come, boy.\u201d</p><p>And that easily, Aden\u2019s entire existence changed once more.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Chicago, IL, present day</p> <p>SID WOKE THE next morning, feeling frustrated and angry. It wasn\u2019t supposed to have worked out this way. Dresner had assured her that vampires were horndogs, always looking for an easy conquest to score both blood and sex. Unfortunately, she was now forced to question everything Dresner had told her, because it seemed the prof had been working for Silas all along. Dresner had all but admitted setting Sid up as bait for Aden, purely so she could help Silas win control over the territory. And now, because Sid had visited Aden\u2019s office once or twice\u2014with Dresner\u2019s encouragement\u2014she was in the crosshairs of this Silas, a vampire she\u2019d never even heard of before last night.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t even care who won the territory. The only reason she\u2019d approached Aden in the first place was because Dresner said he was the guy most likely to win, and therefore the guy most likely to help her fulfill her crusade to shut down Klemens\u2019s old slave trade.</p><p>Granted, that was before she\u2019d actually met Aden, the overbearing asshole. And now that she had, she really didn\u2019t care who won. Or so she\u2019d told herself all through her long walk in the dark last night, from Dresner\u2019s house to a busy club where she\u2019d caught a cab. And ever since she woke up this morning, too. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t having much luck convincing herself that it was true. Somehow that infuriating, chauvinistic, high-handed . . . gorgeous, powerful, and intensely masculine hunk of vampire had gotten under her skin. And wasn\u2019t that a bitch? Because as long as she was listing things that frustrated her, Aden had to be at the very top. One minute he was seducing her, and the next, like a switch being thrown, he was all business, all don\u2019t get in my way, little human, the big bad vampire will handle everything.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d she muttered and stormed over to her computer. Hadn\u2019t she been working this story for months? She knew more about Klemens and his sleazy businesses than Aden did. He hadn\u2019t even been sure there was a slave network until she\u2019d told him. He\u2019d seemed upset once he found out, though. She\u2019d give him that. Of course, then he\u2019d immediately gone all high-handed me-Tarzan and shuffled the little lady off to the tree house where she\u2019d be safe. Well, double fuck that. She\u2019d worked this story alone so far, and she could keep doing it. She didn\u2019t need almighty Aden\u2019s permission to do her job.</p><p>Checking her calendar, she saw it was the eleventh of the month, and the slavers maintained a surprisingly strict schedule, for bloodsucking bottom feeders. The newest shipment of girls would have come in last night. They\u2019d be penned up in one of several holding houses, awaiting the next online auction, which would be on the thirteenth. The number of women to be auctioned varied. It could be as few as five or as many as twenty. It just depended on the gleaners and how much merchandise they could round up. Sid\u2019s problem would be determining which of the houses the women were being held in. If she could figure that out, she could do some recon and maybe gather enough evidence to take to the police. If she could only persuade them to conduct a raid while the women were still being held prisoner, they\u2019d have no choice but to open a wider investigation. Granted, she\u2019d brought the police evidence before, and they\u2019d never moved on it. She suspected they\u2019d been bought off, though she\u2019d never been able to prove it. But she kept trying, and maybe this time her report would fall to someone who wasn\u2019t in the slavers\u2019 pay, someone who would follow up on her information.</p><p>And if that went against Aden\u2019s preferences for keeping the human authorities out of it, then too bad. If he\u2019d listened to her, it never would have come to this.</p><p>Sid settled down to work. Because the slavers were so organized in other things, she\u2019d been working on a system for figuring out which house they\u2019d use in any given month. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but so far, she\u2019d been right about sixty percent of the time. Eventually, her odds would go up, but with any luck they\u2019d be shut down before that happened.</p><p>She\u2019d calculated her best guess and was gathering her stuff for a little field trip when her phone rang. She almost didn\u2019t answer, too focused on her plans for the afternoon to be interrupted, but then she caught Will\u2019s name on the caller ID.</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she whispered. Was it Wednesday already? She briefly considered letting it go to voice mail, but decided that was just too cowardly, so she picked up the phone with a breathless, \u201cHi, Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound out of breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. I dropped a file and was crawling around under my desk,\u201d she explained, appalled at the ease with which the lie tripped off her tongue.</p><p>\u201cCan we make it an early lunch today? I\u2019ve got a meeting.\u201d</p><p>It was the perfect excuse to cancel, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t have many friends since moving to Chicago. Or rather, she had them, mostly from college, but they were spread all over the globe. Will was one of the few who always made an effort to stay in touch, something she herself was woefully remiss in. Besides, who knew? Maybe they would get married someday.</p><p>Sid contemplated that last thought and shook her head. Nope. She just couldn\u2019t see herself settling into her mother\u2019s routine for the rest of her life. And that\u2019s what life with Will would be. Not a bad life, but not the one Sid wanted, either.</p><p>\u201cYou there, Sid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. My brain took a short trip without me. Early lunch is fine. Where and when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reserved 11:30 at Naha. That work?\u201d</p><p>Sid checked the time on her computer. It would be tight, but she could do it. And she\u2019d still have plenty of time this afternoon to check out the slavers\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cWorks great. I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected, smiling at Will\u2019s sign-off. No brooding, alpha male bullshit from Will. He was beta all the way. Had she ever seen him angry? Did he ever get angry? He must, right? Everyone did eventually. She sighed and slumped back to her bedroom to change clothes. Ripped Levi\u2019s and scuffed Chucks weren\u2019t going to cut it at Naha.</p><p>SID TOOK A BIG bite of her Naha \u201cfamous\u201d half-pound burger and chewed with great relish. She caught Will watching her with a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow a bitty thing like you manages to chow down the way you do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m not a bitty thing. I\u2019m nearly five-eight, as you well know. Second, no woman wants to be told she chows down. As for the rest of it, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t have ordered a burger if you\u2019d wanted one, so stop looking at my lunch like a starving dog, and eat your damn halibut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesty. But I had steak yesterday, and I\u2019m trying to cut back on red meat, now that I\u2019m getting older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, you\u2019re going to be thirty, not sixty. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til it\u2019s your turn. Speaking of birthdays, I assume you\u2019re heading home this weekend for your dad\u2019s big bash?\u201d</p><p>Sid blanked for a moment. Her father\u2019s birthday party was . . . oh, God, this weekend? She was mortified and feeling more than a little guilty that she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she insisted, thinking that she and Will knew each other entirely too well. \u201cIt\u2019s on my calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you forgot anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have picked it up tomorrow. My alert\u2019s set for two days before.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have a present yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought it last month, Mister Know-It-All, so there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to drive out there with me? I\u2019m staying over at my parents\u2019 \u2019til Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>Sid thought about the significance of that last part. It didn\u2019t occur to either of them to stay in a hotel together, because there was no passion. Will would stay at his parents\u2019 house, and, if she stayed over at all, it would be in her old room at her parents\u2019 house. She found the reminder depressing.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said to his invitation. At a minimum, he\u2019d be good company for the drive, and if it turned out she didn\u2019t want to stay over, she could always take the train back.</p><p>\u201cGood deal. I\u2019ll pick you up around ten. Gives you time to get gorgeous before the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Sid agreed, but her mind was hung up on the unfairness of it all. That a smug, chauvinist bastard of a vampire could rock her world, while a great guy like Will was relegated to the friends department. What did that say about her? Nothing good, that was for sure.</p><p>Will\u2019s cell phone vibrated discreetly. He stole a glance at it and signaled the waiter for the check.</p> <p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind, Sid. But I can\u2019t be late for this meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother said to say hi, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him hi back.\u201d Her oldest brother, Jameson Reid III, was Will\u2019s best friend and a partner at the same law firm. Which was why Will saw her brother far more often than Sid did. She\u2019d come by her obsessive work ethic naturally. It ran in the family.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Will gave her a brotherly kiss good-bye and slipped into a cab.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to share?\u201d he asked, before closing the door.</p> <p>Sid shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite direction, and I don\u2019t want you to be late. I\u2019ll take the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Saturday morning, then.\u201d</p><p>She watched the cab carry him away, staring at the traffic until the doorman drew her attention with a polite, \u201cDo you required a cab, miss?\u201d</p><p>Sid regarded him blankly, considering. She felt like walking, but it was already late, and she\u2019d have to take the train to her destination later. \u201cYes, please. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The cab ride was longer than she\u2019d hoped. She\u2019d forgotten how bad lunchtime traffic could be and could probably have walked faster. But it was too late for that. She rushed into the elevator and down the hall, kicking off her heels as she walked into her condo, pulling off her black cashmere sweater and charcoal pencil skirt and tossing them on the bed. She took the time to wash her face of makeup and confine her hair in a long braid, but before she got dressed, she added something she only wore during these nighttime recons of hers, and that was a bellyband holster along with a 9mm Glock 26 Gen4 with a ten capacity mag.</p><p>Sid wasn\u2019t all that fond of guns and had never fired one before moving to Chicago. But she was fond of her life, and some of the places she\u2019d had to venture in pursuit of this story were unsavory at best and flat-out dangerous at worst. She hadn\u2019t really taken the danger seriously before Janey had been killed, but afterwards, one of the first things she\u2019d done was buy a gun and learn how to shoot it. She now went to the range every week and fired a couple hundred rounds. Her first few times there had been laughable. She\u2019d flinched so hard, she\u2019d barely hit the target. But she\u2019d stuck with it, and now, while she\u2019d never be a sharpshooter, she was confident she could at least hold her own long enough to get away. Unless her enemy was a vampire. But in that case, she figured nothing would save her anyway.</p><p>She racked the slide, putting a round in the chamber, then dropped the magazine and filled it, giving her a total of eleven rounds. She replaced the mag with a hard slap, just as she\u2019d been taught, then slipped it into the bellyband. Once she\u2019d yanked on her clothes\u2014a pair of torn jeans, a heavy, long-sleeved T-shirt, and a dark gray fleece hoodie, along with the black Chucks she\u2019d had on earlier\u2014the small 9mm was undetectable to anything but a pat-down.</p><p>Other than the gun, she didn\u2019t take much with her on these recon forays. A notebook and pen, her ID and transit pass, and enough money for a cab, just in case, plus a small bottle of water and an energy bar. Experience had taught her that she could sometimes be stuck somewhere a long time, unable to move without giving her position away. She shoved it all into a small backpack, then checked the time again. Nearly 2:00 P.M. It was later than she liked, but there was still plenty of time.</p> <p>She\u2019d discovered early on that her best chances for sneaking up on the holding pens was during the day when the vamps were sound asleep. They hired human guards, but the humans had clearly been told that their job was to keep the women in rather than everyone else out, so they paid very little attention to what was happening on their own perimeter.</p><p>Besides, Sid had become quite proficient at blending into her environment. She could put on a sexy dress and high heels to seduce Aden, or she could pull on a pair of raggedy jeans and some scuffed Chucks to become just another teenager making her way in a rough neighborhood. She took the train, tucking her braid of red hair down the back of her sweatshirt, pulling up the hood, and adding a baseball cap to better conceal herself before disembarking. She\u2019d been enough of a thorn in the slavers\u2019 sides that at least some of them would know her on sight.</p><p>The house she was headed to was in Woodlawn not far from Jackson Park, and only a short distance from Lake Michigan. She actually knew of at least one shipment of slaves that had been moved by boat. She didn\u2019t know where they\u2019d gone after that, because she\u2019d had little luck tracking any of the captive women beyond Chicago. She only knew for sure that her suppositions about the extended network were correct because of Janey\u2019s personal experience.</p><p>Keeping her head down as she got off the train, Sid made her way to the street she needed. Her target was a fifties era, single-story house, with a broad, covered porch. She walked by the first time without slowing, continued down two full blocks, then crossed the street and did a second pass on the opposite side of the street. Most of the houses in this neighborhood had been replaced by large apartment buildings, which was a bit of good luck. She couldn\u2019t hang around too long without the wrong people noticing her, but there was enough tenant turnover in the surrounding apartments that it gave her a little bit of cover.</p><p>Her initial walk-by told her the house she wanted was being guarded by two thuggish-looking guys. They didn\u2019t do much, just sat on the porch, chairs kicked back, and watched the street. It said something about the neighborhood that no one gave them a second look, even though they were obviously armed and didn\u2019t try to hide it. Holding her cell phone and pretending to carry on a conversation, she snapped several pictures of the guards, including a few that zoomed in on their guns, just for the record. Illinois had some of the strictest gun laws in the country, but that didn\u2019t mean no one ever broke them. The police would be no more interested in the guns than the neighbors were, which meant not at all.</p><p>She kept walking. This was the hardest part, when her back was to the guards. It would look too suspicious for her to keep glancing over her shoulder, but she was always waiting for the attack to come. For a hard hand to grab her shoulder or a shot to ring out.</p><p>She reached the end of the block with a sigh of relief. There wasn\u2019t much traffic, but she looked both ways, and as she did, she saw a third guard appear from the back of the house. He walked down the cracked concrete driveway, exchanged a few words with the porch sitters, and then exchanged places with one of them, who then disappeared into the back.</p><p>A total of three guards. That was doable, especially since Sid wasn\u2019t planning on being a hero. There\u2019d be no breaking and entering, no sneaking in to free the prisoners, and sure as hell no big shootout in the middle of the day. But she wasn\u2019t going to limit herself to standing across the street, either. Today\u2019s trip was all about recon, which meant she had to get close enough to verify that there really were captives inside the house.</p><p>She\u2019d made that mistake early on, rushing off to report her findings to the police, only to have them discover an empty house and no sign that anyone had ever been there. Sid had been sure she had the right house, but it had been nothing but a decoy. She\u2019d later learned that this was the slavers\u2019 modus operandi. But that incident was part of the reason why the police didn\u2019t give much credence to her reports anymore.</p><p>For the next phase of her recon, she circled around the block and cut through a second apartment complex that stood behind the small house. This late in the day, the sunlight barely penetrated the narrow space between the several buildings. With her dark gray hoodie, she had plenty of cover to stand and observe the slavers\u2019 back yard. The third guard was there, sitting on a battered aluminum lawn chair and looking bored out of his mind. At one point, she was pretty sure his eyes drifted closed, but she didn\u2019t make her move until he got up and cruised back around the left side of the house to rotate guard duty with his buddies on the porch.</p><p>Moving quickly, Sid slipped over the ancient and drooping chain-link fence bordering the property, and hurried across the mostly dirt yard and up to the right side of the house, which was covered in prickly and neglected holly bushes. She remained still until the new guard was settled on the lawn chair, forcing herself to wait even longer, until there was a good chance he\u2019d grown complacent and bored. And then, hugging the right side of the house, trying to avoid getting her clothes snagged on half-dead holly branches, she moved from window to window. She always hoped for a torn window shade, or a gap in the curtain, something to give her a glimpse inside, but that rarely happened. And today, as usual, the house was buttoned up tight.</p><p>She\u2019d never been inside this house, but real estate websites were full of information, if one knew what to look for. She knew the house had three bedrooms, two on the side where she was now, and a third at the end of a short hallway. The windows on the other bedroom faced the back yard which made them too dangerous to sneak a look at. The lawn-chair guard was absent during the changeover, but walking up to the house in plain sight was too much risk for too little payoff. Sid had no doubt what they\u2019d do to her if she was caught. These were the people who\u2019d killed Janey, and although her father\u2019s name protected her from the vampires at the top, their street thug guards might not check her credentials before killing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hopefully, she\u2019d find what she was looking for in one of the two bedrooms above the holly bushes. She paused beneath the window closest to the front of the house. She couldn\u2019t see what was inside, but people were rarely silent. She listened intently, but there was nothing. Not the scrape of a foot, not a single whimper or cry. Sighing, she crept through the prickly bushes to the second bedroom and stood up just enough to see that this window, too, was sealed off tightly. It was as if they didn\u2019t want any bit of sunlight to creep in, as if . . . She froze as a horrible thought occurred to her. What if there weren\u2019t slaves in the house at all? What if it was nothing but vampires?</p><p>Her heartbeat kicked into panic mode as she checked her watch. Nearly 4:00 P.M., and this was December. Days were short, nights were long. She\u2019d actually counted on the early darkness to help her slip away after her little recon. But if those were vampires in there, she had to make like the birds and get the fucking flock out of there right now.</p><p>Sid forced herself to move carefully, ignoring the old fight-or-flight instinct that was telling her to Run! Now! She kept telling herself she had time. Sunset had to be at least half an hour away, and if the vamps were at all like people, they wouldn\u2019t jump up and be ready. Didn\u2019t they have to pee like everyone else? Brush their teeth or something? She rolled her eyes and concentrated on the important stuff, like remembering how long she\u2019d been lurking in the bushes, and how long since the guards had made their last switch. Glancing toward the front of the house, she considered slipping out through the front yard instead. The covered porch where the guards sat had an old railing around the open sides and more of the unruly holly bushes. It was just possible she could sneak past them and blend into the shade of the big apartment building next door. That was certainly a better alternative than risking a dash across the wide-open back yard with the guard sitting right there and nothing moving but her.</p> <p>The weak winter sun was fading fast, the shadows growing deeper. And the more she thought about slinking through the front yard, the better it sounded.</p><p>She shrugged out of her hoodie, put the ball cap in her backpack, then tightened the straps until it lay flush with her back. Donning the hoodie once more, she zipped it fully and yanked the hood up over her hair, with her braid tucked inside. Then she got down on the ground and crawled along the base of the house until she reached the edge of the porch. On this side of the house there was an open lattice along the base of the porch that let her see the underside of it. It was dark in there, and it smelled wet and rotten, not like something recently dead, but maybe something long-ago dead that was taking its time to decay completely. She briefly thought about hiding in there, but realized that the noise she\u2019d make breaking through the latticework would alert everyone to her presence. She shuddered in relief, then froze when she heard the guards talking.</p><p>\u201cWhat time\u2019s the sun go down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. When it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we wait \u2019til they come out? I ain\u2019t sure I wanna hang around that long. What if they wake up hungry, man?\u201d</p> <p>The guard snorted. \u201cYou rather they hunt you down for not doing the job they paid you for? You don\u2019t want these fuckers coming after you, bro. Besides, they like the women better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the women. Think they\u2019ll share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask too many questions. Better you sit there and shut up.\u201d</p><p>Sid heard all of this with a mixture of fear and triumph. She shivered at the idea that some of Klemens\u2019s old vampires were sleeping only a few feet away. But at the same time, there was a zing of vindication in discovering she\u2019d been right about the slaves being held here.</p><p>Now, if only she could persuade the police to do something before the vamps and their captives were long gone. She sighed in frustration, then had a sudden thought. She\u2019d seen the flash of rage in Aden\u2019s dark eyes when she\u2019d told him about Klemens\u2019s slave trade. She hadn\u2019t imagined that. He might not want her involved, but his reaction had been real.</p><p>On a whim, she pulled out her phone and dashed a quick text message off to Aden. He\u2019d probably ignore her, but just maybe he\u2019d be interested enough to check it out, or at least have one of his guys do a drive-by.</p> <p>She tucked her phone back into her pocket and looked around. The shadows had grown much deeper in just the few minutes since the guards had started talking. The apartment building next door towered four stories over the small house, casting a long shadow this late in the afternoon. The street lights had flicked on a moment earlier, but they were dim, and it was probably no coincidence that the light closest to the vamps\u2019 house was dark, the lens sporting a star-shaped bullet hole.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>Checking her gear one last time, Sid turned off her cell phone and shoved it as deep into her pocket as it would go. She drew a long breath, closed her eyes, and whispered a prayer to whatever universal forces might be listening, then rose into a bent-over crouch and made a dash for it.</p><p>She nearly made it. A few minutes sooner, and she\u2019d have disappeared into the shadows with no one the wiser.</p><p>But those gods she\u2019d whispered to obviously had a twisted sense of humor, because just as she made her dash for safety, the third guard came around the corner from the back and caught her movement. He gave a wordless shout, alerting the other two guards, and suddenly she had three armed thugs coming after her.</p><p>She ran for it anyway, but the guard nearest to her position, the talkative one who\u2019d asked all the questions, hopped directly over the porch railing and landed only a few feet away from her. Sid was fast, but he had the advantage of height and caught her in three strides. He grabbed the back of her hoodie and twisted, nearly yanking her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doin\u2019, fucker?\u201d he growled and hauled her back against his thick chest. Her hood fell back, revealing her braided hair, and the guard grunted. \u201cWell, fuck me, we got us a real live girl,\u201d he crowed and dragged her kicking and fighting back to where his buddies waited at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Sid recognized the other guard\u2019s voice, the one who\u2019d been the voice of reason. \u201cThis ain\u2019t good. Where\u2019d she come from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSide of the house there. She didn\u2019t see nothin\u2019.\u201d Her captor shook her, his big hand gripping her hoodie so that it dug into her throat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see nothin\u2019, did you, bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta tell the boss\u2014\u201d the reasonable one started to say.</p><p>\u201cFuck that. She\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, you asshole,\u201d Sid hissed and kicked backwards, hitting him in the shin hard enough that he howled. Unfortunately, the howl was mostly anger. He shifted his grip to her hair, grabbing her braid like a rope and yanking her back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be sorry for that, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>The thug holding on to her turned sharply toward the porch, jerking Sid with him. What she saw there didn\u2019t make her feel any better. A man stood in the open doorway. He was average height, slender, with dark hair and . . . eyes that flashed red when he stepped out into the faint light of the porch. He was a vampire, and his gaze scanned the three guards before moving to her and staying there.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaught her sneaking around the back, sir,\u201d the more reasonable thug said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words ended in an unmanly squeak of surprise as the vampire was suddenly standing right in front of them, his hand reaching for Sid. He lifted her chin to the meager light and studied her face.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her,\u201d he ordered quietly.</p><p>\u201cAw, she ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sid fell to her knees, her captor\u2019s grip suddenly going lax as the vamp wrapped long fingers around the man\u2019s throat and lifted him off his feet.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a request, human,\u201d the vampire said. He threw the gasping thug several feet to land choking and coughing on the hard ground.</p><p>She looked up as a hand appeared in front of her face. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, and mindful of his reaction to the thug\u2019s insolence, she chose the path of least resistance and took his hand.</p><p>He pulled her effortlessly to her feet. \u201cJordan will pay you,\u201d he told the others, then hustled her over to the driveway where a late model Audi sedan was parked.</p><p>Once in the car, he backed onto the street with a squeal of tires and then immediately got on his cell phone and punched a number.</p><p>\u201cI have something that belongs to your master,\u201d he told whoever answered, then laughed cynically. \u201cIt\u2019s red, and he had it with him at the party the other night.\u201d He nodded. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Sid started, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you just called, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d the vamp said tersely. \u201cJust sit there and shut up. And be grateful about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrateful?\u201d Sid gave him a disbelieving look, for all the good it did, which was none, because he didn\u2019t even glance at her, much less acknowledge her.</p><p>Sid sat in silence for a few blocks, then slanted a sideways glance at her vampire companion. Now that he had her, he seemed to be ignoring her. Taking a chance, she slipped her fingers into her pocket and withdrew her cell phone. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly whom she\u2019d call, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhatever you doing,\u201d the vamp said, almost wearily, \u201cdon\u2019t bother. It won\u2019t\u2014\u201d He glanced over and amended whatever he\u2019d been about to say. \u201cA cell phone? Please. Who\u2019re you going to call? Buffy?\u201d</p><p>Sid glared back at him, refusing to admit she hadn\u2019t had a plan to call anyone. But she\u2019d no sooner had the thought than the vamp was pulling up in front of a familiar building. She leaned forward to scowl through the windshield as the car came to a sliding stop, but before she could voice a protest, she was swinging around as someone pulled her door open.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Trav said, grinning as he took her arm and half pulled, half lifted her out of the car. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a very bad girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sid tried to slap his hand away. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>He held onto her as he leaned down to talk to the other vampire. \u201cThanks for this, Elias. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Elias shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get back. Tell Lord Aden I should know more after tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do. You be careful,\u201d Trav said, then straightened up and slammed the car door. He watched the Audi drive away, then gave Sid a reproachful look.</p><p>\u201cSid, Sid,\u201d he chided. \u201cWhat did you think you were doing out there tonight?\u201d He was careful not to hurt her, but he didn\u2019t let go, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat I was doing long before I met you,\u201d she retorted. \u201cBesides,\u201d she admitted grudgingly, \u201cI meant to be gone before it got dark, but I got stuck, and suddenly it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood planning.\u201d He started toward the front doors, taking her with him, but she dug in her heels. Trav had the strength to force her, but not without making a scene, and she counted on him not wanting to draw that kind of attention.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in there,\u201d she insisted.</p> <p>\u201cBabe, you stuck your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong, and now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean where it doesn\u2019t belong? I\u2019ve spent months doing exactly what I was doing tonight. This is my investigation, not yours. And\u2014Wait a minute. You already knew about the slaves, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It hit her then how stupid she\u2019d been. Why had she thought Aden would be any different than Klemens? Why had she assumed he\u2019d be willing to let go of Klemens\u2019s very profitable businesses, regardless of whether they were moral? Or even legal?</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, or I\u2019ll scream,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Travis let go of her arm, but not before giving her a truly offended look. \u201cJesus, Sid. You really think we\u2019d have anything to do with that crap tonight? That I would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know any of you, do I? But tell me, Trav, why else did that vamp know who I was, and why\u2019d he bring me here? And why does Aden shut me down every time I try to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s none of your damn business,\u201d Trav snarled, then glanced around. \u201cWe\u2019re not discussing this here. If you want to talk, you come upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Sid frowned at him unhappily. She didn\u2019t want to go upstairs, but she did want answers.</p><p>\u201cFine. But only long enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trav didn\u2019t wait for her to finish, just hooked her arm again and started walking, not saying anything until they were in the elevator alone. He let go of her arm and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, Sid, but Aden insisted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Aden\u2019s upstairs? Let me out of here.\u201d She started punching all of the floor buttons. Trav caught her hand.</p><p>\u201cStop that. Fuck! What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d He grabbed her again, wrapping his arms around her and trapping her back against his chest.</p><p>Sid fumed, but stopped struggling, feeling a little stupid when she saw the row of lighted floor buttons. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a very tall building. The elevator stopped at the next floor, and the one after that, the doors opening and closing without anyone getting on or off. Trav made a disgusted noise, but Sid fought back a grin.</p><p>When they transferred past the guards to the private elevator on the fifth floor, she stopped grinning. She reached up automatically to check her hair and discovered her braid was beginning to unravel. With a guilty glance at Travis, she tugged the coated elastic off the end and forked her fingers into the mess, trying to restore some semblance of . . . well, attractiveness was out of the question, but sanity would be nice.</p> <p>Travis chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You look fine.\u201d</p><p>Sid bit back a retort, knowing whatever she said would only add to his amusement. Flattening her lips, she remembered she didn\u2019t have an ounce of makeup on. She\u2019d been trying to look ordinary. Unfortunately, she\u2019d succeeded. Digging around in the small backpack which she\u2019d removed from underneath her hoodie, she found a sample tube of pale pink lip gloss. It wasn\u2019t her best color, but it was better than nothing. Not even trying to conceal her actions from Trav, she unscrewed the cap from the rollerball end and smoothed it on her dry lips. Trav made a rude noise anyway, but she ignored him, too busy slicking her tongue over her teeth and remembering how many hours it had been since she\u2019d brushed. Note to self: add an emergency kit to backpack with all of the basic necessities. Basic necessities being defined as those things necessary to look good after a couple of hours spent lurking in the bushes and spying on criminals.</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the doors opened on the sixth floor penthouse. Travis started to take her arm, but she jerked away, unwilling to be dragged into the great Aden\u2019s presence.</p><p>The elevator opened onto a small foyer, with a marble floor and a lovely Chippendale table against the opposite wall. A wide hallway opened off to the right, delineated only by the change from marble floor to carpeting, and the door to the offices was about twenty feet down. At the end of the hall beyond the offices was a set of double doors, deep red and highly lacquered. She\u2019d noticed them on her earlier visit, mostly because she was absolutely certain that they weren\u2019t standard issue in the building. They were far too expensive for that, and, in her view, it said something about the man behind those doors that he\u2019d been willing to put forth the money and the effort on a set of doors that most people would never see.</p><p>As she and Trav neared the door to the office suite, Sid started to turn, expecting him to lead her into Aden\u2019s office, like before. But he touched her arm lightly, steering her instead down the hall to the red lacquered doors she\u2019d admired. This close, she could see that while they appeared to be nothing more than decorative, they were in fact security doors of some sort. There was a keypad entry, which Trav accessed, and when the doors closed behind them, it was with a solid thunk of sound, like the noise a big refrigerator door would make, or maybe a bank vault.</p><p>What greeted them wasn\u2019t a vault, though. The corridor continued, but everything else was different. The carpet was deeper, and the walls were painted a warm, sandy beige. There were no more harsh fluorescents. Wall sconces lined the corridor, incandescent and lovely, casting a soft light that illuminated without being garish. Closed doors lined the walls, three to a side, and at the very end of the hallway, a final door stood open slightly.</p><p>Travis guided her to the open door and paused, giving her scruffy athletic shoes a meaningful look. \u201cShoes off, Sid.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in surprise, but complied readily enough. Sid was well-traveled enough to know that it wasn\u2019t uncommon to encounter cultures, or simple personal preferences, where one was expected to leave shoes at the door. She bent over and untied her Chucks before toeing out of them, scowling when she realized it cost her an inch of height. In her previous meetings with Aden, she\u2019d worn high heels. With her feet bare, he would tower over her even more than he usually did.</p><p>She set her shoes neatly side by side on a small, elegant rug to one side of the door, which had obviously been placed there for that purpose. She couldn\u2019t help but note that hers were the only shoes there, and that Travis hadn\u2019t removed his loafers.</p><p>She gave him a questioning look, and he grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and Lord Aden, babe. Just what you always wanted.\u201d</p><p>Without any further warning, he tapped lightly on the door. No one answered, but Trav made a sweeping gesture with his hand, indicating she should go on in. Sid frowned unhappily, but then gave a resigned sigh and pushed the door open.</p><p>She took two steps inside and paused, letting her eyes adjust to the muted light. There were no overhead lights, no wall sconces, not even the elegant ones that had lined the hallway. As her eyes adjusted, she realized this was someone\u2019s\u2014probably Aden\u2019s\u2014personal suite. It was decorated in rich colors of burgundy and gold, with an occasional streak of brilliant blue. An intricate silk hanging covered one entire wall, drawing Sid like a siren\u2019s song, offering her a rare glimpse of ancient history. It was incredibly well-preserved, the threads gleaming with color, and those gold strands were the real thing. Their color was too warm, too deep to be anything else.</p><p>Sid\u2019s mother was a weaver. Her pieces were much smaller than this, but they hung in small galleries and wealthy homes all across the Northeast. As her only daughter, Sid had been dragged to every decorative arts collection in museums all over the world. Sid knew fabric and weaving. And this hanging was as fine as any she\u2019d ever seen. Even better.</p><p>She stared at the magnificent piece of art, completely taken in by the decadent and bloody scene it depicted. Eastern lords\u2014she couldn\u2019t have said which country, only that it wasn\u2019t the western hemisphere\u2014rode into battle, their horses\u2019 hooves sharp and deadly, their teeth bared and eyes sharp, their swords dripping blood. And at the other end of the hanging, an elegant palace where ladies in dresses of striking color reclined in indulgent splendor while servants bowed and scraped.</p><p>Feeling grubby after her recent crawl through the dirt and bushes, Sid shoved her hands into the pockets of her hoodie to resist touching the tapestry and wished she could turn up the light just a little to see it better.</p><p>She was so engrossed that she didn\u2019t realize someone else was in the room until a deep, smooth voice drawled, \u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>She spun around, chagrined at her own rudeness, irritated that he\u2019d managed to startle her. She glared at him as if it was all his fault.</p><p>Aden sat in a deep, upholstered chair on the other side of the room. The chair was covered in short-napped velvet, its burgundy color rich with gold deep in its threads. A standing lamp was just over his left shoulder, casting a circle of warm light over him, sparking red highlights in his black hair and blazing off his olive gold skin, while leaving his eyes dark and gleaming.</p><p>Just sitting there, he took her breath away. She tried to focus on something else, anything but the way her foolish body was reacting to the mere sight of him, and her gaze fixed on what he was holding. A pile of paperwork sat on the table to his right, and he was holding a multiple-page document, the top pages flipped over as if she\u2019d caught him in the middle of reading it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden made a noise like an abbreviated chuckle, and Sid\u2019s eyes flashed up to meet his lazy stare. He did a quick head to toe scan before meeting her glare with a small smile of amusement. He gestured with one hand at the matching loveseat opposite his chair, and his smile only grew broader when she stubbornly remained standing.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he repeated, his voice flowing over her skin like the finest silk. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought criminal activity was your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d she said, feeling the blush to the roots of her messy hair. \u201cBut as long as we\u2019re talking criminals, I wouldn\u2019t have thought slavery was your thing.\u201d</p> <p>Something changed behind his eyes. Every shred of humor was gone in an instant, replaced by something much colder and angrier. He dropped the papers to the table and stood, towering over her just as she\u2019d known he would despite the fact his feet, too, were bare.</p><p>He reached out and twisted a lock of her hair around one long finger, then leaned in close, as if to share a secret.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Sidonie Reid,\u201d he purred. \u201cSo I will forgive you this once. But never again accuse me of tolerating slavery. I won\u2019t forgive it a second time.\u201d He tugged her hair until the curl slipped away from his fingers, and started to turn away. But then he stopped. As if it was an afterthought\u2014although she doubted Aden did anything without thinking about it first\u2014he said, \u201cAnd for the record, I don\u2019t need you or anyone else to tell me what\u2019s going on in my city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour city?\u201d she managed to say.</p><p>Aden\u2019s lip curled into a crooked smile. \u201cMy city. My territory. It\u2019s only a matter of time. And not much more of that.\u201d</p> <p>Sid thought privately that his arrogance knew no bounds, but she kept that to herself, saying instead, \u201cSo, that vampire Elias, the one who brought me here, he\u2019s one of yours?\u201d</p><p>Aden regarded her skeptically, clearly deciding whether to answer her question or not. \u201cElias belonged to Klemens,\u201d he said, still studying her as if trying to figure out what angle she was working. \u201cKlemens\u2019s people now belong to no one, other than Lucas who holds their lives until a new lord claims the territory. Elias knows who\u2019s going to win this battle and is being useful in hopes of gaining favor. Eventually, he will be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already knew about the slaves when I talked to you the other night, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected, which is why Elias was there tonight. Fortunately for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you saying something? You know how important this is to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d he asked archly.</p> <p>She felt suddenly foolish in having assumed he would have found out about Janey, and that he\u2019d know what she\u2019d been doing since her friend\u2019s death and why. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last several months trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him angrily. Why couldn\u2019t he ever be up front with her? Why was he always with the games? \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Aden gave her a devastating smile. \u201cThat may be,\u201d he said, closing the fingers of one hand over her hip and drawing her closer. \u201cBut you want me.\u201d He glanced over her head, and she started to turn, thinking someone was there, but then she heard the door close and lock with a quiet snick of sound. She looked up and met his eyes in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d he whispered against her ear, his breath a fan of warm air against her skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he began, depositing a row of butterfly soft kisses along her brow and down to her cheek, \u201cthat when you lie, your heart beats faster?\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s heart was pounding against her ribs.</p> <p>\u201cYour pulse speeds up.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse was throbbing like a tiny creature trapped inside her artery.</p><p>\u201cYour breathing grows shallow.\u201d</p><p>She was going to faint if she didn\u2019t manage to draw more oxygen soon.</p><p>\u201cAnd you sweat.\u201d Sid\u2019s gaze flashed up to meet his. \u201cJust a tiny bit,\u201d he amended, and his tongue darted out to taste her skin.</p><p>\u201cAltogether\u2014\u201d He kissed each corner of her mouth, then touched his lips to hers. \u201cIt tells me you just lied when you said you don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Sid swallowed hard. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, still fighting for breath, \u201cyou\u2019re attractive, maybe unusually so, but I don\u2019t want to want you, and that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>His arm slipped around her waist, pulling her flush against his hard body. And, oh God, it was so very hard. Everywhere. Her hands ached to touch, to stroke her fingers over the ridges of muscle she could feel pressed against her stomach, to squeeze the thick pads of his chest and shoulders that were straining the soft cotton of the long-sleeved black T-shirt he was wearing. She bit her lower lip, her eyes closing of their own volition as she imagined slipping her hand beneath the zipper of his low-slung jeans, her fingers wrapping around the solid length of him, imagined the velvet glide of his skin as she pumped\u2014</p><p>\u201cSome women,\u201d he murmured, his dark voice a burr of sound that rubbed along her every nerve, \u201cwant what\u2019s not good for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he growled in warning.</p><p>She looked up at him and found his nearly-black eyes limned in deep blue, the color more of a light than a tint. They were so beautiful, and his face was so very handsome, that she reached up without thinking and touched his cheek. It was softer than she\u2019d expected. Rough where his beard was already stubbled, but silky smooth above that. He blinked slowly, long, black lashes coming down to shadow his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou could have any woman in the city. Why me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with heat and something else . . . victory. \u201cI like redheads.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie started to pull away, pissed that her only attraction to him was something so shallow. He laughed at her efforts, holding her fast and not letting go.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThen answer the same question. Why me?\u201d</p><p>Sid looked up at him in surprise. This arrogant, confident, powerful creature . . . and he needed to ask her that? She stared at his perfect face with its sensuous mouth and chiseled cheekbones. His extraordinary eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d he crooned, and then he was kissing her. There were no more teasing brushes of his lips. His mouth came down hard, crushing her lips against his. It was passionate and sensuous, a demand and a claiming all at once. Sid lost herself for a moment in the force of that kiss. She clung to him, her fingers clenched in the fabric of his T-shirt, and she felt . . . things. Emotions and desires she\u2019d never experienced with any other man. Things she\u2019d read about, but never thought to feel for herself.</p><p>His hand slipped from her waist to cup the curve of her butt, lifting her up until the thick bulge of his erection was nestled in the vee of her thighs, taunting her with its presence so close to where she wanted him, where she needed him. Sid moaned softly, rubbing the unaccustomed ache between her legs against the temptation of his cock.</p><p>As if her soft moan had been the trigger he was waiting for, Aden swung her up into his arms, and, holding her tightly, his fingers tangled in her hair and tugging her head back to make her mouth available to his kiss, he strode across the room to a closed door she hadn\u2019t noticed before.</p><p>She felt the magic this time\u2014maybe because he was holding her so close to his chest\u2014but she felt the frisson of energy as he exerted his will, as the door swung open at his command. He walked through without stopping, the door slamming behind them, sealing her inside with this dangerous, sexy vampire. Sid shivered in equal parts fear and excitement, her eyes going wide when Aden looked down at her with fangs bared for the first time since she\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me, Sidonie?\u201d he asked, though he didn\u2019t seem bothered by the prospect.</p><p>She nodded, not admitting that what she felt was nothing as simple as fear.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he growled. \u201cNow tell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>Sid closed her eyes, unwilling to admit she was more aroused than she\u2019d ever been in her life. He was already too damn arrogant by half. He didn\u2019t need any more ego stroking. But then he bent his head and kissed her once again, his tongue exploring every inch of her mouth. She couldn\u2019t stifle the groan of desire that started somewhere in her gut and rolled out of her throat. She\u2019d never wanted anyone as much as she wanted him.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded, nipping at her lower lip sharply enough that she was certain he\u2019d drawn blood. \u201cOr I\u2019ll take you back out there and tell Trav to drive you home.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed open. He wouldn\u2019t. But his expression said very clearly that he most certainly would.</p><p>Sid wrapped her fingers around the back of his neck and tugged hard on the ends of his hair, trying to gain some small measure of control. He bared his teeth at her in a snarl and started to turn back toward the door to the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cI want you!\u201d she said before she could stop herself and felt her entire body heat with embarrassment. At least the parts that weren\u2019t already burning up with lust. \u201cI want . . .\u201d Sid didn\u2019t know how to say what she wanted him to do to her, or couldn\u2019t say it out loud. \u201cI want you,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Aden tugged her head back, baring her neck. He lowered his head, and his lips skimmed along the curve of her jaw and lower, until she felt the kiss of his teeth on her neck, his breath warm and moist, his voice a rumble of sound when he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Sid felt herself falling then gasped in surprise when he dropped her onto a bed she hadn\u2019t even noticed. She sat up, trying to take it all in, when Aden yanked off his T-shirt, and she suddenly couldn\u2019t look at anything else. There was nothing in this room, nothing in her lifetime of experience, that was more beautiful than the magnificent male standing in front of her and stripping away his clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tossed his T-shirt to one side, and Sid could only stare at the play of smooth muscle over his chest, the power of his shoulders and arms. She saw with some surprise that he had identical tattoos on both arms, dark bands that circled the thick muscles of his biceps. He started on the buttons of his 501s, and her gaze lowered, taking in the rippled abs and flat belly, the line of silky hair arrowing down to . . . The blood left her brain when he slipped the last button and shoved his pants down past narrow hips. Her imagination hadn\u2019t done him justice. His cock was long and thick and hard, proudly jutting upward as he stalked toward the bed, his eyes lit with that blue-moon glow again, his fangs white and gleaming.</p><p>Sid tried to scoot back, but he struck with snakelike speed, grabbing her ankle and drawing her closer before climbing onto the bed and straddling her still fully-clothed body. He didn\u2019t bother taking off her hoodie; he simply yanked the two sides open, breaking the zipper, then gripped her heavy T-shirt in both hands and, with a powerful flex of his arms, tore it down the middle. He paused briefly then, his hot gaze taking in her blue satin bra and the curve of her breasts pushing out of the top. A strange little smile crossed his face as he slipped a finger under one of the straps and tugged it over her shoulder, then shoved the bra cup down until her nipple was exposed, flushed and hard. His eyes lifted to meet hers, his look smoldering and heavy lidded at this undeniable evidence of her arousal. Heavy lashes came down to cover his eyes as he leaned over and took the traitorous nipple into his mouth, swirling his tongue around in a wet caress. Sid\u2019s moan of pleasure turned into a startled gasp when his teeth closed over the swollen bud, biting down until she could feel the sharp edge of his fangs. She looked down, scraping her nails through the back of his hair, and found him watching her over the curve of her breast, his gaze filled with something wicked, something out of control that dared her to stop him.</p><p>Sid could only moan, too overwhelmed by sensation to think rationally. She wanted to grab him by the hair and yank him away from her breasts, to pull her torn clothes together and run for her life. But even more than that, she wanted him to suckle the other breast in its lonely cocoon of blue satin, wanted to know what it would be like just once to make love to a man, a vampire, who could make her feel such intense pleasure with nothing but his mouth. Her brain couldn\u2019t begin to conjure what the rest of him could do to her.</p> <p>With a final swirl of his tongue, Aden released her breast and sat back, reaching for the zipper to her pants. Fearful that he\u2019d destroy them the way he had her T-shirt, she grabbed for the zipper herself. But he pushed her hands away with an evil-sounding chuckle, and taking slow, exaggerated care\u2014so slow that she began to wish he\u2019d simply rip them off\u2014he slid the zipper down and stripped her jeans away, exposing the blue satin thong that matched the bra.</p><p>Aden eyed the tiny blue triangle briefly before hooking his fingers into the narrow bands to either side and snapping them like thread. Sid\u2019s entire body blushed when he fisted the now useless piece of blue satin and tossed it over his shoulder before running his big hands up the insides of her thighs and pushing her legs apart, baring her aching sex to his hot stare. She moaned, uncomfortable with such unaccustomed exposure, and tried to close her legs. Aden gave a warning growl and bent her knees toward her chest, pushing her thighs wider apart and opening her even further to his scrutiny. Fixing her with a scorching stare, he dipped one thick finger between the swollen lips of her pussy and found her slick with arousal. His sensuous lips curved with satisfaction as he slid his finger up and down, smearing her wetness over and around her clit, tormenting her with slight touches that had her thrusting against his fingers, her hands gripping his forearms as she cried for more. And then, as if to torture her, he took his hand away altogether, and while Sid was still trembling, while her clit was still begging for his touch, he brought his finger to his mouth, and, holding her captive with his hot gaze, he tasted the proof of her arousal, sucking his finger as if to get every last drop.</p><p>Sid closed her eyes against the sight, her head thrashing from side to side as she swore in frustration. He moved in close once more, and she felt the hard brush of his cock over her wetness. Her eyes flashed open, her thighs closing around his hips as she reached for him, certain he\u2019d fuck her at last. But instead, without saying a word, and without releasing her from his stare, the sadistic bastard reached down, grasped his cock, and began pumping it slowly.</p><p>Sid groaned at the sight of this beautiful male, golden skin stretched over sweeps of elegant muscle, dark hair tangled and messy, his eyes no longer the blue of moonlight, but the searing blue of lightning before it strikes. There he sat between her thighs, stroking himself, the very picture of masculine perfection.</p><p>And she wanted him like she\u2019d never wanted anything or anyone in her life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, habibi?\u201d he crooned</p><p>Sid nearly sobbed with relief at the question. \u201cYou,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Aden\u2019s sexy mouth curled into a satisfied smile. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head curiously. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Sid mewed a wordless protest. He knew what she wanted, but he was still waiting, watching her with that smug look on his face, while all the while his strong fingers stroked up and down his shaft, the muscles in his arm bunching and releasing . . .</p> <p>\u201cI want you to fuck me,\u201d she muttered, knowing that\u2019s what he wanted her to say, that he wouldn\u2019t settle for some pretty euphemism.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Aden moaned, eyes closed, head thrown back as he pumped himself.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Fuck me!\u201d she demanded loudly, worried that he was mulish enough to jerk himself off right in front of her, just to make his point. But she needn\u2019t have worried.</p><p>He was on her before she\u2019d finished speaking, pressing her against the bed, his hips spreading her thighs wide apart, and his cock plunging balls-deep into her slick sex. He fucked her fast and hard, giving her no time to come to grips with his size, no slow buildup to the overwhelming thrill of his thick shaft filling her beyond what she\u2019d thought possible. He pumped in and out, forcing the quivering tissues of her inner walls to accommodate him, taking her just to the point of discomfort before pulling out and starting all over again. And all the while, his eyes were locked with hers, keeping himself propped up, his arms straight, gorgeous muscles straining as his hips pumped between her thighs.</p><p>Sid grasped his arms, holding on for dear life, swamped by such desire, such need, that she knew she\u2019d drown in a maelstrom of wild emotions if she let go of him. Every nerve ending was firing at once, her skin so hyper-sensitized she feared she\u2019d come if he so much as kissed her shoulder, her arm, any part of her. Her breasts were swollen and aching, the smooth fabric of her bra feeling like a shimmering electrical charge rubbing all over her, instead of the silky satin it was.</p><p>And Aden just kept fucking her, until she was so wet that her thighs were slick and sticky, until the friction of his smooth cock going in and out was so hot that it was a brand, marking her as belonging to him and no one else.</p><p>She felt the orgasm begin in her belly, a spasm of pleasure, a shivering ripple of sensation that spread in every direction, until she felt it in her fingers and toes, her breasts, even her nipples which longed to feel his mouth again. The wave of desire rolled through her, growing higher and hotter, until it stole her breath beneath her racing heart, until her clit was a pulsing nub of carnal heat.</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she gasped and flexed her hips upward to meet his thrusts, rubbing herself against him, desperate to relieve the terrible aching need, to release the orgasm that he was denying her.</p> <p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he growled, and she looked up to see his fangs pressing against the fullness of his lower lip.</p><p>Sid\u2019s eyes widened as she struggled to think. Sex equaled blood for a vampire. How many times had she been warned about that? Her breathing grew choppy, her pulse dancing counterpoint to her clit. She thought about those sharp fangs slicing through her skin and into her vein, about her blood rushing down Aden\u2019s throat, the strong column of his neck as he swallowed, his head thrown back, eyes closed in ecstasy. And she nearly came just from thinking it.</p><p>A small part of her brain tried to say there was something wrong with her. That Aden was right, and she was one of those women who wanted what was bad for her. But good or bad, she wanted him. And she meant to have him . . . now. She\u2019d waited long enough.</p><p>Sid wrapped her arms around his powerful shoulders and dug her fingers into the muscle.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Aden gave her a hooded look, as if to say he\u2019d kiss her when he was ready. But then he lowered himself slowly, his weight crushing her into the mattress, his heat enveloping her. He kissed her mouth, her jaw, and over to the soft skin in front of her ear. His fangs were a smooth, sharp glide as he scraped them over the swell of her jugular. His lips opened, and she braced herself for his bite, but he sucked at the skin of her neck instead, his mouth warm and wet. Sid cried softly, her fingers tangling in his hair as she pulled him closer, as the shiver of erotic sensation grew. She moaned at the first prick of his fangs, cried out as he sliced into her vein. And then the euphoric contained in his bite jolted through her like an electric shock, sizzling along every nerve and fiber, bowing her back while her womb contracted and her sheath clenched around his cock.</p><p>His fangs were still buried in her vein when her inner muscles began a fierce ripple along his length. Aden groaned, and the sound vibrated in her bones as he fought to keep pumping in and out of her heated sex, to keep slamming his cock deep inside her, their bodies slapping wetly against each other. He lifted his head to stare at her, her blood dripping from his fangs, his throat working as he swallowed. He held her gaze as he licked his lips, letting her watch as he savored every drop. And then he dipped his head and kissed her, and she tasted her own blood on his tongue as he began pumping harder, faster, until finally he tore his mouth away from hers, threw his head back, and came with the triumphant snarl of a predator who has claimed his prey.</p><p>ADEN ROLLED ONTO his back, savoring the last few drops of Sidonie\u2019s blood as they slid down his throat. The energizing effect of what he\u2019d already taken from her was like a hot liquid in his veins, warming his muscles and sparking fire in his nerves. He stretched his arms above his head, savoring the burn. Sidonie took that as an invitation and curled up next to him, her head on his shoulder, one slender arm thrown across his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden frowned and moved only his eyes to look down at her curiously. He could see the pile of curls on top of her head and the pale stripe of her arm against his own much darker skin. He didn\u2019t do post-coital cuddling. Women were a source of sex and blood, obtained through a process that was enjoyable for all.</p><p>On the other hand, he discovered to his surprise that he wanted more of Sidonie Reid. Tonight had been like the appetizer before the meal, and he had every intention of savoring the main course. Probably more than once.</p><p>He dropped a heavy arm over her back, drawing her in closer and feeling her relax infinitesimally. For all her appearance of ease when she\u2019d cuddled in next to him, she\u2019d been tense, waiting to see what he\u2019d do. She was not a woman who fucked casually. That he\u2019d managed to draw her in so easily was partly attributable to his skill in the art of seduction, but that wasn\u2019t the whole story. She was curious about him and what he represented. Sidonie wanted to know what it was like to walk on the wild side. She\u2019d been a good girl all her life, and he was the forbidden fruit.</p> <p>Aden hugged her close with a private smile. He was more than ready to introduce Sidonie to the sort of things done in the dark of night. He only hoped she was ready for just how dark he could get.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>SID OPENED HER eyes without moving. She knew where she was, but she wasn\u2019t sure about anything else. Okay, that wasn\u2019t quite true. She also knew she just had the best sex and made the worst mistake of her life all at the same time. She\u2019d fucked a vampire. What was even worse, she\u2019d fucked a vampire lord and let him take her blood. She groaned out loud, and then froze, hoping he wasn\u2019t close enough to hear her. Although, given his penchant for playing games, he\u2019d probably fuck her again just to prove she wanted it. Which she did, because, yeah, it was the best damn sex of her entire life.</p><p>Not that she had all that much to compare it to. She hadn\u2019t even lost her virginity until college, and she\u2019d always dated proper young men of good families. The kind she could bring home to Mom and Dad. The kind who knew which fork to use at all of those charity fundraisers. They were nice, they were considerate, and they always made sure she came during sex.</p><p>Aden? Well, one out of three wasn\u2019t bad, right? Who was she kidding? She was doomed.</p> <p>She sat up slowly, figuring that since he hadn\u2019t reacted to her groan, he wasn\u2019t in the room. She looked around, taking in all the details she\u2019d been too overcome to notice before. The bed was a big four-poster, king-size or better, with damask silk draperies the color of a fine ruby cabernet. Rich, but dark. Kind of like Aden himself. Beautiful and strokable on the outside, but with a soul as black as coal. It made her wonder about his history, about where he\u2019d come from and what had made him the way he was. Just thinking about it made her sad and she gave herself a mental shake. She wasn\u2019t here to psychoanalyze Aden or to soothe his tortured soul. They\u2019d had sex, great sex, but it would be a mistake for her to romanticize it into anything else. Aden was a consummate lover, but she had a feeling he\u2019d be a demanding boyfriend.</p><p>And speaking of Aden, where was his moody self? She listened carefully, but didn\u2019t hear any noise except her own breathing. No shower running, no voices. Thinking about showers made her realize she needed one. There was a door cracked open on the wall opposite the one they\u2019d come in earlier; at least, she was pretty sure that was where they\u2019d come in. She\u2019d been somewhat preoccupied at the time.</p><p>Scooting off the bed, she gathered her clothes\u2014what was left of them. Her T-shirt was almost useless, but it was the only top she had, so she grabbed it along with her underwear, which was . . . darn, also ruined. She remembered him snapping the sides of her thong, remembered the way the muscles in his arms had bunched up . . . and found herself getting warm and sticky simply thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d She considered leaving her destroyed underwear on the floor for the big, bad vampire to pick up\u2014after all, he was the one who\u2019d ruined it\u2014but she really liked that blue satin, and the bra was fine. Maybe the thong could be repaired. Clutching the clothes she still had, she located the bathroom and cleaned herself up. What she really wanted was a shower, but she didn\u2019t want to be standing there naked and soapy when Aden showed up. She entertained a brief fantasy of him stripping down to skin and joining her in the steamy enclosure. She could feel the glide of his wet skin against hers, imagined the play of his muscles as he lifted her against the tile . . .</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d she scolded. This wasn\u2019t like her. She didn\u2019t moon over men, and she certainly didn\u2019t entertain private fantasies while standing in a strange man\u2019s bathroom. Maybe Aden had done something to her brain, put thoughts in her head that shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>That was the easiest explanation, but she wasn\u2019t willing to let herself off the hook so easily. She\u2019d known Aden was seducing her, and she\u2019d wanted what he was offering. She couldn\u2019t blame him now that it proved to be more than she could handle.</p> <p>She put her bra on, realizing only belatedly that she\u2019d have to go commando under her jeans. It wouldn\u2019t be comfortable, but at least she still had pants to wear, and socks. She frowned in dismay at the broken zipper on her hoodie, but did the best she could with what she had, putting her T-shirt on backwards and her hoodie over that. And then she caught something in the mirror that had her leaning forward in dismay. Yep, she had the mother of all hickeys, although, given her fair skin and what she remembered of his bite, she was surprised it wasn\u2019t worse. She knew vamps sealed the puncture wounds with a lick after they bit someone. Maybe that same chemical in their saliva healed the wound faster, too.</p><p>Well, at least it was winter and she could wear turtlenecks without anyone wondering about it.</p><p>Once she was as dressed as she could get, Sid walked out into the sitting room with its gorgeous silk hanging. She looked around for her backpack, but it wasn\u2019t there. That didn\u2019t make her happy, because the key to her condo was in there, along with her ID, her cell phone, her notes.</p><p>She walked over and opened the door to the hallway. Her shoes were on the small rug where she\u2019d left them, so she sat down and pulled them back on.</p><p>Feeling more or less prepared, she headed down the hallway toward the red doors, thinking she\u2019d find Aden in his office. Or, if not, at least find her backpack, so she could go home.</p><p>As it turned out, she didn\u2019t have to go looking, because as soon as she opened the door to the hallway with the elevator, Travis popped out of the office entrance.</p><p>\u201cSid,\u201d he said cheerfully, although without any of the flirting that had been his usual attitude toward her. \u201cLord Aden\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, feeling a little embarrassed. She was holding her hoodie closed, her arms across her chest, but it had to be obvious what had happened in Aden\u2019s bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI just need to get my stuff,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Trav said agreeably and repeated, \u201cLord Aden\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she wasn\u2019t going to get anything else out of him\u2014it was obvious that Aden had given him orders of some sort\u2014she followed him back into the office where she\u2019d wanted to go anyway.</p><p>Aden was on the phone when she walked in, but his eyes blazed as he gave her a long, slow head-to-toe perusal, the kind that said I know what you look like under those clothes. Sid flashed back to a naked Aden staring at her fully exposed sex, her thighs spread wantonly, and a shiver of arousal skated over her entire body. Her breasts swelled, and an aching warmth began to build between her legs.</p><p>Aden gave her a knowing little wink.</p><p>Her face heating with embarrassment, Sid busied herself with a quick perusal of the office, looking for her backpack. If she could only find that, she\u2019d be gone. Then, at least, she could enjoy her fantasies in private.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking,\u201d Aden said. Sid jerked around to stare at him in surprise, but realized he wasn\u2019t speaking to her, but to whoever was on the other end of the line. He hung up without saying good-bye, and Sid thought it was nice to know he was rude to everyone, not just to her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, his voice a sexy rumble of sound.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, hearing herself and knowing she sounded way too chipper.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sidonie,\u201d he growled, giving her a dark look from under those lush lashes.</p><p>Sid knew she should tell him to fuck off, that she didn\u2019t go for the whole me Tarzan, you Jane routine. But that was her brain talking. Her body was going all melty and warm, her nipples hard as rocks, her pussy, which had always been so well-behaved, was wet and hungry, yearning to be filled. Her body wanted him. And her body won.</p><p>She managed to walk slowly, trying to look reluctant, but the end was the same. She rounded the desk to stand before him, getting close enough that their legs were touching.</p><p>Aden stroked his big hand up the back of her thigh and left it there.</p><p>\u201cBe here at seven tonight, and wear a dress. I like those better.\u201d</p><p>Sid frowned. \u201cBut you said Elias works for you. Aren\u2019t you going to follow up on the slave thing? If their guards follow the pattern, those women will be gone by tomorrow night, and we\u2019ll never find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. You\u2019ll only get hurt.\u201d</p><p>His dismissal cut through the lust fogging her senses. \u201cFuck that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this for months. I know the routes, the holding houses, I know the people involved. I know way more than you do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is vampire business, Sidonie. I don\u2019t want you involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already involved, and I don\u2019t care about your super-secret vampire business. You either take me with you, or I\u2019ll follow you there. Actually forget that, I\u2019ll get there before you.\u201d</p><p>Aden released her leg and stood abruptly, doing that towering-over-her thing that he did so well. She thought for sure that he was going to snarl at her and forbid her from going after the slavers. For all the good it would do him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he surprised her by saying, \u201cFine. You want to see how the game is played, you can come along. Just remember, habibi, human law does not apply here. There will be no Miranda warnings, no worrying about civil rights. The only law that will matter is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some delicate flower to be afraid of a little bloodshed, Aden. And I don\u2019t give a damn what happens to those animals.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite trust the smile he gave her, but he nodded his head and said, \u201cThen be here an hour after sunset. You can wear similar clothes,\u201d he added, glancing down at her jeans dismissively. \u201cBut bring a dress for later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I need to bring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like skirts. They make you more accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore accessible?\u201d she repeated, frowning. \u201cWhat does that\u2014Oh,\u201d she said, suddenly understanding what he meant. A skirt made it easier for him to fuck her. Part of her was outraged at the very idea of him saying something like that to her. But then a suddenly vivid image flashed through her brain, a picture of him bending her over his desk, his big hand shoving up her skirt . . . Lust punched her in the chest, and she shuddered uncontrollably. Clearly, her brain was going with her body on this one.</p><p>Aden\u2019s hand on her hip startled her back to awareness. His fingers tightened, and he pulled her flush against his body. \u201cYou should sleep today,\u201d he crooned. \u201cBecause you won\u2019t be sleeping much tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s mouth went dry. \u201cYou mean, because we\u2019ll be raiding the holding house tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, a smile playing around his lips. \u201cDid you think I meant something else?\u201d</p><p>His hand slid down to the curve of her butt before he lowered his head and kissed her, a sensuous tangle of his tongue and lips, slow and seductive. Sid sighed into his mouth, reluctant to let the kiss end.</p><p>\u201cTonight, habibi,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>And Sid didn\u2019t know if it was a promise or a threat.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>SID FINALLY KNEW what it meant when people said they were on pins and needles. That\u2019s what it felt like to her, as if every inch of her skin was being pricked by tiny little pins . . . from the inside. She sat with Aden in the back seat of his big SUV. Bastien was in the front passenger seat, and Travis drove as they raced through the streets of Chicago, going at what were surely illegal speeds, and definitely reckless. This wasn\u2019t some wide open highway. This was Chicago. Even at midnight on a weekday, there was traffic. But Travis had reflexes worthy of the Indy 500, and apparently no fear of death or dismemberment. She only wished she could say the same. Tonight was going to test every inch of her resolve, every ounce of her courage. She\u2019d never confronted the slavers directly before, had always settled for doing recon, gathering information. That was the sensible thing. She was a journalist, after all, not a soldier or a cop.</p> <p>But tonight was Aden\u2019s show, and he and his vampires were definitely ready for a fight. Assuming she survived the trip to the house where the slaves were being held, there would be a showdown between Aden and his guys and whoever was in charge at the house. And she doubted they\u2019d go down easily.</p><p>Even more than the impending violence, though, she was worried that the slaves had already been moved. That the vamps had somehow gotten word they were coming and spirited the women away. But Aden\u2019s man on the inside, Elias, had reported that tonight was the night.</p><p>Despite her trepidation, the inevitable violence, and everything that could go wrong, Sid was jumping with excitement, exhilarated by the prospect of finally doing something real to stop the slavers and avenge Janey\u2019s death.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t enough to leave her taut as a bowstring, there was the vampire sitting next to her. The vampire who only a few hours ago had been balls-deep inside her. Every time he moved, every time he spoke, she was reminded of what it had felt like to make love to him, to have him murmuring her name as he thrust between her thighs. She was almost embarrassed to find herself sighing dreamily, wondering how long it would be before he did it again.</p><p>\u201cHeavy thoughts, Sidonie?\u201d Aden\u2019s midnight voice had chills skating over her skin, his words like warm honey sliding into her ear and down her throat into her belly.</p><p>She shook her head sharply. \u201cJust . . . I\u2019ve worked so hard on this and now . . . it might all be over.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and let his arm, which had been stretched across the seat behind her, fall heavily onto her shoulders. His hand dropped to her chest where his fingers began to play idly along the swell of her breast. Sid wanted to roll her eyes at her own pathetic response to him, her heart racing, her skin heating to his touch. Aden leaned close and pressed his lips to the side of her face. She felt the wet touch of his tongue as he tasted her skin. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that he could sense her reactions to him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have to look to know he\u2019d have a smug expression on his face, and she\u2019d have loved to smack that look away. But, one, she\u2019d already established that she wasn\u2019t exactly qualified to smack anything off of anyone, much less a vampire lord, and, two, he\u2019d stop her before she even got close. And then either there\u2019d be hell to pay, or he\u2019d find the whole thing oh-so-amusing. Neither of which appealed to her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d she asked, trying to think of anything other than sex.</p><p>\u201cThe plan is simple. We go in two teams, front and back, and kill every vampire present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe van will transport them to a safe location,\u201d he said, referring to the second vehicle following behind them. She\u2019d been surprised when they\u2019d started out to see the plain, full-size passenger van in their mini-convoy. \u201cAny injuries among the women will be treated,\u201d Aden continued, \u201cand they will have the option of returning to their homes, or being settled in this country. Either way, they will be well cared for.\u201d</p><p>Sid blinked in surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected that. In fact, she\u2019d been prepared to put up a fight, to demand something close to those very arrangements.</p><p>\u201cYou seem surprised,\u201d Aden murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>He licked her face again. Not a delicate taste, but a blatant doglike lick.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she admitted, rubbing her wet cheek. \u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no tolerance for slavery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d And she did. It was the second time he\u2019d made that point very strongly, and it made her wonder again about his background. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d been born rich, simply because he was rich. She\u2019d told him as much. But what if he hadn\u2019t been? According to Dresner\u2014assuming anything that bitch had said was true\u2014the powerful vampires were all extraordinarily old by human standards. Not because age equaled power, but because those who gained power as a result of their transition to Vampire won every challenge as they took their time learning to use their newfound power. So, Aden could be old. Old enough that he\u2019d been born in a time when slavery was common.</p><p>She remembered the fantastic silk wall hanging in his sitting room. Her mother would have known instantly where and when it was from, but Sid could only guess. Maybe she could get a picture for her mom next time she was in Aden\u2019s room. She smiled ruefully. Might as well call it what it was, the next time they had sex. And please let there be a next time, her body was begging silently.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, my lord,\u201d Bastien said from the front seat. \u201cWhite house, fourth one down on the right, broken street light.\u201d</p><p>Sid was jerked out of her lust-filled thoughts by his announcement. She looked around and found herself back in the same Woodlawn neighborhood where she\u2019d been skulking around . . . was it only the night before? So much had happened, it seemed longer ago.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an apartment house in the back,\u201d she told them. \u201cYou can sneak in through\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no sneaking,\u201d Aden said, cutting her off. \u201cTrav, Bastien,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019ll take the front.\u201d</p><p>They parked two houses away. Sid climbed out after Aden, listening as he conferred with Freddy and Kage, the final two members of his inner circle who\u2019d traveled in the van, telling them to come in from the back. She watched them slip away into the shadows, thinking about her own clumsy spying and wishing she could move with even a fraction of their stealth. Bastien and Trav had already started up the walk. She pushed away from the truck, intending to follow them, but Aden wrapped his fingers around her arm, pulling her to a stop.</p><p>\u201cSidonie, this will not be civilized by your standards. You may want to wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in with you,\u201d she insisted stubbornly.</p><p>He eyed her steadily, and she thought she saw a glimmer of approval in his dark eyes before he nodded sharply and said, \u201cAs you wish. But you will go in last and remain by the door. I wouldn\u2019t want to kill you by accident.\u201d</p><p>Sid scowled, pretty sure he was joking about that last. But she hung back when the vampires climbed the stairs, not wanting to chance it. Her main objective tonight was to be there for the captives afterward.</p><p>Bastien reached the door first, and Sid waited to see if they\u2019d knock and then rush the entry, or\u2014</p><p>One kick, and the door flew inward.</p><p>Okay, well, that worked, too.</p><p>ADEN WOULD HAVE entered first, but Bastien shoved his way through the door ahead of him. It went against Aden\u2019s nature to let someone else take a risk for him, but he was gradually coming to terms with the necessity. If he was going to rule a territory, he\u2019d have to surrender to the requirements of security. Not for his own sake, but for the sake of those whose lives he would hold in his hands.</p><p>Once inside, however, all bets were off. There were half a dozen vampires in the living room as they came through the door, with more rushing in from other rooms in response to the noise. His inside man had told him to expect ten or more fighters, all vampires. The slavers were moving their captives tonight, and that meant the entire crew would be present. Which was what made this night perfect. Aden could wipe out the entire filthy operation with one blow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His power lashed out, cutting through vampires like a barbed whip, saturating the air and spraying the walls with blood. Vampires screamed and died, and dust joined the bloody miasma filling the shabby room. Some of the slavers seemed to recognize him then, or at least recognize the brutal nature of his ability and the strength behind it, but even here he didn\u2019t draw on the full depths of his power. He didn\u2019t need it for vermin like these. And like vermin, they scurried for the back of the house, thinking to escape, but Freddy and Kage came roaring in through the kitchen door, and the fight was all but over. The slavers went down with disappointing ease. This wasn\u2019t like the challenge battles that Aden would fight in the coming days, including the inevitable showdown with Silas. Tonight\u2019s encounter was a bloodbath. None of these vampires had the juice to offer him even a semblance of a challenge. They were puffed-up line vamps who wouldn\u2019t be alive if not for Lucas\u2019s willingness to step in and keep their hearts beating after Klemens died.</p><p>The last slaver made a dash for the hallway where the captives were being kept, intent either on escape or mayhem. Aden was across the room and on top of the coward before he\u2019d gone five feet down the hallway. Grabbing the vampire by the throat, he lifted him off his feet, watching dispassionately as his face first flushed with blood, then began to purple with a lack of air.</p><p>\u201cMercy, my lord,\u201d he managed to gasp.</p> <p>Aden bared his fangs. \u201cShall I show you the same mercy you gave these women? I know masters who will pay to own a gelded vampire. One whose will has been burned out, but who still walks and talks. Is that the mercy you\u2019d have of me?\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s eyes went wide in shock and fear, and he struggled to shake his head in denial. \u201cPlease,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>Aden studied the vampire, not bothering to conceal his disgust. \u201cI think not.\u201d With a quick twist, he broke the vampire\u2019s neck and dropped him to the floor, then, wielding his power with a fine control, he carved into the vamp\u2019s chest and destroyed his heart.</p><p>\u201cAden, what\u2014\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice cut off mid-sentence. He could feel her behind him, but the violence storming through his veins was so great that he didn\u2019t dare turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cI told you to wait,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cI did wait,\u201d she retorted, or at least she tried to. Her bluster failed her on the last word, betraying the fear he could sense making her heart pound, a fear that he drew in like the sweetest air. It made his fangs emerge; it made his dick hard. He wanted to take her right there, to put her up against a wall and pound into her with the blood and ash of his enemies still fresh around him.</p><p>\u201cAden?\u201d she asked, her voice still a little shaky.</p><p>It was too much. He spun around and snagged her by the waist, slamming her against the wall and holding her there with the full length and weight of his body. His cock was a hard bulge against her belly, and he saw her pupils flare the moment she felt it.</p><p>\u201cI told you to wait,\u201d he murmured, his lips right against her ear. Cupping her ass in one hand, he lifted her high enough that his cock fit neatly where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cIs this what\u201d\u2014she swallowed before continuing\u2014\u201cis this what happens when you fight someone?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, letting her see the length of his fangs. \u201cOnly when I kill them, habibi. Only when I drain their blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her tongue darted out nervously, and Aden caught it, covering her mouth with his, sucking on her tongue and closing his teeth over her tender lower lip.</p><p>\u201cSire, there are sirens.\u201d</p><p>Aden kept his gaze on Sidonie\u2019s flushed face. \u201cTell the others to load the women into the van. I want everyone gone in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d Sidonie said, her voice steady as she met his gaze. \u201cPlease. At least let me talk to the women and tell them what\u2019s going to happen next. They probably don\u2019t speak English, but I know Spanish.\u201d</p><p>Aden regarded her silently, then nodded his head once, letting her slide down the wall until she was standing on her own. \u201cYou have the same five minutes, and then you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Rising up onto her toes with a little smile, she lifted her mouth to his and kissed him. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, then slipped away down the hall. She went directly to the second bedroom and opened the door. A chorus of hysterical cries greeted her, and he heard her soothing the women in Spanish, telling them it was all right, that they were safe. Freddy and Kage hurried past, and Sidonie reassured the women again, embracing a very young girl, telling her not to be afraid, gripping the hand of another woman as she repeated that these men were here to help, that they\u2019d take them to a safe place.</p><p>Aden stared at her, feeling something in that moment that he hadn\u2019t felt for a woman in . . . He struggled to remember how long it had been. Centuries. Not since his mother had chosen her luxuries over the life of her only child. Not even when he\u2019d met his vampire Mistress, the woman who\u2019d changed his life forever.</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Morocco, 1778</p><p>ADEN LAY BACK on the pillow-strewn bed and watched the Lady Na\u2019ima finish dressing. He wasn\u2019t supposed to know her name, wasn\u2019t supposed to know that she was married to the second wealthiest man in the province. But Aden\u2019s owner, Zaahira, was a smart woman, and this was her brothel. Whorehouses were one of the few businesses that a woman was allowed to own outright, and they were allowed that only because no man would sully himself with providing such a service. That didn\u2019t stop those same men from using the service. Although if they knew how many of their wives made use of it, if any of them understood that Aden was far more than the bodyguard they thought him to be, those fine gentlemen might have been far more motivated to shut down Zaahira\u2019s operation.</p><p>As it was, however, Aden\u2019s particular set of skills was very profitable for Zaahira. She\u2019d trained him personally, beginning on the day she\u2019d bought him from Hafiz. For three years, she\u2019d kept him as her personal toy, teaching him all the ways to please a woman. By the time he turned fifteen, Zaahira\u2019s female customers had begun to inquire about him, and his mistress was nothing if not a businesswoman. She\u2019d presented the idea to Aden with honeyed promises of money and gifts, but they\u2019d both known if he\u2019d refused, she would have simply ordered him to fuck whomever she\u2019d wanted, and he\u2019d have had no choice. He was a slave. Zaahira\u2019s personal slave, perhaps, maybe even her favorite, but still a slave. The tattooed bands on both his biceps announced his status to the world, including the expensively-dressed ladies who showed up in the afternoons looking for the kind of attention they were never going to get from their husbands.</p><p>Zaahira knew the true identity of all of her carefully-veiled female customers. She made sure of it before she permitted them into Aden\u2019s bed. Not because she cared that much about Aden, but because she cared that much about her business. Blackmail was the best kind of insurance for a woman like her to have.</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t need Zaahira\u2019s files to tell him who the women were, or even why they came to his bed. Half their time with him was spent complaining about their husbands\u2019 many infidelities with both women and men.</p><p>Zaahira had never offered Aden to her male customers. It was mostly because he was too big, his looks too masculine, even when he was younger. Customers who came seeking that particular entertainment generally preferred pretty, delicate boys, ones who couldn\u2019t fight back. But it was also true that Zaahira had a woman\u2019s appreciation of Aden\u2019s beauty\u2014or so she\u2019d always told him\u2014and wouldn\u2019t see him ruined by the kind of brutality those men favored.</p><p>Besides, from the very beginning, he\u2019d been more than busy enough with his rich ladies . . . like the lovely Lady Na\u2019ima. Soft-skinned and doe-eyed, she\u2019d been married at fourteen, and now, barely nineteen years old, she had already been dismissed from her husband\u2019s bed.</p><p>Na\u2019ima finished dressing, pulling a heavy veil over her face before turning to him with a smile in her eyes, the only part of her face he could see. It seemed a ridiculous conceit, since he\u2019d been buried between her tender thighs only a short time earlier, but if his ladies wanted to believe this candlelit room was too dark for him to distinguish their faces, who was he to deprive them of that?</p><p>For his part, Aden made no effort to cover his nakedness or to conceal his arousal. Lady Na\u2019ima ducked her head in embarrassment, which only made him harder. He loved the power he had over his women, loved that he, a lowly slave, could reduce such fine ladies to begging for his touch.</p><p>He gave Lady Na\u2019ima a wide, inviting smile, and he could almost feel the heat of her blush from across the room. She was the youngest of his customers, sweet and eager, and so very compliant. Tearing her gaze away from his body, she pulled her veil even higher and opened the door slowly, checking the hallway before hurrying out and leaving his door open.</p><p>Aden took his time getting up, unbothered by the open door. Living in a brothel made one very casual about nudity. He pulled on a pair of linen pants, tying them loosely and letting them hang down on his hips. Na\u2019ima was his last client for the day. Afternoons were his busy time, his evenings almost always free. The female whores\u2014and that\u2019s what they all were, what he was, a slave and a whore\u2014saw most of their business in the evening, when the fine gentlemen had finished with work and family. They came to the brothel seeking to entertain themselves with women who couldn\u2019t say no, especially if their desire was to explore the more perverse practices. Zaahira gave her clients a wide berth when it came to such perversions. As long as the whore wasn\u2019t left too scarred or too damaged to work, it was allowed... for a suitable fee, of course.</p><p>Aden changed his mind abruptly and stripped off the linen pants. He needed to get out of the brothel for a few hours, needed to feel like a man instead of a whore. By law, he was required to keep his arms bare, his slave bands in view at all times. But he was the son of a free man, the grandson of two free men. And on occasion, he chose to live as a free man. If only for a few hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled on his finest clothing, which was very fine, indeed. On top of whatever they paid Zaahira, his ladies always left him a generous gift, and that money was his to do with as he chose. It was the only money that was his, since he received no compensation at all from Zaahira. She owned him; his labor belonged to her.</p><p>Dressed for the evening, Aden closed the door to his room and headed toward the stairs. He was almost to the door, had in fact lifted his foot to take the last downward step, when he heard the scream. He would often think of that moment later in his long life, would contemplate what might have happened if he\u2019d left a few minutes sooner. But as it was, he heard a woman\u2019s terrified scream and knew instantly who it was.</p><p>He spun on his heel and raced back up the stairs and down the hallway, passing the startled faces of both whores and customers peering curiously from half-open doors. The door to the small room at the very end remained closed, however. Sana\u2019s room. Sana had been sold to Zaahira as a small child and had practically grown up in the brothel. She\u2019d been a pleasing little girl and everyone\u2019s pet, but there was no room for sentiment in Zaahira\u2019s world. When the child had become a woman, she\u2019d become a commodity. Thirteen years old and not even a month past her first bleeding, her virginity had been a rare prize and brought a high price for Zaahira. But Aden knew Sana\u2019s fee remained high. She was very pretty and small and delicate in build. She appealed to men who were looking for someone weaker, someone to dominate and sometimes to destroy.</p> <p>Aden threw the door open. He found Sana quickly enough. She was curled in a corner, sobbing and naked, her back bruised and welted, small drops of blood visible in the welts.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d a man\u2019s voice bellowed. \u201cGet out of here. She\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s head turned slowly. A fat man stood on the other side of the bed. He was completely naked, and in his hand was a thin-tailed whip, stained dark with blood.</p><p>Aden saw that whip, and a haze as red as Sana\u2019s blood obscured his vision. He leapt over the bed and grabbed the fat man, wrenching the whip out of his hand before shoving him to the floor. Lifting the whip, he brought it down with brutal intention, intending to do to this monster far worse than what he\u2019d dared do to Sana. The fat man screamed, but it wasn\u2019t his cry that stopped Aden. It was Zaahira\u2019s voice, her command carrying every ounce of her authority as the mistress of the brothel, as his lover and friend . . . as his owner.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p> <p>Aden managed to halt his downward swing before it landed on the useless bundle of flesh cringing on the floor before him. One thin lash touched the man\u2019s pudgy thigh, making him scream as if he\u2019d lost the leg instead.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Zaahira snapped. Aden met her angry gaze with one of his own, and for a few brief seconds, he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to obey. But then Sana whimpered, and he rushed to pick her up instead, dragging the sheet from the bed and covering her before taking her out into the hallway where all those prying eyes waited. He took her down the stairs to Isabel, an older slave who worked as Zaahira\u2019s housekeeper and cook.</p><p>That\u2019s where Zaahira found him, helping Isabel apply a soothing balm to Sana\u2019s poor back, holding the girl\u2019s hand against the pain.</p><p>\u201cAden.\u201d Zaahira spoke from the doorway, as if afraid she\u2019d catch something if she came too close. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but he was. He\u2019d thought if the brothel owner had feelings for anyone, it would be Sana, a child reared in her own house. But instead, she gazed at the scene with distaste, as if calculating how much money she was going to lose while Sana healed.</p><p>\u201cLeave that,\u201d his mistress said sharply when he continued to help Isabel. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>His anger was so great it threatened to burn him alive. Isabel must have sensed his rebellion, because she reached out and laid her hand over his, drawing his eyes up to meet hers.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, her gaze filled with warning. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, but he gave her a short nod and stood to his considerable full height, drawing a small measure of satisfaction from the quick flash of fear on Zaahira\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cMy office,\u201d she ordered, then marched down the hall, assuming he\u2019d follow. Which he did. Anger still simmered deep in his gut, but he\u2019d lived with that particular fire for so long, he\u2019d long ago learned to swallow it and take on a suitable mask of compliance.</p><p>Zaahira stormed into her office with a swirl of silk and perfume. There\u2019d been a time Aden had lived and breathed for the privilege of enjoying that scent. A time when pleasing Zaahira had been his only reason for waking every morning. But whatever charm she\u2019d once held for him had been lost on the day she\u2019d chosen to rent his body to others for money. Aden had been devastated, even as he\u2019d scorned himself as a fool for believing in the affection and honor of yet another woman.</p><p>After all, if one couldn\u2019t count on one\u2019s mother, why would one ever trust the good intentions of a whoremonger, no matter how prettily she wrapped herself?</p><p>Zaahira poured herself a cup of mint tea, then sat and sipped feverishly, as if she needed the beverage\u2019s calming effect. Since she was ignoring him, he strode over and slumped into the chair opposite hers without being invited. She shot him an angry glance but didn\u2019t say anything, simply continued her zealous tea consumption until the cup was empty.</p><p>\u201cYou put me in a bad position,\u201d she said tightly, setting the empty cup on a nearby table. \u201cRasim Ahmad is demanding recompense for the injury you caused him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInjury,\u201d Aden sneered. \u201cIt was a scratch. Did you see Sana\u2019s back? He deserves\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou forget your place, slave,\u201d she said. Her voice was cold, her eyes hard and uncompromising, and Aden was reminded that this woman was not his lover, not his friend. He was a useful piece of flesh to her, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cConsider yourself fortunate,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe could have demanded your life, but I persuaded him you had other . . . uses.\u201d</p><p>Aden froze. Zaahira had never ordered him to service a man. He honestly didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if she ordered it now. Was his life so worthless that he\u2019d rather surrender it than permit himself to be used that way?</p><p>\u201cRasim Ahmad is waiting for you in the black room,\u201d Zaahira told him with a dismissive wave.</p><p>And Aden forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Chicago, IL, present day</p><p>SIDONIE WATCHED the van\u2019s red taillights disappear as she hurried to the blacked-out Suburban idling at the curb. Aden was already in the back seat, the door standing open in invitation. Or command. One could read it either way.</p><p>Her steps slowed as she drew closer. On the face of it, this moment didn\u2019t seem like much, but it was the point of no return for her. She\u2019d seen what Aden could do, seen the exhilaration in his face when he\u2019d killed those other vampires. Not that she had any sorrow that they were dead. They\u2019d been the lowest of the low, selling human beings for profit.</p><p>But a small voice inside her head kept telling her she should be horrified by the violence she\u2019d witnessed inside that house. And she had been at first. Maybe if the vampires being so brutally slaughtered hadn\u2019t been the merchants of misery they\u2019d been, if they hadn\u2019t been responsible for kidnapping and selling human women and girls. And who was to say it was only human women they sold? Maybe they tossed a female vampire or two into the mix, vamps too weak to defend themselves.</p><p>But as she\u2019d stood there watching in horrified fascination as Aden and his team systematically annihilated the very slavers she\u2019d spent months trying to get someone to pay attention to, her overriding emotion had been one of vengeance met. And it had felt good.</p><p>Besides, there\u2019d been more than violence in there tonight. Aden and his vampires had treated the freed women with kindness and infinite patience. There they\u2019d been: five big, terrifying, capable warriors, and they\u2019d cared for those frightened women as if they were their own sisters and cousins. It had forced Sid to view Aden in a different light. Not as a violent criminal, but as a protector. A powerful male who wreaked vengeance on those who would enslave others.</p><p>Even as she\u2019d had the thought, she\u2019d known she was once again romanticizing the situation. After all, Aden\u2019s competitors for the territory probably weren\u2019t evil people, not all of them anyway, and he\u2019d just as happily destroy them, too. He was a scary guy, a total alpha male who asked for no one\u2019s approval for what he did. He was nothing but trouble, and a very special kind of trouble, a vampire. And she was probably going to end up dead if she hung around him too long.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t stop her heart from racing at the memory of his naked beauty, or the hunger that twisted her gut every time she looked at him. She told herself it was just one more night. That she was tired of being a good girl, and she wanted one more night in Aden\u2019s bed. She wanted him fresh from the fight, bloody and victorious. She wanted more.</p><p>She stepped up into the Suburban without a word. Aden\u2019s fingers closed briefly around her thigh, supporting her as she crossed in front of him to sit behind the driver. His fingers dipped to her inner thigh when she sat down, sliding up until she was sure he could feel the growing heat between her legs. She found herself hoping he\u2019d touch her, that he\u2019d ease some of the ache. But his fingers stopped a hairsbreadth away from touching her cleft where it strained beneath the tight shield of her jeans.</p><p>With a soft chuckle, Aden leaned down and kissed her temple, and she felt the wet touch of his tongue. The bastard was toying with her again. Sid stiffened in annoyance and would have put the short distance available to her between them. But Aden growled a warning when she started to move, lifting his arm and pulling her tightly against his side.</p><p>\u201cBe good, Sidonie,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her lips tightened, but she couldn\u2019t hold on to the irritation. A satisfied grin wiped it away, leaving nothing but anticipation behind. She\u2019d wanted an alpha male, and that\u2019s what she\u2019d gotten. She only hoped she survived the night.</p><p>Chapter Eleven </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ADEN WAS RUNNING on pure adrenaline. The blood of his enemies was soaking the battlefield, while he and his people were unharmed. It didn\u2019t matter that the battlefield was a run-down house in a crime-riddled neighborhood of Chicago. This was the time in which he lived; these were the enemies he faced. And defeated. And this was only the beginning.</p><p>He glanced at Sidonie sitting next to him. He\u2019d felt the heat between her thighs, the way she\u2019d lifted herself to his fingers, probably without even knowing she was doing it. His good girl wanted to be very bad tonight, and he was going to make her wish come true.</p><p>He reached up and pulled the elastic band from her hair, catching her curls as they tumbled over his hand. Grabbing a fistful, he tugged her head backward and took her mouth in a hard, hungry kiss. She stiffened in surprise, but then opened her mouth eagerly, her tongue tangling with his until she snagged on one of his emerging fangs. A drop of her blood swelled from the tiny pinprick, and Aden sucked it up, pulling her even more tightly against him. He was consumed by the taste of her, by the heat of her mouth and the passion of her response. He would have forgotten himself and fucked her right there in the back seat had they not arrived at his building in that moment.</p> <p>He held her hand across the lobby and into the elevator, through the transfer to the private elevator, and down the hall and into his personal suite. But once the door was closed and they were alone, he grabbed the front of her jacket and pulled her to him, crushing his mouth against her tender lips in a fervor of teeth and tongues. Wrapping an arm around her waist, he swung her around and pressed her against the wall. Ripping open her jeans, he jammed his fingers between her thighs, finding her hot and wet, cursing as the tight pants kept him from getting to her.</p><p>\u201cI told you to wear a skirt, damn it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear a skirt to a fight,\u201d she said breathlessly, struggling to get her hands under his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cFuck this.\u201d He swung her up into his arms, strode across the sitting room, and shoved the bedroom door open with a punch of power.</p><p>SID WANTED TO laugh for joy when Aden dropped her on the bed and stripped off her clothes. There was no sexy striptease, no slow peeling away of layers. Her clothes were in the way, and he got rid of them. But if she\u2019d thought this was any indicator of his intentions for how the rest of the night would go, if she thought he\u2019d be on her and in her as quickly as she\u2019d hoped . . . she was mistaken.</p> <p>He dragged off his own clothes and prowled up and onto the bed, his body a study in lethal grace, muscles bunching and releasing in an elegant dance of perfection. His shaft hung between his legs, hard and thick, dragging along her thighs and belly in a trail of velvet heat as he made his way up her body, until his powerful thighs pinned her hips to the mattress, his cock so close to her yearning pussy, but so very far away. He leaned forward and clasped her wrists in one huge hand, stretching her arms above her head and holding them there as he kissed her.</p><p>Sid had thought she was ready for this, ready for whatever Aden would do tonight. She\u2019d expected him to take her hard and fast, goaded by battle-driven adrenaline, expected his kisses to be a demand for surrender. But what he did was far more diabolical. His kiss was a whispered seduction, a hint of things to come that left her weak with wanting. His lips caressed, his tongue danced, stroking her teeth and gums until every inch of her mouth felt branded by his touch.</p><p>And that was only the beginning. He moved on to her cheeks, her forehead, every inch of her skin, tasting and kissing his way to her neck, lingering at her taut jugular until she was trembling with anticipation, aching for the sweet release of his bite. But instead of biting her, he lifted his head and smiled. At least, she supposed one could call that a smile. It was wicked and charming, a warning and an invitation. And before Sid could figure out what he intended, he\u2019d captured her wrists in something soft and tied them to the headboard.</p><p>Her eyes went wide. She twisted around, looking above her head to see that the soft something was a bright silk scarf. Sneaky vampire. He must have had it there all the time. She tugged on the scarf and realized two things\u2014the binding was loose enough that she could slip the binding if she wanted, and she really didn\u2019t want to. She lowered her head and met Aden\u2019s hot gaze, and she knew this was a test. She could escape, but she\u2019d be leaving behind far more than the silk binding. She\u2019d be leaving Aden.</p><p>His eyes held hers, asking the silent question. Sid\u2019s pulse was throbbing in time to her racing heart. She was scared. Of what he had planned, yes, but also of what it said about her that she\u2019d never been so aroused in her life, and that she wanted to stay. She licked her lips nervously, and his eyes snapped to the sweep of her tongue before coming back to meet her gaze with that same challenging look.</p><p>Damn it. With a soft sigh, she surrendered. Consciously relaxing her body, she went soft beneath him, letting him feel her submission.</p> <p>Aden\u2019s eyes lit up, glowing so brightly that she could see the blue shadow limning her breasts, her jutting nipples. With a rumbling growl, he lowered his mouth to her neck once more, and Sid felt a zing of lust that sank from her breasts to her belly and below. A rush of wet heat made her groan aloud, and she struggled against his pinning thighs, needing to spread her legs, to open herself to his cock where it lay on her belly, taunting her with its heavy presence.</p><p>She flexed her hips in silent demand, and Aden snarled a warning, a rustle of sound along the overheated skin of her neck. The blunt backs of his fangs slid beneath her jaw, and she panted eagerly, waiting for the sting of his bite. But he kept going downward, teasing her with feathering kisses on her shoulders, her chest, finally biting her, closing his teeth over the taut tendon between neck and shoulder. But it was only his teeth, not his fangs, and she moaned a protest, her eyes closed, her head thrashing back and forth as she tugged on the silk bindings, wanting to bury her fingers in his hair and force his fangs back to her neck.</p><p>Aden ignored her wordless pleas as his hot mouth closed over a nipple. He sucked and tormented, his tongue scraping around and around until her nipple was hard and swollen. And then he moved on to her other breast, thrumming the abandoned nipple between finger and thumb as his mouth sucked and teased again until both nipples were aching and puffy. Sid moaned, the rush of sensation from her breasts adding to her growing arousal until she thought she would come right there, just from his tongue.</p><p>He took his mouth away, and she nearly cried, thinking he was leaving her on the edge again. But then she felt the scrape of his fangs along the soft swell of her breast, and she held her breath, waiting for the thrill of his bite, swallowing the cry of need that wanted to escape her throat. She looked down and saw two lines of pinprick blood droplets following the path of his fangs along the curve of her breast. And she saw something else. Aden\u2019s back was tattooed, something big that flowed up his broad back and stretched to his shoulders. She raised her head from the pillow, straining to see what it was, but Aden lifted his gaze at that moment, his eyes gleaming their midnight blue as they met and held her stare.</p><p>Sid froze, mesmerized by the erotic sight of Aden in all his magnificence, thighs bracketing her hips, muscles like banded iron as he held himself above her, his eyes never leaving hers as his tongue slowly stroked her breast, licking up the tiny crimson drops of blood, letting her see as he savored the taste of her, as he rolled the small amount of blood over his tongue, drawing every nuance, every subtle flavor, like a man tasting a fine wine. His gaze was raw with desire, and she thought for sure he was finally going to give her what she wanted. He\u2019d taken her blood, and he was blatantly, gloriously ready, his cock brushing against her thighs whenever he moved, smooth, hot skin over the taut steel of his shaft.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t finished with his erotic torture yet. The cool air hit her nipples, leaving them to crave the heat of his mouth, as he abandoned their tight peaks to kiss and lick his way downward, his tongue tasting her abdomen and belly, lingering at the neat triangle of red curls on her mound. Without raising his head, he bent her knees upward, then spread her thighs with his strong fingers, and slid his thumbs into the slit between her swollen lips, baring her completely to his burning gaze. He was so close to her pussy that she could feel the heat of his breath on her aroused flesh. She squirmed in embarrassment, then jerked in surprise when Aden growled and gave her ass a sharp slap of warning, quickly followed by a soothing caress of his big hand.</p><p>Sid blinked in confusion, but not because he\u2019d spanked her\u2014and what else could she call what he\u2019d done? It had been little more than a sting of his palm on her butt cheek, just enough to pink her fair skin. But what confused her was the zing of pleasure she\u2019d felt when he did it. As if the slight sting of the spanking had instantly become a jolt of exquisite pleasure, one she felt over her entire body, a shiver of sensation that seemed to skate along her nerves until it concentrated directly in her clit. She groaned almost unwillingly, struggling through a haze of arousal to figure out what it all meant.</p><p>But then Aden put his mouth to her pussy, and all rational thought fled, swamped by a tidal wave of erotic sensation that literally stole her sight, a curtain of white lightning suddenly filling her vision as if every synapse in her brain had fired at the same time.</p> <p>She bucked against Aden\u2019s mouth, her orgasm building, soaring to unstoppable heights, her womb clenching as muscles contracted, her skin so perfectly sensitive that every touch felt like a caress directly to her clit. Aden\u2019s tongue scraped roughly over the swollen nub, and she cried out, her hands fisted around the scarf that still held her, her thighs spasming as they squeezed Aden\u2019s broad shoulders.</p><p>And then he stopped.</p><p>Sid panted, disoriented by the abrupt shift, blinking in disbelief. Her climax, which had been building so sweetly, so surely, eased back and flowed away, and she wanted to scream. She looked down between her thighs and found Aden watching her, a knowing smile playing around his sensuous mouth as he licked his lips slowly, lasciviously, tasting her wetness on his mouth, savoring it as he had her blood only moments before.</p><p>She did scream then, a wordless shout of anger and frustration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Aden laughed. He laughed! And then he dipped his head and nipped gently at her inner thigh before covering her body with his, sliding up inch by inch, letting her feel the firm glide of every muscle, his fingers dancing over her skin, kneading her breasts and rolling her nipples, until his mouth was on hers, and she was tasting herself on his lips.</p><p>Sid moaned into his kiss, pleading, desperate for the release he\u2019d stolen from her, but overwhelmed by the sheer sensuality of his kiss.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish, shushing her before covering her mouth with his, swallowing her words as his warm hands swept down her body, his fingers dipping between her thighs, skimming over her clit without ever touching it, disregarding her eager thrusting against his hand as she tried to force him to give her what she needed. He ignored that as he had everything else, intent on his own diabolical torment as he slid first one finger, and then two, into the slick opening of her sex, pumping in and out, fucking her with his fingers, adding a third when her pussy proved so wet, so ready for him, that she was almost embarrassed at this proof of her wantonness.</p><p>But Aden didn\u2019t seem to notice, or didn\u2019t care. Maybe that was what he\u2019d wanted all along, to prove to her that she was shameless in her desire for him. Without warning, his thumb grazed her engorged clit, and she cried out eagerly, her back bowed until she was lifted nearly off the bed. She panted his name, a breathless litany of prayer, hoping he meant it this time, that he was finished with his teasing, that her release was near. His fingers continued to pump in and out, his thumb circling the swollen bud of nerves without ever touching it.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her neck. She felt the hard press of his fangs and sucked in a rasping breath. His hips maneuvered between her thighs, spreading them wide until she could feel the rigid length of his cock sliding back and forth between the swollen lips of her sex, bathing in her wetness. Sid wrapped her legs around his back, trapping him there, wanting to feel his thick erection plunging inside her at last, his fangs slicing into her vein.</p><p>He kissed her neck, and his tongue scraped over her jugular . . . but he didn\u2019t bite her, and he still didn\u2019t fuck her.</p><p>Hot tears filled her eyes. \u201cAden,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, habibi?\u201d he crooned, the length of his cock still sliding up and down between the slick folds of her sex.</p><p>\u201cI want,\u201d she gasped, \u201cI need you inside me. I need to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mine then?\u201d he whispered, dropping tasting kisses on her forehead, her cheeks, closing his teeth over her lower lip with a playful bite that was just short of pain.</p><p>Sid nodded. \u201cYes. Yours,\u201d she said, though she would have agreed to anything at that point, and Aden seemed to know it.</p><p>One half of his mouth curved into a slight smile as he reached up and tugged away the silk scarf that bound her wrists. Sid had time to frown, worried that he was going to release her without ever bringing her to orgasm . . . but then he was turning her over, pulling her hips up until her knees were braced on the bed, and her ass was in the air.</p><p>Grabbing her long hair, he pulled it to one side, baring her back as his strong fingers dug in, massaging her neck, stroking up along the delicate slope of her spine, until he reached her ass where it was pressed against his groin. He lifted his hand and brought it down in a sharp smack against her butt cheek. Sidonie cried out, but once again, it was more pleasure than pain as the sting of his hand sent a jolt of carnal delight directly to her over-sensitized clit, stabbing into her womb until her entire abdomen clenched with desire. She rocked back against his hips, feeling the velvet heat of his erection against her ass.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this, habibi?\u201d he growled, grasping her hips and grinding against her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, more of a demand than an answer.</p><p>Aden bent over her back and reached beneath her to caress her breasts, sliding his hands along her torso to her belly and burying his fingers in her pussy. Sid moaned her bliss, twisting her hips from side to side and rubbing her ass against him. He slapped her other butt cheek, then leaned forward and murmured, \u201cI like a matched pair.\u201d</p><p>Sid threw her head back, feeling the same zing of sensation from his slap, overwhelmed by all of the things she was feeling\u2014his fingers in her pussy, his hard length in the crease of her butt, the unexplainable shock of sexual pleasure that touched every nerve in her body when he spanked her. His thumb skimmed over her clit, and she sucked in a breath, waiting for him to steal her orgasm once again, to wait until she was pleading for release, and then cruelly abandon her. But then he stroked her clit again, and she couldn\u2019t help the cry that escaped her lips as she rocked against him, her heart pounding, her breath rasping in and out of her lungs.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Sidonie,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she nearly sobbed. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>She felt a smooth drizzle of liquid, felt its cool touch as it rolled down between her butt cheeks to caress her overheated sex. She had a heartbeat to realize what he was going to do, to think that she\u2019d never done that before . . . and then he was pinching her clit, and she was coming harder than she\u2019d ever come in her entire life, and his cock was pushing into her ass, filling her in a way she\u2019d never known, filling her so completely . . . He pulled her onto her knees, her back to his chest, his fingers still fucking her pussy, his cock buried in her ass. He gripped her chin with his other hand, turning her mouth to his kiss before he bared her neck and lowered his head, his lips just brushing the skin below her ear before his fangs sliced into her vein with a sting of sensation, his mouth hot as he sucked her blood, the euphoric in his bite lighting up every nerve in her body with exquisite, unimaginable pleasure.</p><p>And it was too much. Sidonie screamed as every part of her body crashed instantly into orgasm, muscles clenching, nerves firing with an ecstasy she\u2019d never known before. She thrashed in his grip, his strong fingers holding her steady as he took her blood, his hips thrusting his cock into her ass, his fingers easing their caress of her clit, as if he knew that the engorged nub could take only so much before intense pleasure crossed into pain. His own climax struck as he held her, his fangs still buried in her neck, his groan rolling through her body as she felt the hot rush of his release filling her, pumping deep inside her until she was limp, and the only thing holding her up was Aden.</p> <p>ADEN PULLED OUT of Sidonie\u2019s sweet ass. She\u2019d been so tight, as he\u2019d known she would be, like a warm velvet glove around his cock. Holding her closely, he eased them both down onto the bed, cradling her limp body in the curve of his much greater strength. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed half-asleep as she smiled and snuggled closer to him. Aden stared down at her, a foreign sensation squeezing his heart. He cared for this woman. She was strong and passionate, innocent in a way that was at complete odds with her fearless persistence in pursuing the slavers who\u2019d murdered her friend.</p><p>And for some reason, she seemed to trust him.</p><p>He let her sleep, drifting into a half doze that let his thoughts go their own way. Vampires didn\u2019t sleep, not the way humans did. Their daytime sleep was far deeper and more restful than human sleep and inescapable because of their vampire blood. But he sometimes found this sort of half sleep to be useful, letting his mind drift over problems and solutions.</p><p>Such as who was left to challenge him, and when would they strike? Silas was the most obvious contender, his only real competition in the field. But there were others whom he couldn\u2019t disregard. His opponent\u2019s chance luck could be as fatal as superior strength. He\u2019d have to meet with Bastien and the others first thing tomorrow night. Maybe the time had come to attack, rather than sit back and wait.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Sidonie\u2019s voice was the lazy drawl of a satisfied woman, and he couldn\u2019t help his own smug smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust that smile,\u201d she murmured, snuggling closer.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to smile?\u201d</p><p>She made a dismissive noise, then kissed the side of his neck, a liberty he allowed no one, but that he somehow allowed her.</p><p>\u201cSo what were you thinking about so fiercely?\u201d she asked, drawing his thoughts away from his own confusing emotions.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe challenge. What happened tonight needed to be done, but it doesn\u2019t change anything. The challenge continues.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stroked a hand over his bicep, her fingers pausing to rub the line of his slave band.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd the other arm, too. It\u2019s like you covered the original tattoos with something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they used to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this chatty after a hard orgasm?\u201d</p><p>He felt the heat of her blush before she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said softly, not looking at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never climaxed that hard before.\u201d</p><p>Aden felt a rush of concentrated pleasure at her words. It was almost like the sensation he got after defeating an enemy, the exhilarating high of victory. But it was a new experience in this context. He knew he was a skilled lover; he\u2019d had hundreds of years to improve on what he\u2019d learned about a woman\u2019s body during his time in Zaahira\u2019s brothel. But he\u2019d always taken the satisfaction of his lovers for granted. He always got them off, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was simply a by-product of his need for sex and blood.</p><p>But not with Sidonie. For some reason, she mattered. She was his. He didn\u2019t know how long this new sensation would last, but he knew that he\u2019d kill anyone who came near her. He blinked in surprise at the intensity of that thought. Huh.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re slave bands,\u201d he told her abruptly, not wanting to pursue his previous line of thought any further, and certainly not with her.</p><p>Her brow wrinkled. \u201cSlave bands,\u201d she repeated, clearly troubled by the concept.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, before she could ask the question. \u201cI was a slave a very long time ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sidonie pushed herself up so she could meet his eyes. \u201cWere you born that way?\u201d she asked, her eyes full of a compassion he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said simply, watching her reaction. \u201cI was sold when I was five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSold. How can . . . by whom?\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her, trying to decide if he\u2019d answer truthfully or not. \u201cMy father,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aden,\u201d she breathed and hugged him tightly, her soft breasts crushed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago, habibi,\u201d he said, stroking his hand down her back, feeling the need to comfort her, despite the fact that it was his story.</p><p>\u201cBut still . . . What about your mother? Where was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re avoiding the answer,\u201d she said, but then caught her breath. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m prying. It\u2019s a bad habit. It comes with the territory . . . investigative reporter and all. I\u2019ll be quiet now.\u201d</p><p>Aden continued to rub his hand idly up and down the elegant curve of her spine. What would she think if he told her about his mother? That she\u2019d given him up, because she preferred playing the whore for his father over caring for her own child. Would Sidonie hate his mother for him? Did he want her to?</p><p>Seeming to sense his reluctance, or maybe his indecision, she crawled up onto his chest and propped her chin on her hands, so she could smile into his eyes. \u201cWhat about the tattoo on your back?\u201d she asked, changing the subject for him.</p><p>He slid his hand down to cup her delicious ass, smiling when he saw her wince in anticipation of another spanking, catching the relief on her face when he only rubbed her firm little butt cheek fondly.</p><p>\u201cThe back tattoo is mine. It\u2019s a phoenix and all it represents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do it on your back? Is that significant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI offended a wealthy man once, when I was still a slave. That particular man liked to inflict pain on those who couldn\u2019t fight back. His preferred victims were very young women. I objected . . . forcefully to his torture of someone. He demanded satisfaction, and my mistress gave me to him in recompense. He had no interest in fucking me, he couldn\u2019t even get an erection, a fact that I\u2019m certain disappointed him. But there are other ways to humiliate a man, and there was always the whip.</p><p>\u201cHe had free use of me for three days and nights. I received no medical assistance and only enough water and bread to keep me alive and able to feel pain. My mistress wouldn\u2019t let him blemish my face or genitals, but my back was so damaged it took weeks to recover. And even then, the scars were so numerous and so thick that I was in constant pain even after I healed.\u201d</p><p>Tears shone in her eyes, but she swallowed hard and said, \u201cBut . . . there aren\u2019t any scars now.\u201d She touched her fingers to the back of his shoulder where he knew the tip of one wing could be seen.</p><p>\u201cWhen I became Vampire, the scars began to heal. It took time, but eventually they vanished completely. Sometime later, I got the tattoo to make a point. My body is mine, and no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a bitch,\u201d she muttered, presumably about Zaahira. \u201cI hope she died old and ugly.\u201d</p><p>Aden smiled in fond remembrance of Zaahira\u2019s death. But that was a story for another time. \u201cI do believe Zaahira\u2014she was my whore mistress\u2014eventually regretted the whipping. Not because she cared about me, you understand, but because I was unable to fuck her other clients while I recovered, and even then . . . it was never the same. Any pleasure I\u2019d taken in the seduction of rich women was gone. I never again forgot that I was nothing but a slave, no matter whom I fucked.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in concentration. \u201cWait. You said you were unable to fuck clients, that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I was a sex slave,\u201d he said harshly, watching for her reaction. \u201cA whore, just like my mother.\u201d He pushed the words out, trying to conceal the anger they hid, daring her to judge him for his past. But, of course, she didn\u2019t. Sidonie didn\u2019t judge people on the actions of others. She rescued them instead.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you hunted the slavers tonight, why it was important enough that you took time out from the challenge to see it done.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slightly.</p><p>She ran a soft finger down over his shoulder, to his arm, and along the black line of his slave band. \u201cI didn\u2019t know vampires could be tattooed. I thought your bodies repaired everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works as long as we mix our own blood with the ink. It takes considerable skill and patience. Kage is my tattoo artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKage is the one with the buzz cut, right? With all the piercings?\u201d</p><p>She indicated her left eyebrow where Kage wore a titanium bar. He also had a tongue stud, although Sid had no way of knowing that.</p><p>Aden nodded in response to her question. \u201cKage is the youngest of my vampires, though not young by human standards. He\u2019s been the go-to guy for some time for all the vamps in Lucas\u2019s territory who wanted tats, but he\u2019s mine, so he goes where I go. Lucas will just have to find his own artist now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wanted a tattoo, but I never got up the nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your skin the way it is. Leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who covered his back to prove it was his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who will spank this sweet ass if you go against me on this,\u201d he growled, cupping her butt cheek.</p><p>She shivered, but that wasn\u2019t fear in her eyes, it was remembered pleasure, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was planning on doing it,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Aden laughed and rolled her beneath him. \u201cHow\u2019s that slick pussy of yours, Sidonie?\u201d he murmured, rubbing his hardening cock against her belly.</p><p>Her eyes went wide in surprise, but then she wrapped her legs around his hips, tightening her hold possessively. \u201cAre you going to tease me again?\u201d she asked with mock severity.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m just going to fuck you until you scream.\u201d</p><p>SIDONIE LAY BONELESSLY across Aden\u2019s chest, exhausted, drained, completely washed-out. Aden had been true to his word . . . several times. She found it interesting that the Vampire virus, or whatever it was, left a male capable of getting an erection over and over again, and yet incapable of actually producing offspring. It was an interesting evolutionary twist, but one her mind was too exhausted to ponder overmuch right at that moment. For now, she\u2019d simply count her blessings that she not only had a vampire lover, but one who had apparently learned the art of lovemaking from the best... even if the bitch had enslaved him to do it. She frowned, not liking that part.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you scowling?\u201d Aden\u2019s chest rumbled beneath her ear, making her smile.</p><p>\u201cI love your chest,\u201d she said, cracking a huge yawn. \u201cIt\u2019s very resonant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResonant,\u201d he repeated drily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s big and deep and so very strong, oh wonderful one.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her butt cheek in warning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re entirely too obsessed with my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your ass,\u201d he said, smacking it lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s very resonant.\u201d</p><p>Sid laughed, sitting up to stare down at him in surprise. \u201cYou made a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the press. Oh, wait. You are the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be front page news,\u201d she said, yawning again as she stretched her arms over her head and cracked her neck from side to side. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked, glancing around for a clock.</p><p>\u201cNearly dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is . . . Oh. Do I need to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded. \u201cThe suite will lock down, so will the elevator entrance. No one comes or goes until sunset. And I won\u2019t exactly be a sterling conversationalist in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she repeated stupidly. She should have thought about that. Aden and all his guys would be sleeping helplessly, while she . . . she could probably do anything she wanted. She could kill them all, and they\u2019d never know. She stared at Aden in sudden alarm. If she could get to them, maybe someone else could, too. \u201cDo you have security? Like guards or something to be sure no one sneaks in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have guards,\u201d he assured her, reaching up to brush tangled curls away from her face. \u201cAnd our sleeping quarters are very secure. We\u2019ve been doing this a century or two.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her throat suddenly too clogged with emotion to permit words. She was overcome by the brutal image of Aden lying helplessly asleep, his muscular body stretched out naked, one arm thrown over his face in complete abandon, while a faceless form, dark and malevolent, crept through the shadows and...</p><p>She shook her head to clear the horrifying picture and felt tears threatening. She turned away so Aden wouldn\u2019t see and was struck by another terrible thought. Oh, no. No, no, no. She could not be falling for him. She wasn\u2019t that stupid, was she? This was supposed to be a bad boy fling, not an affair almost guaranteed to break her heart.</p><p>She climbed off the big bed and began gathering her clothes.</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of here in a minute,\u201d she said, without looking at him. \u201cIt won\u2019t take me long to get dressed. I can shower\u2014\u201d She squeaked in surprise when he was suddenly right there in front of her, forcing her to look at him. He was so beautiful. Evolution had gotten that much right, at least. Beautiful and deadly, the perfect combination for a predator.</p><p>Aden was studying her curiously. He ran a thumb under her eye, catching a lone tear with a gentleness that was surprising in a creature capable of the kind of violence she\u2019d witnessed earlier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come back later,\u201d he told her. There wasn\u2019t even a hint of a question in there. He was either completely self-assured, or just plain bossy. Unfortunately, either way she didn\u2019t have the strength to turn him down. Not yet. She wanted to keep her bad boy a little longer.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAny particular time?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d</p><p>She looked up from where she\u2019d sat down to tie her shoes and was distracted for a moment by the view of a very naked Aden from this perspective. It took her a moment to remember what she wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a usual?\u201d she managed, then laughed at his flat look of disapproval. She stood, going up on tiptoes to kiss his scowling face, her arms circling his neck. \u201cThere\u2019s the no-nonsense Aden I\u2019m used to. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee that you are,\u201d he said, walking her to the door. And then he kissed her good-bye. A full-body kiss, deep and slow and promising all sorts of dark, erotic pleasures.</p><p>When he finally let her go, she had to hang onto him for a bit, her legs were so wobbly. Yeah, she definitely needed more of that before she gave up her bad boy fling.</p><p>She waved as she walked down the hallway, hearing his door close behind her with a very solid thunk of sound. The red doors were equally substantial, and when she turned to make sure they\u2019d closed completely, she found they had already locked behind her. Down the hall, the elevator was open and waiting. She took it down to the fifth floor and was nodding a somewhat embarrassed hello to the guards when one of the men approached as if he\u2019d been waiting for her. He was slightly older, maybe mid-forties and had an air of authority.</p><p>\u201cMs. Reid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she responded, wondering if she\u2019d triggered some sort of alarm by coming down in the elevator when she did.</p> <p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Earl Hamilton. I\u2019m chief of Lord Aden\u2019s daylight security team. Lord Aden said I should introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>Sid smiled. Bad boy, schmad boy. How could you not love a guy who thought about you like that?</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mister Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, call me Earl. Everyone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarl. It\u2019s a pleasure, thank you. I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d A thought occurred to her. \u201cLet me give you my cell number, Earl, just in case I can ever help out.\u201d</p><p>Numbers exchanged\u2014she got Earl\u2019s number, too\u2014Sid made her way to the street and climbed into the taxi which Earl had summoned for her. The ride was thankfully short. At her own building, she rode up to her condo, went directly to the shower, and then to bed. She was nearly asleep before she realized there\u2019d been something . . . or rather, someone very important who\u2019d been absent from the night\u2019s bloodbath at the slavers\u2019 holding house.</p> <p>She reached for her cell phone automatically and called Aden, not remembering until she got his voice mail that he wouldn\u2019t get the message until later, and she simply could have waited until she saw him. But as long as she had him, or at least his so-abrupt-it-was-almost-rude voicemail response, she left a message.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me. We\u2019ll talk later, and you probably know this, but . . . we didn\u2019t get everyone at that house tonight. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She barely managed to disconnect before she was sound asleep.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cWHAT DO YOU mean we didn\u2019t get everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd good evening to you, my lord,\u201d Sid said. She dropped her backpack and walked right up to Aden, smiling up at him expectantly.</p><p>He stared down at her, his eyes sparking blue fire and promising all sorts of retribution, but he fisted a big hand in her jacket, yanked her closer, and then he kissed her, starting out hard and dutiful, but quickly turning seductive and ending with a sensuous flourish of his tongue that left her breathless.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue that later,\u201d he murmured directly into her ear, and she wiggled happily.</p> <p>\u201cNow, what did you mean by your message?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Sid pressed a hand to her chest, still trying to catch her breath. She glanced up to let him know an answer was coming and found him regarding her with a smug look that said he knew exactly why she was having trouble breathing. She rolled her eyes, but he only winked back at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, taking a full breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t see everyone you killed last night, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause some of them died before you made it through the door,\u201d Aden interrupted impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there,\u201d she admonished him. \u201cI think you missed someone. The slave business was Klemens\u2019s operation, but he didn\u2019t do the grunt work. There was another vampire who ran the whole thing, drugs and slaves both. I got the impression he did other stuff, too, because he wasn\u2019t around much, but he was definitely in charge. His name was Carl Pinto.\u201d</p><p>Aden glanced over her head, and she turned to see Bastien coming through the door to the office where they stood. Bastien was the most buttoned-up of Aden\u2019s vampires, always dressed in black, his hair a neat razor cut. He moved with an economy of motion that Sid thought must indicate military training, maybe Special Forces or something.</p><p>\u201cPinto,\u201d Bastien repeated, then shared a look with Aden before asking Sid, \u201cWhen was the last time you saw him?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the notebook out of her bag and thumbed through it, looking for Pinto\u2019s name. \u201cIt was just before the big gala,\u201d she said, half to herself, then found the note she was looking for. \u201cYep. Eight days, to be precise. He was at their place in Fuller Park. It\u2019s kind of a drug clearinghouse for them.\u201d</p><p>Both vampires were looking at her oddly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you lurking around drug houses anymore,\u201d Aden said flatly. \u201cEspecially not in Fuller Park.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m careful. And that\u2019s where they do their business. It\u2019s hard to keep track of them if I don\u2019t go where they go. Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she registered how intent he was. How angry. At her? Why would he be angry at her?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused and a little irritated that he was giving her attitude for doing her job.</p><p>\u201cI understand your need for revenge for your friend\u2019s murder,\u201d Aden told her, clearly trying not to be patronizing and failing miserably. \u201cBut this has to end. If Pinto is still alive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014we will take care of it. These people are too dangerous for you to continue this surveillance on your own. It\u2019s only dumb luck that you haven\u2019t been seriously harmed before this.\u201d</p><p>Did he just say dumb luck?</p><p>\u201cIf not for me,\u201d she pointed out with admirable patience, \u201cyou\u2019d still believe Pinto was dead. I think there\u2019s a little more to what I do than dumb luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting off the subject,\u201d he said, shutting her down. \u201cBastien, if Pinto\u2019s alive\u2014and it seems he is,\u201d he added, before Sid could do more than open her mouth to protest. \u201cI want him found. Get Elias on it immediately.\u201d</p><p>Bastien nodded, turned on his heel, and left the office, leaving Sid alone with Aden.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he snarled, closing his fingers around the front of her jacket again, pulling her against his body and up onto her toes, and holding her there as he lowered his mouth to hers. But Sid wasn\u2019t ready to kiss and make up. She bit his lip angrily and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, trying without success to push him away. \u201cI get the whole alpha male, vampire lord-of-all-he-surveys thing, okay? I kind of even like it in the bedroom. But out in the real world, you are not the boss of me. I don\u2019t forfeit my brain just because we have sex. And I\u2019ll do whatever I think is necessary to get my story. And it\u2019s not like most of what I do is that dangerous. I\u2019m not aiming for Woodward and Bernstein. But I\u2019m not stupid either. I don\u2019t take unnecessary risks, and I\u2019m careful with the risks I do take.\u201d</p><p>Aden was eyeing her with very little expression on his face, which made it difficult to tell how he was receiving her liberated woman speech. Whatever his reaction was, however, it didn\u2019t extend to his body, which was ready to fuck, and no question about it.</p><p>\u201cKind of like it?\u201d he asked finally, one corner of his mouth curling upward with amusement as he focused on the one part of her speech that she\u2019d thought he\u2019d have no problem with. \u201cI think I can do better than that.\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s first thought was that she wouldn\u2019t survive if sex between them got any better than what they\u2019d done last night. But she didn\u2019t tell him that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she insisted, trying to keep from smiling back at him.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cAden\u2014\u201d she began, but Bastien chose that moment to return.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d he said. \u201cElias is here.\u201d</p><p>Aden glanced at her, but anticipating his vampires-only speech, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll sit in the outer office. I want to check some things anyway, and I\u2019ve got my laptop with me. You all have Wi-Fi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Bastien assured her. \u201cThe code\u2019s above the keypad on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d she said. She looped her backpack over her shoulder, but then she paused, pretending a thought had just occurred to her, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to engage your cone of silence device.\u201d</p><p>Aden rolled his eyes, but still managed to give her butt a firm swat as she walked away. What was it with him and her ass?</p><p>She sat down at the desk, pulled out her laptop, and went to work as Bastien and Elias disappeared into Aden\u2019s office and closed the door. What she\u2019d told Aden about her last sighting of Carl Pinto was correct as far as it went, but her full notes, going all the way back to the beginning of her investigation, had all been transferred into her laptop. She had a system that let her track the individual players over time. And just as she\u2019d been able to predict which house the slavers would use for this month\u2019s transfer, she\u2019d be able to see the pattern in Pinto\u2019s movements that would help Aden track the vamp down and get rid of him once and for all.</p><p>She was still hunched over her notes when the office door opened and Elias walked by sometime later. She nodded at him and waited to see if Aden would call her back in. When he didn\u2019t, she wasn\u2019t particularly concerned. Figuring he and Bastien were still conspiring, she flexed her fingers, ready to go back to her own work, but then realized Elias had left the door partway open, and she could hear Aden and Bastien talking. Eavesdropping shamelessly\u2014she was a reporter, after all\u2014she stopped working and leaned toward the open door, listening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c... a concern, my lord.\u201d She caught the tail end of Bastien\u2019s sentence.</p><p>Aden laughed dismissively. \u201cYou know me better than that, Bastien. When have I ever let a woman get in my way?\u201d</p><p>The two males laughed, and Bastien said something she didn\u2019t catch, but she did hear Aden\u2019s reply.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about blood, my friend,\u201d he growled. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t be around much longer.\u201d</p><p>Sid blinked, surprised at how much his words stung. She wasn\u2019t even sure they were talking about her, but she couldn\u2019t shake the sense that they were. That Bastien had been concerned she would get in the way of their plans to seize the territory, and that hers was the blood Aden had dismissed so readily.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have bothered her. After all, it was no more than she\u2019d been telling herself all along, that this thing between them was temporary. Her bad boy fling. So why did it hurt so much to hear him say it?</p><p>She stood and gathered her things. There was no more reason for her to stay. Aden didn\u2019t need her\u2014he\u2019d made that abundantly clear\u2014and her reason for being here in the first place was done. She\u2019d wanted justice for Janey, and she\u2019d gotten that. Or close enough. Carl Pinto was still out there somewhere, but she had the tools to find him. Better tools than Aden had. After all, she was the one who\u2019d found the house last night. She\u2019d find Pinto, and, despite what Aden seemed to think, she wouldn\u2019t be stupid about it either. She\u2019d find him and pass on the information to Aden via telephone. During the day, when she could simply leave a voice mail message. And that would be it as far as Aden was concerned. There\u2019d be no need to humiliate herself further, no need to pretend that there was something besides sex going on between them. Because he clearly wasn\u2019t feeling anything at all.</p><p>Time to let go of her bad boy and go back to her real life.</p> <p>The phone rang as she closed her laptop and slipped it into her backpack. Someone picked it up before it rang a second time. Not that she would have answered it anyway. She wanted no more part in vampire business. She\u2019d already gotten in deeper than she\u2019d ever intended.</p><p>Stepping over to the office, she spied Aden and Bastien deep in conversation. Whatever they were discussing now, they\u2019d gone back to their secret vampire voices. Maybe something to do with the phone call. Not that she cared, she reminded herself.</p><p>Aden looked up the moment she appeared in the doorway. A few minutes ago, she\u2019d have interpreted that to mean they had a connection. Now, she just figured he wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t overhear whatever he and Bastien were plotting.</p><p>\u201cI can see you guys are busy,\u201d she said, with false cheer. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m going to finish this, I\u2019ll need my old notebooks, which are back at my condo. I\u2019ll head over there now, and if I come up with anything, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d</p><p>Bastien smiled, but she could tell by his quick glance at Aden that he was waiting for the boss to react before he said anything.</p><p>Aden just studied her silently, as if waiting for her to say more. But there wasn\u2019t anything else. She was going home.</p> <p>ADEN WATCHED Sidonie as she stood there in his office doorway and fed him a huge steaming pile of bullshit that she apparently expected him to take at face value.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call,\u201d she said, and turned away without so much as a wave.</p><p>He stared at the empty doorway until he heard the ding of the elevator, followed by the sound of the doors closing. Then he glanced at Bastien. \u201cPut Kage on her. And tell Hamilton I want her tailed during the day.\u201d</p><p>Something had put a bug up her ass. He didn\u2019t know what it was, but he intended to find out. If she thought she could dismiss him with a lame excuse and walk away, she had a lot to learn. And he was going to enjoy teaching it to her.</p><p>But not tonight. That phone call had been formal notification of a challenge. Not from Silas, which might have been expected, but from a vampire named Ramiro Salvador. Aden didn\u2019t know much about Salvador. He was from Mexico, which made him one of Lord Enrique\u2019s people, and he\u2019d been at the gathering on Sunday which had officially launched the challenge. Officially being the operative word, since the maneuvering, and the killing, had begun days before... as Aden had reason to know.</p><p>But other than those few bits of information, Salvador was a cipher to Aden, which was never a good thing going into a challenge. Bastien was working their contacts here in the Midwest and elsewhere trying to find out what he could, but they didn\u2019t have much time. The challenge was set to take place an hour from now in Washington Park. Not the neighborhood, but the actual park. It was a big public space on Chicago\u2019s South Side, consisting of several hundred acres, most of it grass and trees, and largely deserted at this time of night. A public park wasn\u2019t the place Aden would have chosen for a challenge battle, but then he had private properties of his own within the city that he could use. He\u2019d been building his network here for some time, well before Lucas had finally offed Klemens. Lucas had tapped Aden to run his Kansas City operation several decades ago, which had put him only a short flight away from Chicago.</p><p>On the other hand, this was probably the first time Salvador had spent any time in the city. Notwithstanding the significant drug trade Klemens had been carrying on with certain interests in Mexico, there wasn\u2019t much in the way of cross-border dealings between vampire territories. Raphael was trying to change that, trying to get the North American territories talking to each other in order to fight a common enemy.</p><p>But that was in the future. For tonight, it meant there\u2019d been no opportunity for Salvador to check out the battleground or set up any kind of headquarters in advance. Even if Klemens had allowed the foreign vampire to visit his city, Enrique probably wouldn\u2019t have agreed. The Lord of Mexico was said to be very old school with his vampires and saw the rivalry between the territories as a good thing.</p> <p>All of which meant that Salvador\u2019s choice of Washington Park was a smart one.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Bastien said, interrupting his contemplation of tonight\u2019s opponent. \u201cI spoke to Lord Raphael\u2019s lieutenant, Jared. We had some dealings last year before his promotion, when he was still troubleshooting for Lord Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded his understanding. The long explanation wasn\u2019t really necessary, but Bastien\u2019s caution was understandable. Vampires were hugely territorial, and a different master might have wondered why his lieutenant had a relationship with a high-ranking vampire in another territory. But Aden wasn\u2019t that insecure, nor did he view Raphael as an enemy. Especially not with what he\u2019d recently learned about the threat from Europe.</p><p>\u201cJared put me in touch with a vampire named Jaclyn who is Raphael\u2019s representative in the Southern territory. She\u2019s been helping Lord Anthony rule the South\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like ruling the South herself,\u201d Aden observed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll play along. What does Jaclyn have to say about Salvador?\u201d</p><p>Bastien shot Aden a quick grin. Everyone knew that Anthony couldn\u2019t hold the South without Raphael\u2019s support. But then, based on what Aden had learned recently about who really killed Jabril, the previous Lord of the South, it was Raphael\u2019s mate who had a better claim to the territory than anyone else, no matter whose ass currently occupied the seat of power.</p><p>\u201cJaclyn knows Ramiro Salvador reasonably well,\u201d Bastien continued. \u201cWith all the cartel violence in Mexico lately, there have been multiple issues related to territorial security, and she\u2019s met him several times. In her opinion, Salvador\u2019s strong enough to hold a territory, although she was unaware that he had any designs on the Midwest. She\u2019s never met you, my lord, and so had no direct comparison, but she did say Salvador was on a par with Jared. And Jared is more than commonly powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be a member of Raphael\u2019s inner circle if he wasn\u2019t. Has Salvador fought anyone else in the current challenge, or is he jumping right to the top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few minor skirmishes during the gala, picking off easy targets. No death matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll be his first then. Let\u2019s get going. Don\u2019t want to make him wait for his own funeral.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>ADEN AND HIS team parked very close to the house where they\u2019d wiped out what was left of Klemens\u2019s slave trade the previous night. Or so they\u2019d thought. If Sidonie was right, there was still at least one significant outlier left to kill.</p><p>The neighborhood they walked through wasn\u2019t bad, especially compared to Fuller Park where Sidonie had staked out Carl Pinto\u2019s drug house. But it wasn\u2019t somewhere Aden had ever anticipated visiting so frequently, either. He\u2019d left behind this kind of poverty long ago. Contrary to Sidonie\u2019s assumptions, not all vampires were wealthy, but most of them were at least financially secure. When one lived for centuries, one had a different view of life and necessity. And what vampires couldn\u2019t earn for themselves, they persuaded others to give them. Once upon a time, they had simply taken what they needed and killed anyone in their way. Modern life demanded greater subtlety, but there were still ways of acquiring whatever one needed, or wanted. And a vampire\u2019s life span put a whole new spin on long-term investment.</p><p>Freddy and Travis roamed ahead as they crossed into the park and entered the shadows beneath the trees, while Bastien walked at Aden\u2019s side. Kage would probably be upset at missing the fight, but he was sitting on Sidonie, who, by all reports, had gone home and stayed there. But concerns about Sidonie were a distraction Aden couldn\u2019t afford, not if Salvador was as powerful as reported, so he put her out of his thoughts. He hadn\u2019t come this far to be undone by a female, not even one he actually cared for. There would be time for Sidonie tomorrow. Tonight, he had a challenge to survive.</p><p>Ramiro Salvador had been somewhat vague, when he called earlier, about the specifics of where they\u2019d meet within the park. Aden assumed the Mexican vampire had scouted the area ahead of time and chosen ground that favored him, but they\u2019d walked nearly all the way to the Hyde Park side before he finally felt the first twinges of the challenger\u2019s presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden pulled Freddy and Travis back, wanting all three of his vamps close at hand before the fighting broke out. It was a common tactic to pick off an opponent\u2019s vampire children in an effort to weaken him before the battle. Aden didn\u2019t want the distraction, but he also didn\u2019t want to lose any of his vampires. He loved them, if not as children, then as brothers. Never having had either, he couldn\u2019t say which it was, but he knew their deaths would pain him greatly.</p><p>\u201cTighten your shields,\u201d he warned all of them.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Three voices answered as one.</p> <p>Bastien\u2019s low-voiced warning presaged Salvador\u2019s appearance from the darkness on the other side of a small clearing. Not that Aden needed the warning. To his vampiric sight, the Mexican vampire shone like a beacon, his power every bit as strong as reported. Maybe stronger.</p><p>\u201cRamiro Salvador, I presume,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are the great Aden,\u201d Salvador responded with a sneer. \u201cYour name was everywhere in the ballroom on Sunday. The fools are all saying you\u2019ll be the next Lord of the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>Aden dipped his head in acknowledgement, already bored with the theatrics.</p><p>\u201cI even saw you kissing Raphael\u2019s ass, making nice with his woman, for all the good it will do you. It\u2019s not Raphael who will decide this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Aden conceded, unconcerned. \u201cBut you\u2019re a fool if you think he can\u2019t affect the outcome.\u201d</p><p>Salvador bristled at the sideways insult, just as Aden had intended. The Mexican\u2019s power was lapping across the clearing in big looping waves, as if he was making no attempt to conceal it. It was as if he hoped that broadcasting his aggression would dissuade Aden from the challenge altogether.</p><p>Or perhaps he was more clever than that. Perhaps he thought that by making himself seem undisciplined and unable to control his own power leakage, Aden would assume he was weaker than he really was.</p><p>But Salvador was badly underestimating Aden, if he thought to fool him that easily.</p><p>For his part, Aden kept his power under a tight leash as always. Even knowing that Salvador might be only playing the fool, it was simply bad form to permit one\u2019s power to slop all over like that. Besides, it would be much more fun to see the shock on his opponent\u2019s face when he realized who, and what, he was really up against.</p><p>Salvador stalked out from under the trees and into the moonlight. He was of better than average height, with a wiry build, and his posture was stiff with hostility. His hands were clenched at his sides, his body leaning forward slightly, leading with his jaw.</p> <p>Aden watched him come, then dropped a comforting hand on Bastien\u2019s shoulder and strolled into the light himself. He let a mocking smile drift over his face and said, \u201cLast chance, Salvador. You can still go home alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should heed your own warning, cabron. Only one of us will be walking out of here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s amusement fled. He liked to think, after more than 250 years, that he\u2019d gotten over the fact of his illegitimate birth. But that didn\u2019t mean he had to accept the insult from the likes of Ramiro Salvador.</p><p>He loosened the hold on his power just a little, letting it waft around the clearing like a gentle breeze, still only the smallest hint of his true strength.</p><p>Salvador grinned, putting his fangs on full display. \u201cThat all you got? One more chance, big man. Walk out of here.\u201d</p><p>Aden bared his own teeth in a blatant challenge. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>He released his power in a flood, his eyes hooded with satisfaction as he took in the wide-eyed realization on Salvador\u2019s face. Deep inside Aden, the part of his Vampire gift that he rarely tapped and that very few knew existed came alive. It reached out, rolling in the scent of the Mexican\u2019s fear, like a dog in something dead, drinking it in, drawing strength from it. The more rational part of Aden\u2019s brain waited to see if Salvador would surrender, half-hoping he would. But that deep part of him, the part that was chortling with pleasure at his enemy\u2019s dread, that part hoped Salvador would stand and fight . . . and die.</p><p>And that\u2019s what he did.</p> <p>Once Salvador had stepped into the clearing, there had been little chance of anything else. If he\u2019d made the challenge and then surrendered without fighting, he\u2019d never have been able to go back home, never have been able to face his Sire. For all Aden knew, Enrique was the kind of Sire who would execute his own child for embarrassing him.</p><p>But after his initial shock, Salvador stood his ground. He stopped playing games and immediately tightened his power around himself, creating a nearly impenetrable shield.</p><p>Aden had fought many challengers over the years, had seen his opponents\u2019 power take the form of a variety of shields and weapons. But Salvador\u2019s was something new. Most shields were either constantly in motion, or solidly immovable. Salvador\u2019s was like a series of overlapping plates that were constantly changing, shifting position, freezing fractionally, then shifting again. It was a particularly difficult shield to overcome. One had to figure out when the shield was weakest, when it was moving or when it was realigning itself, and then time the shifts in order to anticipate a vulnerability. But, its very complexity made Aden wonder why the Mexican vampire hadn\u2019t fought and won enough duels to make a name for himself. There had to be a weakness, a fatal flaw.</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t have time to consider that, though, as Salvador launched the first salvo, clearly having decided his best bet lay in striking hard and fast. Aden absorbed the initial attack\u2014shields pulled tight around his body, fixed and secure\u2014not even trying to deflect. He wanted to feel the weight of Salvador\u2019s power, feel its heat through his shields. He was still learning his opponent, still gathering intel.</p><p>What Salvador saw, however, was the slight give of Aden\u2019s shield under his attack. Misunderstanding its cause, the Mexican vampire grinned viciously.</p><p>Aden grinned back, and the Mexican\u2019s pleasure faltered.</p><p>While Salvador was still figuring out what had happened, Aden attacked, his power whipping out in a long, flexible curve of energy, wrapping around Salvador and tightening like a noose, but a noose made of edged steel rather than rope. Salvador\u2019s shield slid, trying to slip away from the grasp of Aden\u2019s assault, trying to cut through the whip-thin band of energy. Aden felt the pressure and pulled his power back, once again letting the Mexican vampire grin in victory. But this time, Aden kept his own expression carefully blank. The Mexican\u2019s grin only widened.</p><p>Aden now knew at least one of his challenger\u2019s weaknesses\u2014 arrogance, which some mistook for confidence. Confidence was good. Arrogance would get you killed.</p><p>Salvador struck again, and the fight truly began. Power lanced back and forth without halt, singeing the trees overhead, starting little fires that were quickly doused when the next blast of energy sucked all the oxygen out of the air. Aden unleashed the full weight of his power, slamming it outward in a concussive wave that knocked Salvador back several steps and sent one of the Mexican\u2019s minions crashing into a tree. The vampire minion yelped in pain, and Salvador leapt back into the fray, his fists raised then slammed into each other, creating a vibrating roll of energy that bombarded Aden\u2019s shields with sound and fury, pounding against his eardrums and setting up a cacophony in his head that was badly disorienting. Aden was forced to retreat within his own shields, using his power to push back, interrupting the energy waves and stopping the noise.</p><p>Salvador had clearly been waiting for just that reaction. He attacked again, a pinpoint shaft of power this time. It burrowed through Aden\u2019s shield, digging into his arm, burning through flesh and into bone.</p><p>It was an agonizing pain. But Aden had learned at a very tender age to set aside the worst pain imaginable, to keep working regardless of blood or torment. He flexed the muscles of his wounded arm, choosing his own pain, using the agony to fuel his rage, channeling that rage into a whirlwind of razor-edge flails, hammering and slashing at Salvador\u2019s shields, slipping through to slash at his face, to batter his body.</p><p>Blood ran freely from every inch of Salvador\u2019s exposed skin, from the rips and tears in his clothing. But still he fought, using Aden\u2019s attack against him, taking advantage of his focused distraction to strike at his legs, narrow beams of power cutting through his flesh like tiny lasers.</p><p>Aden nearly staggered, but would not grant himself that weakness. With a snarl of pure fury, he doubled his attack, shifting from the pounding force of a flail to the knife-edge slice of the thinnest of whips, the kind of whip that could fillet a man as neatly as a fish, could slice the flesh from his bones so quickly he wouldn\u2019t even know until he\u2019d fallen that he was dead.</p><p>Salvador\u2019s answering howl carried more rage than pain, his head thrown back, his clothes almost gone, no longer able to hold form. Bloody strips of flesh hung from every inch of his body, white bone showing through, his face barely more than a skull. His teeth were bared, his eyes wild and gleaming a ruby-tinged gold as he pinned Aden with a furious stare and launched one final salvo.</p><p>And Aden saw it. The weakness in the Mexican\u2019s shields. For the space of a long breath, the constantly shifting plates of Salvador\u2019s shield froze completely as he drew upon every ounce of his remaining strength, draining the shield\u2019s power.</p><p>Aden pounced. Channeling his own power into a single whippet of energy, he slashed out, wrapping the thin beam around the Mexican\u2019s neck, letting the whip curl around and around like a snake, and then giving a single sharp tug.</p><p>Ramiro Salvador\u2019s eyes met Aden\u2019s in an instant of shocked disbelief, and in that moment, something passed between them, an understanding, a recognition of mutual respect. And then his head separated from his body, and he died.</p><p>Aden fell to his knees, his head thrown back as that hidden aspect of his power came roaring to the fore. It drank in the energy of Salvador\u2019s death, as if by dying he released his power for Aden to draw upon. Distantly, Aden heard the screams of Salvador\u2019s minions as they followed their Sire into death, too newly made to survive the trauma of his ending, and Aden drank in their deaths, too. He didn\u2019t like this gift of his Vampire nature, but he used it. It was a morbid and dark power, but it was also a tremendous secret weapon. And he was a warrior. A warrior used whatever weapons were available to him. Aden\u2019s ability to draw strength from the death of other vampires made it possible for him to recharge in the middle of a fight. And it meant that when the battle was over, he was not so weakened by blood loss that he was vulnerable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden became aware of Bastien at his side. He turned and saw the worry shadowing his lieutenant\u2019s face. He reached out mentally to Bastien and the others and felt their loyalty tinged with genuine fear for his safety, because they . . . loved him. His breath caught in his throat. Had anyone ever loved him before? Not like this.</p><p>He gripped Bastien\u2019s arm in thanks and pushed back, stopping his vampire children from offering their own power to aid his healing. He didn\u2019t need it, and they weren\u2019t home free from this challenge yet. What if Silas had learned of the challenge and was waiting for the victor to emerge, thinking he would be weakened and vulnerable in the aftermath?</p><p>\u201cWe must leave, my lord,\u201d Bastien told him. \u201cFreddy has gone for the truck.\u201d</p> <p>Aden nodded and stood, feeling an ache in his right leg, which he was fairly certain had been broken a moment ago, the bone sliced through by Salvador\u2019s last attack.</p><p>\u201cThe Mexican was a worthy opponent,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot worthy enough,\u201d Bastien replied loyally.</p><p>Aden\u2019s lip curled in a half smile, but he privately wondered what the situation was in Mexico, that a powerful vampire like Ramiro Salvador had come this far north in search of territory. But then, wasn\u2019t that precisely the situation Raphael had described as happening in Europe? Powerful younger vampires forced to extreme measures to find territories to rule?</p><p>It was something to consider, but Aden set the thought aside. That was the battle for another day, after he was Lord of the Midwest. For tonight, he had to get himself and his vampires home safely. He briefly considered paying a visit to Sidonie. He knew where she lived, of course, and could easily bypass her doorman. And while the energy infusion from his unique ability was useful, there was nothing like blood, warm, fresh, and velvety. Like Sidonie\u2019s.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he was in no mood to deal with whatever had sent her off in a huff earlier.</p><p>\u201cMake sure Hamilton knows I want a daylight tail on Sidonie tomorrow,\u201d Aden said as they returned to their SUVs. \u201cAnd tell Kage to take over the watch after sunset.\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow would be soon enough to find out what bug was up her ass. He\u2019d get his answers first.</p><p>And then he\u2019d get his blood.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>SID HOVERED NEAR the edge of the crowd, drink in hand, pretending she was having a great time at her dad\u2019s birthday party. Everyone else was. But she was just . . . sad. Not weepy, put-on-a-cowboy-love-song sad, it was more of a stare-out-the- window-at-nothing sad. She knew where the blame belonged for this particular sadness, though. He was tall, dark, and handsome, and he sucked blood. Although if she was being perfectly honest, it wasn\u2019t Aden\u2019s fault, either. The fault rested with her na\u00efve assumption that she could ever be anything to him besides a quick drink and a lay. Dresner had warned her about vampires, about their preference for short-term hookups and no commitment. Blood and sex. Wasn\u2019t that what she\u2019d said? And Sidonie had been certain she was prepared, that her goals were clear, and she didn\u2019t want or need anything else.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Sid.\u201d</p><p>She turned with a smile for Will Englehart. They\u2019d driven up together, and she\u2019d been a terrible companion, silent and staring out the window. He was looking very handsome in his tuxedo, and she was about to tell him so when she noticed the woman holding his hand. She was blond, petite, and curvy, and the look she was giving Sid held just a hint of challenge.</p><p>\u201cSid, this is Jennifer Lascher. Jenny, Sidonie Reid.\u201d</p><p>Sid shook the woman\u2019s hand, trying to keep the curiosity out of her voice and expression, and settled for the ever reliable, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jenny murmured something polite but didn\u2019t bother to conceal either her own curiosity or the little bit of hostility that lingered in her eyes.</p><p>Amenities done with, Sid gave Will a look that said, \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Will grinned back at her, but when he spoke it was to Jenny. Draping an arm around her shoulders, he pulled her close and brushed a kiss across her forehead. \u201cGive us a few minutes, okay? I\u2019ll meet you back at the table.\u201d</p><p>Sid studied Will as he stared after Jenny\u2019s retreating back. He turned and caught her watching him.</p> <p>\u201cNew girlfriend?\u201d she teased, knowing full well it was more than that. She might not want to marry Will, but she\u2019d known him all her life.</p><p>He smiled back at her, and Sid knew she was right. \u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think this one needs privacy,\u201d Sid commented, slipping her hand through his arm. \u201cThe patio\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>The blast of cold air when they opened the French doors told them exactly why the patio was empty, but her parents\u2014or their party planner\u2014had set up heaters for the few hardy souls who were willing to brave the cold in order to grab a quick cigarette break. There was no one out here now, however, so Sid and Will had the patio to themselves.</p><p>\u201cIs it serious?\u201d she asked him, glad she\u2019d worn a sweater over her dress. The heaters could only do so much.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d he said, looking out at the sloping yard. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>Sid drew back in quickly-concealed surprise, thankful that Will had been admiring her parents\u2019 perfect landscaping instead of looking at her.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I should have told you, but . . . it\u2019s not like you and I were really going to get married, Sid.\u201d He looked at her then, his pretty brown eyes solemn and sincere.</p><p>She smiled to let him know it was okay. \u201cWill,\u201d she said soothingly, \u201cI\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m just surprised that you didn\u2019t say anything before this. How can you be engaged when I didn\u2019t even know you were dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened kind of fast. We worked a case together a few months ago, one of those multiple plaintiff deals. Anyway, we just . . . clicked. She loves me, Sid. It\u2019s like . . . I walk into the room, and her whole face lights up. Like I matter.\u201d</p><p>Sid slapped his arm playfully. \u201cOf course, you matter, you idiot. You always have. Do you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I ever thought possible,\u201d he said with a dreamy sigh that would have done a teenaged girl proud.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy for you. For you both. Do your parents know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re telling them this weekend. Tomorrow actually, brunch at the club, both families at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave man.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNah, my parents will love her, plus they kind of know each other, since it turns out her parents are members, too. But, Sid,\u201d he added, going serious. \u201cI wanted to tell you first.\u201d</p><p>She went up on her toes and kissed his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, thank you. But I\u2019m not upset, so don\u2019t worry. Will I be invited to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Won\u2019t be for a while yet. At least a year. Jenny wants the whole catastrophe, and I\u2019m told these things take time to plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Sid murmured. She didn\u2019t tell him she\u2019d heard it from her own mother at least once a year for the last several years, and always in reference to her own wedding . . . to Will. \u201cYou should find Jenny now,\u201d she said, pushing him toward the door. \u201cShe\u2019ll be wondering what we\u2019re doing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks, Sid. I still love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014not that way,\u201d he chorused along with her, laughing. \u201cAre you going back inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll hang out here a bit longer. It\u2019s kind of stuffy in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too long, though, okay? You\u2019re not dressed for this weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she said, fighting a grin. She watched as he opened the patio doors and was quickly lost in the crowd of partygoers, then watched a little longer. All those people, laughing and talking. There were even a few couples dancing now, including her parents. They were an attractive couple. Her mom pretty and trim, despite her three children, two of whom\u2014Sid\u2019s brothers\u2014had been enormous babies. And then there was her dad. Tall, slender, and handsome in a classic all-American way, the reddish-gold hair he\u2019d passed on to his only daughter now threaded with silver.</p><p>Sid knew that all children wanted to believe their parents were in love, but she was convinced that her parents really were. And that\u2019s what she wanted. She didn\u2019t want a marriage of convenience or dynasty. She wanted passion. She wanted . . . Fuck. She wanted Aden.</p><p>Stupid, stupid Sidonie.</p><p>A sudden cheer drew her back inside as she saw her parents making their way to the front of the room where the DJ was set up. Her brothers were already there, and her dad was searching the room, looking for her. His face lit up in a smile when he found her, and Sid hurried to join them, knowing they\u2019d hold everything waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cA toast,\u201d her older brother, Jamie, called out, slinging an arm around her shoulders. \u201cTo our dad on his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d her father shouted, stopping Jamie before he could say the number. \u201cNo need for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014birthday,\u201d Jamie finished, laughing. \u201cHappy day, Dad. We love you.\u201d</p><p>The crowd cheered, and everybody drank. More toasts were shouted out from friends, and everybody drank some more . . . and so it went, until her parents slipped out of the room, disappearing into a back hallway, where their suitcases were all ready to go, with a town car idling in the driveway.</p><p>They didn\u2019t linger after that. Quick kisses all around, admonitions to take care while they were off on a month-long European vacation, and they were gone. But the party was just getting started.</p><p>Sid told her brothers she wanted to change clothes and headed upstairs to the same room where she\u2019d slept since grade school. Thankfully, her mother had updated the d\u00e9cor over the years. Sid didn\u2019t want to think about sleeping under the picture of Eminem that had been taped to her ceiling in high school, although she supposed that was better than the Backstreet Boys poster she\u2019d hidden on the back of her closet door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened her laptop, then stood and changed clothes while it found her parents\u2019 Wi-Fi and logged on. She hung her dress in the closet and pulled on the turtleneck sweater and well-worn jeans she\u2019d worn for the drive up. Still barefoot, she settled in front of her laptop and brought up the train schedule back to Chicago. There was one more departure tonight\u2014she checked the time\u2014and she could just make it, if she hurried.</p><p>She yanked on socks and boots, then tapped out a quick e-mail to her brothers. She called a cab using her cell phone, then turned it off. Hopefully, her brothers would be too busy to pick up her e-mail before morning, but just in case, she didn\u2019t want them nagging her about her abrupt departure. She\u2019d done her duty; she\u2019d come to the big party and mingled. But now she was going home, which had somehow become Chicago instead of this pretty suburb. She\u2019d always told herself she\u2019d return here when the story was finished, and maybe she\u2019d really planned on doing that back when she first moved away. But not anymore. Her home was in Chicago, and so, unfortunately, was her heart.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything to pack. Her party clothes could stay. All she really needed was her laptop, her purse, and her jacket.</p> <p>Grabbing all three, she ran down the back stairs and made her getaway the same way her parents had. Half an hour later, she was racing through the train station. Half an hour after that, she was sitting on a train, heading for Chicago, and contemplating the dismal state of her love life.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t happy with the way she\u2019d ended things with Aden. It wasn\u2019t like her to slink away. If he was an asshole, then she needed to tell him that. And if not, they could at least say a civil good-bye, nice having sex with you, have a good life.</p><p>\u201cYou heading to the city?\u201d</p><p>Sid jerked in surprise. She\u2019d been so caught up in planning for what she would do when she saw Aden next that she hadn\u2019t realized someone had sat down across the aisle from her. She\u2019d reserved a seat in business class and had found the car mostly empty when she\u2019d arrived. She looked up and down the aisle and saw that that was still the case. There was one couple at the other end of the car, and then there was her new and unwanted friend.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said pleasantly, then immediately pulled out her book and pretended to read.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too. Had one of those family things tonight. Grandparents\u2019 anniversary. Their fiftieth, so I had to be there.\u201d</p><p>Sid barely glanced over and made a noncommittal noise, hoping he\u2019d take the hint. No such luck.</p><p>\u201cMorning after brunch tomorrow, too, but you know how it is. I didn\u2019t want stay over,\u201d Mister Chatty Cathy continued.</p><p>She smiled politely and kept reading.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you from around here?\u201d</p><p>She put her book down, letting him see a little bit of polite irritation. Maybe if she let him talk a minute or two, he\u2019d get it out of his system.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do in the city?\u201d she asked. Unwilling to give him any tidbit of information about herself, she switched the questions back on him.</p><p>\u201cCommodities trader,\u201d he said with a sly smile, clearly expecting her to be impressed.</p><p>\u201cMust be interesting,\u201d she said, thinking to herself that she had no interest in the subject at all.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d he enthused, and proceeded to tell her in mind-numbing detail about every pork belly and soybean he\u2019d ever sold. She knew in principle what was involved in commodities, but this was far more than she\u2019d ever cared to learn.</p><p>As he regaled her with the wonders of his job, she studied him. He wasn\u2019t bad looking. Medium build, dark brown hair, medium height\u2014although it was difficult to tell the latter with him sitting down. On another day in another year, she might have been interested. Maybe. But not tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Vasco, by the way,\u201d he said, offering his hand. \u201cRichard Vasco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d she said, not giving up her last name.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a coffee, Sidonie? Or maybe something cold?\u201d He stood as he offered, and she saw she\u2019d been right about his height. He was a couple of inches over her own five foot seven and a half.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said pleasantly.</p><p>He shot her a quick, \u201cBe right back,\u201d and moved down the aisle.</p><p>Once he was gone, Sid checked the time on her cell phone and realized she\u2019d never turned it back on after leaving her parents\u2019 house. Figuring she was well away from her brothers, who by now were either sound asleep or so drunk that they\u2019d forgotten her, she turned the phone back on. Then she draped her jacket over herself like a blanket and pretended to fall asleep. It was cowardly, and she was deeply ashamed . . . okay, so she wasn\u2019t ashamed at all. She simply wanted a quiet ride back to the city. Was that too much to ask?</p><p>She heard Vasco return, felt him standing in the aisle studying her, maybe trying to figure out if she was faking it or not. But Sid was made of sterner stuff. She kept her eyes closed and her breathing steady and eventually dozed off for real.</p><p>ADEN OPENED YET another file on his computer, this one a long windy financials report, when a simple one-page accounting would have done the job just as well. It made him long for another bloody fight to the death. He\u2019d been at his desk for hours, but business didn\u2019t stop just because the challenge was underway. Lucas was still his master for now. He knew Aden was in Chicago and why, but that didn\u2019t mean they could ignore what was happening in Kansas City. Reports still came in and so did a thousand requests. Some vampires couldn\u2019t make the simplest decision without seeking advice or permission. Aden knew these vampires were as necessary to the race as he was, but sometimes their timidity drove him to distraction. They were vampires, damn it. Why couldn\u2019t they act like it?</p><p>He sighed, knowing the answer to his own question. If every vampire was as aggressive and driven as he was, they\u2019d have wiped themselves out long ago.</p><p>He looked up when Bastien entered the office, hoping for a distraction. But one look at his lieutenant\u2019s face, and he knew it wasn\u2019t good news.</p><p>Aden did a quick mental check of his vampire children, and finding them all well and alive, he asked the question he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted answered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarl Hamilton called. They\u2019ve lost Sidonie Reid.\u201d</p><p>Aden grew very still. \u201cLost her? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left the city this morning in the company of\u201d\u2014Bastien checked some scribbled notes\u2014\u201cWilliam Englehart. We don\u2019t know much about him yet, other than he\u2019s a lawyer from her hometown. Hamilton\u2019s guy said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left the city,\u201d Aden repeated flatly.</p><p>Bastien studied Aden carefully. \u201cYes, my lord. Englehart picked her up this morning in his personal vehicle.\u201d</p><p>Aden slapped his laptop closed, fighting against the urge to do something violent. Had Sidonie dared to continue seeing a human lover after being with Aden? Was she really that stupid?</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHamilton\u2019s man said they seemed friendly.\u201d Bastien looked down, reading from his notes. \u201cShe had no luggage other than her computer and a garment bag, and they\u2014\u201d He broke off with an uneasy glance at Aden who was sitting perfectly still, his hands flat on the desk.</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey kissed when she got in the car.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s jaw was so tight, he thought the bones would break. He was surprised at the intensity of his own reaction, but she was his. Maybe not forever. He didn\u2019t do forever. But for as long as he wanted her, and he fucking did not share.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey drove to her parents\u2019 home together, although it\u2019s not clear whether Englehart stayed at the house with her, or went elsewhere. Reid didn\u2019t leave the house the rest of the day. There was a party, starting late this afternoon and going into the evening. It looked like the party was winding down when Reid suddenly jumped in a cab and hit the train station. By the time our guy parked and got inside, she was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d Aden observed coldly. \u201cWhat about Englehart? Where\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>Bastien blinked and immediately grabbed the phone.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Hamilton I want his guy fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Bastien said, then conveyed the orders to Hamilton with a few terse words before disconnecting.</p><p>\u201cSidonie has a cell phone,\u201d Aden growled. \u201cGet someone tracking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done, my lord. It\u2019s turned off right now, but the minute it comes back on, we\u2019ll pick up the ping and start tracking her.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s phone was off. Aden could think of many reasons why a woman would turn her phone off, and he didn\u2019t like any of them. He was trying to think of what else they could do when the phone rang. Bastien answered, his posture radiating tension. Intellectually, Aden knew none of this was Bastien\u2019s fault, but he wasn\u2019t inclined to let him off the hook. If Aden had to suffer, Bastien could damn well suffer with him.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d his lieutenant said, disconnecting the phone once more, but keeping it in his hand. \u201cEnglehart is at his parents\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sidonie isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where the fuck is she?\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again. Bastien glanced at him, but Aden waved a hand, telling him to answer the fucking thing. Another terse conversation, and Aden saw Bastien\u2019s entire demeanor change, becoming if not relaxed, then at least less tense.</p><p>\u201cMs. Reid\u2019s phone just pinged, my lord. She\u2019s on a train,\u201d Bastien reported, seeming puzzled by this latest news. \u201cFortunately, at this time of night, there aren\u2019t many trains moving. We\u2019re fairly certain she\u2019s on her way back here, to Union station. We won\u2019t know for sure until the phone switches cell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going home,\u201d Aden interrupted. \u201cLet\u2019s greet her, shall we?\u201d</p><p>SID WOKE WHEN the train slowed to enter Union Station. She slitted one eye open carefully. No Vasco. Sighing in relief, she gathered her things, thinking she\u2019d take a cab home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as she made her way through the station toward the cab stand, Vasco appeared at her side.</p><p>\u201cI have a town car,\u201d he said, taking her elbow. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home.\u201d</p><p>Sid felt a trickle of unease. It was one thing to flirt on the train, but something else entirely to stalk her through the station and touch her uninvited. She jerked her arm away from him.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cI\u2019ll take a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d he insisted, his eyes going flat as his fingers closed around her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late for that.\u201d</p><p>Unease turned to genuine alarm, and Sid stared around, looking for help. The station was busy, but no one was paying attention to them.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, trying to remain calm. \u201cI appreciate the offer, really. But I don\u2019t know you, and I\u2019d really rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSid!\u201d</p> <p>Sidonie looked up at the sound of her name and saw Kage striding toward her, a big smile on his face and one arm raised in greeting, as if they were long-lost friends. Next to her, she felt Vasco stiffen. His grip tightened enough to leave bruises, and she thought for a moment that he was going to make a break for it and drag her with him.</p><p>But then Kage was there, flashing a hint of fang as his fingers gripped Vasco\u2019s wrist and forced him to release Sid\u2019s arm. Kage wrapped an arm around Sid, placing himself between her and Vasco, who backed away with a hissed curse.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, vampire.\u201d</p><p>Kage grinned. \u201cBring it on, human,\u201d he said dismissively, then guided Sid toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said breathlessly, trying to keep up with his long strides. \u201cThat guy was a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was more than a jerk. He knew who you were.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced up at him as they left the station and climbed into the SUV Kage had left parked illegally.</p><p>\u201cHe knew you were a vampire,\u201d she said in sudden understanding.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would he know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His gaze cut over to her. \u201cSame thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. How\u2019d you know I was on that train?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should ask Lord Aden.\u201d</p><p>Sid rolled her head back against the seat. She could push for answers, but there was no point. The one thing she\u2019d learned about vampires was that they were completely loyal to their Sires. That loyalty could be compromised, according to Dresner, if a vampire was strong enough to break away. But Sid\u2019s impression of Aden and his people was something closer to a brick wall. They were solid.</p><p>If Aden didn\u2019t want Kage to talk to her, he wouldn\u2019t talk.</p><p>She looked up in surprise when Kage pulled the SUV up in front of her building and stopped, clearly waiting for her to get out. She\u2019d expected him to take her to Aden and had to stifle the surprisingly strong surge of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. \u201cFor rescuing me.\u201d Although she still wondered what exactly she\u2019d been rescued from.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said, giving her a quick sideways smile. \u201cSee you around, Sid.\u201d</p><p>She made a beeline for the elevator, giving her doorman a wave as she went by. She was beyond tired and imagined she could hear her bed calling to her with its down comforter and soft sheets. Her hallway was empty as she unlocked her door and stepped into the quiet darkness of her condo. Closing the door behind her, she leaned against it with a sigh of relief, then pushed away and was already stripping off her jacket when she made her way down the short hall to her sparsely-furnished living room. Her bedroom was on the other side of that open space, and she could see the white of her comforter gleaming in the moonlight from a window she rarely covered. That was her only goal for tonight. Bed.</p><p>But then a light clicked on, and her heart nearly stopped.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sidonie,\u201d Aden\u2019s deep voice purred.</p><p>Sid clutched a hand to her heart, feeling it bouncing so hard behind her breastbone that her ribs rattled.</p><p>\u201cAden, damn it,\u201d she swore, hanging on to one of the tall stools lined up at the bar between her kitchen and living room. \u201cYou scared me half to death. What are you doing here? And how did you get in?\u201d</p><p>Aden stood to his full height. He remained still for a moment, as if inviting her to admire him, and damn it, she did. He looked good. He wasn\u2019t wearing a jacket, just a black long-sleeved T-shirt and a pair of black jeans that showed off the length of his legs, the powerful muscles of his thighs, and cupped the rest of him lovingly. Sid blinked, honest enough to admit that she wouldn\u2019t mind cupping him herself. She raised her gaze to his face, and his knowing smile told her he was aware of the effect he had on her.</p><p>Sid gave him a narrow look and opened her mouth to tell him to take his beautiful self right out of her home, but then he moved, and she was caught up in the pure, lethal elegance of him. He didn\u2019t so much walk across the room as he prowled\u2014long graceful strides, loose hips rolling like those of a big cat, his dark eyes limned in blue.</p><p>She looked up at him, suddenly right on top of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Sidonie? And more to the point, whom have you been with?\u201d</p><p>Sid blinked, the spell of his beauty broken by her sudden anger. What right did he have to ask her such things?</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she snapped and tried to push past him. It was like trying to push a ton of brick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my business,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Don\u2019t you have better things to do? Winning the challenge, world domination? Don\u2019t let me get in your way. Isn\u2019t that what you said, that you\u2019d never let a woman\u201d\u2014she added a sneer to the word, just as he had the other night\u2014\u201cget in your way? Well, I\u2019m officially taking myself out of your fucking way. So you can leave now.\u201d</p><p>She pushed at him again to no avail, but this time he bracketed her arms with his big hands.</p><p>\u201cWorld domination?\u201d he repeated, smirking.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Sidonie?\u201d he repeated implacably. He was like a stone statue, immoveable and unmoved by anything she said.</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s my father\u2019s birthday. We had a party for him. I went. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s William Englehart?\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s mouth dropped open in surprise. \u201cHow do you know about Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d he snarled, stepping even closer until she was backed up against the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s true?\u201d she asked in confusion. \u201cAnd what about Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sid glanced around. She didn\u2019t see any of Aden\u2019s vamps, but there was no way he\u2019d come here alone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone,\u201d Aden said, accurately reading her concerns. \u201cBastien\u2019s in the lobby by now. He started down when you started up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you . . . Kage,\u201d she realized. \u201cHe must have called you from the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you fuck Englehart?\u201d</p><p>Sid glared at him. \u201cYou know what? Go to hell. And how did you get in here anyway? I thought you guys needed an invitation, like at Dresner\u2019s house the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour doorman let me in.\u201d</p><p>Sid scowled. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI persuaded him you were missing. He was very concerned and invited me to search your condo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you needed my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, just an invitation from someone with the right of entry. Your doorman has that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long. And I\u2019m going to hang garlic over the threshold.\u201d</p><p>Aden laughed. \u201cThat won\u2019t do anything but smell up your home, and I don\u2019t like the scent. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop giving me orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me the truth. Did you fuck Will Englehart?\u201d</p><p>Sid was on the verge of telling him to go hell again, but she saw something in his eyes, a hint of vulnerability in that otherwise tightly-controlled face. Too many people bought into Aden\u2019s hard-ass exterior and never looked beneath the surface, probably because he didn\u2019t let them. But for some reason, after a long lifetime of protecting himself, he\u2019d let her in. He\u2019d trusted her, and she couldn\u2019t imagine what it must have cost him to do so. She wouldn\u2019t betray that.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cWill and I dated, but we haven\u2019t been lovers in years. Our families are close, and he\u2019s a very old friend, but that\u2019s it.\u201d She flattened her palm against his chest, feeling his muscles bunch beneath her fingers. \u201cI haven\u2019t fucked anyone but you lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you answer the question. How long\u2019s it been since you fucked someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than you?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an impatient look.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNot since I came to Chicago for the challenge.\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s breath ran out in a rush. A couple of weeks?</p><p>\u201cThey meant nothing, Sidonie,\u201d he murmured, cupping her cheek in his warm hand.</p><p>Weren\u2019t vampires supposed to be cold? Aden never was. Wait. They?</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>He shrugged carelessly. \u201cUntil you, I never bothered to stick with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was sweet in a man-slutty sort of way. \u201cBut you told Bastien\u2014\u201d she started, but couldn\u2019t finish. She didn\u2019t want to sound like a clingy, needy woman.</p><p>His eyes lit with understanding. \u201cSo that\u2019s what this is all about. You eavesdropped, and as is often the case when one listens to a conversation that is none of one\u2019s business, you misunderstood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat you said was pretty clear, Aden,\u201d she said, wondering if he enjoyed his little lectures as much as she hated them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was, but it had absolutely nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not me, then who? Who\u2019s the woman who\u2019s getting in the way of your grand plans?\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a quizzical look, as if there was some obvious truth she was missing. \u201cSilas, of course,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sid stared at him. \u201cSilas is a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be accurate, Silas is a female vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just assumed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assumed she was male,\u201d he tsked. \u201cNot terribly liberated, Sidonie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, most of you guys are . . . well, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas is most assuredly not a guy. She\u2019s quite beautiful if one cares for the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat type?\u201d Sid asked, feeling a twinge of jealousy.</p><p>\u201cThe type who will cut off your balls without remorse if the mood strikes her. And I\u2019m not speaking figuratively.\u201d</p><p>Sid stared at him. \u201cYou mean she\u2019s actually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told she has a collection.\u201d</p> <p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. You should definitely kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on it, but not in search of some cosmic justice for males everywhere. She\u2019s in my way, so she has to go.\u201d</p><p>His hand, which had been stroking her cheek, dropped to her neck and grabbed a handful of hair, tugging her head back so she had to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were leaving town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care. Besides, you knew anyway. Your cover was pretty much blown when Kage rescued me at the train station. Thank you for that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s hand clenched almost painfully in her hair, and he went preternaturally still, his eyes gleaming as if lit from behind. \u201cRescued you from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome guy,\u201d Sid told him. \u201cHe sat near me on the train, but I brushed him off. I thought that was it, but then in the station he got really pushy about giving me a ride. Kage showed up just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>But before she could answer, there was a knock on her door. Aden glanced down the hallway, and the next thing she knew her front door lock was gliding open, and Bastien was standing at the entrance to her living room, his dark hair slicked back and shining in the moonlight, his eyes fixed on Aden.</p><p>\u201cKage just reported in,\u201d Bastien said. \u201cSidonie was approached this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just heard,\u201d Aden agreed. \u201cDid Kage know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord. But the assailant most definitely knew Kage.\u201d</p><p>Aden drew Sid against him in a protective gesture, even though there was no one in the room except Bastien. He cupped her chin, tilting her head back until she was looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>She took his hand and turned in his embrace, leaning against his side with his arm heavy over her shoulders. \u201cNothing about him stood out. He was a little bit taller than I am, brown hair, brown eyes, fit, but on the slender side. He said his name was Vasco.\u201d</p><p>Aden spoke over her head, addressing Bastien. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he human?\u201d Bastien asked, his eyes eerily intent as his gaze cut to her.</p><p>\u201cI think so. It was after dark when I got on the train, but he\u2019d have to be human, wouldn\u2019t he? I mean, I didn\u2019t go to my parents\u2019 place until this morning, so how could he have . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off, because neither vampire was paying any attention to her.</p><p>\u201cSilas, you think, my lord? The description could fit Balderas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Balderas?\u201d Sid asked.</p><p>\u201cSilas\u2019s daylight security chief,\u201d Aden growled. \u201cOne of two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has two security chiefs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaylight security. And Silas likes to surround herself with men, especially human men. They\u2019re her favorite food source. Unfortunately for them, her idea of post-coital relations all too frequently resembles that of a black widow spider. Balderas must not be her type, because he\u2019s been around long enough to be noticeable. What did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>Sid hadn\u2019t paid much attention to what he\u2019d said. Her focus had been on getting rid of him. \u201cIf it was Balderas,\u201d she qualified, then paused when Bastien shoved a cell phone under her nose with a picture of . . . \u201cOkay, fine. That\u2019s him. Mostly he talked about himself and commodities trading. What kind of security chief is hung up on commodities trading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who was a trader before he was convicted of fraud and did a stint in federal prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. He was a little intense.\u201d</p><p>Aden took her by the shoulders and turned her in the direction of her bedroom. \u201cPack some things. You\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>She spun back around. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a droll look. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go home with me?\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s heart leapt at the heated look in his eyes. A look that said going home implied a lot more than sleeping in a guest room.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she agreed and, ignoring his confident smirk, went off to pack.</p><p>ADEN SPRAWLED lazily on his bed, still fully clothed, his back against the headboard as he watched Sidonie unpack the few things she\u2019d grudgingly brought with her. It wasn\u2019t much. He didn\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t want to intrude, or, more likely, if she was unwilling to surrender her independence enough to stay with him longer than she had to. But whichever it was, she was here, and here she was staying. She just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>\u201cYou can use all of the drawers in that dresser,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use the one in the closet. That one\u2019s art.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand over the delicate flower motif and mother-of-pearl inlays on the chest of drawers. \u201cThis is beautiful. Is it, um, original?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a delicate way of asking if it\u2019s an antique, something from my past? I\u2019m not worried about my age, Sidonie. But, yes, that\u2019s an original fifteenth century Ottoman, and no, I only purchased it a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, turning to give him a gimlet stare. \u201cSo, how old are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, something he\u2019d done much more frequently since meeting her. \u201cI was born in 1753. This body\u201d\u2014he touched a hand to his T-shirted chest and noted with satisfaction that her gaze followed the gesture appreciatively\u2014\u201creflects more or less my age when my Mistress acquired me and made me Vampire. I was close to twenty-seven years old at the time, although I could be off by a year or two. I was a bastard and a slave. What records existed were hardly precise.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie had crossed the room while he spoke, and she now climbed up onto the bed to straddle his thighs. Her eyes were soft and sad, and he knew it was because of what he\u2019d told her about his early life. She pretended to be tough, but his Sidonie was tender-hearted, the toughness only a thin shell that protected her from the carelessness of others.</p><p>Whoa. His Sidonie? He did a mental double take at that thought. When had she become his? And not in the way of previous lovers whom he\u2019d only claimed for a day or two until he was done with them, and even then only because he didn\u2019t like to share. Sidonie was his in a way he\u2019d never considered before, a way that would last a hell of a lot longer than a day or two. A way that said he didn\u2019t plan on sharing her ever.</p><p>She leaned forward, gentle hands cupping his cheeks, her full breasts barely touching his chest as she brushed a kiss over his mouth. He wanted more. His arms banded around her back as he rolled her beneath him and took what he needed. His mouth was hard on her soft lips, his tongue plundering as she opened to him, her hungry moan telling him he wasn\u2019t the only one who needed more.</p><p>He shoved his hand under her sweater and palmed her breast through the lace of her bra, feeling her nipple poke at his fingers. With a growl, he yanked on the delicate fabric, hearing it tear and not caring. He\u2019d buy her a new bra. He\u2019d buy her a hundred. Right now, he needed her naked, and the bra was in the way. Lifting slightly, he pushed her sweater up over her breasts and released the front clasp on the torn bra with a deft twist of his fingers. Her breasts spilled out heavy and full, her nipples flushed a deep rose against her pale skin.</p><p>Unable to resist their temptation, Aden took one of the plump morsels in his mouth, sucking until the pink rose became a succulent cherry, so hard and engorged with blood that he could smell it, so rich that it made his fangs elongate with hunger. Beneath him, Sidonie was making eager little noises, her breaths choppy, her fingers tunneling through his hair, holding him against her breast, almost begging him to bite, to taste her blood. But he wasn\u2019t ready to release her to an orgasm just yet. He wanted her hot and begging.</p><p>He bit down until he knew she could feel the sting of his teeth, heard her suck in a breath and hold it in anticipation of his bite, but he didn\u2019t let his teeth sink in, he didn\u2019t draw blood. Lifting his mouth from her flesh, he switched to the other breast, smiling against her hot skin at the sound of her groan, her hand fisted against his back, pounding once in frustration.</p><p>Stroking his hand down over her hip, he cupped the curve of her ass, then slapped her once, smartly. She jumped, but it only seemed to heighten her arousal, as he\u2019d known it would. Aden would never beat a woman, he\u2019d never beat anyone who was weaker than he was, but he was a master at understanding the sensuous pleasure to be found in the right kind of pain.</p><p>Sucking her second breast into his mouth, he lavished it as he had the first, sliding his tongue over her nipple, feeling the blood pulse, sucking harder until the entire tip of her breast was between his teeth. He bit down again, knowing there\u2019d be marks on her delicate flesh tomorrow and taking pleasure in the knowledge. He\u2019d mark every inch of her before he was through.</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she gasped, her breath warm and wet against his ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet, habibi. Not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>She growled angrily, making him smile. Until she thumped his back again in her anger.</p><p>\u201cNot nice, Sidonie love. You\u2019ll pay for that one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig talk,\u201d she muttered, then cried out in surprise when he whipped her sweater over her head and used it to tie her hands to the headboard. She tugged on the stretchy material, but his binding held fast. Of course.</p><p>\u201cThis is what happens when you hit,\u201d he told her solemnly, breaking into a grin when she narrowed her eyes at him, lips pursed in annoyance.</p><p>Unable to resist, he leaned forward and took that pretty mouth in a kiss, her lips softening beneath his at once, her tongue twisting over and around his tongue and teeth, her body straining upward, undulating against him as she tried to get closer.</p><p>But Aden had other plans. Ignoring her wordless protest, he lifted his mouth from hers and kissed his way along her jaw, then down to her neck where he teased with quick flicks of his tongue, and lower, to her shoulder. He closed his teeth over the delicate bone of her clavicle, letting her feel the edge of his fangs, before moving to her chest once more. Sidonie thrust her breasts upward, and he took a moment to admire their lush beauty, the plush nipples and pink areolas, the bright red brand of his teeth marks.</p><p>\u201cAden!\u201d Sidonie demanded, bucking impatiently, obviously wanting him to do more than admire.</p> <p>He gave her a single flat look of warning. She huffed in frustration and favored him with a scowl, but then lay quietly beneath his hand where it rested against her abdomen.</p><p>Leaning down, he brushed a kiss over the soft skin of her belly, then began stripping away the rest of her clothes. He unfastened her jeans and dragged them down her legs, hooking his thumbs in the lacy edges of her panties and taking those, too, until she was completely naked beneath him. He sat back and admired his work, his lovely Sidonie.</p><p>\u201cHow come I\u2019m always naked and you\u2019re not?\u201d she asked sulkily.</p><p>Aden stroked a hand down her bare leg, starting at her thigh and continuing down to cup her calf behind him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you this way.\u201d He closed his fingers around her calf and pulled her leg up, bending her knee and pushing outward until he could see the first rosy blush of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI like you naked, too,\u201d she said, somewhat more breathless than she had been.</p> <p>\u201cBut this is my bed,\u201d he said patiently, sliding his fingers under her other thigh and bending that leg as well, until she was completely open to him.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you . . . oh, God,\u201d she gasped as he slid a single finger into the wet heat between her swollen folds.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d he asked mildly, as his finger played in the slick moisture which gave lie to her words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she moaned, eyes closed as she fairly rippled under his hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed open to glare at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d He wiped his fingers on her thigh and stood next to the bed, laughing as she snarled a furious protest. Until he began removing his clothes.</p><p>She grew silent as she watched him undress, her eyes hot and hungry, her tongue darting out to lick her lips when he yanked his T-shirt over his head and tossed it aside. She was such an erotic sight\u2014tied to his bed, her pale skin flushed, damp with a fine sheen of sweat, his teeth marks on her breasts, her thighs wet with her own arousal. His cock strained at the heavy fabric of his jeans, so tight it was almost painful. Slipping the buttons one at a time, he reached inside and fisted himself as his heavy shaft sprang free, pumping his hand slowly up and down as he ate in the sight of her.</p> <p>\u201cAden,\u201d she said urgently, her breath coming in pants, her gaze fixed on his cock as he stroked himself.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me, Sidonie,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>She obeyed readily, bending her knees even closer to her chest and spreading her legs until he could see the slick opening to her sex, her vaginal lips flushed and swollen in invitation.</p><p>Captivated by the sight, Aden released his cock and climbed onto the bed to kneel between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou have the prettiest, pink pussy,\u201d he murmured, then leaned over to taste, his tongue dipping inside her, then out again, swirling over and around the hard pearl of her clit. He lifted his head enough to meet her hungry eyes. \u201cSweet, too.\u201d</p><p>She made a noise very much like a sob, but though he saw her stomach muscles flexing with the effort, she remained still beneath his hands. Such discipline deserved a reward.</p><p>Bending his head once more, he inhaled the scent of her arousal, taking it in, feeling the sizzle as it sped along his nerves and over his skin, his cock jerking with the need to bury itself inside her hot little body. But first he closed his lips over the hot bundle of nerves that was her clit, kissing and sucking, his fangs aching with the need to taste more than her wetness.</p><p>He scraped the edge of one fang along her clit, and then the other. Her heart was pumping, her muscles taut as she writhed against the binding of her hands, as she strained to keep her thighs open against the need to clasp them around his head.</p><p>He teased her, lifting his lips away with a soft kiss, a gentle nip to the tender skin of her inner thigh. She did sob then, the emotion of the moment too much for her to hold in, her need for him warring with her desire to remain still, to please him. He blew softly on the wet flesh between her thighs before rasping his tongue the full length of her slit, stimulating her clit until it was hard with arousal.</p><p>And then he truly tasted her, tasted the sweetest blood a woman\u2019s body could offer. His teeth closed over the pulsing pearl of her clit, and Sidonie screamed, her back bowed as the orgasm swept through her body, her sex flooding with juices, pulsing with hunger as it searched for something to fill its emptiness.</p><p>Aden gripped her hips, holding her to the bed, keeping her legs open and her pussy available to him as he lapped up the cream of her climax like a sweet topping to the richness of her blood. He sipped and tasted until she began to calm down, until the first throes of orgasm had passed and her breathing was beginning to slow, her heart to cease its racing.</p><p>And then he rose up between her thighs and, positioning his cock at her slick and swollen opening, he leaned over her and thrust his hips forward, slamming his cock deep into her tight body, feeling the trembling flesh of her sheath spreading to accommodate his intrusion. Sidonie gasped, then moaned in pleasure, as her legs closed over his back, ankles locked to hold him there.</p><p>Aden chuckled at her possessiveness, loving the clasp of her thighs around his hips, the way she arched her back to rub her nipples over his skin. Wanting to feel her arms around him, he reached up and freed her hands from their sweater binding. She responded immediately, curling her arms over his back, her nails scratching along his spine hard enough that he knew she\u2019d drawn blood.</p><p>He growled his satisfaction as he pumped in and out of her hot embrace, as her inner muscles began to clench around his cock, her breath gasping in his ear, her heart pounding against his chest. He crushed his mouth against hers, letting her taste herself on his tongue, their teeth clashing until both were bleeding.</p><p>Aden lifted his mouth and howled in triumph as Sidonie had her first taste of his blood, as she jolted in surprise at the electric shock of it, shuddering as it exploded directly into her brain like a shot of liquid lust. She began lifting her hips in time with his thrusts, their hips slapping together, her teeth closing over the skin of his neck as if seeking to taste more of him.</p><p>Aden snarled and lowered his mouth to her jugular. He could hear the rush of her blood through her veins, the pounding of her pulse. Her scent was overwhelming. His gums ached as his fangs emerged, as Sidonie twisted her head, baring her neck in invitation.</p><p>She screamed when he bit her, when the euphoric in his bite raced through her already-electrified bloodstream, lighting up every nerve ending, every pleasure center in her body. Her pussy squeezed around him like a fist even as her blood rolled down his throat, fragrant and rich, thick and sweet. And he felt his own orgasm building, felt his sac stretched tight around his balls, until with a shout of triumph, his climax rolled over and through him, his release roaring down his cock and into her body, filling her with his heat, marking her body and claiming her soul.</p><p>Sidonie was his. And he\u2019d kill anyone, man or woman, who touched her.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>SIDONIE DIDN\u2019T know if she could move. She lay on top of Aden, every bone in her body turned to Jell-O, her muscles to mush. He had that effect on her, and she didn\u2019t think it was only his vampire blood. Although that stuff should be bottled and sold as an aphrodisiac. Fuck little blue pills. The vamps could make a fortune selling their blood. There must be a reason they hadn\u2019t done so, she mused. She\u2019d have to ask Aden about it. Although there was a hell of a lot more to sex with Aden than a sip of his blood. He had moves. The things he could do with his tongue . . . A delicious ripple of memory rolled through her body, her fingers digging into his chest as she shivered in a mini-orgasm.</p><p>Aden slid his arm around her, his big hand drifting down to cup her ass possessively. He didn\u2019t say a word, and she wasn\u2019t looking at his face. But she just knew he\u2019d have that smug smile going on. She could hardly blame him, but it wasn\u2019t like she was the only one who\u2019d gotten her rocks off. Pleasure had been had all around, hadn\u2019t it?</p><p>She propped herself up on his broad chest. He gazed down at her, his eyes all but hidden behind the veil of his lashes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time I\u2019ll tie you up,\u201d she muttered thoughtfully, not even sure if she meant him to hear it.</p><p>But he did hear it, and his reaction was instantaneous.</p><p>\u201cNo one ties me up, Sidonie.\u201d His voice was hard, his hand on her ass suddenly unyielding. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>He moved abruptly, lifting her off his chest as if she weighed nothing and vaulting off the bed with a flex of smooth muscle. He was careful with her, but he didn\u2019t linger. Sid sat up into a cross-legged position, watching as he strode across the room and disappeared into the bathroom. A minute later, the shower came on, and she sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been an idiot. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t want to be tied up. Hadn\u2019t he confided his history to her? It couldn\u2019t have been easy for a powerful male like Aden to admit to her that he\u2019d been a slave in his former life, that he\u2019d been forced to submit to people much weaker than he was\u2014both men and women\u2014that he\u2019d been bought and sold, used like a piece of property.</p><p>Idiot wasn\u2019t harsh enough. She was an ass. She crawled off the big bed, determined to fix this somehow. She was a writer, damn it. Words were supposed to be her forte. She shuffled over to the bureau where her few clothes were stashed and realized she\u2019d have to shower first. She was sticky with sweat and . . . other things. The shower was still running, and her brain had no problem conjuring up images of Aden\u2019s big, powerful, naked body, steam filling the glass enclosure, hot water flowing lovingly over every inch of smooth muscle and skin . . .</p><p>She shook herself out of the fantasy. He hadn\u2019t invited her to join him. Quite the opposite, in fact. He\u2019d even closed the door.</p><p>Ass, she cursed herself again.</p><p>But she still couldn\u2019t put clean clothes on over her stinky, sticky body. She also didn\u2019t feel like being naked when Aden finally emerged from the bathroom. Sure, he\u2019d seen, and probably licked, every inch of her, but that was then. This was now, and if he was pissed at her, she didn\u2019t want to face him at her most vulnerable.</p><p>She glanced around. Aden had been wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt earlier. She could pull that on until . . . She frowned, realizing he\u2019d picked up all of his clothes on his way to the shower. Just her luck. She\u2019d fallen for a neat freak. Casting around for a solution, expecting the shower to turn off at any moment, her eye fell on an antique armoire against the far wall. Maybe there was something in there she could put on, a robe or another shirt.</p><p>She crossed over to the tall closet-like piece of furniture. It was similar in design to the dresser, with latticework cutouts in a floral motif, but the inlays were tortoise shell and sliced so thin that when she pulled open the door, the light shone through in rich gold and chocolate brown. She stroked her fingers over the beautiful workmanship as she pushed the door fully open . . . and then she could only stare at what she\u2019d found.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a robe, wasn\u2019t a shirt, hanging inside. But what there was aroused so many different feelings that she couldn\u2019t process them all. She\u2019d known Aden was dominant and had suspected his dominance was more than simply an alpha male personality, but this . . . this was whips and chains, handcuffs and arm restraints, collars and blindfolds, and other things she could only guess at.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear the bathroom door open, didn\u2019t know Aden was there until she felt his heat against her still-naked back and smelled the fresh soap scent of his skin. His arm reached around her and lifted a flogger from its hook. It was leather, a light brown suede that gave its multiple tails a deceptively soft appearance.</p><p>Aden dragged the soft suede across her naked breast, and Sidonie felt every one of the multiple tails as they slid over her engorged nipple until it ached. Her breath grew uneven, and her heart was going a mile a minute. But she wasn\u2019t afraid. She was exquisitely aroused, with wet heat dripping between her still sticky thighs.</p><p>Aden lowered his mouth to her ear. \u201cDo you know what I thought when I laid eyes on you for the first time, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>Sid tried to come up with something clever, something to break the unbearable erotic tension that was freezing her in place. But she could only shake her head mutely.</p><p>\u201cI thought how beautiful your pale skin would look under the lash,\u201d he purred, trailing the flogger down over the curve of her breasts to her belly. He lingered above her swollen pussy lips, switching the flogger around and stroking the hard handle between her thighs, before snaking the multiple tails over her hip and down to her leg.</p><p>Without warning, he snapped the flogger in the air, letting her feel the barest kiss of suede against her thigh. Sid shivered, her nipples hard points of desire, her pussy drenched in heat. Aden closed the small distance between them until his body was flush with hers, his cock a heavy length against the curve of her butt. She closed her eyes, letting her head fall back against his shoulder.</p><p>His lips closed over her neck, and she reached up, curling her fingers over the back of his head, caressing him, holding him against her.</p><p>\u201cShall I show you, Sidonie? Would you like to see how pretty your skin would look?\u201d</p><p>Sid trembled, afraid to admit her own desires. \u201cI want you to fuck me,\u201d she said in a whisper so soft that she wasn\u2019t certain he\u2019d heard until his arm came around her waist and she was spinning around. Before she could draw a breath of surprise, Sid found herself bent over the bed, her butt in the air, her legs spread wide as Aden nudged her feet apart.</p><p>His thick fingers dipped between her legs, spreading her lips, testing her wetness and finding her slippery with arousal. \u201cYou\u2019re soaking wet, habibi,\u201d he chided. \u201cSuch a wicked girl.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked the full length of her slit, gathering moisture and dragging it over the skin of her butt, as if to demonstrate how very wet she was.</p><p>\u201cAsk nicely,\u201d he murmured, his voice a rumbling burr of sound. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give you what you want. What you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she whispered, the words scraping against her dry throat. \u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle in response was far too happy. As if he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d defy him.</p> <p>\u201cBad girl,\u201d he hissed directly into her ear.</p><p>She heard the swish of the flogger before she felt the sting of its kiss. Her pussy clenched, and she could only groan, her back arching as she offered herself, her body begging for what her brain refused to admit.</p><p>\u201cPink and pretty,\u201d Aden crooned, and then the whip swished again, on her other butt cheek. \u201cMmm,\u201d he said appreciatively. \u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she said, trying not to whine.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>Sid swallowed the knot of desire choking her throat, every nerve in her body stretched thin, hanging on the precipice and screaming for release. \u201cI really need\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to finish her sentence. One of Aden\u2019s strong hands flattened on her lower back, holding her in place, and then his cock was slamming into her, a long hard thrust that went deeper than she would have thought possible. She felt him all the way to her womb, all the way to her heart, as he thrust in and out in a steady rhythm, as she pressed her chest into the bed and arched her back, inviting him to go deeper still.</p><p>Aden fisted a hand in her long hair, wrapping it around his fingers as he bent low over her back and tugged her head backwards, bearing her neck.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled against her hot skin. And that was all the warning she got before his fangs bit into her vein, and her entire body convulsed in orgasm. She buried her scream in the bed covering, her hips bucking against him as his fingers slipped under her body and deep between her thighs, delving into her wetness until he found her clit, then stroking and pinching until Sid thought she\u2019d die as wave after wave of sensation rolled through her body, scorching her nerves, winding her muscles so tightly she could no longer move, only feel, as Aden\u2019s thick cock continued to pound into her, as his snarl of possession shivered against her skin.</p><p>He lifted his head, his fangs sliding free of her vein, his breath a silken brush over the flushed skin of her neck.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he demanded, his tongue roughly licking her wounds closed.</p><p>Sid had trouble making sense of his words, her mind fogged with bliss, her synapses overwhelmed with sensation.</p><p>Aden\u2019s hand came down sharply on her ass, and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She thought hard, then finally realized what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she agreed, panting. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s roar of climax sounded like a shout of victory, his hot release filling her, setting off a final orgasm that left her overcome by too many emotions, too many feelings all crowding together, all demanding that she feel at the same time.</p><p>Aden collapsed over her sweaty back, breathing deeply as he sucked in oxygen, one arm braced to her side, the other stroking her face tenderly.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, habibi,\u201d he murmured, his tongue brushing her cheek, tasting her tears.</p><p>Sid nodded and tried to concentrate on just that. Breathing. Inhale, exhale. Slow and steady.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she managed to ask, then drew in another lungful of air. \u201cThat word you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has different meanings, but for you, it means sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHabibi,\u201d she repeated, testing the syllables.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he agreed. Sliding a muscled arm around her waist, he dragged them both farther up onto the bed, settling against the pillows with her a limp weight against his side.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay here today,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because Silas sent that guy on the train, but I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Sid said fretfully. \u201cWhat would she want with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never kept a woman around before. Maybe she thinks I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fishing, Sidonie. What do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>Sid found enough energy to drape herself over his chest, so that their eyes were more or less even, his expression filled with a patient humor that made her want to bite something, him for starters. She blinked at the thought. She\u2019d never been a biter before she met Aden. Come to think of it, she\u2019d never done a lot of things before she met Aden. This bad boy fling was turning out to be a lot more than she thought. The question was, what did Aden think it was, and was Sidonie about to get her heart broken?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, hoping she looked more alert than she felt. \u201cI like you. Probably more than I should, given your . . . dangerous profession.\u201d</p><p>Aden laughed out loud. \u201cIs that what we\u2019re calling it? My dangerous profession?\u201d</p><p>Sid slapped his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun. What would you like me to call it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire, Sidonie. Violence is in my nature. If that makes me dangerous\u2014and it fucking well does\u2014I make no apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want an apology. I like you the way you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the violence. You\u2019re as bloody-minded as I am. It\u2019s an unexpected bonus in such a wholesome all-American girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost people would consider it sick, not a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. So what is this, then? Am I the flavor of the month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, surely longer than that. At least six weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAden!\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m being serious here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you are.\u201d He stroked his hand over her face, lifting the heavy weight of her sweaty hair and brushing it back over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think in forever terms, habibi. Forever is a very long time for a vampire. But I find myself uncommonly attached to you. And when I think about some other man so much as touching your hand, I want to rip his heart out. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>Sid smiled happily, then stretched up to kiss his mouth. She intended it to be quick, but as always Aden had his own plans. One hand on the nape of her neck, he wrapped the other around her back and held her in place, taking the kiss deeper, his tongue twisting around hers, tasting every inch of her mouth until Sid felt an impossibly powerful desire rising once again. She moaned as Aden closed his teeth over her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun is nearly here.\u201d</p><p>Sid voiced a wordless protest. She didn\u2019t want to give him up to the sun or anything else.</p><p>Aden rolled her beneath him with a rumbling growl, his fingers going unerringly to her drenched pussy. Sid flexed her hips, thrusting against his hand in a silent demand, spreading her legs wider when his clever fingers dipped into her sex, his thumb circling the tight bud of her clit. She started to grab his hand, although whether it was to crush him against her vulnerable flesh or to pull him away, she couldn\u2019t have said. It didn\u2019t matter, because Aden bit down on her lip with a snarled warning.</p><p>Sid cried out in protest, but slid her hand along his powerful arm, stroking the smooth muscle up to this thick shoulder, before threading her fingers through his hair. Their kiss became deeper, more frantic as he continued to stroke her, as her pussy began to tighten around his fingers. Her clit was unbearably sensitive, every caress of his thumb sending a fresh jolt of pleasure, turning her nipples into hard pearls of exquisite sensation as they rubbed against the rough hair on his chest.</p> <p>The orgasm rolled over her like a wave, unstoppable even if she\u2019d tried. Aden\u2019s fingers continued to fuck her, his thumb a constant pressure against her clit, until the wave crashed, and she screamed into his mouth, her back bowing off the bed with the force of her climax, his weight the only thing keeping her from thrashing off the bed.</p><p>Aden kissed her, swallowing her screams, and when her screams turned to tears because it was all too much\u2014too much sensation, too much love, damn it\u2014he swallowed her cries, too, kissing away her tears as she held on to him, not wanting to let go.</p><p>He held her as she drowsed in his arms, until in the distance, from down the long hallway, she heard the distinctive trilling of the elevator bell as the doors closed, and the car dropped to the fifth floor for the day.</p><p>Aden brushed the sweaty mess of her hair away from her face. \u201cThis room will lock soon, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes struggled to open. \u201cWill I be stuck here?\u201d she mumbled, half asleep.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, laughing a little. \u201cYou can stay here as long as you want. You can shower . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed open to see if he was being snarky with the shower comment. He winked at her, which could have meant almost anything, but she was too tired to figure it out and way too tired to do anything about it anyway.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut once you leave my suite, you won\u2019t be able to get back in until sunset. So be certain you have everything you need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmkay,\u201d she murmured, ready to go back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cSidonie, are you listening? Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyelids up and stared at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pretend not to laugh this time, which told her how she must look. She scowled at him, and his expression became deadly serious, but she didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with her scowl.</p><p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d he said, holding her chin in his fingers and forcing her to meet his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t leave the office. You can use the computers, the phones, whatever you like. Hamilton and his security team will be manning the fifth floor, so you\u2019ll be safe up here. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said grumpily, jerking her chin away from his fingers. \u201cYou haven\u2019t completely fucked my brains out, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he murmured, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s time, habibi. Kiss me good night.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him, soft and seductive, putting everything she was feeling, everything she couldn\u2019t say out loud, into the kiss. \u201cGood night, Aden,\u201d she whispered, then jumped in surprise as the shields came down over the door in the next room.</p><p>She laughed nervously, feeling silly for reacting, but Aden only smiled. He pulled the covers out from underneath them, until they were both lying on the clean sheets of the bed, and then he settled back against the pillows and closed his eyes.</p><p>Between one breath and the next, she knew he was . . . gone. Not dead. Just no longer there.</p><p>Sid watched him for a long time. He was still breathing, although not as deeply, nor as often. She put her ear to his chest and heard his heart beating very slowly, but with a steady, strong rhythm.</p><p>Somewhere out there, the sun was shining, trapping their enemies in their holes. But she and Aden and the others were here. And they were safe, for one more day.</p><p>She believed that. She really did.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>SID KICKED BACK on the leather couch in front of the TV, laptop in front of her, a bottle of cold water and an energy bar close at hand. One thing Aden hadn\u2019t thought of, when telling her she should stay here for the day, was the food selection in the office. Human food, that was.</p><p>There was plenty of booze to be had. Apparently vampires drank like fish. Who knew?</p><p>There was also an entire shelf of bottled water in the big refrigerator which took up most of the floor space in the office\u2019s tiny kitchen. The rest of the shelves were stacked with bags of blood, the kind you\u2019d find in a blood bank. Sid wondered what their supply chain was. Dresner had told her that people volunteered at the nightclub-like blood houses, partying with vamps and letting them drink from the vein. But where\u2019d the rest of this come from? She pictured a special room in every vampire-owned nightclub, with a staff of trained phlebotomists always ready, just waiting for donations. Cookies and orange juice available.</p><p>Sid chuckled. It was kind of funny, but also probably not far from the truth. Come to think of it, she wouldn\u2019t have minded some of those cookies and orange juice right about now. She\u2019d found a lone bag of stale chips that must have been left behind by someone months ago.</p><p>Thank God for her backpack and its supply of energy bars, but by the time sunset rolled around, she\u2019d be making a beeline to the nearest restaurant and some real food.</p><p>In the meantime, she was making do. She\u2019d showered and changed, feeling every strained muscle, every bit of deliciously tender flesh. There was a unique soreness to a woman\u2019s body after sex, muscles used, secret places rubbed and invaded. Sid wasn\u2019t an innocent; she had prior experience of that soreness. But never like this. Sex with Aden was like nothing she\u2019d ever known before, nothing she\u2019d ever thought existed. And she could hardly wait to do it all over again.</p><p>She smiled to herself, wishing she could be there when Aden woke, imagining his eyes opening, his broad chest expanding as his lungs drew their first deep breath of the night. And then he\u2019d roll over and wrap her in his big arms, tucking her beneath his body, one thigh slipping between hers, the weight of his cock against her thigh...</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath of her own. She felt herself growing wet, her pussy aching as she remembered the feel of Aden\u2019s thick shaft sliding in and out.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sid, get a grip,\u201d she muttered and forced her attention back to her computer screen and the article she was writing about hidden slavery in America. That was a splash of cold water on any arousal she\u2019d been feeling. This was the reason she was here. Meeting Aden had been an amazing bit of luck all around, but her purpose in getting inside the world of vampires had been to expose their illicit business practices.</p><p>Had been being the operative words there. She\u2019d had every intention of rousing the peasants with their torches and pitchforks, of dragging Klemens into the light and letting him burn. But now it was Aden she\u2019d be exposing, and that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Whatever sins he might be guilty of, selling women into slavery definitely wasn\u2019t one of them. He\u2019d been ruthless the other night in killing every one of the slavers, but when it came to the slaves themselves, he\u2019d shown tremendous care. Knowing his background, it made sense to her, but not everyone would have come out of his horrific experience with compassion for others. Studies had shown over and over again that some of the worst abusers had been abused themselves. It spoke to Aden\u2019s strength of character that he chose to protect the weak instead.</p><p>But Sid\u2019s story still needed to be told. Americans needed to know what was going on under their noses. Maybe she could play down the vampire angle. The fact that the slave ring had been controlled by vampires wasn\u2019t that important in the overall scheme of things. There had been plenty of humans down the food chain, too.</p><p>Her cell phone rang, and she glanced over. It was her oldest brother again. He\u2019d been calling ever since the weekend, wanting to know what was up with her, why she\u2019d left not just the party but the whole town so suddenly. She wondered what he\u2019d say if she told him the truth, that she was shacked up with a vampire, and not just any vampire, but the next Lord of the Midwest. He\u2019d probably send the men with their white jackets after her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sid touched the side of her neck. It was tender, but the wounds were almost gone. If she hadn\u2019t been so pale, there\u2019d probably be nothing left to see, no evidence of a vampire\u2019s bite at all.</p><p>Her phone was still ringing. Two more rings, and it would go to voice mail. She should really answer this time. If her brother Jamie didn\u2019t hear her voice soon, he\u2019d get someone to knock on her condo door. And when no one answered the door, he\u2019d get the super involved. Jamie took his responsibilities as the oldest child very seriously. Particularly when it came to his baby sister.</p><p>She exhaled a long-suffering sigh and took the call.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout damn time,\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou disappear from the party and then don\u2019t even bother to answer the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t you get my e-mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Sid? I\u2019ve been calling for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou know how I get when I\u2019m finishing a story.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted wordlessly, but said, \u201cSo the slave story\u2019s almost done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be coming back home then?\u201d</p><p>That had been Sid\u2019s plan all along. Her move to Chicago was supposed to be temporary. A few months to write a story about drugs and violence, then back home to the suburbs. But the drug story had become a slavery story, and then Janey had died, and the slavery story had become a crusade to shut the whole ugly thing down. And now it was almost two years since she\u2019d left her parents\u2019 safe and cozy suburb for the wilds of the big city.</p><p>If Jamie had asked her that same question two weeks ago, she\u2019d have told him, yes \u0327 that she was leaving Chicago and coming home soon. Her condo lease was up in a month, and she\u2019d have been more than ready to get out of the big city and back to the quiet comfort of her parents\u2019 suburb. There\u2019d been nothing keeping her here.</p><p>But now that she\u2019d met Aden, the idea of leaving Chicago made her chest hurt, because it meant leaving him. And she didn\u2019t know if she could do that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered Jamie\u2019s question honestly.</p><p>\u201cMom misses you, you know. So does Dad, but Mom especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry. But . . . I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I hear Will\u2019s getting married,\u201d he ventured carefully, as if testing the waters.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m staying in Chicago, Jamie,\u201d she told him patiently. \u201cWill and I haven\u2019t been a couple for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d check. I\u2019d hate to break the guy\u2019s bones, but you know I would if he hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill would never hurt me.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that that was part of the problem, that Will was simply too nice, just like every other man she\u2019d met until now. She hadn\u2019t realized it herself until she\u2019d met Aden. Apparently, she needed a man with an edge.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well . . . I\u2019ll be in town next week,\u201d Jamie told her. \u201cWe can do lunch, or dinner. You can cook for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sid made a dismissive noise. \u201cYeah, right. You can take me out, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you ever going to get a husband if you don\u2019t cook, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m looking for one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom wants grandbabies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s got two perfectly good sons who can pop them out for her.\u201d She paused. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got something to tell me? Maybe the popping doesn\u2019t work so well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sid, that\u2019s disgusting. You\u2019ve been hanging around the wrong class of people for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to go, but we\u2019ll definitely get together next week, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Call me when you get here, we\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d Sid disconnected, then put her computer aside and sat up, feeling suddenly restless. Maybe it was the call from her brother, trying to drag her back within the circled wagons. If it were up to her family, Sid would never leave the suburbs. She\u2019d get married and have a few grandchildren for her mom to spoil, if not with Will, then with someone equally suitable. Suitable meaning one of their own\u2014white, educated, and moneyed. She didn\u2019t know how much formal education Aden had, but he clearly had plenty of money. On the other hand, she was pretty sure suitable didn\u2019t include a vampire, no matter what.</p><p>Needing to stretch some of her sex-sore muscles, and desperate to think of something besides her immediate future, she grabbed a bottle of water and headed for the hallway. Aden\u2019s office was one of three interconnected rooms, with the receptionist area the only one with a door to the hallway. The other two rooms opened off the receptionist area, with Aden\u2019s office the largest of the three and the only one with windows. The lounging area where she\u2019d been hanging out was the other room, with its small kitchen area and man-cave ambience.</p><p>Walking out into the hallway, Sid paused and glanced in both directions. Aden\u2019s suite, and what she assumed were the apartments of his other vampires, were all to her right, secured behind the heavy red doors. At the other end, to Sid\u2019s left was the elevator, and that was it. As she stood there, she was abruptly struck by the nearly total silence. No phones rang, no music played. There was the quiet rush of air that was the heating system, but nothing else.</p><p>She felt suddenly very alone. And very vulnerable. Not simply for her own sake, but for Aden and the other vampires. There was a war of sorts going on in this city. Call it a challenge or a competition, but vampires were dying left and right. What if one of Aden\u2019s enemies decided to play dirty and attack during the day? Did the vampire culture have rules about these things? This was the sort of question she might have asked Professor Dresner not long ago. But for now, she had to rely on her own judgment, and her head was telling her that if, by some chance, any enemies managed to get to this floor, Aden had no one but her standing between him and disaster.</p><p>She spun around and headed for her backpack, which she\u2019d left in the lounge area. She hadn\u2019t told Aden about her gun, thinking he wouldn\u2019t have approved. Besides, he\u2019d only have insisted he didn\u2019t need her protection, because his security measures would hold, what with Earl Hamilton guarding the fifth floor and the private elevator locked down. But empires had been lost because the loser believed himself invulnerable, and Sid had studied enough to know that no one was perfectly safe. If the attackers were willing to die, anybody could be gotten to. And if Sid had learned one thing about vampires, it was that their followers would do anything for their vampire master . . . or mistress.</p><p>Crossing to her backpack, she pulled out her subcompact 9mm Glock. It didn\u2019t look like much compared to the big Glocks, but it was enough to stop a human, and since the sun was high in the sky, that was all she\u2019d have to worry about. After dark, Aden didn\u2019t need her little firepower. He was more than capable of defending himself.</p><p>Shoving her shirt up and her jeans down, she wrapped the bellyband around her waist, then pulled everything back into place. She\u2019d originally chosen the bellyband holster because she didn\u2019t want to advertise the fact that she was armed. With the lower edge of the bellyband tucked beneath the waistband of her pants, and her usual fleece hoodie adding another layer of concealment, no one would know she was carrying unless they took the time to pat her down. And if someone had enough control over her that they were patting her down, the fight was probably already over.</p><p>Checking the ten-round magazine, she slammed it home, then worked the slide, chambering a round. Going hot was what her firearms instructor had called it. It saved a few seconds on the first round, and a few seconds, he\u2019d emphasized, might be all she had.</p><p>Sliding the Glock into the elastic, and putting her spare mag into its own special pocket, she pulled her long-sleeved T-shirt over it, but left her hoodie unzipped for now. Feeling slightly gunfighterish, she paced back to the hallway and down to the elevator, where she spent a few minutes staring up at the floor display, until the steadily lit number \u201c1\u201d began to flicker in her sight. She blinked rapidly and decided it wasn\u2019t going to change. No one was storming the battlements, at least not while she stood there waiting. And besides, she was getting hungry again, and she\u2019d left her pitiful allotment of energy bars on the coffee table in the lounge area.</p><p>Grabbing a fresh bottle of the water from the fridge, she settled back on the big leather couch and squirmed around a bit, before finally finding a position where the gun didn\u2019t dig into her belly or scrape against her hip bone. She unwrapped the first energy bar, flipped on the TV, and felt her eyes begin to droop almost immediately. She hadn\u2019t gotten more than an hour\u2019s sleep last night. Setting aside the tasteless energy bar, she settled into the thick pillows and let sleep take her.</p><p>Sid came awake with a jolt, her heart racing as she stared at the unfamiliar room, taking in the giant TV screen which currently showed a bunch of hyperactive game show contestants celebrating mutely. Aden\u2019s office, she remembered. She was in Aden\u2019s office, and something had woken her. She sat up and checked the time on her cell phone. It was barely noon. Long hours stretched ahead of her, and she was beginning to hate the isolation of being locked in here.</p><p>She was reaching for her bottle of water, her fingers not yet touching the plastic, when she heard the very last sound she\u2019d expected to hear. The elevator dinged faintly, as if the car was on its way up and she was hearing its progress through the lower floors. Was that what had woken her? It was so quiet in here that the smallest noise would seem loud.</p><p>She stood, listening. And heard it again. Maybe the elevator was simply moving up and down between the lower floors. Maybe she\u2019d misunderstood what Aden had said about the car being locked down. Or maybe Earl Hamilton was coming up for some reason. Yes, that was probably it. Maybe he knew she was here and was checking on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smoothing her T-shirt down and patting the gun for reassurance, she walked softly through the receptionist area and back to the hallway, where she paused. Sticking just her head through the doorway, she peeked down at the elevator and waited.</p><p>Nothing. Not even the earlier dinging she\u2019d heard. That was good, right?</p><p>Feeling somewhat cowardly hanging back in the office, she ventured out into the corridor. Sticking close to the wall with the elevator on it, one hand running along the smooth surface, she approached the elevator cautiously. She could hear the hum of the car\u2019s movement, the rumbling slide of the thick cables.</p> <p>Standing there next to the elevator, she cursed herself for an idiot. She should have called Hamilton from the office. He was probably on speed dial, or if not, she had his number stored in her cell from the other morning.</p><p>She was just turning to head back for the office when the thunk of an arriving car froze her in her tracks. She backed away, staring, afraid to breathe as she watched the elevator doors slide almost soundlessly open.</p><p>Men poured out of the elevator, their faces and clothes bloodied, guns much bigger than hers already in their hands. She screamed, her hand going to the flat bulge of her gun, but it was too little, too late. One of them swung a closed fist, striking her hard enough that she spun around and slammed face-first into the wall just outside the elevator. She tasted blood in the back of her throat and felt her nose swelling shut from the force of the blow. Behind her, someone grabbed her by the hair and yanked, torqueing her neck as he pulled her back to her feet and held her upright. Someone else wrenched her hands behind her back and zipped a plastic tie around her wrists, jerking it so tight that the plastic band cut into her skin. She barely had a chance to cry out before a wet cloth was pressed against her mouth. Unable to breathe through her swollen nose, Sid sucked in a breath through her mouth and nearly choked on the sharp, acrid taste, fighting not to throw up. Primitive instinct had her drawing a second breath, and stars dotted the blackness behind her eyelids.</p><p>Her last thought was that they wanted her alive, and that was a good thing. But she couldn\u2019t remember why.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>ADEN WOKE TO a rare fury. His eyes opened, and he leapt from the bed, swallowing his howl of rage as he scanned the empty room, searching for whatever danger had his fangs splitting his gums, his fingers curling into claws. Nothing. The room was dark and silent. Searching farther, he sought out and found all four of his offspring, each just beginning to wake as the sun dropped deeper below the horizon.</p><p>He straightened from his defensive crouch, his heartbeat slowing to normal and his breathing evening out as the adrenaline drained away. He glanced over at the empty bed and thought of Sidonie. Reaching out again, he exerted his power in a search of the offices beyond the safety of his rooms, seeking the frail beat of her human heart.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t there. Or she wasn\u2019t alive.</p><p>Grabbing a pair of sweats on the fly, he ran for the door and input the release code, pulling the pants on as the shutters retracted slowly, as the bolts slid into the wall with the heavy thunk of solid steel. He didn\u2019t wait, but ducked under the still-moving shutters as soon as the bolts were clear and the door could open.</p><p>The smell of blood hit him like a cudgel, knocking him back half a step before he raced down the hall and slammed through the security doors, following a scent he knew well. He\u2019d taken Sidonie\u2019s blood. It flowed through his veins, it pulsed in his heart. Her scent drew him not to the office as he expected but all the way to the end of the hallway, to the closed doors of the elevator and the smear of her blood on the wall.</p><p>The phone started ringing as he crouched down. Sidonie\u2019s blood was in the carpet, too, and it wasn\u2019t alone. There was other blood there. Human blood, and more than one person. But the scent was too faint to tell him who or even how many, as if they\u2019d carried the blood on their clothes and lost only trace amounts when they struggled . . . with Sidonie.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and tried to reconstruct what had happened, using only what his nose could tell him.</p><p>The phone stopped ringing. He heard an authoritative voice leaving a message, but didn\u2019t bother to listen to the words. Nearly silent footsteps and the unique awareness of his offspring informed him that Bastien was awake and functioning and now stood in the office doorway, listening to the message.</p><p>That same awareness told him a moment later that his lieutenant had come into the hallway and was waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Bastien?\u201d Aden asked quietly, as he dipped his fingers in Sidonie\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cThat was the police, Sire. The caller didn\u2019t say so, but the lobby doorman is dead. I heard someone else discussing it in the background. They\u2019re interviewing tenants and are very unhappy that they cannot access our two penthouse floors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Hamilton?\u201d Kage asked, loping down the hall in time to hear Bastien\u2019s statement.</p><p>That was the question, Aden thought to himself. Where was his daylight security chief, and why wasn\u2019t he the one who\u2019d called to report instead of the police?</p><p>\u201cThe invaders were here,\u201d Aden said, standing and eyeing the blood smeared on his fingers. \u201cThey took Sidonie.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to face his people, all four of whom now stood in the hallway, watching him with identical expressions\u2014puzzlement and anger, but no fear, he was proud to see. They had confidence in him, in his ability to protect them and to kill whoever had dared orchestrate this brazen attack. Vampires didn\u2019t send minions to attack in daylight. It was one of their few taboos. And to do it during a territorial competition was unheard of.</p><p>\u201cWe need to check on Hamilton and the others,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cAnd the police?\u201d Bastien asked.</p><p>\u201cFor all they know, we haven\u2019t risen yet. Let them wait. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They took the stairs down the single flight to the floor where Aden\u2019s daylight security people bunked when on duty. Travis went through the door first, shoving it open hard enough to crash into the wall and rushing through in a burst of vampire speed. The one thing that was certain was that the invaders had been human. If any had still been lurking, waiting to catch Aden and his people unawares, they would have been unable to track Travis\u2019s movement.</p><p>But there was no one there. Aden knew that as soon as the door opened. The scent of blood had grown stronger with every step he took. And now, he was nearly blown back by the stench. It was more than blood. It was a smell he hadn\u2019t experienced in more than a hundred years, the reek of a human battlefield\u2014sweat and blood, and over it all the stink of bowels gutted or released in death.</p><p>\u201cSpread out,\u201d Aden ordered. \u201cSave anyone you can, and don\u2019t forget to wipe their memories after. Yell if you need me. And find Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>He followed his own orders, going from man to man, rendering aid, slicing his wrist and dripping blood into their mouths to accelerate healing where possible. Closing their eyes and offering a word to whatever gods were listening when it was too late for anything else.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Kage called. \u201cI\u2019ve got Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>Aden strode down the hallway to the control room, where video feeds showed him the lobby and every door in the building. Earl Hamilton lay on the floor against the far wall. Kage stood, making room for Aden at the injured man\u2019s side. It was obvious that Hamilton had taken the brunt of the attackers\u2019 rage. He\u2019d been the only one with access to the sixth floor during daylight\u2014the elevator and stairs having separate but equally complex codes\u2014and the invaders had tortured him to get it. Every finger was broken, the joints swollen and bloodied where they\u2019d used something like a hammer to do the breaking. Hamilton\u2019s face was so badly beaten, he was barely recognizable, and they\u2019d stabbed him multiple times, as if they\u2019d tried to kill him once they had what they wanted.</p><p>\u201cEarl,\u201d Aden said, stroking a hand over the human\u2019s forehead and using his power over human minds to ease the man\u2019s agony. It took all of Aden\u2019s considerable control to kneel there, sending waves of reassurance and calm, while a part of him kept imagining Sidonie\u2019s pale skin and delicate bones, her lovely face. Kept imagining her at the mercy of men who were capable of this kind of brutality.</p><p>He wanted to rage to the heavens, to hunt down whoever had done this and to do to them a hundredfold what they\u2019d done to Hamilton and the others. And he desperately wanted to find Sidonie and bring her back to safety.</p><p>But first he owed a debt to Earl Hamilton. Using his fangs, he sliced his wrist open and put it against Hamilton\u2019s mouth, urging the man to drink his fill.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Bastien cautioned. \u201cLet me give him my blood. If Silas is behind this, she may use the confusion to challenge\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aden gave him a cold look. \u201cEvery one of these men offered his life in my defense. If I can help them, my blood is theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to the others, Bastien. No one else dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those who are already dead?\u201d</p><p>Aden closed his eyes against the unexpected pain. He\u2019d employed guards for decades, but he\u2019d always considered daylight security to be more for appearances than necessity. He\u2019d trusted his electronic locks and his vault doors to keep him safe. He\u2019d never considered the possibility that any of his daylight guards would need to die on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cWe treat them with honor. Call the funeral home, you know which one. And notify their families. We\u2019ll cover all expenses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir employment contracts cover that, my lord, as well as compensation to the families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the good it will do them,\u201d Aden muttered.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, my lord, but you need to speak to the police.\u201d</p><p>Aden gazed down at Hamilton. The healing benefits of Aden\u2019s blood were already obvious. It would take days for the man to heal, but he was breathing more easily, and his color was improving. If Aden had been willing to give him even more blood, he would have healed in hours rather than days. But Bastien was right. Whoever had done this wasn\u2019t finished. And if the perpetrator was Silas, she could be planning to challenge him while he was weak or distracted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden stood. Silas didn\u2019t know him very well, if she thought this was enough to weaken him.</p><p>\u201cBastien, you\u2019re with me. We\u2019ll talk to the police.\u201d They walked out into the main room. \u201cThe rest of you, clean this up. I\u2019ll make sure the police remain downstairs\u201d\u2014another way of saying he\u2019d nudge the human investigators\u2019 minds in the right direction\u2014\u201cbut I want these men moved to their bunks to recover. The bodies can be put in one of the side rooms for now, until the funeral home picks them up. And, Trav, get the appropriate cleaning crew in here. Make sure they arrive after the police are gone. And someone start checking the video feed of the lobby.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the sweatpants which was all he had on. They were covered in blood and wholly unsuitable.</p> <p>\u201cI need to change clothes.\u201d He glanced at Bastien who was similarly half-dressed. \u201cYou, too. We need to make an impression. We will assure them that our security was never breached, and that we will, of course, cooperate fully.\u201d</p><p>Aden raced up the stairs with Bastien in his wake, forcing himself to focus on the details of what needed to be done right now in order to protect himself and his vampires. Entering his suite, he shoved aside the rage that was eating him alive, ignored the images of Sidonie\u2019s fair skin covered in blood, her face filled with terror. It wouldn\u2019t do her any good for him to storm all over the city in a fruitless search. He\u2019d taken enough of her blood that if he got close enough, he could track her.</p><p>But Chicago was a big city, and her abductors could be hiding her anywhere. She might not even be in the city any longer. He didn\u2019t know when the attack had occurred, didn\u2019t know how many hours they\u2019d had to spirit her away, to torment her . . .</p><p>He picked up a heavy brass sculpture and threw it at the wall with such force that it hung there embedded in the plaster. He stared, not seeing it, his fists clenched with the need to hit something, someone. When he found whoever was behind this, their life would become nothing but pain. They would live a very long time, and every moment of it would be spent learning what it meant to defy a vampire lord, to take from him the only woman in his entire long life that he\u2019d ever cared for. The only woman who\u2019d ever honestly cared for him.</p><p>Turning away from the destroyed wall, he dressed quickly, pausing only to eye his reflection in the mirror, to straighten his tie and button the double-breasted jacket. The police were expecting a vampire, fangs and all. He\u2019d give them a solid citizen, a businessman who was shocked at the intrusion of violence into his ordered life.</p> <p>And if they didn\u2019t believe that, he\u2019d wipe their minds until they couldn\u2019t remember what they\u2019d had for breakfast. He didn\u2019t have time for this shit. Someone had broken every rule of vampire society, someone had taken his Sidonie, and they would pay before the sun rose in the morning.</p><p>SIDONIE TWISTED and yanked at the plastic ties binding her wrists until her skin was slick with blood, but she couldn\u2019t get them off. Maybe if she\u2019d had something sharp to cut them with, some edge she could use, but there was nothing. They\u2019d tossed her into the trunk of a car, closed the lid, and taken off. The trunk was airless and reeked of exhaust fumes and something dead. The smell was nauseating, and she was fighting a constant battle against the urge to vomit, which could be fatal since her mouth was taped over, and she\u2019d watched enough crime shows to know she would choke to death.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been stuck in this damn trunk. She\u2019d faded out more than once, maybe from the fumes, or maybe from the blow to her head when they\u2019d first taken her. But it left her unsure as to how long they\u2019d been traveling. She only knew it was long enough for her to wonder where she\u2019d gone wrong, how she\u2019d found herself tied up and in the trunk of a car.</p><p>She sighed. It would be easy to blame Aden, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. Her current predicament was the multiplied effect of so many choices made over the years, beginning with her decision to forego the usual hometown stories of pancake breakfasts and basketball heroes in favor of pursuing what she considered serious journalism. Stories that could make a difference. She\u2019d made a difference all right. Janey was dead, and she was probably going to join her before the night was over.</p><p>Was it even night yet? It had been full daylight when they\u2019d taken her. She\u2019d been half out of it from whatever had been on the wet rag they\u2019d slapped over her face, but she remembered that much. The sun had still been shining when they\u2019d dragged her out a back door and into the alley behind Aden\u2019s building.</p><p>Her heart lurched in a sudden burst of fresh fear. Aden. She had to believe he was okay, that the intruders had never made it past the last, and most hardened, layers of his security. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d had time, and besides, why take her if they had Aden?</p> <p>But what would he think when he woke and found her gone? Would he find her blood on the wall where she\u2019d hit her face? Or had her abductors cleaned that up, leaving him to wonder what had happened? Would he think she\u2019d run? That she\u2019d left him? Tears filled her eyes at the thought. Every woman in his life had betrayed him. But Sid hadn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t. Did he understand that?</p><p>Sid swallowed her tears, forced herself to think with her brain instead of her heart. She didn\u2019t think Aden would believe she\u2019d run. And even if he did, he\u2019d find her. Aden wasn\u2019t the kind of man a woman walked out on\u2014he was the kind of man who made sure he did the walking. So, he\u2019d come looking for her, even if it was only to dump her.</p><p>A new horrible thought struck her. What if that was what her abductors wanted? What if she was bait for a trap to catch Aden? She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She wouldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>She sighed, or she tried to. It was difficult with tape over her mouth and a nose that was so swollen she could barely breathe. Still, big words from the little lady all tied up in the trunk. She shifted awkwardly, but there was no comfortable way to lie scrunched up in this small space with her hands bound behind her back. They could have at least kidnapped her in a bigger car. Her head throbbed, her shoulders ached, and there was a hard something digging into the side of her belly. She tried moving again, but the hard thing kept digging... Sid froze. The hard thing was her gun! They must not have searched her, or at least not very well. The knowledge made her more determined than ever to get her hands free, but it didn\u2019t make it easier. The more she struggled, the deeper the plastic seemed to bury itself in her skin.</p><p>She made a frustrated sound behind the thick tape then forced herself to calm down, to think rationally. Her gun was useless if she couldn\u2019t get to it. She still needed her hands free, but it wasn\u2019t serving any purpose for her to thrash about. She had to think smart, and that meant planning ahead. Eventually, they\u2019d have to open the trunk and get her out of here. Even if the plan was to use her as bait, they\u2019d have to have a place to lure Aden to, someplace better than this car. There was no way to predict where that would be, though. So, the only thing she could do for now was be ready to take advantage of whatever opportunity presented itself. As impossible as it seemed, what she needed to do now was to rest, to turn off her head and sleep.</p><p>Good luck with that, she thought. But she closed her eyes and focused on relaxing one muscle at a time, feeling the dregs of the drug still in her system, letting the exhaustion take her . . .</p><p>She jerked awake when someone pounded on the trunk lid, surprised to realize she\u2019d actually managed to sleep. The pounding came again, simply to scare her, she thought, because a moment later a key scraped in the lock, and the lid popped open. Her first reaction was surprise that it was nearly as dark outside the trunk as it had been inside. She must have been stuck in there for hours. But her next reaction was pure relief as cold, fresh air washed over her face, and she drew a strained breath that didn\u2019t reek of fumes and death.</p><p>Her relief was short-lived as one of two men staring down at her grabbed her upper arm and dragged her from the trunk, jerking her shoulder and whacking her ankle painfully against some sort of trailer hitch on the back of the car. Her legs, cramped from too long in a small space, couldn\u2019t hold her when she tried to stand, but her abductor didn\u2019t even try to catch her. He let her fall onto an asphalt driveway, and her elbow cracked against the hard surface. Her cry of pain was muffled by the tape still covering her mouth, but at the same time she registered the fact that the tape was no longer as tight as it had been. The heat and stress of hours in the small space had left her sweaty, her face tear-streaked, and all of that had combined to loosen the tape a little. The knowledge didn\u2019t do much to free her, but it made her feel better somehow. It gave her hope.</p> <p>The man gripped her arm once more, and every muscle shrieked in protest as she stumbled upright. She closed her eyes, shutting out the sight of her abductors, wishing she could shut out the whole experience as easily. Everything hurt, from her swollen nose to her right ankle and everything in between.</p><p>\u201cWalk, bitch. I ain\u2019t carrying you.\u201d</p><p>Sid really looked at her guards for the first time. She couldn\u2019t be positive\u2014everything had happened so fast\u2014but she didn\u2019t think either one of these two had been among her abductors this morning. Maybe that was what had taken so long. Maybe they\u2019d driven her around until these two could pick her up. Or maybe they\u2019d been parked somewhere while she slept. Or, hell, maybe she was simply mistaken about who\u2019d been in on the original kidnapping. One thing she felt sure of . . . whoever was behind all of this was waiting for her in the small clapboard house at the end of this driveway.</p><p>She swiveled her head around as much as she could. The neighborhood was familiar in a way that told her she\u2019d either been here before, or, equally possible, she\u2019d been to someplace just like it. Badly run-down houses were squeezed onto tiny lots and surrounded by apartment buildings in even worse shape. Cars lined both sides of the street, some up on blocks and all of them old and badly used. The street was dark, lit mostly by the light of the half moon, the street lights either shot or burned out. And it struck her. This was the same neighborhood where she\u2019d staked out some of Klemens\u2019s drug dealers. Not this house, but it was close enough that it worried her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her captor caught her looking around and shook her like a rag doll.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be looking at my \u2019hood, bitch. This place got nothin\u2019 to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Black splotches swam in her vision, but Sid fought them away, determined to remain conscious. She needed to see as much as she could in order to plan her escape. Some people might consider thoughts of escape ridiculous in her current situation, but that didn\u2019t stop Sid. Situations could change. People could grow lazy or complacent and give her an opening. She wouldn\u2019t need much. Although, she thought, frowning, she would need to get her hands free.</p> <p>That thought had a deflating effect, and for the first time since her abduction, she felt the full weight of her predicament. Her shoulders slumped dejectedly. Her captors saw and laughed as they dragged her through the side door and into the house.</p><p>The sturdy door and elaborate lock confirmed that this wasn\u2019t an ordinary house, that it was probably used by drug dealers. But Sid couldn\u2019t imagine what they\u2019d want with her. She\u2019d done an article or two on the drug culture in Chicago, but that had been more than a year ago, and the stories hadn\u2019t garnered enough attention to inconvenience anyone, much less do real damage.</p><p>As they hustled her through a filthy kitchen smelling of grease and old trash, however, she had a second, chilling thought. Aden had wiped out the heart of the slave network, but he hadn\u2019t caught the one vampire Sid was absolutely sure had been the driver behind the whole thing. Carl Pinto. And Klemens\u2019s slave trade had always been closely tied to his drug dealings.</p><p>She felt a tremor that started in her stomach and radiated outward, shaking her entire body before it was finished. She wanted to attribute it to the drugs they\u2019d given her, or to the adrenaline overload, but it was fear, pure and simple. She\u2019d seen what Pinto was capable of, his cruelty and callousness. The women he\u2019d trafficked had been nothing but meat to him. Objects to be bought and sold, and if they weren\u2019t profitable, they were crushed and thrown away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, bitch,\u201d her captor said, reacting to her trembling. \u201cThe man\u2019s lookin\u2019 forward to takin\u2019 care of you.\u201d</p> <p>Sid couldn\u2019t have responded to the taunt if she\u2019d wanted to, not with the tape still covering her mouth. As it was, however, she was too busy trying to stay on her feet, trying to come up with a scenario that didn\u2019t end up with her dead or shipped off as a slave. She was pretty sure she\u2019d rather be dead.</p><p>\u201cSidonie Reid,\u201d someone growled, and she looked up to find the very vampire she\u2019d most feared. Carl Pinto sat in a big leather chair, the only piece of furniture in the room that wasn\u2019t falling apart.</p><p>Sid swallowed hard, her heart pounding so violently that it felt like it was crawling up her throat and had to be forced back to where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve caused me a lot of trouble, little girl. A lot of trouble,\u201d he repeated thoughtfully, almost as if he was talking to himself. \u201cBut no matter. I\u2019ve got you now.\u201d He nodded to the guard holding her arm, and she was shoved forward and to her knees, so that she had to look up at Pinto as the tape was ripped off her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said, gazing down at her with cold eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s where you belong, where all of you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us,\u201d Sid croaked, ignoring the voice inside her head that was telling her to shut up. She knew that it would be smarter, but if she was going to die, she was going to go down fighting, even if all she had to fight with were her words. \u201cYou mean all of us humans, or all of us women? You have a problem with women, Pinto?\u201d</p> <p>She saw the rage fill his face seconds before he leaned over and backhanded her hard enough to spin her around and slam her to the floor. He\u2019d used his open hand, which was the only reason she was still alive. He was a vampire. She\u2019d have to remember that. His strength was several times that of a human. A casual slap could break her jaw. And that had been no casual slap. Her ears were still ringing, and she was having trouble seeing straight.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, whore, or I\u2019ll put it to better use.\u201d</p><p>Sid lay on the floor, blinking, trying to come up with the energy, the desire, to force herself upright, to confront this monster with whatever dignity she had left.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d Pinto demanded.</p><p>Sid made the effort, but she\u2019d been hit twice today, both times hard enough to have her seeing stars, and it was taking longer for her to recover. That her hands were still bound behind her back didn\u2019t exactly make it any easier, either. She made a show of trying to drag herself off the floor and nearly made it before falling to her side, unable to catch herself with her hands tied.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing you like this,\u201d Pinto said, chuckling. \u201cRich bitch Sidonie Reid crawling on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Sid felt the heavy weight of his booted foot against her side, digging into her ribs hard enough to hurt as he shoved her back and forth, almost idly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your daddy\u2019s money now, bitch? It wasn\u2019t my idea to let you live, you know. That was Klemens. Didn\u2019t want to rattle the moneyed class. They\u2019re willing to overlook almost anything as long as none of theirs gets hurt. He let me take that little whore friend of yours, though. What was her name . . .\u201d His voice trailed off, as if he was trying to remember.</p> <p>Sid knew he was playing with her, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She didn\u2019t want Janey\u2019s name on this monster\u2019s lips. \u201cJaney,\u201d she said, shocked at the raw sound of her own voice. \u201cHer name was Janey, and you killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t stop you, though, did it? You just kept coming and coming, and still Klemens wouldn\u2019t let me kill you.\u201d</p><p>She heard the squeak of leather as he rose from the chair, the scuff of his boots on the rough carpet, and then he was crouched right next to her, cruel eyes staring at her out of a face that was too handsome to be so evil.</p><p>\u201cBut Klemens is dead now, princess. And you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>Sid croaked a wordless protest, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019m going to do you a favor. You care so damn much about my slaves, you can fucking well join them. You\u2019re a bit older than my usual merchandise, but that red hair\u2019s worth something, and you\u2019re white. That\u2019s always a selling point. You\u2019ll fetch a nice price.\u201d</p><p>Sid saw the kick coming, but there was nothing she could do to stop his boot before it slammed into her ribs. She sucked in a shocked breath and knew he\u2019d cracked a rib or two.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said over her head. \u201cTake care of her. You know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d her guard ordered. He grabbed one of her bound arms and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Sid nearly screamed with the pain, but bit her tongue to stop the sound from escaping her mouth. She wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>As the guard shuffled her from the room, Pinto spoke up from behind her. \u201cCut the ties on her hands before you lock the door. I don\u2019t want to damage the merchandise any more than necessary, but make sure she stays put.\u201d</p><p>The guard grunted an acknowledgment as he pulled a key ring from his pocket and unlocked one of the bedroom doors. Several women were already inside, and they looked up as the door opened, their faces wearing identical expressions of fear. Sid had enough time to register their presence before she was shoved hard, just managing to keep her face from slamming into the floor as she fell. The guard snorted a laugh as he knelt next to her, one heavy hand gripping her thigh, pinching it as if testing for tenderness. She tried to roll away from him, feeling something close to horror at the idea that he might rape her, knowing she\u2019d fight with everything she had to stop him, and knowing it might not be enough. The guard grinned, as if her pitiful efforts amused him. Rolling her onto her stomach, he shoved her face into the rough carpet and held her there with a knee in the middle of her back. There was a tug on her bound wrists, and then, with a snap of released plastic, her hands were suddenly free.</p><p>Sid couldn\u2019t stop a cry of misery as blood flowed back into her hands and fingers, as strained muscles struggled to return to their rightful configuration. She lay on her side, gasping for breath, her sore hands curled protectively against her chest, her entire body shrieking with pain. But despite it all, a surge of adrenaline whipped through her system, making her heart pound with triumph.</p><p>She had her gun. And her hands were finally free. Things were looking up.</p><p>BEFORE THE ELEVATOR doors opened onto the lobby, Aden smelled more blood. It was nowhere near the slaughter that had greeted him upstairs. This was one man. He knew that before he saw the police gathered around the doorman\u2019s body in its dark blue blazer. Humans swarmed the scene, technicians gathering every bit of evidence they could find. It wouldn\u2019t do them any good, Aden thought. Whichever vampire had set this in motion would see to it that no one survived to testify to the event.</p><p>\u201cMister Aden?\u201d A human male wearing a suit that cost less than the shirt and tie Aden was wearing approached him warily. He met Aden\u2019s eyes only briefly before quickly looking away. Many humans believed a vampire could only influence a mind if they met the person\u2019s eyes. That might be true of a lesser vampire, one who needed the contact to reinforce his control. But it was definitely not true of one with Aden\u2019s power and ability. He didn\u2019t correct the detective, however. The mistaken belief served vampire interests well.</p><p>\u201cI am Aden,\u201d he acknowledged, scanning the scene. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d he asked, although he already knew. He could smell the gunpowder.</p><p>The detective didn\u2019t answer his question, but posed one of his own instead, intent on taking charge of the conversation. \u201cWhere were you between ten and noon this morning?\u201d</p><p>Aden gave the man a patient look. \u201cI am a vampire, Detective . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevisani,\u201d the man supplied.</p><p>\u201cDetective Trevisani. I assure you that I and my staff were quite incapable of rising from our beds when this was happening.\u201d He could feel Bastien\u2019s growing tension, his aggression simmering just under the surface, heightened by the blood here and upstairs, and by what he perceived as a threat to his Sire. He was a good lieutenant, disciplined and highly skilled. But having his Sire\u2019s territory invaded while they\u2019d slept unknowing only yards away, and now with this human policeman all but accusing Aden of the crime . . . it was enough to strain the mettle of the most restrained of vampires. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To his credit, Trevisani had the grace to look embarrassed at his gaffe. Obviously, a vampire hadn\u2019t killed the doorman. That didn\u2019t mean a vampire hadn\u2019t been behind it, however, and the good detective was both smart enough to know that and confident enough not to be cowed by his initial mistake.</p><p>\u201cGranted,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cBut you own the top two floors of this building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd my sources tell me there\u2019s some big vampire meeting in the city this week.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was interesting, Aden thought. The Vampire Council didn\u2019t exactly maintain secrecy about their affairs. It would have been impossible given the sheer number of participants staying in town, not to mention the gala itself, which had drawn some attention. But the detective\u2019s comment made Aden suspect that it went beyond idle curiosity, that perhaps the Chicago police had spies within vampire society in the city. He\u2019d have to remember that when he became Lord of the Midwest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Aden said, agreeing without providing details.</p><p>Trevisani grunted. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe this attack had something to do with you personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not a vampire who did this,\u201d Aden said confidently. \u201cIt clearly happened in full daylight\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be a hit team hired by a vamp,\u201d Trevisani interrupted to say.</p><p>Aden smiled patiently. \u201cAs I was saying . . . vampires do not attack each other in daylight. It\u2019s forbidden by custom, and the repercussions for any vampire who dared would be significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who hates you enough to pay the price?\u201d</p><p>Aden huffed a humorless laugh. \u201cI have many enemies, Detective, but I do not believe this was aimed at me. There was no attempt to breach my security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe elevator was open when we got here, and there\u2019s blood inside.\u201d</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t say anything to that. There had been no question posed, and it was always better, when dealing with authorities of any kind, not to volunteer information. Besides, what could he say? That he didn\u2019t need anyone to tell him there was blood, that he could smell it for himself? He doubted the detective would find that reassuring.</p> <p>Trevisani waited, studying Aden\u2019s face for any indication of guilt. Aden gazed back unflinchingly. He\u2019d faced down far more dangerous opponents than this human detective.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Trevisani conceded. \u201cWe\u2019re just about done here.\u201d He gestured at two men who were cloaking the body in a black body bag and zipping it up. \u201cThis building\u2019s a co-op, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ll want to hire a special team to clean this up. If you call the district, they can give you a referral.\u201d He tucked away the small memo pad and pen he\u2019d been using for notes. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ll need your contact information in case something comes up.\u201d</p><p>Aden reached into his jacket pocket and handed over one of his business cards.</p><p>The detective read it carefully, then nodded his acceptance, not understanding that his thoughts were no longer his own, that Aden had been slowly, unobtrusively, working his way into the detective\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you a copy of my report in the morning,\u201d Trevisani said. \u201cI have to say, though, my gut\u2019s telling me this was a hate crime. You\u2019re just lucky they didn\u2019t make it upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Aden held back his smile. The detective had proven to be quite strong-willed, but Aden supposed that was to be expected given his line of work. The challenge, as always, had been taking over the man\u2019s mind without him sensing the intrusion. He could have achieved the same result much more quickly, if he hadn\u2019t cared about leaving the mind intact.</p><p>Normally, Aden would have relished the challenge of manipulating such a strong-willed human, but tonight it had taken all of his considerable self-control to hold back his impatience. He didn\u2019t want to be here bandying words with a human police detective. He wanted to be out there hunting down whoever had been so brazen as to attack Aden\u2019s lair in broad daylight, and so stupid that he\u2019d left behind a body for the human authorities to find. It wasn\u2019t only Aden who would come down on the instigator for this, the entire Vampire Council would crush him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk, Detective Trevisani,\u201d Aden said, then dismissed him from his mind as the human gathered up his remaining crew and hustled them out the door. Aden let his power fill the lobby, nudging the humans into doing what their hindbrains were already telling them. To get the hell out as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, watching as the last of the humans drove away. \u201cBastien, lock those doors until we can get a guard to man the lobby. Make it two guards, and be sure they\u2019re suitably armed and armored. And call\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped as the elevator opened behind him, and the rest of his vampires flowed into the lobby, taking up positions around him until they formed a defensive square. Even knowing that Aden was far more powerful than all of them combined, they stood ready to defend him. The bond between a Sire and his children knew no reason, only instinct.</p><p>\u201cTrav, is that clean-up crew on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. They should be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne human did the shooting, the rest came in after. All of them were masked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. All right. Bastien, we need\u2014\u201d Aden\u2019s attention was drawn to the front door where a wide-eyed vampire was tugging on the big brass handle and frowning when it wouldn\u2019t open. He lifted his gaze to find Aden staring at him, and his eyes grew even wider.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize him?\u201d Aden asked no one in particular.</p><p>Bastien stared at their visitor. \u201cGoodwin something. One of Silas\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodwin Pierce,\u201d Travis provided, blatantly placing himself between Aden and the front door. \u201cFairly low on Silas\u2019s org chart and apparently, tonight, her messenger boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr her sacrifice,\u201d Kage growled. \u201cGive the word, my lord, and we\u2019ll send her a message of our own. It had to be Silas who took Sid. She already tried and failed once before.\u201d</p><p>Aden tended to agree, but it wouldn\u2019t help to kill the messenger. \u201cLet him in.\u201d</p><p>Freddy and Kage moved to flank the front door. Freddy glanced back briefly, then unlocked the door and pulled it open, immediately grabbing Goodwin and slamming him to his knees.</p><p>Aden studied the young vampire. And he was definitely young, no more than ten years turned, if that. Either Silas truly didn\u2019t care whether he returned from this mission alive, or she\u2019d chosen him precisely because he was so inoffensive that no one would bother killing him.</p><p>One thing was certain, the vamp hadn\u2019t known what he was walking into. His nostrils were flaring at the smell of blood, his pupils so blown with fear that his eyes were almost completely black. He didn\u2019t even seem aware that his fangs had emerged, an aggressive display that was almost a guaranteed death sentence in front of a powerful vampire like Aden.</p><p>Aden stepped out from behind Travis and Bastien. The night he needed to be protected from Goodwin was the night he\u2019d stake himself.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Goodwin jerked, losing what little color he had as he stared up at Aden. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then seemed to realize his fangs were in the way. He retracted his fangs with a grimace of concentration and tried again. \u201cThe Lady Silas sent me, my lord,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cShe wanted me to give you this.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his jacket and was immediately grabbed by Freddy, who immobilized him before he could produce whatever he\u2019d been reaching for. Freddy, who was twice as big as Goodwin, kept him locked in a choke hold, while Kage carefully lifted the messenger\u2019s jacket and extracted a rolled parchment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a message, my lord,\u201d Goodwin gasped out. \u201cNothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it here. And don\u2019t kill him, Freddy,\u201d he added, amused by the resignation on his vampire\u2019s face, despite their grim situation. \u201cLet\u2019s see what Silas has to say for herself.\u201d</p><p>Aden took the scroll from Kage and had to fight the urge to drop it in disgust. His lip curled, and he felt unclean the instant he touched it. He glanced up and found Kage watching him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, my lord? I\u2019ve never felt anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman skin,\u201d Aden growled, turning to glower at the unfortunate Goodwin who only squeaked his denial. Forcing himself to unroll the thing, Aden saw it was a formal challenge. Handwritten in the old way, using human blood and skin for the message.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that bitch thinking?\u201d he snarled. \u201cShe\u2019s not old enough to have been around when we did this kind of crap.\u201d</p><p>Goodwin remained silent in the face of Aden\u2019s slur against his mistress\u2019s character, proving he was smarter than his current predicament indicated.</p><p>\u201cSilas is challenging me to a duel,\u201d he explained to his vampires. \u201cNo surprise there,\u201d he added, but then frowned. The challenge was straightforward enough, despite the archaic delivery. There was no mention of Sidonie, but then, the obvious play would be to spring Sidonie as a surprise weapon at an opportune time, inducing Aden to concede the challenge to save his lover\u2019s life.</p><p>But that strategy would only succeed in leaving an unhappy Aden alive to challenge Silas another time. Something only a fool would do. And for all her failings, Silas was not that big a fool.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d Bastien said quietly, clearly following the troubled direction of Aden\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not adding up,\u201d Aden said. \u201cThe Vampire Council will not forgive this display. Silas would know that. So, what does she gain by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was Silas,\u201d Bastien intuited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Taking Sidonie is the kind of thing she would do, but this public mess... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re clearly connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d Aden agreed.</p><p>\u201cCould Silas be hoping you\u2019ll forfeit the duel by going after Sidonie instead of meeting her tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps. On the other hand, what\u2019s to stop me from killing her quickly and then going after Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe her intent was to split your forces. She knows you have only the four of us. If you send one or more of us after Sid, you\u2019ll be facing her without full back-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re assuming it was Silas who took Sidonie. What if wasn\u2019t? What if this is nothing more than coincidence?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I believe in such a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>Aden frowned. He wouldn\u2019t have believed such a thing before tonight, either. But what if Silas wasn\u2019t behind the kidnapping? Then where the hell was Sidonie? His jaw clenched, his gut telling him to drop everything and go after her. Fuck Silas, fuck the damn Council and their rules. But then his gaze roamed over the lobby, touching on each of his vampire children in turn. To a man, they were utterly loyal to him, and they trusted him to repay that loyalty with a care for their lives. If Aden lost the challenge to Silas, whether by forfeit or weakness, his children would be the first to suffer, perhaps even die.</p><p>But even more than that, he had an obligation to the larger vampire community to maintain the discretion that permitted them to live in peace among humans. Which meant dealing with the human police over the bloody spectacle that someone had left in his lobby. That was what it meant to be a vampire lord. It wasn\u2019t the wealth or the prestige, though those were nice enough. But at its core, being a lord meant taking care of those whose lives were entrusted to you. And as much as it grated on him to accept it, more lives than Sidonie\u2019s were at stake tonight.</p><p>Whoever had taken Sidonie had done so for reasons involving him. He was certain of that much. They\u2019d taken her from his stronghold, after all\u2014a bold move meant to make a point. If the power behind the kidnapping turned out to be Silas, then she would die tonight and Sidonie would be safe. But if it wasn\u2019t Silas? He sighed unhappily. Then whoever it was would contact him soon enough, and in the meantime, they would keep Sidonie alive. It was a bad bargain, but the only one he had.</p><p>His attention was drawn to a black panel van that had pulled up out front.</p> <p>\u201cTrav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the vamp cleaning crew, my lord,\u201d Travis confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let them handle this and the scene upstairs. Freddy, I want you to reach out to our local sources, everyone we know. If anyone\u2019s heard word of Sidonie\u2019s whereabouts, I want to know about it, no matter how doubtful the information. In the meantime, we have to mop up this clusterfuck someone left on our doorstep. Silas may not care about creating a spectacle of our affairs, but I must.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we\u2019ve finished with that . . . I\u2019m going to go kill Silas and bring Sidonie back home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>IT WAS LATE BY the time Aden finished cleaning up the mess the assassins had left behind, although most of his personal involvement was along the lines of wiping memories and dealing with the police. Apparently the doorman\u2019s uncle was high in the police chain of command. He\u2019d raised holy hell with Detective Trevisani and had insisted on a personal interview with Aden. The initial demand had been for Aden to present himself at the station house, which he\u2019d refused outright. They\u2019d tried the usual bluster, threatening to arrest him, but Aden knew his rights and, more importantly, his power. Let them try to arrest him. They wouldn\u2019t make it two steps into the building before they forgot why they were there. The uncle had finally settled for a personal visit to the scene which Aden had been more than willing to accommodate.</p> <p>But by the time the uncle departed with his thoughts suitably altered, Aden was seething. Silas, or whoever had engineered this clusterfuck, had been so wrapped up in their own needs that they\u2019d disregarded one of the main tenets of vampire society. Vampires did not go around leaving piles of bodies for the human authorities to find, not even in the guise of human violence. Only the quick action of Aden and his people had ensured that there was nothing to tie vampire interests to the doorman\u2019s death. Aden\u2019s residence in the building became nothing more than a coincidence, with the police convinced that he and his people were innocent and had no specific knowledge of the day\u2019s tragedy.</p><p>But if Aden hadn\u2019t succeeded in cleaning up the disaster on the fifth floor before the police got wind of it, if he hadn\u2019t gotten to Detective Trevisani in time to steer the investigation along the desired path, it could have proved disastrous. Not just for Aden, but for vampires everywhere, especially given the high profile visitors in the city for the territorial challenge.</p><p>But then perhaps that had been Silas\u2019s goal. She\u2019d never been one to risk her own life when someone else\u2019s life would do. She was no different than every other woman in Aden\u2019s life before he\u2019d become Vampire. Always willing to let him bleed to ensure their own safety and comfort. That wasn\u2019t to suggest that women hadn\u2019t tried to use him since he\u2019d been turned, only that they hadn\u2019t succeeded. The lone exception in a lifetime of bitter experience with women was Sidonie, and now someone was threatening to kill her. Aden\u2019s vision filled with blood as he contemplated the pain her abductors were going to suffer when he got a hold of them.</p><p>The first step toward that goal was meeting Silas. Aden\u2019s two SUVs pulled up in front of the warehouse near the Chicago River where Silas had set the formal challenge. The building appeared abandoned, its brick walls pockmarked and blackened with age, the windows old and thick, dull as they reflected the distant light of the waning half-moon.</p><p>Many of the buildings in this area had been given historical landmark status, a shining memory of another age. Sadly, this warehouse was not one of them. It was clearly abandoned, although on this particular night, there were a fair number of vampires clustered inside. Aden wondered if Silas had purchased the building for her own use during the challenge, or if she was simply squatting. It was also possible that this was one of Klemens\u2019s old buildings, since Silas had been close to Klemens and would know about his properties. If it had belonged to Klemens, it would be Aden\u2019s before the night was over, along with everything else Klemens had owned. Assuming it was still standing after Aden killed Silas.</p><p>The area around the building was oddly suited to tonight\u2019s activities. The streets were dark and narrow, with only a few lights along the river more than a block away. At first glance it seemed deserted, but it wasn\u2019t. There were people in the shadows, human predators drawn out by the unexpected activity and by the expensive vehicles which were out of place on these shadowy streets in the middle of a Sunday night.</p><p>Travis and Kage got out of the first vehicle and immediately dropped back to Aden\u2019s SUV, taking up positions front and back. In the front seat, Freddy and Bastien opened their doors simultaneously and joined them, leaving Aden alone until Bastien stepped back to open his door.</p><p>Aden slid out of the SUV, standing still for a moment as he surveyed the surrounding buildings, the alleys and streets. His power swelled, riding the edge of his anger, the midnight blue of his eyes gleaming from beneath half-closed lids. He sensed the heightened aggression of the human watchers at this invasion of their territory, felt their shock as his power reached out like a physical thing, a rolling wave of energy that buffeted each of them, shoving them back into the shadows. He smiled grimly at the sound of their hearts racing with unaccustomed fear, at the sweat-scented waves of dread rolling off of them as they slunk away. They were not predators this night, they were prey.</p> <p>Aden turned his back, dismissing the humans from his mind, as he studied the old warehouse. Other than theirs, there were no vehicles in front and no other vehicles in sight, but for a few older cars parked along the curb, none of which Silas would have used. She was too vain to sink so low, even for purposes of subterfuge. She must have arrived earlier. This was her choice of battlefield, after all, so she\u2019d want to prepare it to her best advantage, to deploy her people. He had no illusions about whether this meeting was meant to be a trap. He assumed it was.</p><p>He also knew the trap wouldn\u2019t be an explosion, because there was no question that Silas and her minions were inside the warehouse. The presence of so many vampires was as impossible to fake as it was to miss. They hummed like a bad fluorescent tube on the inside of his skull, and if he concentrated he could detect Silas buzzing louder than any of them. She was definitely in there this time.</p><p>He glanced around at the four vampires he\u2019d brought with him. They were dressed as he was, in all black\u2014a long-sleeved T-shirt, combat style pants tucked into ATAC boots. Freddy and Kage were conventionally armed, and there were several additional Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns within easy reach inside each of the trucks. It wasn\u2019t usual to bring human weapons to a challenge fight; the combatants were expected to rely on their vampire abilities and nothing else. But Aden didn\u2019t trust Silas. For all the old-time formality of her blood-scribed parchment, she\u2019d proven her willingness to play dirty at every step. There had been Stig Lakanen\u2019s attack that first night, when Silas had goaded the much weaker Stig into going after Aden, even though she\u2019d known he would fail. Then, she\u2019d worked with Professor Dresner to maneuver Sidonie into Aden\u2019s camp, using her to set up the ambush at the club\u2014an ambush which Silas had fled, leaving her minions to bleed and die in her wake. And now she\u2019d likely taken Sidonie hostage, probably hoping to blackmail Aden into conceding the fight. As if he were too stupid to understand that she\u2019d kill him anyway, the first time his back was turned.</p><p>Not that Aden had any intention of conceding anything to Silas.</p><p>The territorial challenges were supposed to be one-on-one, vampire vs. vampire. The kind of petty wrangling that Silas had engaged in\u2014using humans as tools, letting others die in her place\u2014only underscored her weakness. A weakness that would see the Midwest drowning in chaos if she became lord, as vampire after vampire challenged her from inside and out, nibbling away at the territory, breaking off chunks until it was fractured and vulnerable.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to happen. Even if Aden hadn\u2019t been certain of his superiority, confident in his ability to destroy Silas and every other challenger, he knew Raphael would never have permitted Silas to rule. The Western Lord would take her out himself first, letting Lucas continue to hold the territory until a more suitable candidate stepped up. Perhaps alone among the contenders, Aden had no illusions about Raphael\u2019s role in choosing Klemens\u2019s successor, nor his cold-blooded willingness to do whatever it took to ensure his vision of a secure North America. And now that Aden understood the threat from Europe, he wholeheartedly embraced that vision and would see to it that the Midwest did its part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silas clearly didn\u2019t understand any of it\u2014not the looming threat and certainly not Raphael\u2019s role in deciding who would rule. And she just as clearly had deluded herself into believing she could win. Whether it was because Klemens had favored her, letting her believe it was her own power rather than his that fed her rise in his ranks, or if she was simply that stupid, Aden didn\u2019t know. But he did know that one of the reasons she\u2019d remained loyal to Klemens was because he\u2019d let her play her cruel little games, permitted her to take weaker vampires and torment them, to kill humans for the fun of it. Never mind that Klemens was sworn to protect the very vampires Silas had tormented, or that he bred instability by permitting her to prey on humans. The now-dead vampire lord had probably found her games amusing. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a vampire\u2019s children to be reflections of himself. And Klemens had been one sick fucker of a vampire.</p><p>Regardless of why Silas was the way she was, it was too late for her. If she\u2019d come to Aden at the beginning, if she\u2019d stepped aside in recognition of his greater strength and pledged her fealty, he would have rewarded her, even given her a city of her own. Not a major city, but something suitably profitable.</p><p>But after everything that had happened, he wouldn\u2019t trust her out of his sight, and he didn\u2019t like her well enough to keep her in his sight. If she walked out that door right now and came to him on bended knee, it would only make it more convenient when he chopped off her head.</p> <p>Aden did a final check of his vampires, receiving a quick nod from Bastien. Gathering his strength, he sent out a wave of power, searching the warehouse, wanting to know exactly what waited for them inside. True to form, Silas had brought so many of her minions that it was difficult to get an accurate count. He didn\u2019t bother trying. It wasn\u2019t worth the expenditure of energy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s brought more than I can easily count, so stick close and expect trickery,\u201d Aden told his vampires, then glanced over at Freddy, who stood closest to the entrance, and nodded.</p><p>The big vampire pulled back the heavy door on its sliding track, entering first when Aden would have done so. Aden had to smile at that. It was vampire instinct to protect one\u2019s master. He would have done the same thing for Lucas.</p><p>Aden entered the warehouse and immediately stepped to one side, clearing the entrance for the rest of his vampires. There were no lights inside. The only illumination came from moonlight through the dirty windows, but darkness was hardly an impediment for a vampire.</p><p>Silas\u2019s people waited for him, spread out across the back of the warehouse in disorganized rows, their aggression palpable, raising whatever power they had in preparation for the fight to come. For the most part, their eyes gleamed red, betraying their lack of significant power. Silas stood in the very last row, surrounded by the buffer of her minions. She was a petite woman, so short that he only knew she was there because of the dirty-penny shine of her eyes in the dark warehouse.</p> <p>\u201cThis is your party, Silas,\u201d he called out to her. \u201cYou and your pretentious invitation. We haven\u2019t used human blood for such things in a century or more,\u201d he added derisively, pricking her temper and reminding her that he was far older and more experienced than she was. He raked the assembled vampires with a sneering glance, ending with his gaze directly on Silas. \u201cBut all I see are underlings. Are you refusing to fight? Again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I have minions,\u201d Silas responded, her soprano voice echoing in an odd way that told him she was enhancing it somehow. Probably making it louder, and what a waste of energy that was. \u201cUnlike your pathetic four,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf they do nothing else, my many children prove my fitness to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilas, Silas,\u201d Aden chided. \u201cThey do no such thing. Your need for them, and a sorry lot they are, proves nothing but your weakness.\u201d</p><p>Silas snarled angrily. \u201cKill him!\u201d she ordered shrilly. \u201cKill them all!\u201d</p><p>Aden engaged Silas\u2019s vampires without mercy, disgusted by the nature of the battle. He despised having to kill so many vampires, but he was in this battle to win, and so he fought with everything he had.</p><p>He and his four attacked as a team, his vampires feeding him their energy, while at the same time drawing strength from his staunch defense, from his willingness to die for them.</p> <p>The attacking vamps swarmed Aden, trying to isolate him from his people, thinking to take him down by sheer strength of numbers. They were like yappy dogs nipping at a lion, but even dogs can do damage if there are enough of them. None of Silas\u2019s minions were powerful enough by themselves to kill him, but as Aden fought them off, as they managed to strike the rare lucky blow that left him bleeding, he knew her true objective was for them to weaken him for her. She didn\u2019t want them to kill Aden, she needed to do that herself, needed that notch on her belt if she was going to come out of the challenge with any honor. But that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have her minions diminish him, leave him injured and bleeding, unable or unwilling to use his dwindling energy to heal himself.</p><p>That was how Silas saw the situation. Aden had other plans.</p><p>Aden let Silas\u2019s people wound him, let them draw blood thinking they\u2019d beat him. He heard her victorious howl, felt the sudden surge of power that told him she believed her triumph was at hand. And still he waited. Until they were gathered around him like rats, their eyes ruby sparks in the darkness, their defenses lowered, confident he was bested. And then he killed them, mowing them down like a scythe through wheat, his power a sharp-edged blade that cut through their bodies with ease.</p><p>And deep within Aden, the dark half of his vampire gift stirred, roused by the blood soaking the ash-covered floor, by the scent of the air which had become a red-tinted miasma of death. But this time, Aden didn\u2019t fight it. This time he opened his arms and let it come.</p><p>He laughed with joy as the bindings broke, unleashing this darkest aspect of his power. It was an erotic rush, as if he\u2019d been the one imprisoned, as if he was finally freed. Black flame raged through his muscles and blood, expanding his power, reaching outward, seeking victims, seeking . . . food. He roared his pleasure as the gruesome power which was so much a part of him sought out and drank the energy of the dying, sucking up their life force, growing stronger with every death, not caring whether the vampire died beneath his hand or another\u2019s.</p><p>Silas\u2019s minions gazed upon him with horror, no longer struggling to be the first to attack him, but shoving to escape instead. They trampled each other in their panic, ignoring the shrieked demands of their mistress ordering them to attack, far more willing to face her anger than the hunger of this monster who had suddenly manifested among them.</p><p>But none escaped. Aden wouldn\u2019t permit it. His loyal four wouldn\u2019t permit it. As the last of his attackers died, as the screams of disbelief still echoed off the brick walls, Aden reined in his most deadly power. It went willingly, like a satiated child, weary from its efforts and too full to protest. Aden closed his eyes briefly, then opened them and took stock. He glanced left and right, drinking in the sight of his four vampire children, bloodied but still standing staunchly by his side.</p><p>He caught movement in the dim recesses of the warehouse. There was a door in the back, and a sliver of faint light flashing as Silas tried to worm away once more.</p> <p>Aden raised his power and slammed the door shut before it could open more than an inch or two. Silas spun to stare at him, her eyes going wide with fear and surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, Silas,\u201d Aden growled.</p><p>He stalked across the wide open space, taking his time, taunting her with his confident swagger. \u201cA smart warrior knows his enemy,\u201d he lectured deliberately. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bother to discover the true nature of my power. Klemens knew. Why do you think he refused to take the field if I was there?\u201d</p><p>He came within five feet of her and stopped, the blue gleam of his eyes casting her in foggy color. \u201cYou thought your slavish minions would guarantee my defeat, but the only defeat tonight will be yours.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in rage, their copper-penny glow making her look sallow and sickly. But for all her glare of defiance, she was afraid of him. She kept rubbing her arms, as if trying to scrape away the clinging webs of his power, kept reaching with her mind for her dead minions, becoming frantic all over again when she discovered they were gone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even try to surrender, seemed to understand at last that she had come too far, had caused too much bloodshed for him to accept her submission.</p><p>But she was still a vampire, still driven by the power of her blood. She made a final, desperate bid for survival, marshaling all of her remaining strength into a single knife-blade of energy. With a gesture far more disciplined that Aden would have credited her with, she thrust it at Aden, a killing blow aimed at his heart.</p><p>Aden was not so easily taken in. He\u2019d been fighting vampire challenges a century before Silas had even been born. He\u2019d sensed her desperation, felt her gathering power. When she launched her surprise attack, he was ready for her. With a gesture, he deflected her conjured knife blade, turning all of that energy back on her and blasting her across the floor to slam against the far wall while she wailed in both anger and pain.</p><p>Aden was silent as he crossed the few feet to where Silas lay choking on her own blood, her power drained, her body damaged beyond her current ability to heal. Had Aden been willing, he could have saved her.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t willing. Silas needed to die. The only question was how much pain she would endure first.</p><p>Sinking to one knee, he studied her dispassionately. She\u2019d known the risk she was taking and had taken it freely. She wasn\u2019t the first vampire to die this way, and she wouldn\u2019t be the last. It was the lot of those who were made Vampire, especially those who were driven to climb the ladder of power.</p><p>Reaching down almost idly, he stroked his fingers over her chest where her heart still beat frantically. In another context, the gesture could have been sexual. But there was nothing sexual about this.</p><p>\u201cOne way or another, Silas,\u201d he murmured, \u201cyou\u2019re going to die tonight.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI can make it easy, or\u2014\u201d He bent his fingers slightly, and his power squeezed her heart. Silas cried out, her eyes going wide with shock at the intense pain\u201c\u2014I can make it very painful,\u201d he finished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked up at him, her breathing reduced to harsh gasps for oxygen.</p><p>\u201cTell me where Sidonie is,\u201d he said, his voice hard and uncompromising, \u201cand I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she began breathlessly, struggling for enough air to speak. Her head rolled from side to side in denial. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p> <p>Aden\u2019s gaze went flat, and his eyes lit up, bathing her in their cool glow.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She shrieked as he ripped her mind apart, as he dug for knowledge of Sidonie\u2019s kidnapping and found nothing. And when he was finished, he dug his fingers into her chest and squeezed her heart like an overripe tomato, feeling the bloody flesh squish through his fingers like some gruesome puree.</p><p>When it was all over, when Silas had become part of the bloody mud on the floor of the warehouse, Aden stood. If she\u2019d had any power left, he\u2019d have absorbed it willingly, but by the time he\u2019d killed her, she\u2019d been drained of every ounce. He closed his eyes against the inevitable adrenaline crash and felt Bastien and the others gathering around him, offering their protection and their strength.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know anything about Sidonie\u2019s kidnapping,\u201d Aden said quietly.</p> <p>Bastien gave him a worried look. \u201cThen where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go, my lord. There will be enough light through the windows in the morning to burn away this mess, and we can leave her vehicles out back. Local scavengers will strip them far more efficiently than we could.\u201d</p><p>Aden glanced around the nearly empty warehouse. \u201cIf any of her minions\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t bother finishing the sentence. There\u2019d been no one left to survive Silas\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, my lord,\u201d Bastien reminded him. It was late, much later than he\u2019d planned. The business with the dead doorman and its follow-up had taken far too much of his time. And he wondered if someone had planned it that way, someone who had Sidonie in his clutches even now.</p><p>It did no good to curse the rising sun and its implacable effect on his vampire nature, but he did it anyway, swearing long and fluently. Sidonie was out there somewhere. Alone or worse. She wasn\u2019t dead. He\u2019d taken enough of her blood that he\u2019d have known if she died. Unfortunately, there were far worse fates than death. He had experienced many of them personally.</p> <p>Did she know he was looking for her? That he wouldn\u2019t stop until he found her?</p><p>He drew a deep breath as they exited back onto the street, grateful for the fresh air. As cold and wet as it was, it was an improvement over the warehouse, which had become oppressive with the stink of drying blood and ash.</p><p>\u201cIs it over, my lord?\u201d Bastien asked, pausing to look at Aden as he opened the SUV\u2019s door.</p><p>His lieutenant was asking if the night\u2019s battle concluded the challenge. If Aden was now Lord of the Midwest.</p><p>Aden nodded, but waited until they were in the SUV and on their way home before going into detail. \u201cSilas was the last major challenger that I know of. It\u2019s possible some unknown contender is out there waiting in the wings for the rest of us to kill each other off, but I haven\u2019t heard of any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then, how do you claim the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lucas\u2019s call. He\u2019s the current Lord of the Midwest in fact, if not in spirit. I\u2019ll notify him of my intention to claim the territory. He has the option of fighting me for it, but I think we both know he won\u2019t do that. Although,\u201d he added thoughtfully, \u201cif Silas had tried to claim the victory, he would have made her fight for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr simply sicced Raphael on her,\u201d Bastien muttered.</p> <p>Aden chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Raphael, Bastien. Does he strike you as a vampire who can be sicced on anybody?\u201d</p><p>Bastien\u2019s face brightened in a rare grin as he looked over the seat at Aden. \u201cI think Cyn could get away with it.\u201d</p><p>They shared a tired laugh, and Bastien said, \u201cSo, you inform Lucas, and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we travel to that godforsaken ranch of his in the middle of nowhere, and he formally transfers the Midwest to me. We spend a night in drunken revelry, and then we come back to Chicago and start working. But before we do any of that, I need to find Sidonie. It wasn\u2019t Silas who kidnapped her, so who was it? And what do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it be that unknown challenger you talked about?\u201d</p><p>Aden frowned, shaking his head. \u201cMaybe. It doesn\u2019t sound right, though. It took manpower to take Hamilton and his people down that way. If there was a challenger in town with the numbers to do that, I\u2019d have heard about it. Damn it!\u201d he swore, pounding the armrest in frustration, feeling the rippling heat inside his skull that warned him the rising sun was nearly to the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI can have some our daylight people put out feelers tomorrow, my lord. It will give us a head start in the search for her.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded, his mood grim. \u201cHe used humans for the assault, and humans talk. They can\u2019t seem to help themselves. Someone will be bragging about taking down a vampire, even though that\u2019s not what happened. We simply have to root him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Aden agreed silently. He would find Sidonie. He only hoped he wouldn\u2019t be too late.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>THE NEXT NIGHT, Aden opened his eyes to the knowledge that he was Lord of the Midwest. He\u2019d told Bastien they had to contact Lucas, had to go through the formalities first. But that was just the paperwork. He felt the victory in his bones and blood. He knew there was no vampire in Chicago who could stand against him, and if he stretched his awareness even farther, he detected no one within the entire territory, his territory, who could.</p><p>He would have to pay Lucas a personal visit anyway, in order to receive the full power and burden of his lordship. Every vampire within the Midwest would soon look to him for his next breath, for the next beat of his heart. Aden tried to imagine the weight of it. The lives of his four vampire children seemed heavy enough. What would it be like to have thousands weighing on him every minute of every day? He\u2019d probably come to welcome the daily rising of the sun for the rest it would bring him.</p><p>He sat up, pulling his awareness in and narrowing his focus. Lucas would have to wait. Aden\u2019s first priority was to find Sidonie. She was somewhere in this city, a city he now owned. Somewhere out there was a vampire who knew something, who\u2019d seen something, that would lead Aden to whoever had attacked his guards and taken Sidonie from him. He didn\u2019t need someone to point out the house, they only had to get him close. Her blood would tell him the rest.</p><p>Throwing aside the covers, he climbed from the bed and strode to the shower. He sensed his vampires waking up in their secure rooms down the hall. And then he blinked in surprise, his step nearly faltering as he felt something more, something only a lord would sense . . . vampires waking all over the city. Good. He\u2019d put them all to work.</p><p>ADEN WAS SURPRISED to find Earl Hamilton waiting when he strode into his office. The human had been pacing the receptionist area and turned when Aden rounded the corner. He was wearing full combat gear, including a military-grade chest plate, with a MP5 hanging round his neck on a sling. His hands rested on the weapon as he faced Aden.</p><p>\u201cHamilton,\u201d Aden said in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d the human said, dipping his head respectively. \u201cI heard . . . forgive me, my lord, but I heard Ms. Reid had been kidnapped. Is this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Aden confirmed grimly.</p><p>The man\u2019s face was a study in regret. \u201cI must tender my resignation, my lord. I failed you, and Ms. Reid paid the price.\u201d</p><p>Aden rested his hands on his hips and studied the human. He understood the man\u2019s dismay, but didn\u2019t see how resigning helped anyone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept that,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI need you now more than ever. And if you insist on feeling responsible, then Sidonie needs you, too. As for whether or not you failed me, you offered your life in the defense of me and mine. Some of your men gave their lives in that defense. I would be a foolish lord indeed if I rewarded such loyalty by firing you.\u201d</p><p>Tears shone in Hamilton\u2019s eyes when he spoke next. \u201cThank you, my lord. I am honored to serve you in whatever way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen help me find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. We\u2019ve had people out scouring the streets, listening to gossip mostly. And the phones have finally started ringing. Everyone knows we\u2019re looking, and we\u2019ve offered a reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Double it for information leading to her rescue, and triple if they give us the exact location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Hamilton nodded respectfully and headed for the elevator, as Aden\u2019s four vampires made their way down the hall toward him.</p><p>\u201cTravis,\u201d Aden called without turning, \u201cthe vampire who found Sidonie snooping around that slave house the first time, what was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElias, my lord,\u201d Travis supplied as he came even with Aden.</p><p>\u201cRight. Call him. If it wasn\u2019t Silas, then someone associated with the slave network is the most likely culprit. Sidonie caused a lot of trouble there and cut off a nice flow of cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she insisted we\u2019d missed the top vampire in the operation, too.\u201d</p><p>Aden nodded. \u201cCarl Pinto,\u201d he confirmed, the knowledge like a light going on in his brain. \u201cFind him.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and Bastien crossed to the desk to answer it. He spoke briefly, then held the phone out to Travis. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>Travis shared a quick look with Aden and took the phone from Bastien. \u201cElias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor has it your boss is the new lord.\u201d Aden could hear both halves of the conversation with ease.</p><p>\u201cRumor travels fast,\u201d Travis said. \u201cI\u2019m barely awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven faster than you think. I heard that particular bit of news in the last hour before the sun rose this morning. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ve another tidbit for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that item I returned to you before?\u201d</p> <p>Travis lifted his gaze to meet Aden\u2019s. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone was happy with Lord Aden\u2019s interference in their business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what the cool kids are calling slaves these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Trav. You know\u2014\u201d Elias didn\u2019t get any further, because Aden yanked the phone from Travis.</p><p>\u201cEnough bullshit,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Elias breathed, and Aden could hear both shock and fear in those two words. This was what it was like to be a vampire lord. Only a day ago, he\u2019d been Aden, just another powerful vampire. Now he was Lord Aden, with the power to reach out and stop a vampire\u2019s heart from beating.</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d Aden ordered.</p><p>\u201cCarl Pinto, my lord. He was Klemens\u2019s man at the head of the slave ring. Drugs, too, but he really liked the idea of owning those women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Aden\u2019s jaw was clenched so tightly, he had trouble forcing out the single word. If Pinto had touched Sidonie, he was going to die. Actually, he was going to die either way, but if he\u2019d dared to harm her, his death was going to be slow and excruciating.</p><p>\u201cI can give you the address, my lord, but it would be easier to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Aden handed the phone over to Travis. \u201cSet up a meet. We leave in five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>SID REGAINED awareness slowly, feeling sluggish and tired, fighting her brain\u2019s insistence that she wake up. She wanted to go back to sleep, and there was no reason she couldn\u2019t. She was a freelance reporter. It wasn\u2019t as if she had a set schedule, and if she\u2019d had an appointment, her phone would have dinged by now. Smiling, she rolled over, jerking in pain when something dug into her hip bone, something hard and... Her eyes popped open as she remembered where she was. What the thing digging into her hip was.</p><p>She sat up too fast, making her head spin dizzily as she eyed the other women in the room, her fellow captives. Except that they obviously didn\u2019t view her as a fellow anything. There was very little light, only a bare, yellowed bulb overhead, but enough for her to count seven other women huddled as far away from her as the small room and their chains would permit. Distrust of her was plain on their faces, layered on top of a weary sort of horror at their predicament.</p><p>Pushing her hair away from her face, Sid scooted back until she could lean against the wall, easing her muscles after what felt like several hours spent lying twisted on the gritty wooden floor. She closed her eyes and tried to remember, to piece together the events that had led to her waking in this filthy room. She didn\u2019t remember falling asleep, but her body told her that hours had passed. The window was barred on the inside and boarded over outside, but she could see enough to know it was nighttime, and she doubted it was the same night as when she\u2019d been kidnapped.</p><p>She remembered talking to the vampire, Carl Pinto, remembered his human henchman shoving her into this room and cutting her hands free. She\u2019d felt excitement, because finally she\u2019d be able to reach her gun. And then . . . nothing until she\u2019d woken up just now. But something was wrong, something more than the obvious, because she shouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep at all. She should have been wide awake and terrified. Those bastards must have drugged her again, but how? She hadn\u2019t eaten or drunk anything. In fact, she was as thirsty as if she\u2019d just run a few miles on a hot day without water. The thought had her looking around idly for water and not finding any. Not a surprise.</p><p>She pressed her back against the wall, then reached down and began to work the muscles of her legs, which were sore and aching from being crammed into the trunk for so long, then sleeping on the floor. Bending first one leg, then the other, she brought each knee to her chest and back down several times, massaging her calves, her thighs . . . She frowned, running her fingers over her right thigh. It was more than sore. It was tender, with a hard knot that was so feverish she could feel it through the heavy denim of her jeans. Under other circumstances, she wouldn\u2019t have thought much about it. She bruised easily and badly, and she frequently had no memory of what caused any particular mark. But this was more than a bruise. This was more like when she\u2019d gotten vaccinations before going to South America that time, and she\u2019d had a negative reaction to...</p><p>Shit. The guard hadn\u2019t been pinching her thigh last night. Or, rather he had, but he hadn\u2019t been sizing her up for rape, he\u2019d given her a shot of some drug. She\u2019d been so relieved when he\u2019d cut her hands free, but he\u2019d only done it because he knew she\u2019d be out. Jesus, what had he given her? What if it was something addictive? What if the needle hadn\u2019t been clean?</p><p>She forestalled a full-blown panic attack by reminding herself that she had a much bigger and more immediate problem. She was being held prisoner by a vampire who wanted her dead, whose most optimistic plan called for her to be sold into slavery. A drug addiction she could deal with, a disease she could fight. Later. When she was free.</p><p>What she needed to focus on now was getting out of here and taking all of these women with her.</p> <p>\u201cPor favor,\u201d Sid said, speaking to the oldest of the women, who was still several years younger than Sid herself. Sid\u2019s Spanish was good. Her mother\u2019s cook, who had been Sid\u2019s nanny when she was younger, was Puerto Rican and had used nothing but Spanish when speaking to Sid.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d she asked, continuing in Spanish. \u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany hours,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cThey brought you here last night, and you slept all through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only one,\u201d Sid clarified. \u201cOne day.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. \u201cThey will come soon,\u201d she warned. \u201cBut at least they will bring food and water.\u201d</p><p>Sid nodded. That made sense. They wouldn\u2019t spend any more than necessary keeping the women healthy, but they did need them alive. You couldn\u2019t sell a dead slave.</p><p>\u201cHow many men, when they bring the food?\u201d Sid asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d The woman shrugged. \u201cSometimes only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Sid asked curiously. With Aden wiping out the other house, she would have expected Pinto to move the women in and out as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cSix days, I think,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThey chained us together after one night, and they told us we are leaving, but then . . .\u201d She shrugged again. \u201cThey went away and didn\u2019t come back. I thought they would leave us to die. But then he came, and now we wait again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the vampire.\u201d</p><p>One of the younger women, a girl really, chimed in, nodding. \u201cThe pretty one,\u201d she said, \u201cwith the cruel eyes.\u201d</p><p>Carl Pinto had meant to move these women with the others, Sid realized, the ones Aden had freed with his raid on the house Sid had discovered. But Pinto had been forced to change his plans. And now he sat here in this house with his few captives, probably afraid to move them for fear of getting caught, but not willing to lose the profit by freeing them either. Maybe he thought whoever won the challenge would let him return to his slave running. It was definitely profitable, if one didn\u2019t mind where the profit came from.</p><p>Sid, on the other hand, was convinced that Aden would be the ultimate victor. And that meant Carl Pinto\u2019s days were numbered.</p><p>Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t wait that long. She stood and continued stretching, running through various escape scenarios in her head as she did so. On the one hand, she felt confident that Aden would look for her. He wouldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d left him. She hadn\u2019t been thinking straight before. There had to have been some evidence of her capture. Earl Hamilton and his entire security team had been on duty only one floor below. She frowned, wondering what had happened to Hamilton and his men. Were they all dead? God, she hoped not.</p><p>She shook away the thought. There was nothing she could do about it, and she didn\u2019t need the negative energy draining her resolve. She needed to focus on one thing and one thing only, and that was getting the fuck out of here. So, points in her favor . . . first, Aden would be looking for her, and second, she still had her gun. She\u2019d learned from Dresner, that traitorous bitch, that you didn\u2019t need an actual stake to kill a vamp. That was the traditional method, but the key was not the stake itself, but the damage it caused. Do enough damage to a vamp\u2019s heart, no matter how you did it, and you could kill him. If she could somehow get close enough to Carl Pinto to shoot the gun point blank at his heart, that should do the trick.</p><p>Or rather, the trick would be getting the gun close enough and then pulling the trigger. She\u2019d never killed anyone before, never even shot a gun at anything living, much less a person. But Pinto had not only killed Janey, he\u2019d enslaved uncounted numbers of women, sending them to a horrible fate and sometimes death. Could she kill him, if it came down to it? She thought she could.</p><p>But what she knew was that she couldn\u2019t sit around and wait for Aden to show up. This wasn\u2019t a fairy tale, and she was no princess. She couldn\u2019t count on her hero riding in on a white horse, or in this case rolling up in a black SUV. Even if he showed up, he might be too late.</p><p>The heavy tread of booted feet pounded down the hallway and stopped outside the bedroom door. Some of the women cried out, hugging each other and eyeing the door as if expecting a monster to enter, which wasn\u2019t far from the truth. Sid didn\u2019t join the terrified huddle\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d have accepted her if she tried\u2014but she played it safe, dropping into the corner and tucking her knees up against her chest, not wanting to take the slightest chance that her gun would be discovered.</p><p>There was a scrape of metal, and then what sounded like a heavy padlock falling against the doorjamb, before the door swung open. Sid had expected it to be the guards bringing food and water, but instead it was Pinto himself who stood there, his eyes gleaming red fire as he stared at her in the dim light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet up, bitch,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t move, just stared at him defiantly.

She cried out, hanging from his hard grip and whimpering softly.</p> <p>\u201cGet up,\u201d he repeated to Sid. \u201cOr I\u2019ll drink her dry and leave the husk.\u201d</p><p>Sid tried to put all the hatred she felt into her stare as she stood, keeping her back against the wall. \u201cLeave her alone,\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou want me. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow touching,\u201d Pinto sneered. But he opened his fingers, releasing the teenager. She dropped to the floor with a clatter of chains, then crawled over to rejoin the knot of terrified captives.</p><p>\u201cCome then, Sidonie Reid. Let\u2019s find out why a cold bastard like Aden would find you so irresistible.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie walked slowly, steeling herself to make a break for it when she hit the doorway. But she never got there. A deafening noise suddenly rocked the house, a loud crack of wood followed by a hard slam of something heavy and flat crashing to the floor. Like the heavy front door. Her heart soared as she realized Aden must have found her, that rescue was at hand, not just for her but for the other women. She opened her mouth to scream, to let Aden know where she was, but before she could so much as draw a breath, Pinto was on her. One of his hands gripped her waist, pinning her to his side, the other covered her mouth as he dragged her away from the living room to the opposite end of the hallway which opened to the kitchen.</p> <p>It sounded like war had broken out behind them, with the steady sound of gunfire and men shouting coming from the living room. Sid knew a moment of fear for Aden before she was jerked back to her own danger as Pinto slammed her against the hallway wall hard enough to knock her breath away. He flattened himself against her, his hand over her mouth, and they hung there a long moment as Pinto seemed to listen intently to something in the kitchen. And then just as abruptly, they were moving again.</p><p>Sid fought as much as she could, but Pinto was a vampire. His strength far exceeded hers, and he didn\u2019t mind hurting her. She strained to hear what was going on in the living room. With one exception, Pinto\u2019s henchmen were human. If that was Aden out there, and her gut told her it was, Pinto\u2019s human gangbangers didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>He wrenched her to a stop one more time, holding her just short of the doorless opening between the kitchen and living room. He froze, filthy fingers over her mouth, his arm around her ribs so tightly that she could barely breathe. She thought she knew why he was waiting. The door to the driveway was on the other side of the kitchen, and Pinto would have to pass right in front of the living room opening to get there. Even at vampire speeds, they would be in full view of the living room for a few precious seconds.</p><p>Pinto held her in place, muttering almost silently, trying to persuade himself to make a break for it, insisting no one would notice and cursing Aden in the same breath. Sid twisted and turned, trying to make noise, to knock something over and give away their position, but Pinto had her crushed face first up against the open shelves of a pantry cabinet, the edges digging into her cheek, her breasts, her thighs. Cold air from the wide-open door to the outside brushed over her face, and if she rolled her eyes sideways she could see the opening.</p><p>Pinto\u2019s muscles tightened. His muttering became more urgent, and Sid knew he was steeling himself for the final dash to freedom. This was her moment of truth. She either acted now, or she surrendered her freedom and maybe her life.</p><p>Her left arm was trapped awkwardly by the steel band of Pinto\u2019s grip and the shelf that was jammed against her chest. But her right arm was free from her elbow down. Gritting her teeth, praying Pinto was too busy with his own worries to pay attention to what she was doing, Sidonie slid her right hand down over her belly. She moved slowly, curling her fingers into claws and gathering up the double layer of her hoodie and T-shirt, sliding beneath it until she met the tight edge of her bellyband. She paused then, testing his reaction. But he seemed so focused on the dangerous invaders in his living room that he\u2019d already disregarded his human hostage as a threat.</p> <p>Leaving her hand flattened over her belly, she waited until he made his move, until he dragged her past the cracked porcelain sink, moving vampire-fast as they popped into full view of the living room and then past it. He hesitated once more, just long enough to lean forward and sniff the air outside the driveway door, and Sid made a move of her own.</p><p>Shoving her hand under the bellyband, she curled shaking fingers around the grip of the small 9mm. It felt solid in her hand, heavy, as she inched it out of the holster, as she sucked in a deep breath of courage. And then with an effort that was more awkward than graceful, she bent her elbow, twisted the gun until it was jammed it against Pinto\u2019s chest, and pulled the trigger over and over until the slide locked back and there was nothing left to fire.</p><p>ADEN DIDN\u2019T WASTE any time on elaborate strategies. According to Elias, whom they\u2019d met up with as scheduled, Pinto had only one vampire left from the crew that Aden had decimated only days before. The rest were human, mostly gangbangers who were happy to act as guards and enforcers. The pay was good and the risk was low. Or it had been before tonight. Tonight, hell itself was going to descend on them in the form of one pissed-off vampire lord.</p><p>The target house was in a far worse neighborhood than the previous one. Pinto probably felt safer here. The authorities rarely ventured down these streets, usually only in response to overt violence, and there was nothing about this house to draw unwanted attention.</p><p>Aden\u2019s vamps had parked their SUVs halfway down the block, flashing their fangs blatantly as they climbed out, so there\u2019d be no question of whom potential thieves were dealing with. And just to be sure, Aden had sent out a very clear don\u2019t-fuck-with-me message on a wave of power that even the dullest human would understand. They\u2019d brought three vehicles in case there were captives who needed transport, and he didn\u2019t want to come back to find all of them stripped for parts.</p><p>They walked the short distance to the house, pausing while Aden sent out a tight thread of power, scanning the house and its occupants. Sidonie was definitely inside, definitely still alive, though he couldn\u2019t tell if she was hurt. He needed to get in there.</p><p>\u201cOne outside guard,\u201d he observed tightly to Bastien, who stood next to him. \u201cHuman, right side of the house.\u201d</p><p>Bastien nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a side door there. Probably means no back door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI expected more,\u201d Aden commented, searching the dark spaces on either side of the house, using his power to scan the house and yard, looking for more guards.</p><p>\u201cPinto might be short on people. They lost a lot of manpower at the slave house,\u201d Bastien suggested.</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t trust possibilities, but he trusted what his own senses could tell him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Kage, you go ahead and take out that guard. When you hear us come through the front door, you join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Kage acknowledged and took off, gliding across the street like a shadow over the moon. He didn\u2019t bother asking how he\u2019d know when Aden and the others got inside. He knew as well as any of them that there would be nothing subtle about Aden\u2019s entry.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of us go in the front, quick and dirty,\u201d Aden said, stating the obvious. \u201cThe door goes down, we go in. There\u2019s Pinto and one other vamp, but a dozen or more humans. Some of those might be slaves, so kill everything that moves unless it\u2019s female. We\u2019ll sort out the rest later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Pinto, my lord?\u201d That was Freddy. Always up for a fight, and the real fight here tonight would be Carl Pinto.</p><p>\u201cPinto is mine,\u201d Aden said, one side of his mouth lifting in a half grin. \u201cYou can have the other one. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Aden crossed the street without waiting for the others, striding up the broken concrete walkway, taking the three steps to the porch in a single bound. As his foot hit the wide porch, he gathered his power into a battering ram of pure energy and shoved it front of him. The heavy door with its metal sheeting and reinforced hinges cracked down the middle like a piece of rotted wood. Freddy stepped in front of Aden and, turning sideways, kicked the shattered door inward where it fell with a loud, booming, slap of noise.</p><p>Gunfire erupted from the human guards clustered in the front room, increasing as those who\u2019d been knocked off their feet by the original entry found their wits and their weapons and began fighting for their lives. Freddy went down under a spray of bullets from a submachine gun. Aden caught the rich scent of his blood and sent a shaft of healing energy to his vampire child, pausing to grip his shoulder as he went past. Lifting his gaze to the human who\u2019d fired the weapon, Aden grabbed him by the throat with one hand, cupped his other hand under the man\u2019s chin, and twisted, breaking his neck with a speed and strength no human could hope to match.</p><p>He caught movement in the hallway and turned just as one of the guards herded several terrified women ahead of him into the front room. A quick glance told him his vampires had the other guards well in hand, so he turned his attention to the coward who would use slaves as a shield for his own worthless life.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, or I\u2019ll kill \u2019em all,\u201d the man shouted, his voice cracking with fear. He had his arm hooked beneath the jaw of a teenaged girl, the barrel of his weapon jabbed against her neck.</p><p>Aden eyed the man with the kind of hatred he saved for those who would enslave others, who abused them for money or pleasure. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The man glared back at him, his eyes too bright, his heartbeat loud in Aden\u2019s ears. He was high as a kite, his chest puffed up with overblown arrogance. \u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere, asshole. Now, get the fuck out of my way, or they all die, starting with this one.\u201d He shoved his gun into the girl\u2019s neck, and she cried out as it sliced into her skin, drawing blood.</p><p>Aden\u2019s gaze went hooded as he studied the man. \u201cThat bit about going to hell?\u201d he drawled, then snapped out a hand and wrenched the weapon from the man\u2019s grip, seizing him around the neck with the other. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a suggestion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gun shots sounded from somewhere else in the house, and the women all screamed and ran for the front door, only to find their way blocked by Freddy\u2019s bulk. Not realizing he was there to help them, they cowered away, backing into a corner and clinging to each other, crying. Their terror was a palpable thing to Aden, like a bad taste in his mouth. They didn\u2019t know if they were being rescued, or if something even worse had befallen them. But Aden didn\u2019t have time to reassure them.</p><p>Meeting the terrified gaze of the human in his grip, he said, \u201cHell\u2019s too good for you.\u201d Squeezing so tightly he could feel the pressure of his own fingers meeting through the man\u2019s flesh, he snapped the human\u2019s spinal cord, then reached out with a thought and exploded his heart in his chest.</p><p>He dropped the piece of empty flesh, then turned to search the faces of the trembling women, confirming what his instincts had already told him. Sidonie wasn\u2019t among them.</p> <p>He\u2019d taken the first step down the hallway when he heard her voice behind him.</p><p>\u201cAden?\u201d</p><p>He spun around. She was leaning against the open door jamb of the kitchen. And she was covered in blood.</p><p>CARL PINTO DIDN\u2019T cry out or even groan when Sid shot him. He gave her a shocked look, shuddered so hard he shook her with the force of it, and collapsed to the kitchen floor. He would have dragged her down with him, but Sid shoved away from him at the last minute, eyeing him warily as she backed away. She stood there for a moment, staring, waiting for him to go poof the way she\u2019d always heard vampires did when they died. But he remained stubbornly corporeal, lying there on the floor, blood soaking his shirt, twitching like a man having a really bad dream.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t know what that meant. Would he be dead soon? Or would he suddenly rise like some movie villain to grab her ankle just when she thought she was free of him? She only knew he was down for now, and she intended to make sure he stayed that way. Her hands were shaking so badly she was barely able to press the magazine release on her Glock, and she nearly fumbled the empty mag when it dropped out of the grip. Drawing a deep breath, she forced herself to concentrate and shoved the empty mag into the pocket on the bellyband. It took her three tries before she managed to get her fingers around the backup magazine and slammed it into place. But by the time she was working the slide to chamber a round, she was feeling more confident, the hours of practice she\u2019d put in on the gun range finally kicking in.</p> <p>She started to lower the gun, intending to empty another ten rounds into Carl Pinto, when she heard women screaming behind her. The slaves! She\u2019d left them in the bedroom, had hoped when she heard the fighting break out that they\u2019d stay there until it was over.</p><p>Sid hurried to the open archway in time to see one of Pinto\u2019s henchman with a gun pressed to the neck of one of the teenagers who\u2019d been trapped in the room with her. And facing the gunman, his back to Sidonie, was the most welcome sight she\u2019d ever seen. Aden. Her heart swelled with such relief, such complete confidence that she was safe, that she finally understood why all of those fairy tale princesses collapsed in tears at the sight of their heroes.</p><p>And what a hero he was. She gasped as Aden used his vampire speed to grab the slaver\u2019s gun, seizing him by the throat and freeing the captive girl. Aden waited until all of the women were huddled in the corner, then . . . Ew. Okay, that was pretty gruesome, but it did the trick. The slaver collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut and, since he was human, leaving him quite dead.</p><p>Aden was about to start down the hallway to the bedrooms when she called out to him.</p><p>\u201cAden.\u201d</p><p>He spun at the sound of her voice, his eyes flaring blue with power as he took in her blood-soaked clothes, her battered condition. She lifted a hand to her face self-consciously, but before she could say anything, he was there, wrapping her in his arms, holding her against his broad chest, and whispering things she couldn\u2019t understand in her ear.</p> <p>Sid let the tears come then, let all the fear and stress of the last few hours fall away as she held on to him. She would be strong again in a few minutes, but for now she let herself be the rescued maiden and cried with relief.</p><p>Aden pulled back until he could see her face. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he asked, cupping her face in one big hand, rubbing a careful thumb over her tear-stained cheek. \u201cDid he\u2014\u201d He drew a breath, searching her eyes, and she knew what he was asking.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly his,\u201d she said turning to indicate Pinto who didn\u2019t seem to have moved, but who still wasn\u2019t dead, damn it.</p><p>A deep growl rumbled out of Aden\u2019s chest as he stared at the fallen vampire.</p><p>\u201cI shot him in the heart a bunch of times,\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cBut he won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>Aden grinned and ran a hand over her tangled hair. \u201cDo your parents know you\u2019re this bloody-minded?\u201d He laughed when she swatted his arm and added, \u201cYou\u2019ll do nicely.\u201d</p> <p>His expression turned grim when he switched his attention back to Pinto who, Sid was startled to see, was beginning to stir.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll recover if we don\u2019t kill him,\u201d Aden said. \u201cBut he\u2019s your kill. Do you want the honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said immediately, patting his broad chest. She could live without that particular honor. \u201cI did my part. He\u2019s all yours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and there was such malice in that one word, such cutting satisfaction, that Sid shivered, even though it wasn\u2019t aimed at her. \u201cWatch,\u201d Aden murmured.</p><p>And Sid watched.</p><p>His gaze fixed on Pinto where he lay on the floor, twitching, Aden lifted his hand, palm up, almost like an invitation. But then his fingers closed slowly, and suddenly Pinto wasn\u2019t only twitching anymore. His eyes flashed open, and he squealed like a pig as he tried to shove himself up from the floor, tried to roll onto his belly and crawl toward the open door, bent on escape. Aden\u2019s fingers clenched into a tight fist, and Pinto\u2019s back bowed as he screamed in agony, begging, sobbing, before collapsing like a rag doll, his cries becoming high-pitched and mindless, all semblance of rationality gone.</p><p>It took a few minutes, while Sid stared in mingled horror and satisfaction, but Pinto finally, finally, died, becoming nothing more than a pile of dust on the cracked linoleum floor.</p><p>Aden\u2019s arms came around her, pulling her away from the mess that had been Pinto, hustling her through the destroyed living room. \u201cThe women will be taken care of,\u201d he assured her, seeming to understand that their welfare would be her first concern. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting you out of here.\u201d</p><p>Sid nodded, sensing he was riding the sharp edge of violence, that as much as he wanted to see her safe, he needed it even more. For all his tough guy, female-hating image, Aden had a protective streak a mile wide. He needed to protect the people he cared about. He cared about those women, because he hated slavery of any kind. He cared about his vampire children. Sid had seen the way he looked at them, heard the respect in his voice when he spoke to them. And he cared about her. She\u2019d seen the relief on his face when he\u2019d realized she was alive and more or less unharmed, the pride when he\u2019d offered her the honor of killing Pinto. He cared, and he needed to see her safe.</p><p>So she let him hustle her out the door and down the sidewalk. They were moving fast, with Bastien a few steps ahead of them. The others had stayed behind, presumably to take care of the captive women and clean up any evidence that they\u2019d been there. She\u2019d gotten the impression that vamps were very big on cleanup, leaving no footprints for anyone to follow. No wonder so few people knew anything about them.</p><p>It reminded her of the nightmare at Aden\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone dead?\u201d she asked, nearly stumbling to a stop as the thought hit her.</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t even slow down, just looped an arm around her waist and kept going. \u201cIs who dead?\u201d he asked absently, and Sid noticed for the first time that he\u2019d grown more tense, not less, since they left the house, that he was scanning the street, as if expecting trouble.</p><p>\u201cIs someone\u2014\u201d she started, but she never finished her sentence, because he suddenly wrapped both of his arms around her and spun away from the SUV.</p><p>\u201cBastien, down!\u201d he roared, the end of his words lost as all three of the SUVs they were heading for suddenly blew up in a maelstrom of fire and debris. Sid screamed as the explosion rocked the night, blowing them off their feet and sending them sailing through the air. They hit the ground hard, Aden\u2019s arms still around her, cushioning her fall, as pieces of burning metal and molten glass rained down around them.</p><p>\u201cSIDONIE, STOP,\u201d Aden growled. Realizing she couldn\u2019t hear him over her own screams, he put a gentle hand over her mouth. Her eyes were huge and terrified as they finally focused on him, but she nodded convulsively and sucked in the last of her cries with a gulping breath when he lifted his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>More frantic nodding, her fingers digging into his arm.</p><p>Aden held her tightly. She was trembling. She\u2019d survived Carl Pinto, had nearly taken the damn vampire out herself, and this was her reward. They couldn\u2019t even walk down the street without some asshole trying to blow them up.</p><p>Aden stood, taking Sidonie with him. They couldn\u2019t stay here in the open. Instinct already had him searching the night, his power reaching out to find his latest would-be assassin. He would be nearby. He\u2019d have wanted to witness Aden\u2019s demise for himself, either to claim the kill in the challenge, or to report to whatever coward he worked for.</p><p>Aden heard Sidonie whimper, realized he was squeezing her too tightly, and consciously relaxed his grip. He was beyond furious.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it,\u201d he muttered viciously. He looked up and found all four of his vampires surrounding him, the three he\u2019d left in the house having rushed out at the sound of the explosion.</p><p>\u201cBastien!\u201d he called. His lieutenant limped over to his side, and Aden glanced down to see blood soaking his pant leg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s minor, my lord,\u201d Bastien assured him. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of her,\u201d Aden said, transferring Sidonie into his care.</p><p>Sidonie rebelled briefly, twisting to look up at him. \u201cAden?\u201d</p> <p>He cupped her cheek, the gentleness an effort in the midst of his anger. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou stay here with Bastien.\u201d He forced himself to speak softly, to let none of the rage that was boiling his blood leak into his words. It didn\u2019t fool Bastien, of course.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d</p><p>He met Bastien\u2019s gaze over Sidonie\u2019s head. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said grimly. And with that, he reached out with his power and tunneled through the shadows like a serpent until he found the assassin. Human, he was hugging the wall of an empty house, shivering in the face of his failure, too terrified of discovery to run, too stupid to realize he couldn\u2019t hide from a vampire as powerful as Aden.</p><p>Aden dragged the coward into the light of the burning SUV, using his power like a hook dug into the man\u2019s chest, making it as painful as possible.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he growled, recognizing the human Balderas. He\u2019d been Silas\u2019s daytime security chief, but he was also the one who\u2019d tried to abduct Sidonie in the train station.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you, vampire,\u201d the human managed to gasp, pawing at his chest as if the hook digging into him was something physical he could remove. When he looked up, his eyes were filled with tears, but not with pain, or rather not that kind of pain. \u201cYou killed her!\u201d he screamed accusingly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what this is about?\u201d Aden questioned in disbelief. \u201cYou want revenge for that stupid bitch Silas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014\u201d Balderas\u2019s words cut off, replaced by a guttural scream of agony as Aden twisted the hook of his power down into the man\u2019s gut.</p><p>\u201cThis is how the game is played, human,\u201d Aden hissed, reeling his power in, dragging Balderas with it until he was within arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cI loved her,\u201d the human whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThen you can join her.\u201d</p> <p>The hook became a poker as Aden rammed it up behind the man\u2019s rib cage and into his heart, burning white-hot while the human shrieked in pain, until he had no air left with which to scream, until his heart was nothing but a piece of shriveled meat.</p><p>Aden let the body fall to the street. But he wasn\u2019t finished yet. His head swung slowly from side to side, brow lowered, eyelids heavy over his searching gaze. But he wasn\u2019t seeing the neighborhood he stood in, with its neglected homes and old cars, the cracked sidewalks and dried lawns. His gaze went far beyond that. Pure, raw power was driving this search, spreading out into the city, seeking out and finding every damn vampire in the greater Chicago area, moving beyond even that to the thousands of vampires in the Midwest, their lives gleaming in his sight, some bright, some bare pinpricks of light.</p><p>\u201cThis ends now,\u201d he snarled. Gathering every ounce of power he possessed, sucking power from every vampire life he encountered, he sent out a raging tidal wave of command, claiming the Midwest as his own and daring any vampire to challenge him here and now, to wrest the power from him if they could, and to submit or die if they could not.</p><p>Throwing back his head, eyes closed, Aden stood with outstretched arms, hands open and palms up as he drew in the lives of the territory, one after another, first a trickle and then a flood. His power thundered as vampires surrendered, falling to their knees, to their faces, recognizing the new Lord of the Midwest.</p><p>SID DIDN\u2019T KNOW what was happening. One minute they were hurrying to the SUV, and the next the world exploded. She knew Aden had saved her, that he\u2019d protected her with his body. She didn\u2019t even think he was aware of the blood soaking the back of his shirt, of the rips and tears in his flesh. She didn\u2019t think he was aware of much, because he\u2019d gone into some sort of Zen state that had even Bastien backing away and taking her with him.</p><p>\u201cBastien,\u201d she said, confused. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he silenced her quickly. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t distract him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Distract him? Aden? He didn\u2019t look very distractible right now. In fact\u2014Her thoughts cut off as a human suddenly came into view, looking like he was being reeled in like a fish, and just as reluctantly. She squinted. He looked familiar. The clothes were different, but . . .</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the guy,\u201d she whispered. Bastien\u2019s hand tightened on her arm in renewed warning, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSid,\u201d Bastien whispered urgently, turning her to face him. \u201cPlease. You need to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Sid\u2019s lips flattened in frustration, but she figured Bastien knew what was going on far better than she did, and she didn\u2019t want to do anything that might jeopardize Aden\u2019s safety. She spun around, staring in shock when the guy suddenly shrieked as if someone was ripping his skin off, then felt slightly sick when Aden dropped the man\u2019s limp body to the street like a piece of forgotten trash.</p><p>Not that she blamed Aden for being angry. The guy had just tried to kill them all. But she\u2019d seen enough violence and death in the last forty-eight hours to last the rest of her life.</p><p>She drew a deep breath, thinking it was finally over, but then Aden snarled a few words, and the world went even crazier. Her lungs strained to breathe as all the oxygen in the air seemed to disappear at once, as the few winter-bare trees around them began rattling like dried bones, bending and creaking beneath a powerful storm with Aden at its center. Thunder rumbled, but it wasn\u2019t the weather. It was coming from beneath their feet, an earthquake of sound, shaking the ground until she clung to Bastien, her feet braced as the street rippled like a sheet in the wind.</p><p>And still Aden stood, unmoving, immovable. His arms were stretched out as if he was calling down the power of the gods upon his enemies and bathing in its glow. Except the glow was the blue of his eyes, burning brighter than the flames of the wreckage, twin lasers of brilliant blue sapphire.</p><p>Suddenly Aden threw his head back and howled, his hands clenching into fists as if holding on to something. He stood that way for a long time, and then his arms fell to his sides, his eyes opened, and his head swiveled to pin her in the blue laser gleam of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Bastien released her at once, his fingers flying open as if she\u2019d suddenly become red-hot.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sidonie,\u201d Aden crooned.</p><p>She froze for the space of a heartbeat, knowing something more was going on than what her simple human senses could detect. But this was Aden, and she knew he\u2019d never hurt her.</p><p>She closed the distance between them, going into his arms without hesitation.</p><p>He seemed larger somehow, and that was saying something, because he was a big guy to begin with. But at the same time, there was something weary in his expression, as if he had taken on a heavy burden in the last few minutes, something she couldn\u2019t see, except in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, touching her hand to his cheek and noticing that his eyes had begun to lose their laser-like glow and return to their usual midnight blue.</p><p>He blinked, seeming surprised that she\u2019d ask. And then he smiled. \u201cI will be. Let\u2019s go home, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>ADEN USHERED Sidonie out of the elevator and into his private quarters. Elias had been summoned, and they\u2019d used his vehicle to drive away from the bombing scene. The explosion had been too dramatic for even that neighborhood, and the scene was now crawling with human police. There was nothing to tie Aden to the destroyed vehicles, so there was no concern there. And Elias, intent on proving himself to his new lord, had remained behind at Pinto\u2019s place, calling in a team to see the women to safety and to do a thorough cleanup on the house. Aden didn\u2019t fully trust Elias, but he judged the vampire to be smart enough to see that his future depended on making Aden happy. With vampires, self-interest was always the best motivator.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably want a shower,\u201d Aden told Sidonie as he hustled her through the sitting room and straight into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I stink?\u201d Her response was playful enough, but she didn\u2019t quite pull it off. She had to be exhausted. She did need a shower, but not because she smelled. She was covered in blood, her clothes stiff, her skin sticky, with bits of grime from the explosion still clinging everywhere.</p><p>But Aden didn\u2019t tell her any of that. Slipping his arms around her, he pulled her close and said, \u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019ve had a rough couple of days, and a hot shower will help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and leaned her forehead against his chest, her hands resting to either side of his waist. The gesture was so unaffected and spoke of such trust. He gazed down at her bent head and felt his heart clench with rare emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, then raised her head to meet his eyes with a wicked look that belied her exhaustion. \u201cWill you join me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a low laugh and let one hand slide down to rest on the curve of her sweet ass. \u201cI have a phone call to make first. And I need to check with Bastien and the others. But it won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, standing on tiptoes to give him a quick kiss. \u201cBut don\u2019t blame me if you miss all the fun.\u201d</p><p>Aden waited until she\u2019d disappeared into the bathroom, pulling the door shut behind her, then he strode quickly back through his quarters and down the hall to his office.</p><p>Bastien and the others were waiting for him, but he raised a hand to put off any questions. \u201cI need to call Lucas.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother closing the door. Vampire hearing made such barriers useless. Besides, these four vampires were his closest advisers, his inner circle as he undertook to rule the Midwest. He\u2019d have very few secrets from them.</p><p>Picking up the phone, he hit a speed dial number and listened to it ring. He didn\u2019t have to wait long. The call was answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors of an earthquake in Chicago,\u201d a familiar voice said. \u201cThe vampire grapevine is humming tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Lucas. It\u2019s not the way I wanted it to go, but the damn minions wouldn\u2019t stop coming. They blew up three fucking vehicles tonight, and Sidonie was with me. She could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice sharpened with interest, and Aden realized he\u2019d said more than he intended.</p><p>\u201cA friend. Look, I\u2019ll be there tomorrow night to do it properly. I just wanted to touch bases.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsider the bases touched, and congratulations, my friend,\u201d Lucas said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. And bring Sidonie with you!\u201d he added. He was still laughing when he hung up.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Aden swore softly. Lucas was never going to let him live this one down. Not that the other vampire had any ground to stand on. He was fully tethered to his new FBI girlfriend and looked to stay that way for a while.</p><p>Aden threw the phone onto the desk and joined Bastien and the others in the outer office.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you heard, we\u2019re going to South Dakota tomorrow night. In and out. We\u2019ll be back here by dawn. Once that\u2019s taken care of, our first order of business is building a solid core of fighters. Bastien, I want you to put out a call for recruits. Priority goes to the vampires we worked with in Kansas, and then pretty much anyone from Lucas\u2019s or Raphael\u2019s territory. You know the drill. The four of you can do the initial screening, but I\u2019ll want a list for final review. No one, and I mean not one, of Klemens\u2019s brood gets in on this round. Maybe in the future, when things have settled down\u2014don\u2019t close the door on the possibility, it\u2019ll only cause resentment. But right now, I don\u2019t trust any of them.</p><p>\u201cI have to figure out how far Klemens\u2019s rot has spread and take out any of his former allies who have a lingering loyalty to the old guard. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about where the next fucking bomb is coming from. They\u2019ll say it\u2019s not fair, but fuck fair. We\u2019re vampires, not children.</p> <p>\u201cNext, we need a new place to live and use as a headquarters. Yesterday\u2019s attack showed how vulnerable this place is. Right now, I\u2019m more interested in the acreage than the house. We can always build more house, but I want some space between me and the city. Put Hamilton on it. He can screen properties from a security standpoint, and he can also work with a realtor during the day. Once he has a few possibilities, I\u2019ll take a look, but I want it within the next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Klemens\u2019s estate on the Gold Coast?\u201d Bastien asked.</p><p>\u201cMy inclination is to burn it to the ground and sell the lot, but that might draw too much attention. Freddy, you know who handles this sort of thing. We need to make sure there are no secrets inside, no hidden passages or cubbies, nothing that can come back on us. I want it emptied to bare walls and naked floors. I want every closet emptied, every window opened. I want sunlight in every crevice and corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Aden said, more than ready to call it a night. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>His vampires shared glances, shaking their heads in unison. \u201cNothing, Sire,\u201d Bastien said for all of them.</p> <p>Aden grinned. \u201cThen get some sleep. And congratulations, gentlemen. We did it.\u201d</p><p>SIDONIE LEFT ALL of her clothes in a pile on the floor of the bathroom, not sure if any of it was salvageable and not really caring. The only thing she took proper care with was her gun and bellyband. Folding the holster carefully, she stepped outside the bathroom and laid it on the dresser top, placing the gun on top of that and patting it fondly. It was probably silly, and not at all consistent with a tough girl image, but this was the first time she\u2019d used the gun in a life-or-death situation. She felt proud and a little proprietary about the whole thing.</p><p>Smiling at herself, she gave the gun a final pat and went back to her shower, leaning into the stall to turn on the hot water and let it run. Guilt stabbed her about the wasted water. She was generally very conservation-minded. But sometimes a girl needed steam, and this was one of those times. Her pores needed opening. She wanted every trace of Carl Pinto and his hell house gone. Not to mention the fucking explosion afterward. She figured she\u2019d pretty much used up her life\u2019s supply of adrenaline in the last two days.</p><p>While waiting for the bathroom to become foggy, she leaned toward the mirror and used her hand to rub away a clear space so she could study the damage.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she muttered, horrified. This was so much worse than she\u2019d thought. It was a wonder Aden hadn\u2019t walked away and left her on the street. Her hair was a rat\u2019s nest, and she was wearing a couple of days\u2019 worth of running mascara, but okay, that was expected. What she hadn\u2019t anticipated, although she probably should have, given her throbbing headache, was the red and purple bruising that covered half her face. She didn\u2019t know how much of it was from Pinto and how much from the explosion and didn\u2019t care. It all came together to create the nightmare image that was staring back at her. She literally looked like a refugee from a horror movie.</p><p>She closed her eyes and turned away, not wanting to see any more. The bathroom was steamy and warm, and she drew a deep, calming breath. The steam felt good on her sinuses, which were swollen nearly shut, but she\u2019d forgotten about the injury to her side where Pinto had kicked her and had to swallow a cry of pain. She frowned and pressed the damaged ribs tenderly, checking for breaks. Not that she was sure she\u2019d know the difference, but they didn\u2019t feel broken. Nothing squished when she pushed on it, no knife-sharp pain. Just really sore.</p><p>She sighed, wishing she could go back to that house, back to the moment when Aden had asked if she wanted to have the honor of finishing off Pinto herself. She wouldn\u2019t pass it up a second time. She\u2019d blow that fucker\u2019s head off, but not before kicking him a few times so he\u2019d know what it felt like to be tied up and helpless.</p><p>It was funny, in a not-funny-at-all way, that the worst of her injuries had come from her short time with Pinto and not the gigantic explosion later. That was because Aden had protected her, cushioning her fall and taking most of the damage himself.</p> <p>She stepped into the shower, standing with her eyes closed and her head bent, letting the hot water pummel her back and neck, washing away the dirt and grime... and blood. Most of the blood was Pinto\u2019s, but not all of it. Needing to be clean, she turned around and reached for the shampoo. Her hair was a tangled mess, but the dirt had to come out first. She washed it quickly and thoroughly, then again, and finally massaged in about twice as much conditioner as she\u2019d normally use. She was rinsing the last of that away, her eyes closed, her head tilted forward under the hot spray, when the shower door clicked open behind her.</p><p>She smiled without opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d get here.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s strong arms surrounded her, one hand going low on her belly as he nudged her back against his chest, his erection a hard length against her butt.</p><p>\u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t take long,\u201d he murmured. Reaching over her shoulder for the soap, he lathered it between his big hands and began to rub it over her skin with exquisite care, his touch far gentler than she would have thought him capable of.</p><p>Aden was a man of such contrasts. Not a man at all, according to him. He\u2019d have her believe he\u2019d left behind his humanity long ago when he\u2019d been enslaved, treated like a thing. But that didn\u2019t explain his concern for the captured women, his kindness in making certain they were not just cared for, but safe and on their way home. The careful way he\u2019d protected her. He was so powerful, and yet his touch when he examined her bruises was so tender, so full of . . .</p><p>She wanted to say love, but she didn\u2019t know if that was true. It felt like love, but maybe she was projecting her own feelings onto him. Because she was definitely falling and falling hard. She\u2019d been teetering on the edge ever since the first night she\u2019d met him. As rude and irritating as he\u2019d been, there\u2019d been an undeniable spark between them. She\u2019d initially dismissed it as nothing more than sexual attraction. After all, the guy was sex on a stick. Any woman still breathing would want him. But the truth had crept in, growing with every hour they spent together, every tiny bit of himself that he revealed to her, until she could no longer deny it. She even knew the precise moment when she\u2019d reached the point of no return. It was the look in his eyes when he\u2019d seen her standing in that kitchen doorway tonight. His relief at seeing her alive, and his rage when he\u2019d seen what Pinto had done to her.</p><p>She knew he cared, but she didn\u2019t know if he loved her.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he murmured against her ear, and she shivered at the rumble of his deep voice.</p><p>She obeyed, turning around to face him, lifting her gaze from his thickly-muscled chest to his wonderful, broad shoulders, past the strong column of his throat to his sensuous lips which curved slightly with amusement, before she finally met his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI look awful,\u201d she lamented.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful. You\u2019re alive, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Sid sighed and rested her forehead against his chest. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t wait anyway.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her head from side to side. \u201cI decided I was no fairy tale princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever that means,\u201d he growled. \u201cHe could have killed you. You should have waited for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know what he would do to those women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken care of them. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did know, and I knew you\u2019d come after us, but I was worried you\u2019d be too late. Pinto was getting ready to move, and I was afraid he\u2019d have us all packed up and gone before you got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019d have tracked you down,\u201d he said implacably. \u201cI am a vampire lord, Sidonie. I have resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not infallible. And I couldn\u2019t take that chance. Besides, I am woman, hear me roar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgain, whatever the fuck that means. Do I need to check your head for bumps?\u201d</p><p>Sid laughed. \u201cPoor old vampire. I\u2019ll explain it all to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld?\u201d His soap-slick hands slid down her back to cup her ass and lift her against his fully aroused shaft.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you are old,\u201d she said breathlessly, then hissed when her sore ribs were crushed against his chest.</p><p>Aden cursed and released her. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt. Let me heal\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Sid didn\u2019t let him finish. Standing on her tiptoes, she hooked her arms around his neck and pulled his face down to hers. She kissed him hungrily, twisting her tongue around his until he groaned. Wrapping both arms around her carefully, he took the kiss deeper, one hand tangling in her long hair, tugging her head back as his lips trailed past her mouth to her neck, kissing her softly there, letting her feel the sweep of his tongue before lifting his head with another curse.</p><p>Sidonie voiced a wordless protest. She didn\u2019t want to be pampered, she wanted to be fucked. Lifting her mouth to his, she teased his lips open with her tongue, and then she bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. He growled, but only squeezed her ass in warning.</p><p>She grinned against his lips and bit down harder, swallowing the tiny bit of his blood, feeling the rush, feeling every inch of her skin, every nerve ending tingle with awareness of him.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to play?\u201d he snarled finally. \u201cWe\u2019ll play.\u201d He lifted her higher, spinning them both around until her back was against the opposite wall of the shower, her legs around his waist.</p><p>His mouth went to her neck, and she shivered in anticipation. He sucked hard enough that she knew she\u2019d have an old-fashioned hickey, but he didn\u2019t let her feel even the edge of his sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she wheedled, flexing her hips against his belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, habibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She gasped as his hand slid down her back, over the curve of her thigh and into the aching emptiness between her legs, filling her with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet. Is that for me, Sidonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cOnly for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she repeated urgently.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He pumped his fingers a few times in and out, lingered to dip briefly into her nether opening. Muscles bunched as he held her against the wall, as he reached between them to grip his cock and position it at the opening to her pussy.</p><p>\u201cScream for me, Sidonie,\u201d he murmured and slammed his full length inside her with a single powerful thrust, his hands gripping her ass, holding her wide open, so he could go deeper still.</p><p>And Sid screamed, but it was a cry of pure sensuous pleasure, her nails digging into his shoulders, her head thrown back against the wet tile as he pumped again and again, his hips slapping against hers, his butt flexing beneath her crossed ankles.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he commanded, and she did, eyeing him through a haze of desire, his handsome face so stern and focused, his dark eyes limned in the blue glow of his power.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know who you\u2019re fucking,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>She gave him a languorous smile, her entire body suffused with desire, teetering on the edge of a climax that she fought to hold off, because it felt so damn good to ride this edge with him.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d she murmured, her words slurred with sensuality. \u201cThere\u2019s no one like you in the world. No one but you.\u201d</p><p>He growled, his eyes lighting up like lasers as his fingers dug into her ass. He leaned in, pressing his hard chest against her breasts, covering her mouth with a searingly hot kiss, his lips sealed against hers, his tongue stabbing between her teeth and tangling with her tongue. She was breathless when he finally released her, her heart racing, every nerve she possessed trembling in anticipation as he lowered his head to her neck. She felt the sweep of his tongue, rough against her hot skin, the scrape of his fangs, tormenting her, letting her feel their sharp points, but not breaking the skin, not yet.</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d she pled, choking on a sob as she gasped for air, her body so ready to climax that her skin felt too tight, ready to explode from all the feelings, all the sensations roaring along her nerves, tightening her muscles.</p><p>\u201cSidonie,\u201d he whispered, like a prayer, and then his fangs sliced into her neck and punctured her vein, and she was lost.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scream as the climax took her, her throat seized up and she bucked in his arms, the orgasm pouring through her veins like hot liquid, feeling it in every inch of her body, from her fingers scraping over his scalp to her feet digging into the firm muscles of his ass, to the exquisite bundle of sensation in her clit, that oh-so-sensitive tiny nub. Pulses of overwhelming pleasure roared through her, waves of ecstasy so strong that she\u2019d have been lost if not for Aden, holding her in his arms, keeping her safe.</p><p>I love you, she thought, but didn\u2019t say, as he lifted his head and met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Sidonie,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She smiled. He couldn\u2019t say it either. \u201cI will,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAs long as you want me.\u201d</p><p>SID CAME OUT of the bathroom to find Aden stretched out on the bed, gloriously naked, propped up against the headboard with one muscled arm behind his head. He held an iPad in his other hand, his expression very intent as he read whatever it was displaying. She stood for a moment, admiring him.</p><p>\u201cLike what you see?\u201d he asked, without lifting his gaze from the iPad.</p><p>She laughed, crossing the room to climb onto the bed with him. \u201cFishing for compliments, vampire?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cLike I need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You are so vain.\u201d</p><p>He cut his gaze to look at her. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t like what you see?\u201d</p><p>Sid huffed out a dismissive breath. \u201cRight. So, tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular?\u201d</p><p>She slapped his thigh. It was like slapping solid steel, and she paused for a moment to appreciate it, stroking her hand back and forth.</p><p>\u201cSidonie?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot up, and her cheeks heated. Jesus, she was pathetic. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said, covering, \u201cI was just thinking. At that challenge gathering, when I met you the first time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember it well.\u201d</p><p>She flushed with pleasure at the heat in his eyes, the rumble of lust in his voice. \u201cUm, right,\u201d she said, trying to gather her thoughts under the onslaught of erotic images he conjured up without even touching her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you become a vampire?\u201d she blurted out. She was pretty sure that wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been meaning to ask, but it was the first thing that came to her mind.</p><p>Aden put the iPad aside and studied her in puzzled amusement.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve always wondered,\u201d Sid continued. \u201cMost of you, the few I\u2019ve met anyway, seem\u201d\u2014she frowned, as if looking for the right word\u2014\u201chappy,\u201d she said, surprised at her own choice of words. \u201cI\u2019ve read lots of books, and they always talk about how the vamp was turned against his will, and he\u2019s a monster and he hates it. But every vampire I\u2019ve ever met seems really happy to be one. Is that because you\u2019ve just accepted it? Did you have a choice about the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>ADEN EYED SIDONIE curiously. She was the most inquisitive woman he\u2019d ever met. Or maybe it was simply that she was the only woman whose questions he\u2019d ever been inclined to answer.</p><p>\u201cEvery vampire has his own story,\u201d he said, knowing that such a trite response would never satisfy her.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s your story?\u201d she persisted, right on cue.</p><p>He considered blowing her off, distracting her with more sex, which they\u2019d both enjoy. But if he wanted to spend some time with Sidonie\u2014and he did, a very long time\u2014then he was going to have to answer her questions. Because she\u2019d only keep asking.</p><p>\u201cMy Mistress,\u201d he told her, \u201cthat is, the vampire who made me, did offer me a choice. But it was one she knew I would accept. I was in a dire situation, albeit of my own making, and she gave me an out. A way to escape into what she said would be a better life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Morocco, 1778</p><p>ADEN ROSE LATE in the day. It was the first week of the holy month, and business was light. Not even the wealthy would dare the wrath of their god during this time. He thought of it as their god because he no longer believed in god, not theirs or anyone else\u2019s. Certainly not the god of his father, who\u2019d sold him like an animal, or even the god of his mother, who discarded him to secure her own comfort. No god had ever done Aden any favors.</p><p>But he was grateful for this one time of the year when he wasn\u2019t forced to play the prostitute, or, even worse, the whipping boy of that fat turd who continued to beat him bloody whenever the mood struck him, and all with his mistress\u2019s blessing. How could he ever have thought she cared for him? She\u2019d replaced him in her bed long ago, buying a new young slave to train just as she had him. But he\u2019d thought some affection still lingered between them. Her willingness to sell him so cruelly had killed any such illusions, her betrayal far greater than the simple brutality of the fat man.</p><p>He rolled off the bed slowly, feeling twice his age as every inch of scar tissue, every fresh wound made itself known. He had scars on top of scars. And when he wasn\u2019t being whipped, he was expected to service the women who continued to ask for him, though he derived only the most perverse pleasure from fucking them. He\u2019d fooled himself in the past into thinking they desired him, even cared for him. But no longer. He was a whore, and they used him like one.</p><p>\u201cAden?\u201d It was young Sana, tapping lightly on the frame of his doorway. \u201cCan I oil your back for you?\u201d</p><p>The child felt responsible, as if she\u2019d somehow asked to be whipped bloody that day he\u2019d gone to her rescue.</p><p>\u201cNot today, asal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because we\u2019re not busy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot today,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cVery well, but if you change your mind . . .\u201d</p><p>Aden remained silent until he heard the sound of her bare feet padding softly away. Sometimes he let her rub the oils in, because it did help, softening the scar tissue and keeping it as flexible as it was ever going to be.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t trust himself tonight. He was filled with such rage. It was a hot coal in his belly, burning him from the inside out. Was this to be the rest of his life? What would happen when he grew too old to service the women, too old for even the fat man to enjoy beating? Would his mistress turn him out on the streets to beg?</p><p>He began to pace, his long legs needing no more than three strides to travel the length of the room. With every step he took, his anger grew. What purpose was there in continuing this farce? Why not end it? He knew the herbs, a simple cup of tea, sweetened with honey to blunt the taste. One of his ladies had brought him a gift of tiny date cakes, baked with cinnamon and sesame, prepared by her cook who was a slave like him. But they would taste all the better for that, and he could eat them all with his final cup of tea. There would be no point in saving them any longer, no point in hoarding them like the only treasures of his miserable life.</p><p>He paced some more, back and forth, nursing his rage, his feelings of betrayal, until an idea began to take shape. Yes, he would end this wretched existence, but he wouldn\u2019t go alone.</p><p>Crossing to the cheap wooden box where he stored his few possessions, he dug down until he unearthed yet another gift from a customer, this one far more useful than a few date cakes. It was a blade, forbidden for one such as he to possess. But the lady had given it to him not because it was a weapon, but because it was beautiful. It was meant to be a woman\u2019s table knife, small and adorned with jewels. When she\u2019d given it to him, it had been as dull as a child\u2019s toy, but no longer. He\u2019d sharpened it over time, hiding it by day and working late at night, until the edge now gleamed in the low light. He pressed it gently against his fingertip and watched a line of blood well up.</p><p>He smiled. It would do.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t bother dressing for the occasion. None of his clothes were any better than the loose trousers he was wearing. And it didn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><p>Palming the blade, he pulled open the flimsy door which was for his clients\u2019 privacy, not his own, and strode down the short hallway to the stairs, ascending swiftly to the third floor, with its cool, tiled hallway, where his mistress lived in far greater splendor that any of the slaves who made such opulence possible. He glanced through the small window near her door and saw that night had descended. He could hear the crowds outside, the devout whose fast ended with the setting sun, and who would now gorge themselves in anticipation of doing it all over again tomorrow.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother knocking on his mistress\u2019s door. He knew she\u2019d be breaking her own fast, sitting down to a finer meal than anyone else in the house would enjoy. Once upon a time, he\u2019d have been dining with her, but she no longer invited him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Tonight, he was inviting himself.</p><p>He shoved the door open, ignoring her squawk of surprise. \u201cHow dare\u2014\u201d Her outraged protest was cut off, quite literally, by his blade against her throat.</p><p>She stared up at him in shock, her dark gaze wet with fear. \u201cAden,\u201d she gasped. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>Aden watched her with hooded eyes, feeling nothing but grim satisfaction as she begged for her life.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Disgust turned to rage, a cold fury that drew the gleaming edge of the sharp knife across her throat, slicing through skin and tendons, releasing a fountain of blood as she went to her death staring up at him in disbelief.</p><p>He twisted his fingers in her long hair, watching the hot blood pump out of her neck, disappointed that she hadn\u2019t lingered, that her death had been far too swift.</p><p>\u201cYou made it too easy.\u201d</p><p>Aden spun at the sound of a woman\u2019s low, sensuous voice behind him. He stared at the newcomer, the bloody blade still gripped in one hand, his other hand opening to let his dead mistress\u2019s body fall to the floor, forgotten.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cIf you sever the neck here . . .\u201d She drew a finger across the front of her own throat. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying, but the blood spills too quickly. If you want them to linger, you must cut here.\u201d She indicated the side of her throat. \u201cThey will still die, but it will be slow, and they will know every moment of their death.\u201d</p><p>Aden stared silently. He didn\u2019t know this woman, had never seen her before in this house. She wasn\u2019t veiled and didn\u2019t seem bothered by it, or by the fact that she was facing a strange, armed and half-naked male. She also didn\u2019t seem overly troubled that he\u2019d just murdered his mistress in front of her.</p> <p>\u201cAden, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, taking a step closer.</p><p>He thought about using the knife on her before she could run screaming to report his crime. But something stopped him. She hadn\u2019t done so yet, and besides, what did it matter if this woman reported him? He couldn\u2019t remain here anyway, and he\u2019d be long gone before anyone arrived.</p><p>She stretched out a hand, stroking it down his arm, the look in her eyes one he\u2019d seen often enough to recognize it. Women found him attractive, beautiful even. They admired his face, his size, and the strength of his body.</p><p>\u201cSweet child,\u201d she whispered, urging him to turn around. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>He turned, letting her see the ruin of his back, even as he scowled at his own complacency, his obedience. He was hardly the child she\u2019d called him, but it was as if her voice was inside his head, replacing his own thoughts, telling his body what to do.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nearly ruined you, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d He felt cool fingers gliding over the lumpy scar tissue. \u201cWhat a waste,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut we can fix that,\u201d she added, speaking normally. \u201cLook at me, child.\u201d</p><p>He did, wondering again why she was calling him child when they were surely very near the same age.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go with me, Aden? To leave this place, this life, forever?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d he started, his voice a croak of sound. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, trying again. \u201cWhere would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere we want,\u201d she said, with a mysterious smile. \u201cI can give you freedom you\u2019ve only dreamed of. We can go anywhere, do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened, until it was a slash of white against her olive skin. He watched in amazement as some of her teeth began to grow, until they became . . . fangs. Like a serpent\u2019s. Two smooth, sharp fangs that split her upper gums and pressed against the lush fullness of her lower lip.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of his brain a voice was mewling in terror, urging him to run away from this monstrous female. But the rest of him felt . . . content. As if after twenty-seven years of wandering, he\u2019d finally found the one place he truly belonged. He lifted his hand, wanting to stroke the woman\u2019s cheek which would be smooth and soft, to touch the diamond hardness of her fangs. But the blood of his mistress still dripped from his fingers, and it made him hesitate. The woman saw his hesitation and smiled, and then she did something that shocked him to his core. Taking his hand in hers, she kissed it, her tongue lapping out to taste the blood.</p><p>Aden\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cVampire,\u201d he whispered. He\u2019d heard tales of such things, but had thought them only that, children\u2019s stories meant to frighten.</p><p>The woman smiled up at him, proudly, as if he\u2019d done something clever, something marvelous.</p><p>\u201cI am Vampire,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd it is wondrous. I would share it with you, Aden, if you will have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I would go far away. We would want for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Aden looked around the opulence of his dead mistress\u2019s rooms, the silk and gold, the fine porcelain dishes. And he thought of his own tiny room, with its cheap wooden box hiding his few treasures, the dim light concealing the threadbare state of his linens, the gaudy gifts his women brought him as if he was an animal to be blinded by their shiny surface and too stupid to know their true value.</p><p>He thought of little Sana and the others. He would miss them. He would have given his life to protect them. But he discovered he would not sacrifice this future for them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name, mistress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s smile grew. \u201cI am Leticia.\u201d</p><p>Aden repeated the strange syllables silently, tasting them on his tongue. \u201cLeticia,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cI will go with you.\u201d</p><p>Chicago, IL, present day</p><p>\u201cWHAT HAPPENED after that?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie\u2019s voice jerked Aden back to the present, to the elegant rooms of his Chicago headquarters and the warm woman lying naked next to him and smelling of sex. He rolled her beneath him, savoring her easy surrender, the way she spread her legs to accommodate him, her silky thighs cradling his hips.</p><p>\u201cWe traveled the world,\u201d he said, answering her question.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . I mean . . . were you a couple?\u201d</p><p>Aden raised an inquisitive eyebrow. \u201cYou mean did we have sex?\u201d</p><p>Sidonie scowled up at him, and he leaned down to kiss her soft lips, smoothing away the frown.</p><p>\u201cOf course we did. She was my Mistress. She made me a vampire. We were lovers for half a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged one shoulder dismissively. \u201cOne night I saved her life, and she released me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d Sidonie drew a deep breath, as if gathering her courage. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>He stroked his fingers gently over her forehead, along her cheekbones, memorizing her face. \u201cA vampire always loves the one who turns him,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s as if our blood cells recognize where we came from, who created us.\u201d He held her gaze, wanting her to understand. \u201cBut I never loved her the way you mean. She was a willing lover and an intelligent woman. I enjoyed her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut why would she send you away when you\u2019d saved her life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had other vampire children by that time, and I\u2019d grown too powerful. She was afraid of me. She called it a gift when she released me, but really, she was just sending me away. I was alone for half a century after that. I had no one until I found Bastien and made him my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could you be lovers if she was afraid of you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSex between us had grown infrequent by then. She said I was cold. That while I knew where to touch, where to put my tongue, how to deliver pleasure, there was no passion in my lovemaking. When she released me, she kissed me good-bye and said she hoped I\u2019d find my passion someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>Aden looked down at Sidonie, at her crystal blue eyes gazing up at him with such honesty, at the wild copper curls tangled on the pillow beneath her. He brushed a length of hair away from her bruised cheek, marveling at the contrast between them\u2014his hands seeming so big and rough next to her delicate features, so dark against her pale skin.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me, Sidonie. Am I cold?\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him for a puzzled instant, then her arms looped around his neck, and her fingers stroked his nape. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the sapphire heart of the hottest flame. When I\u2019m with you, I feel like the sexiest woman in the whole world. I feel cherished and safe.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI feel loved.\u201d</p> <p>Aden froze. Did he love Sidonie? Had more than two and half centuries of life brought him to this place and time so that he could finally know what it meant to love someone? To love this woman? He kissed her again, a tender brush of his lips that became a lingering kiss, a seduction of her mouth. Sidonie met his kiss with eager passion, her mouth opening beneath his, her tongue darting out to taste him, to weave around his until he felt the hunger rising in him, the need to possess her again, to claim her as his own.</p><p>He lifted his hips, letting his already-hard shaft drag in the wetness between her thighs. Sidonie made a greedy little noise and spread her legs wider, thrusting against him.</p><p>\u201cAm I cold, Sidonie?\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted fiercely. She reached between their bodies, taking his cock in her slender fingers and stroking him lovingly before tightening her grip and placing his tip between the swollen folds of her sex, letting him feel her heat.</p><p>There was nothing cold about his Sidonie, he thought as he as plunged deep into her silky warmth, her sheath clasping and releasing his cock as he drove in and out. He groaned at the satin slickness of her pussy, at the sensual fullness of her breasts, the hard pearls of her nipples.</p><p>The slow seduction became a demand as his pace quickened. He slammed his hips between her thighs, his cock burying itself deep inside her, then pulling out and doing it again. Her sheath squeezed him with every thrust, a thousand fingers caressing his length, stroking him, urging him to come, to go over that edge with her, to tumble into the unknown of ecstasy, to take the chance.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered against the sweat-slick skin of his neck, her fingers digging into the muscles of his back, her legs crossed over his back, trapping him inside her. \u201cYou\u2019re my passion, Aden. I love you.\u201d</p><p>A rush of emotion answered her whispered vow, a fire that spread to every inch of his body, lighting up his nerves and warming his cold heart until it slammed against his ribs, feeling as if it was beating willingly for the first time in two centuries. As if until now, this moment, it had pumped only because it had to, because it kept him alive. He felt it pounding in his chest, felt Sidonie\u2019s heat surrounding him, welcoming him, loving him.</p><p>The climax came from nowhere, roaring over his body, every muscle taut with desire, every nerve thrumming with electricity. His balls tightened and his cock swelled, growing harder and thicker inside Sidonie, filling her so completely he could barely move. She moaned, a sound full of heat and desire, and it was his name on her lips.</p><p>\u201cAden.\u201d She repeated it like a prayer, her head thrown back, her nails digging into his shoulders.</p><p>Aden growled, his fangs splitting his gums eagerly, hungry for her blood, for the fever that was Sidonie. His Sidonie.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her neck, slicing through her velvet skin, piercing the thin wall of her vein and drinking down the smooth, honeyed flow of her blood, feeling it speeding to every cell of his body, giving him life, giving him her.</p><p>She bucked beneath him, crying out as his bite brought euphoria instead of pain, her mouth closing on his shoulder as she tried to muffle her scream. He felt his skin tear beneath her teeth, felt the pull as she swallowed his blood. He tightened his grip, lowering his full weight onto her body, holding her in place as she thrashed against the double assault of his bite and his blood. She\u2019d never tasted that much of his blood before, never had that connection. Aden knew what could be forged if she drank more, if he permitted her to do it again in the future. A powerful link would be created, the kind of link humans could only try to replicate with their vows and their protestations of love.</p><p>If asked, he\u2019d have said he didn\u2019t want such a link with anyone. So he couldn\u2019t explain why he pressed her face against his shoulder, while he urged her to bite harder, to drink more. Why his cock stirred anew when she complied, why he joined her as she moaned against his skin, as a final orgasm rolled through them both, leaving her shuddering and limp in his arms.</p> <p>Aden gathered Sidonie close, holding her tightly as he rolled over and pulled the comforter back on the bed, then slid them both into the warmth beneath the covers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me today,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cNo more roaming around the office for you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even stir, only cuddled deeper into his embrace and went to sleep. He smiled down at her, marveling at the feelings tightening his chest. He didn\u2019t know if it was in his nature to take a mate in the vampire way, to bind someone to him forever. What he felt for Sidonie was love, but forever was a long time. She might grow tired of him, of the life he led. Maybe she wanted children and grandchildren, and he could give her none of those.</p><p>But for now, she was his. And he intended to keep her for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cSleep, nuur il-\u2018en. We have a busy night tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>SID WOKE WITH a smile as a muscled arm looped around her waist and pulled her in, sliding her across the sheets and tucking her underneath his heavy body as if she weighed nothing. She opened her eyes to find Aden staring down at her, looking like a man who\u2019d been waiting impatiently for her to wake up.</p><p>\u201cIs it nighttime again?\u201d she asked sleepily, reaching up to brush a thick lock of black hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked instead, his gaze so intent that it made her wonder if she should be feeling worse than she did.</p><p>\u201cUm. A little sore?\u201d she ventured. \u201cYou\u2019re a big guy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that, Sidonie,\u201d he said, though he couldn\u2019t stop the smug smile that curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said, then frowned, as if just remembering the beating she\u2019d taken at the hands of that creep Carl Pinto, remembering the explosion and fire afterwards. \u201cSurprisingly well, actually.\u201d Her frown deepened as she realized just how good she really did feel. She drew a deep, testing breath, and there wasn\u2019t even a twinge from her ribs. She touched her face cautiously. Her cheekbone had been so swollen that she could see it without a mirror. But it seemed completely healed, not tender and no longer swollen. And she felt rested in a way she hadn\u2019t in weeks, although that could be explained by the rigors of the previous night. She blushed hotly, remembering exactly what some of those rigors had entailed.</p><p>Aden caught the blush, of course, and grinned, as if he knew what she was thinking about.</p><p>\u201cCan you read my mind?\u201d she asked accusingly.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s necessary for your safety.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, thinking about that one. He laughed and bent his head to kiss her, coaxing her lips with soft caresses, until her mouth opened to him.</p><p>When he lifted his head again, she was breathless . . . but still in possession of a brain, so she asked, \u201cHow long did I sleep?\u201d thinking that perhaps she\u2019d been unconscious for days, and that\u2019s why her various injuries were healing already.</p><p>\u201cThrough the day, a little longer. Sunset was an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering why your injuries have healed,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember biting me?\u201d He nodded his chin at his left shoulder where she could just make out the imprint of a human bite mark. Her bite?</p><p>\u201cOh my God! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she said instantly. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, stopping the flow of words. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, habibi. It was a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her directly, saying instead, \u201cMy blood healed you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a puzzled look. \u201cProfessor Dresner, that bitch,\u201d she added, when his eyes narrowed at the name. \u201cShe told me the reason you all were so good-looking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of us.\u201d</p><p>Sid rolled her eyes. \u201cThe reason so many of you are good-looking is because once you become a vampire, your blood heals everything that was wrong, all the defects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of us were born looking this good.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and cupped her hand to his chiseled cheek. \u201cAnd some of you are way more than just good-looking. But,\u201d she continued, \u201cnow you\u2019re telling me that the healing abilities of your blood can be extended to anyone who drinks it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our deepest secret. If you tell anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019ll have to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot I. They\u2019ll have to go through me to get to you. But eventually, the Council would kill us both.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Although the major concern is that it not become public knowledge, and you are a journalist. That brings you extra scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew! Okay. My lips are sealed. What happens if I bite you again? Do I become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s little more complicated than that, and I like you the way you are. But . . .\u201d He grew far too serious all over again. \u201cIf you continue to drink my blood, it will bind us together.\u201d</p> <p>She met his solemn gaze. \u201cLike forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as we choose to continue,\u201d he amended. \u201cBut it will link your life to mine in a very direct way. The longer we\u2019re together, the stronger the link, but even with what we\u2019ve taken from each other already, I could find you almost anywhere. I knew you were at Pinto\u2019s last night, because we got a tip. But once there, I could sense that you were alive and in that house. Now that my blood is inside you, I would no longer need help finding the house. I could track you from anywhere in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re like, going steady?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and she reached up again to touch his cheek. \u201cYou should do that more often,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLaugh. It\u2019s a good look on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, but, Sidonie, this is serious. The more you drink my blood, the tighter it binds you to me. In the way of Vampire, we will be mated.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOkay. I\u2019d rather have a diamond ring, but super healing is good, too.\u201d</p><p>ADEN STUDIED Sidonie as she gave him a sweet smile, as if he hadn\u2019t just told her she was chaining herself to him in the most visceral way imaginable. Their bodies would be linked. This wasn\u2019t some romantic human ceremony with promises of love and devotion, this was blood calling to blood. If she stayed with him long enough, their very lives would be bound together. She would remain young as long as she drank his blood, but, by the same token, if he died . . .</p><p>Sid pushed against his weight, and he let her roll them over until she was lying on top of him. Propping her hands on his chest, she stretched up and began kissing his face all over, light touches of her lips on his mouth, his cheeks and forehead, his lowered eyelids one at a time.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Aden,\u201d she whispered, and his heart clenched as his arms closed around her. But she wasn\u2019t finished. She slid from his embrace, dropping kisses along his jaw and neck, letting him feel the heat between her thighs as she slid downward. She kissed the pads of muscle over his chest, closing her mouth over one flat, male nipple and sucking it to hardness, then locking her teeth over it and biting gently.</p> <p>His cock flexed hungrily at the feel of her mouth on him, but his gut tightened and he fought the urge to take control, to obey the hard-earned instinct screaming at him to throw her over and fuck her until she begged for release. He liked, he needed, to dominate his lovers.</p><p>\u201cAden.\u201d Sidonie\u2019s whisper cut into his thoughts, and he looked up to find her eyes wide with emotion and filled with tears. \u201cI know what they did to you, baby, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Let me love you. Let me do this for you.\u201d</p><p>Aden stared at her. He knew he was twisted, that his years as a slave had warped his sexual desires by forcing him to play the submissive when dominance had been bred into his DNA. Not even his vampire Mistress had ever forced him to submit like that. He hadn\u2019t surrendered control over his body to anyone since the day he\u2019d left Zaahira\u2019s whorehouse in Morocco, and he wasn\u2019t going to start now.</p><p>Except. This was Sidonie. She was his. And somehow he had also become hers.</p><p>Aden forced himself to relax, consciously releasing one muscle at a time. Tangling his fingers in the silky strands of Sidonie\u2019s hair, he watched as she bent to her task once more, licking the skin over his abdomen and belly, her succulent mouth leaving soft, sucking kisses in a trail to his groin and lower. And there she paused, slender fingers wrapping around his straining cock, holding it like a thick stick of delicious candy as she stroked her tongue up one side and down the other, rolling her gaze up to be sure he was watching when she took only the tip of him into her mouth, working it like she would a kiss, her tongue twisting and dipping into the slit at its head.</p><p>Aden\u2019s snarled demand for more became a groan of pleasure when she finally took him fully into her mouth, his erection stiffening even further as her lips closed around him, as her head dipped lower with every slow suck, until finally the tip of his cock hit the back of her throat. She hummed with pleasure, and the sound vibrated along the taut skin of his shaft like a tuning fork. It was everything he could do not to grab her head and fuck her delicious mouth, not to slam deep into her throat until he came hard and she was forced to swallow every drop. But more even than that, he wanted the hot, wet glove of her pussy. He wanted her legs around his waist, he wanted her bucking beneath him where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cI want your pussy,\u201d he growled and fisted his hand in her hair, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>She gave his cock a final, firm suck, then lifted her head slowly, her tongue gliding all the way up his shaft until she released him, her warm breath blowing across the wet head of his dick while her eyes met his. She licked her lips, savoring the taste of him with a wicked grin.</p> <p>Aden reached for her, intending to roll her over and slam between her thighs until she screamed his name. But instead of submitting like a good girl, she braced her hands on his abs and slid up his body to straddle him once more, her pussy so hot it was like a fire against his groin. She raised herself enough to wrap her fingers around his cock, to position it between the swollen lips of her sex, and then she lowered herself slowly, surrounding his cock in the heat of her body, fucking him, mounting him.</p><p>Aden stiffened again, every muscle turned to steel, his fingers digging into her hips. But then Sidonie closed her eyes and began to rock her hips above him, swaying gently, his cock sliding in and out of her silky, wet pussy with every movement.</p><p>His fingers loosened their grip, one hand traveling up her smooth back and pulling her down until their mouths met in a slow, passionate kiss. He released her mouth gently, his teeth closing over her lower lip in a lingering bite as she struggled to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cLove you, habibi,\u201d he murmured. Her blue eyes opened in surprise and filled with crystal tears.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered. Then she sat up and began riding him harder, her hips flexing and rolling, full breasts swaying tantalizingly close before her hands came up to cup them and squeeze. Aden growled a protest at that, substituting his own fingers for hers, caressing the soft globes, pinching her nipples between thumb and forefinger, feeling a fierce satisfaction when her pussy clenched around his cock in response, when she cried out and her thighs clamped around his hips.</p><p>She raised her arms to cradle her head as she sought comfort for her growing hunger, as her moans grew in volume, becoming whimpers of need until Aden finally reached between her thighs and pressed his fingers against the swollen nub of her clit.</p><p>Her eyes flashed open, unseeing as she gave a wordless cry. Her movements became frantic, her fingers coming down to cover his as if to prevent him from lifting his hand, the swell of her breasts so enticingly erotic that Aden flexed his abs and sat up enough to take one tender globe into his mouth. Sucking until her nipple plumped like a ripe cherry, he bit down and drank in the honeyed taste of her blood, while her pussy spasmed around him, grabbing his cock like a hard fist.</p><p>Sidonie screamed as she came, leaning forward to dig her nails into his chest, her twisting hips grinding her sex against him until he could feel every convulsion of her pussy as her climax rippled along his cock. He rode out her orgasm, gritting his teeth, holding her as she shuddered in the aftermath, as she collapsed on top of him, her breasts crushed against his chest, her nipples rigid points that scraped his skin with every breath. And then he stroked a hand down her back and his fingers dipped into her tight, little asshole. He began thrusting up against her, fucking her with his cock as his fingers filled her ass, hearing her exhausted moans turn into blissful shouts as he slammed into her still-trembling pussy. Aden groaned as her sheath tightened around him yet again, as his own orgasm seized his body, his release roaring down his cock in a rush of heat, filling Sidonie as she writhed beneath him, her screams of climax meeting his roar of satisfaction as they fell together into ecstasy.</p><p>Aden wrapped his arms around Sidonie\u2019s trembling body as he fell back onto the bed. His heart was slamming against his ribs, or maybe the pounding heart was hers. She was plastered against him so tightly, their sweaty bodies so close that even he couldn\u2019t tell where one began and the other ended. Her breath was hot on his skin, her fingers stroking his chest lightly where they were trapped between them.</p><p>She sighed as he rolled her slightly to the side, permitting her to stretch her legs out from where they\u2019d been wrapped around his hips. Aden glided a calming hand over her neck and shoulder, then pulled the sheet up to cover her before she could get chilled.</p><p>Sidonie made a soft noise and burrowed closer. And Aden felt . . . content. It was such a foreign emotion that he stopped to examine it. Sidonie had done this. Aden had believed himself free of the bonds of slavery long ago, but he\u2019d been wrong. One last chain had remained, dug in so deeply that he hadn\u2019t known it was there, warping him, keeping him a slave to their twisted desires.</p><p>He hugged her close, touching his lips to her tousled hair. Sidonie\u2019s mouth curved into a smile that he felt against the bare skin of his chest, her body limp as she drifted half asleep.</p><p>He was wishing she could stay that way when his cell phone rang, vibrating across the side table like some over-caffeinated alien.</p><p>He reached out a long arm and snagged it. \u201cBastien? Give us an hour.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie stirred enough to mumble, \u201cWhat\u2019s in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, habibi. That\u2019s how long we have to shower and join the others. Come on.\u201d He put his arms around her and climbed out of bed, setting her in front of him and making sure she was steady on her feet, before propelling her toward the bathroom with a possessive hand on her ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wiggled her butt away from his hand and frowned over her shoulder, her eyes still cloudy with sleep. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked grumpily.</p><p>\u201cSouth Dakota. I\u2019m about to become an official vampire lord.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p> <p>South Dakota</p><p>SIDONIE FELT LIKE she was in a movie. One of those shadowy, film noir kind of movies, where all of the action takes place in the middle of the night, usually when it\u2019s raining. So far, her night had all the hallmarks. They\u2019d flown out of a dark, private airport outside Chicago, with no one around except for them and their flight crew. They\u2019d landed in Rapid City and rolled away from the brightly-lit main concourse to a small, dark hangar on the side, where two SUVs had been waiting for them. The SUVs had drivers, but consistent with the night\u2019s air of secrecy, they\u2019d both gone in one of the vehicles with Kage and Freddy, while Travis took the wheel of the other and drove her and Aden, with Bastien riding shotgun.</p><p>There was no rain here in South Dakota, but there was snow. After a fairly mild early winter of nothing but snow showers, the real season was finally upon them. The snow was coming down heavy and hard, but the weather didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone but her. Maybe because everyone else was an indestructible vampire who didn\u2019t have to worry about car crashes. She leaned forward to peer between the front seats and out through the windshield of the SUV. Apparently, indestructible wasn\u2019t the only thing vampires were. They could also see in the dark, because she didn\u2019t see any gleam of headlights out there.</p><p>She sat back, her fingers finding Aden\u2019s hand and squeezing\u2014for her own reassurance rather than his. One would have thought becoming a vampire lord was a big enough deal to warrant some nerves, but Aden was completely relaxed. He leaned over and kissed the top of her head but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Sid didn\u2019t know where they were going. Oh, Aden had told her they were going to visit Lucas Donlon, who was a vampire lord himself and currently ruling what was called the Plains Territory. It seemed Aden had worked for Lucas for, oh, about a century. A century! She felt like a toddler. Hell, her grandparents hadn\u2019t even been born yet when the two vampires met. This was going to take some getting used to.</p> <p>She stole a furtive glance at Aden, his profile clear in the glow of the dash lights. Yeah, that would take some getting used to, but he was worth it.</p><p>Anyway, Lucas had taken over all the vampires when Klemens, the bastard, was killed. In fact, she\u2019d overheard a conversation between Kage and Travis that made her think Lucas had been the one to kill him. But whether that was true or not\u2014and this part was difficult to understand\u2014he held the lives of the Midwestern vamps as well as his own. Sid was still learning how vampire lords did their thing, but one thing she did know was that the connection between the lords and their vampires was very direct and very personal.</p><p>\u201cIs it dangerous?\u201d she whispered to Aden.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Lucas is going to do to you tonight. Is it dangerous?\u201d</p><p>He freed his hand from hers and put his arm around her instead, pulling her against his side. \u201cNot at all. Tonight\u2019s mostly a formality. You already saw the hard part.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean when you caused the earthquake,\u201d she said confidently.</p><p>Aden huffed a laugh. \u201cI told you, that wasn\u2019t an earthquake. It was more of a concussive wave, like what happens with a pile driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill made the earth move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, habibi,\u201d he murmured in her ear, \u201cI do that every night.\u201d</p><p>Sid gave a surprised laugh, then covered her mouth with a guilty glance at the two vampires in the front seat. She didn\u2019t argue the point, though. He certainly made her earth move.</p><p>The SUV made a wide, curving turn, and there was finally something other than darkness outside the windows. There were lights and . . . a barn? With horses?</p><p>Aden caught her puzzled frown and said, \u201cLucas likes horses. He breeds them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>The SUV slowed in front of a lovely and expansive house, all lit up with landscape lights that gave off a soft golden glow. Pretty. The front door of the house opened to reveal yet another incredibly handsome vampire.</p><p>Aden turned to Sid and hugged her close. \u201cRemember, Sidonie, Lucas is a friend. No matter what you see tonight, no matter how bad it looks, I\u2019m in no danger.\u201d</p><p>Sid pulled back so she could look into his face, searching his eyes in the dim light. She had a thousand questions she needed to ask, but before she could ask even one, Bastien pulled open the truck door, and Aden was sliding across the seat and taking her with him. Almost immediately, they were surrounded by a whole bunch of vampires she didn\u2019t know then hustled up the stairs and into the house.</p><p>\u201cADEN!\u201d LUCAS\u2019S greeting was predictably enthusiastic, though the Irish vamp had learned long ago not to try the hugging thing on Aden. They did a shoulder bump instead, gripping each other\u2019s hands in a crushing hold, their shoulders slamming into each other hard enough to move a small house.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Aden greeted him. \u201cLet me introduce you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Sidonie,\u201d Lucas said before Aden could finish. He all but shoved Aden out of the way as he took Sidonie\u2019s hand in his, holding it with studied care and bringing it to his lips for a gentle kiss. \u201cI\u2019m Lucas,\u201d he purred, gazing at her over the pale curve of her fingers. \u201cAnd I am thrilled to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie gave Lucas a doubtful look, eyes narrowed and her chin tucked down. Her eyes cut to Aden with a look that said, What do I do now?</p><p>\u201cDown, boy,\u201d Aden growled and extricated Sidonie\u2019s fingers from Lucas\u2019s hold, before tucking her against his side.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes for both of us. Where is Kathryn anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lovely mate is on the phone as always,\u201d Lucas said, and Aden didn\u2019t miss the emphasis on the word mate, which was a new development. \u201cThe FBI never rests,\u201d Lucas continued. \u201cBut she\u2019ll be joining us soon. Come on back to the office. We\u2019ll get this business out of the way first.\u201d</p><p>They started down the hall and were quickly joined by Lucas\u2019s lieutenant, Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Lord Aden,\u201d Nick said with a grin, offering the same kind of handshake as Lucas, albeit with less macho posturing.</p><p>As they strolled into the office, Aden leaned over and whispered in Sidonie\u2019s ear, \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d He nodded to Bastien, who stepped up and slipped an arm around Sidonie\u2019s shoulders, pulling her away to one side where they stopped in front of a wall of black and white photographs.</p><p>Aden gave her a final reassuring look, then mirrored Lucas\u2019s move to the center of the room. There was a cluttered desk to his left, and a big leather couch to his right with a battered coffee table pushed off to one side.</p><p>Lucas stopped and turned to face Aden. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to stand on ceremony,\u201d he said in a rare moment of seriousness. \u201cYou know what to expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Aden agreed. \u201cI got a pretty good taste the other night.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s lips flattened into a wry smile. \u201cIt ain\u2019t all roses and candy, but it\u2019s a good gig.\u201d</p><p>Aden shook his head, amused by his friend\u2019s description. \u201cBetter than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Lucas granted. \u201cSo, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>He offered his hand, just as he had earlier. Aden took it, gripping hard as they went into the usual alpha male contest, but then without any warning there was suddenly nothing usual about their meeting.</p><p>Aden\u2019s gaze flashed up to meet Lucas\u2019s as their hands seemed to fuse together, making it impossible to break their hold. Lucas\u2019s eyes had taken on a golden gleam, getting brighter with every second, and Aden could feel his own power rising to meet him. The whole situation felt damn close to a challenge, and he fought to remind himself that Lucas was his friend, and that this was a willing transfer of power.</p><p>The air around them grew electric. Papers flew from Lucas\u2019s desk, and pictures rattled on the walls. And still they clenched each other\u2019s hands, their gleaming eyes meeting in a test of wills that neither of them was willing to concede. Lucas\u2019s lips peeled back in a snarl as his fangs split his gums. Aden bared his teeth in a grinning response, his gums aching until his own fangs slid out with a growl.</p><p>Arm muscles bulging, their grip tightened, drawing them together until they were nearly chest to chest. Aden was a fraction taller than his former master, and far bulkier, but then, physical strength wasn\u2019t what mattered here. This was about raw power, pure and simple, and the two of them had power to spare. The walls began to groan from the pressure, and Lucas hissed his displeasure.</p><p>His fingers squeezed Aden\u2019s until they were both bleeding, until they crashed to the floor, kneeling together, hands still clasped before them.</p><p>\u201cAden, damn it,\u201d Lucas finally growled. \u201cLet. Me. In.\u201d</p><p>Aden grinned, pleased to have made his friend ask, because hadn\u2019t that been the entire point of this little display? Lucas was a friend, but he was also a rival vampire lord. Because when it came to vampire lords, there was no other kind. Lucas had clearly hoped to use his knowledge of Aden, and the loyalty between them, as a weak spot, a door to slip into Aden\u2019s mind and force the transfer.</p><p>But he\u2019d had to ask nicely instead.</p><p>With that thought, Aden opened his mind. The transfer started as a trickle, but soon became a flood, as the lives of thousands of vampires, every single bloodsucker living in the Midwest, roared into Aden\u2019s soul. The onslaught was a far greater burden than he\u2019d ever thought to bear, far greater even than he\u2019d expected after seizing power the other night. But he took them willingly, soothing their fears as, for the second time in months, they found themselves with a new master. He welcomed them all, the ones who greeted his arrival with joy and the holdovers from Klemens, even the ones who would miss the dead lord\u2019s depravity and utter lack of decency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aden absorbed their lives, their histories, until he thought he\u2019d burst, until he thought he could bear no more, and still they came. And then finally, with a long relieved breath, Lucas\u2019s gaze broke, and his chin dropped to his chest. His grip loosened as his hand slipped away from Aden\u2019s to fall limply to his side.</p><p>With matching groans of relief, they both sat back on their heels, chests heaving with effort. The level of vampiric power thundering around the room dropped abruptly. Papers and pictures settled, albeit not in precisely the same places, and the walls ceased their groaning with only a few cracks to show for it.</p><p>Aden remained kneeling on the floor as he struggled to make sense of all the new feelings and needs filling every corner of his self. It hurt his soul to have them there. There was a constant tug of war inside him, between the person who was Aden and the vampire who was now Lord of the Midwest. He sighed tiredly and felt a gentle hand on the back of his neck.</p> <p>\u201cAden?\u201d Sidonie knelt next to him, her arm around his back as if offering him her strength and support, her cheek resting on his shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>His arm reached out automatically, circling her waist and pulling her against him. He raised his head and met her concerned gaze, and he wondered anew that this woman loved him.</p><p>He touched his lips to hers. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cBetter now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She blushed hotly, her gaze cutting sideways to where Lucas still knelt far too close.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind Lucas,\u201d Aden assured her. \u201cI\u2019ve tuckered him all out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Lucas growled right on cue and surged to his feet, as if ready to do it all over again.</p><p>But Aden had anticipated his friend. He grabbed Sidonie and stood just as quickly, taking two steps back to put some distance between them.</p><p>Lucas stared at Aden for a long moment, then huffed a laugh. \u201cThis definitely calls for a drink.\u201d He looked around the office, which was somewhat worse for the wear. \u201cMaybe we should have done this outside.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cToo late now, but let\u2019s go down the hall. The booze is better, and, if I\u2019m not mistaken, my Katie is waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Sidonie closed her fingers over Aden\u2019s arm when they stepped out of the office, holding him back as the others crossed the main entrance hall and continued into the opposite wing, turning into a room about halfway down.</p><p>Aden gave Sidonie a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cIs that the last of it?\u201d she asked softly, touching his bleeding fingers. She lifted her head, and there was a sheen of tears in her eyes. For him? \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p> <p>He had to admit his hand ached like a son of a bitch, like every finger bone had been cracked to the edge of breaking. But he couldn\u2019t tell her that.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut not too bad. Lucas is probably feeling much worse.\u201d He could only hope, he thought privately.</p><p>Sidonie shook her head, her lips flattened reprovingly. \u201cYou guys are like children in a schoolyard. Are you finished now? No more tests, no more earthquakes?\u201d</p><p>They started walking down the hall to where the others could be heard talking.</p><p>\u201cNo more tests,\u201d Aden agreed. \u201cAs for the other, time is short. I\u2019ll need to consolidate the territory under my authority as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in concentration. \u201cYou mean some of Klemens\u2019s people might try to take it back from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might try, but they won\u2019t succeed,\u201d Aden said, shaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t let them. There\u2019s a far greater danger to all of us looming on the horizon, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it . . . tomorrow,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cI just became Lord of the Midwest, and damn it, I\u2019m taking one night and forgetting everything else. No worrying about the territory or a war that might not come. Tonight, you and I are going to celebrate. All of that other crap will still be waiting for us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>Chicago, IL</p><p>SIDONIE HURRIED into Aden\u2019s office suite in the new house. They\u2019d moved in two weeks ago, after the shortest escrow she\u2019d ever heard of. Vampires really must be magical, she thought, if they could purchase a property this big and expensive with a thirty-day escrow. It helped that the house had been empty for a while. The sellers had been what their agent called \u201chighly motivated\u201d and what Aden\u2019s agent called \u201cdesperate.\u201d They\u2019d been more than happy to let the vamps begin renovating the property for their specific needs even before the purchase went through. Renovating in this case mostly meant installing extensive security measures, including a new front gate and sensors all over the grounds that were worthy of the White House. In fact, she was pretty sure the White House didn\u2019t have this level of sophistication, it being the peoples\u2019 house and all.</p><p>The new house was huge, three levels in two wings, including a basement which had been completely retrofitted to provide secure accommodations for lots of vampires. There were new vamps joining Aden\u2019s security detail every day, and Bastien had told her there would be many more. It was more than simple security. It was an army, and they were already training like one.</p><p>She and Aden had a private basement suite of their own, well removed from the others. Doors had been installed on all basement entrances that more closely resembled the kind on big bank vaults, and there were redundancies on redundancies.</p><p>Sidonie had gotten used to the security and to living mostly at night. Although being human, she still needed sunlight, and being female, she needed to have her hair and nails done and to indulge in the occasional shopping spree or lunch with friends.</p><p>Like today, when she\u2019d discovered a whole new crop of friends who truly did get where she was coming from. Tonight was the official welcoming for Aden as Lord of the Midwest and member of the North American Vampire Council. All of the other vampire lords were in town, and Sid had been delighted to discover that most of them had mates and they\u2019d brought them along.</p><p>The mates had all gone shopping today, a field trip organized by Cyn, who was the woman Sid had seen across the room talking to Aden that very first night at the gala. Cyn had seemed to take it as her personal mission in life to get them all into as much trouble as possible. Fortunately, cooler heads had prevailed, and they\u2019d settled for a wine-fueled lunch, with shopping afterward.</p><p>Sid glanced down at her arm and had to stifle a laugh. Well, cooler heads had mostly prevailed. She was feeling far more wicked than cool right now. But then Aden loved it when she was wicked, and Sid loved it when he taught her the error of her ways. She grinned happily, just thinking about it.</p><p>Kage was lounging on the big leather couch in the outermost room of the office suite, his muscular arms mostly bare in a short-sleeved shirt that showed off his tattoos, his piercings glinting in the low light. He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s things, Sid? You ladies have a good time today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did, yes, and look\u2014\u201d She pushed up the sleeve of her sweater. \u201cI got a tattoo!\u201d</p><p>Kage\u2019s smile froze on his face. He came off the couch in a single, smooth movement, his gaze fixed on the delicate feathered quill sketched on her right forearm.</p><p>As if drawn by Kage\u2019s reaction, Bastien, Travis, and Freddy suddenly appeared and gathered around, all of them staring at the tattoo as if expecting it to leap off her arm and go for their throats.</p><p>\u201cSidonie.\u201d Aden\u2019s deep voice had all four of his vampires jerking in surprise, which was a surprise in itself. She\u2019d never seen them react that way before. They always knew where he was.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she turned around with a smile. She didn\u2019t know what the vamps\u2019 problem was, but she was feeling good and was happy to see her lover. She crossed the room and raised her arms automatically for a welcoming hug and kiss. She was used to waking up with him and had missed him today.</p><p>But like the others, Aden\u2019s gaze was riveted to her forearm, with its new artwork.</p><p>His brow lowered, and he seemed to swell with anger, his eyes shifting to glare at his vampires.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck\u2014\u201d he started.</p><p>But Kage quickly interrupted, another first in Sid\u2019s experience. \u201cI would never, my lord. Not any of us. But I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sid had had enough. She stomped her foot to get their attention, but directed her anger at Aden. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal. It\u2019s my arm. If I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let someone touch you, let them bleed you?\u201d Aden demanded.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, then abruptly realized the significance of what she\u2019d done. If she\u2019d learned nothing else in her time with Aden, it was that vampire lords were territorial about everything, including, no, especially, when it came to their mates. They were the alpha of all alphas. They made Tarzan look like a piker. And a tattoo? What had she been thinking? Blood was the ultimate prize to a vampire. She might as well have opened a vein and let another male take a lick.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cLook . . .\u201d She rushed over to the desk and opened a drawer, grabbing the package of hand wipes that was inside. Ripping it open, she rubbed the wipe over her pretty feather quill. \u201cIt\u2019s temporary,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt comes right off.\u201d</p><p>Aden gave her a level look, then glanced over her head at his vamps. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the conference room.\u201d With murmurs of \u201cSire\u201d and \u201cmy lord,\u201d they all filed out of the office, closing the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sidonie.\u201d</p><p>Sid thought about how wicked she\u2019d been feeling, and how she\u2019d looked forward to her time alone with Aden. But this was not what she\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>She finished cleaning off her new \u201cink,\u201d then walked over to gaze up at him, her hands resting on his narrow hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Aden said, surprising her yet again. This whole evening was turning out to be one giant surprise.</p><p>Her face must have registered her shock, because he laughed and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI may have overreacted. This time. If I\u2019d paid attention to my nose instead of my eyes, I\u2019d have known there was no blood and that the tattoo couldn\u2019t be real. But let\u2019s be clear about one thing. Your body is mine. No one writes on it, but me. And sure as hell no one pierces it but me.\u201d He punctuated this last with a press of his growing erection against her belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sid drew a relieved breath, feeling as if the crisis was over. \u201cWhat about if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a tattoo, Kage will do it, and I\u2019ll supervise. But I love your skin just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only temporary,\u201d she reminded him woefully. \u201cWe all got them. Different ones, but we all got something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the mates, even Colin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is Colin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mated to Sophia, she\u2019s Lord of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who Sophia is. I didn\u2019t know she was mated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe used to be a Navy SEAL. I think he and Cyn know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyn,\u201d he repeated drily. \u201cI bet this was her idea.\u201d</p><p>Sid nodded. \u201cWhen she found out I was mated to you, she couldn\u2019t believe it. She said you were a cold son of a bitch, and that you owed her money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she? She\u2019s just a sore loser. We hunted the same prey not long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on your point of view. Cyn located the prey, but I did the killing.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe sent me a huge fucking bill for services rendered. What\u2019d you do when she said that about me?\u201d he asked curiously.</p> <p>\u201cI told her to keep her fucking opinion to herself, and besides, you were the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Let me see your arm,\u201d he said, switching subjects.</p><p>He took her arm in his big hand and examined it carefully. The skin was red and irritated where she\u2019d rubbed the tattoo off. It was especially noticeable, given her pale complexion, and she sighed.</p><p>Pulling her closer, Aden kissed her arm with a tenderness that she knew would surprise everyone but her. But then, as if to remind her of that fact, he immediately dropped his big hand to her butt and palmed both cheeks possessively. \u201cI think we need to establish some ground rules, habibi. But, later.\u201d He patted her butt lightly. Sid took this as a warning of things to come and felt a zing of anticipation that quickly speared down between her thighs in a rush of wet heat.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s my Sidonie. Come on, I don\u2019t want to be late for my first Council meeting.\u201d</p> <p>ON THE OTHER side of the big house, Raphael stood silently on the mezzanine at the top of the stairs. His fellow vampire lords were gathering below, outside the conference room where they would soon meet as the North American Vampire Council to confirm Aden\u2019s addition to their ranks. The lords arrived in twos and threes, talking and joking with each other for the most part, shaking hands and clapping Aden on the back in congratulations. Even Sophia joined in the greetings, her big SEAL of a mate standing with her, daring anyone to get too close. Not so long ago, these meetings had been hostile affairs, the individual lords arriving late and leaving early, the eight of them sitting around a huge table, barely speaking.</p><p>Raphael had worked hard over the last two years to change that, doing whatever was necessary to put vampires on the Council who could, and would, work together. He had understood when no one else had that the vampires of North America would need a united Council, that an invasion from Europe was only a matter of time.</p><p>Down below, only one Council member still remained apart, his lip curled in disdain as he skirted the boisterous group and went directly into the conference room, his lieutenant behind him. Enrique Fernandez del Solar had ruled over Mexico for more than two hundred years and seemed determined to stay there for another two hundred. He was the only remaining member of the old guard on this Council, other than Raphael himself. But Raphael saw the future, while Enrique was more likely to dwell in the past. And that made him a potential breaking point for the entire continent. He would never agree to work with the others, and so he had to go.</p><p>Raphael knew things about Enrique\u2019s territory that he doubted even the old vampire lord knew, not least of which was that the loyalty of his lieutenant, Vincent, was no longer as staunch as it should be. Vincent had been lieutenant nearly as long as Enrique had been lord. But the Mexican vampires were increasingly frustrated by Enrique\u2019s iron rule, by his unwillingness to change, and Vincent was the focal point for that restlessness.</p><p>Unfortunately for Enrique, Vincent was about to discover a truth that would push his loyalty to the very brink. In fact, Raphael was betting the discovery would tip Vincent right over the edge, and that Enrique\u2019s lies would finally be his downfall.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell them about the letter?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s mouth curved into an automatic smile at the sound of Cyn\u2019s voice behind him. She stepped up to his side, and he slipped an arm around her waist, leaning down to breathe in the scent that was hers alone.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he murmured, answering her question.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them.\u201d</p><p>Cyn studied the group as he had, her gaze sharpening when she caught a glimpse of Enrique through the open doors as he settled into a chair against the far wall.</p><p>\u201cEnrique?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Raphael nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnything we can do about it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled in amusement and hugged her closely. \u201cEven I can\u2019t control everything, my Cyn. But there are events moving even now that I suspect will see a new Council member joining us soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Jared\u2019s deep voice drew Raphael\u2019s attention to the fact that all of the other lords had disappeared into the conference room and taken their seats.</p><p>Raphael bent to brush his lips against Cyn\u2019s. This meeting was for the lords and their lieutenants only. One lord, one lieutenant. He could have taken Cyn instead of Jared. No one would have questioned him. But Jared needed to know that Raphael trusted him, and so did the others. Jared had a role to play before this was over, and he would need all of his confidence if they were to survive.</p><p>So, he kissed Cyn and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you shortly.\u201d He let his hand slide down her back and over the curve of her hip as he stepped away.</p><p>She nodded, seeming to understand, and he thanked whatever fate had brought her to his side. They would all need people they could rely on in the coming months, people who would stand by them and not flinch in the face of danger.</p><p>But he would need Cyn more than ever.</p><p>To be continued . . . </p> </body></html>"]
