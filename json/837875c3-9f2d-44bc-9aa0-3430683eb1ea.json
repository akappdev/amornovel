With her short gray hair, lined face, and generous curves, she reminded me of the grandmotherly types often seen on TV sitcoms. It was only her blue eyes\u2014or rather, only the power that glowed within them\u2014that gave the game away. Adeline Greenfield was a witch, a very powerful and successful one.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I mean, I can hear them, and sometimes I can see them, but they don\u2019t seem to hear or acknowledge me.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cI thought if I was on the same plane as they are\u2014if I astral-traveled to them\u2014it might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d She set the teapot down and frowned. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you help relocate a ghost that was causing all sorts of mischief at the Brindle?\u201d</p><p>The Brindle was the witch depository located here in Melbourne, and it held within its walls centuries of knowledge, spells, and other witch-related paraphernalia. \u201cYes, but it wasn\u2019t really a ghost. It was actually a mischievous soul who was undecided about moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouls are usually incapable of interaction with this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the Brindle is a place of power, and that gave her the ability.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded sagely. \u201cIt is still odd that you cannot speak to them the same way as your mother, because I\u2019m sure she said you had the skill.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cYou knew Mom?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThose of us truly capable of hearing the dead are few and far between, so yes, I knew her. We had lunch occasionally.\u201d</p><p>That was something I hadn\u2019t known. But then, there was probably a whole lot of stuff I\u2019d never known about my mother\u2014and never would, given she\u2019d been murdered. Grief swirled, briefly touching my voice as I said, \u201cWell, no matter what she may have believed, the dead won\u2019t speak to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts can be vexing creatures,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd they often have no desire to acknowledge their death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is ignoring me helping them disregard the fact that they\u2019re dead?\u201d</p> <p>She placed a couple of sugars in each cup, then gently stirred the tea. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the dead here. Their minds are not what they once were, especially those who have been murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he\u2019d been murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. Trouble, my dear, darkens your steps, and it\u2019s not such a leap to think that if you want to speak to a ghost, it\u2019s because he died before his time. Otherwise, your reaper would have been able to find out whatever you needed.\u201d She handed me a cup of tea, then glanced over my right shoulder. \u201cI would prefer it, by the way, if you\u2019d just show yourself. It\u2019s impolite to skulk on the edges of the gray fields like that.\u201d</p><p>Heat shimmered across my skin as Azriel appeared. Of course, he wasn\u2019t strictly a reaper, as they were soul guides. He was something much more\u2014or, if you believed him, something much less\u2014and that was a Mijai, a dark angel who hunted and killed the things that broke free from hell.</p><p>But what he hunted now wasn\u2019t an escapee demon, daemon, or even a spirit\u2014although we certainly had been hunting one of those. We\u2019d gotten it, too, but not before the fucking thing had almost killed me. Which was why I was moving like an old woman right now\u2014everything still hurt. I might be half werewolf, but fast healing was one of the gifts I hadn\u2019t inherited enough of. In fact, I couldn\u2019t shift into wolf shape at all, and the full moon held no sway over me.</p><p>Of course, I could heal myself via my Aedh heritage, but shifting in and out of Aedh form required energy, and I didn\u2019t have enough of that, either.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Adeline said, satisfaction in her voice. \u201cNow, would you like a cup of tea, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>There was a hint of amusement in Azriel\u2019s mellow tones, and it played through my being like the caress of gentle fingers. Longing shivered through me.</p><p>Adeline picked up her own cup, a frown once again marring her homely features. \u201cWhy do you wear a sword, reaper? There is no threat in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there is not,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>When it became obvious he didn\u2019t intend to say anything else, Adeline turned her expectant gaze to me.</p><p>\u201cHe wears a sword because he\u2019s helping me hunt down some\u2014\u201d I hesitated. For safety\u2019s sake I couldn\u2019t tell her everything, yet I couldn\u2019t not explain, either. Not if I wanted her help. \u201c\u2014rogue priests who seek the keys to the gates of heaven and hell so they can permanently close them.\u201d</p><p>That raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhy on earth would anyone want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re not of earth.\u201d They were Aedh, energy beings who lived on the gray fields\u2014the area that divided earth from heaven and hell. Or the light and dark portals, as the reapers tended to say. While the reaper community had flourished, the Aedh had not. They\u2019d all but died out, and only the Raziq\u2014a breakaway group of priests\u2014were left in any great numbers. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve decided it would be easier to permanently shut the gates to all souls than to keep guarding against the occasional demon breakout.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut that would mean no soul could move on and be reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they don\u2019t care about that. They just see the bigger picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely the number of demons who break out of hell is minor when compared to the chaos that closing the gates permanently would cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t think the priests care.\u201d Not about the human race in general, and certainly not about babies being born without souls and ending up as little more than inanimate lumps of flesh. \u201cThey just want their life of servitude to the gates ended.\u201d</p><p>Which is how I\u2019d gotten involved in this whole mess in the first place. The Raziq had developed three keys that would permanently open or close the gates. The only trouble was, my father, who was one of the Raziq responsible for making the keys, had not only stolen the keys but had arranged to have them hidden\u2014so well that even he knew only a general location. And as he could no longer take on flesh form, he now needed me to do his footwork, since only someone of his bloodline could detect the hidden keys.</p><p>In fact, everyone needed me\u2014the Raziq, the reapers, the high vampire council. And all of them wanted the keys for very different reasons.</p><p>Adeline said, \u201cAnd this is why you wish to speak so urgently to this ghost? He knows of the keys?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cNo. But he might have some information about a dark sorcerer who could be tied up in all this mess. We questioned our ghost when he was alive, but someone very powerful had blocked sections of his memories. We\u2019re hoping death might have removed those blocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rather vague hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is still better than no hope.\u201d I took a sip of tea, then shuddered at the almost bitter taste and put the cup down. Tea had never been a favorite beverage of mine.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you wish to start?\u201d Adeline asked.</p><p>\u201cNow, if possible.\u201d</p><p>She frowned again. \u201cYour energy levels feel extremely low. It\u2019s generally not considered a wise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdeline,\u201d I interrupted softly, \u201cI may not get another chance to do this.\u201d</p><p>Mainly because I\u2019d been ordered by my father to retrieve a note from Southern Cross Station later this morning, and who the hell knew what would happen after that? But if past retrievals were any indication, then hell was likely to break loose\u2014at least metaphysically speaking, if not physically.</p><p>She studied me for several minutes, then said, \u201cIf you insist, then I must help you, even if it is against my better judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust?\u201d I raised my eyebrows. \u201cThat almost sounds like you\u2019ve been ordered to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have, and by Kiandra herself, no less.\u201d She eyed me thoughtfully. \u201cYou have some very powerful allies, young woman.\u201d</p><p>Surprise rippled through me. Kiandra\u2014who was head witch at the Brindle\u2014had helped me on several occasions, but only after I\u2019d approached her. That she was now anticipating my needs suggested she knew a lot more about what was going on than I\u2019d guessed. \u201cDid she say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said only that your quest has grave implications for us all, and that it behooves us to provide assistance where possible.\u201d</p><p>Which suggested that Kiandra did know about the existence of the keys and our effort to retrieve them. And I guess that wasn\u2019t really surprising\u2014surely you couldn\u2019t become the head of all witches without some working knowledge of the fields and the beings that inhabited them.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I need to do this now, Adeline.\u201d</p><p>She continued to study me, her expression concerned. \u201cWhat do you know of astral traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot, though I suspect it won\u2019t be that dissimilar to traveling the gray fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Astral travel is simply your consciousness or spirit traveling through earth\u2019s realm, whereas the gray fields are merely the void through which your soul journeys on its way to heaven or hell. But there are a few rules and dangers you should be aware of before we attempt this.\u201d</p><p>Having traveled through the gray fields many times, I knew they were hardly a void, as they were where the reapers lived. But I simply said, \u201cThere usually are when it comes to anything otherworldly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThought is both your magic carpet and your foe on the astral plane. If you want to go somewhere, think of the precise location and you will be projected there. By the same token, if you become afraid, you can create an instant nightmare.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. She continued. \u201cBe aware that any thought related to your physical body will bring you back to your body. This includes the fear that your physical body may be hurt in some way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned. \u201cIf I can\u2019t speak or move, how am I going to question my ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t move, and you think the questions, the same as you think of the location. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs mud.\u201d</p> <p>She eyed me for a moment, the concern in her expression deepening. \u201cThe astral plane is inhabited by two types of spirits: those who cannot\u2014for one reason or another\u2014move on spiritually, and other astral travelers. And just like walking down the street, you cannot control who\u2019s on the astral fields. But you can be certain that not all will be on the side of the angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should watch my metaphysical ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. At your current energy levels, you could attract energies who are darker in life, and they may cause you problems on the astral plane or follow you onto this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle unpleasant energies on this plane. And if I can\u2019t, Azriel can.\u201d I paused. \u201cWhat of the dangers?\u201d</p><p>Her expression darkened. \u201cWhile you cannot die on the fields themselves, it is possible to become trapped there. It is also possible to become so enraptured by whatever illusion surrounds you on the plane that what happens there can echo through your physical being.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cSo if I somehow imagine getting whacked on the plane, my body can be bruised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the illusion is powerful enough, yes. And if you find yourself entrapped there, you risk death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Azriel said, before Adeline could, \u201cflesh cannot survive great lengths of time without its soul. And while the astral body is not the entirety of the soul, if you find death when your astral being is not present in your body, then your soul is not complete and cannot move on. You would become one of the lost ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking it would be a walk in the park.\u201d I swept a hand through my short hair and wished, just once, that something was. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>She glanced past me briefly, then rose. \u201cCome with me, then.\u201d</p> <p>I followed her out of the living room and down the long hall, my footsteps echoing softly on her wooden floors. Azriel made no sound, although the heat of his presence burned into my spine and chased away the chill of apprehension.</p><p>Adeline stopped at the last door on the right and opened it. \u201cPlease take your shoes off.\u201d</p><p>I did so as she stepped to one side and motioned me to enter. The room was dark and smelled faintly of lavender and chamomile, and my bare feet disappeared into a thick layer of mats and silk.</p><p>\u201cLie down and make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at Azriel. Though his face was almost classical in its beauty, it possessed the hard edge of a man who\u2019d won more than his fair share of battles. He was shirtless, his skin a warm, suntanned brown and his abs well defined. The worn leather strap that held his sword in place emphasized the width of his shoulders, and the dark jeans that clung to his legs hinted at their lean strength. His stance was that of a fighter, a warrior\u2014one who not only protected me, but had saved me more than once. And would continue to do so, for as long as I was of use to him.</p><p>Still, I couldn\u2019t help mentally asking, You\u2019ll be here?</p><p>I\u2019ll be here to protect your physical form, yes. His thought ran like sunshine through my mind. I wasn\u2019t telepathic in any way, shape, or form, but that didn\u2019t matter when it came to Azriel. He could hear my thoughts as clearly as the spoken word. Unfortunately, the only time I heard his thoughts was at times like now, when it was a deliberate act on his part. But not on the plane. Astral travelers are of this world, not mine, so you are basically little more than a ghost to me. I cannot interact with you in any way.</p><p>Reaper rules?</p> <p>Reaper rules. He hesitated, and something flashed through the mismatched blue of his eyes. Something so bright and sharp it made my breath hitch. Be careful. It would be most . . . inconvenient . . . if you find death on the astral plane.</p><p>Inconvenient? I shucked off my jacket and tossed it to one side with a little more force than necessary. Yeah, I guess it would be. I mean, who else would find the damn keys for you if something happened to me?</p><p>That, he said, an edge riding his mental tone, is an unfair statement.</p><p>Yeah, it was. But goddamn it, if I was an inconvenience to him, then he was a vast source of frustration to me. And on more than one level. Was it any wonder that it occasionally got the better of me and resulted in a snippy remark?</p><p>That frustration is shared by us both, Risa.</p><p>I glanced at him sharply. His expression was its usual noncommittal self, but the slightest hint of a smile played about his lips. I snorted softly. If he was implying he was as sexually frustrated as me, then he had only himself to blame. After all, he was the one determined to keep our relationship strictly professional now that desire had been acknowledged and acted upon. Although how he could ignore what still burned between us I had no idea. I was certainly struggling with it.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d Adeline said softly, \u201cyou must lie down before we can proceed.\u201d</p><p>I did as she ordered, and the mats wrapped around me, warm and comforting. Adeline closed the door and the darkness engulfed us. The scents sharpened, slipping in with every breath and easing the tension in my limbs.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said softly, her voice at one with the serenity in the room. \u201cTo astral-travel, you must achieve a sense of complete and utter relaxation.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and released awareness of everything and everyone else around me, concentrating on nothing more than slowing my breathing. The beat of my heart became more measured, and warmth began to throb at my neck as the charm Ilianna\u2014my best friend and housemate\u2014had made me kicked into action. It was little more than a small piece of petrified wood, to connect me to the earth, and two small stones\u2014agate and serpentine\u2014for protection, but it had saved my life when a spirit had attacked me on the gray fields, and I\u2019d been wearing it ever since. That it was glowing now meant it would protect me on the astral plane as fiercely as it did on the gray fields, and I was suddenly glad of that.</p><p>Though why I thought I might need that protection I had no idea.</p><p>\u201cLet your mind be the wind,\u201d Adeline intoned. \u201cLet it be without thought or direction, free and easy.\u201d</p><p>A sense of peace settled around me. My breathing slowed even further, until I was on the cusp of sleep.</p><p>\u201cA rope hangs above your chest. You cannot see it in the darkness, but it is there. Believe in it. When you are ready, reach for it. Not physically\u2014metaphysically. Feel it in your hands, feel the roughness of the fibers against your skin, feel the strength within it.\u201d</p><p>I reached up with imaginary hands and grasped the rope. It felt thick and real, and as strong as steel.</p><p>\u201cIgnore physical sensation and use the rope to pull yourself upright. Imagine yourself rising from your body and stepping free of all constraints.\u201d</p><p>I gripped harder with my imaginary hands and pulled myself upward along the rope. Dizziness swept over me, seeming to come from the center of my chest. I kept pulling myself upright and the pressure grew, until my whole body felt heavy. I ignored it, as ordered, and every inch of me began to vibrate. Then, with a suddenness that surprised me, I was free and floating in the darkness above my prone form.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t really dark. Adeline\u2019s aura lit the room with a deep violet, and Azriel\u2019s was an intense gold. Which surprised me\u2014I\u2019d have put money on the fact that his would be the fierce white I saw on the fields. The black tats that decorated his skin\u2014the biggest of which resembled half of a dragon, with a wing that swept around his ribs from underneath his arm and brushed the left side of his neck\u2014shimmered in the darkness and seemed to hold no distinct color.</p><p>Only that half dragon wasn\u2019t actually a tat. It was a Du\u0161an\u2014a darker, more abstract brother to the one that had crawled onto my left arm and now resided within my flesh. They were originally created to protect the Aedh priests who had once guarded the gates, but we had no idea who\u2019d sent them to us\u2014although Azriel suspected it was probably my father\u2019s doing. He was one of the few left in this world\u2014or the next\u2014who had the power to make them.</p><p>Valdis, the sword at Azriel\u2019s back, dripped the same blue fire on the astral field as she did in the real world, and it made me wonder if my own sword, Amaya, would be visible on this plane, given that she was little more than a deadly shadow normally.</p><p>I shoved the thought aside, then closed my eyes and conjured the image of the area where our ghost\u2014Frank Logan\u2014had met his doom.</p><p>In an instant, I was standing in front of the gigantic shed that was the Central Pier function center. On the night Logan had been murdered, this place had been filled with life and sound, and the pavement lined with taxis and limos waiting to pick up passengers. Now it was little more than a vague ghost town\u2014figuratively and literally.</p><p>I looked around. The first thing I saw was a man, watching me. He was tall, with regal features and a body that was as lean as a whip. A fighter, I thought, staring at him.</p><p>As our gazes met, humor seemed to touch his lips and he bowed slightly.</p><p>I frowned, and thought, Do I know you?</p><p>No, but I know you rather well. I\u2019ve been following you around for weeks.</p><p>His voice was cool, without inflection but not unpleasant.</p><p>Why would you\u2014 I stopped and suddenly realized just who he was. You\u2019re the Cazador Madeline Hunter has following me?</p><p>I certainly am, ma\u2019am.</p><p>I blinked at his politeness, although I wasn\u2019t really sure why it surprised me. I had grown up hearing tales about the men and women who formed the ranks of the Cazadors\u2014the high vampire council\u2019s own personal hit squad\u2014and I suppose I just expected them all to be fierce and fearsome.</p><p>He gave me another slight bow. Markel Sanchez, at your service.</p><p>Well, forgive me for saying this, Markel, but you\u2019re a pain in my ass and I\u2019d rather not have you following me around, on this plane or in life.</p><p>Trust me, ma\u2019am, this is not my desire, either. But it has been ordered and I must obey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I raised imaginary eyebrows. Meaning even the Cazadors are wary of Hunter?</p><p>If they are wise and value their lives, yes.</p><p>Which said a lot about Hunter\u2019s power. She might be the head honcho at the Directorate of Other Races, but she was also a high-ranking member of the high vampire council and, I suspected, plotting to take it over completely.</p> <p>I need to speak to a ghost. You\u2019re not going to interfere, are you?</p><p>I\u2019m here to listen and report. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>I nodded and turned away from him. A grayish figure stood not far away. He was standing side on, looking ahead rather than at me, and he was a big man with well-groomed hair, a Roman nose, and a sharp chin. Frank Logan.</p><p>I imagined myself standing beside him, and suddenly I was. If only it were this easy to travel in Aedh form.</p><p>Mr. Logan, I need to speak to you.</p> <p>He jumped, then swung around so violently that tendrils of smoke swirled away from his body.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d He wasn\u2019t using thought, and his words were crisp and clear, echoing around me like the clap of thunder.</p><p>I\u2019m Risa Jones. I was standing nearby when you were murdered.</p><p>His expression showed a mix of disbelief and confusion. \u201cI\u2019m dead? How can I be dead? I can see you. I can see the buildings around me. I can\u2019t be dead. Damn it, where\u2019s my limo? I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>He was never going home. Never moving on. He\u2019d died before his time, and no reaper had been waiting to collect his soul. He was one of the lost ones\u2014doomed to roam the area of death for eternity.</p><p>But I suspected nothing I could say would ever convince him of this, and I wasn\u2019t about to even try\u2014that could take far more time than I probably had on this plane. Mr. Logan, I need to speak to you about John Nadler.</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, young woman, but I can\u2019t talk to you about clients\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Logan, John Nadler is dead\u2014murdered. I imagined a cop\u2019s badge, then showed it to him. We\u2019d appreciate your helping us willingly, Mr. Logan, but we will subpoena you if required.</p><p>His confusion deepened. \u201cWhen was Nadler murdered? I was talking to him just today.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s \u201ctoday\u201d had actually been several days ago. Which is why we need to speak to you. We believe you could be the last person to have seen him alive.</p><p>Or at least, the last person to have seen the face-shifter who\u2019d killed the real Nadler and assumed his identity. The real Nadler had been dead\u2014and frozen\u2014for many, many years, and that was the body the cops now had.</p><p>The Nadler Logan had known had used Nadler\u2019s money and influence to purchase nearly all the buildings around West Street in Clifton Hill\u2014a street that just happened to cross one of the most powerful ley-line intersections in Melbourne. It was also an intersection that seemed very tied up in the desperate scramble to find the portal keys. According to Azriel, the intersections could be used to manipulate time, reality, or fate, and it was likely that whoever had stolen the first key from us\u2014or rather, from me\u2014had used the intersection to access the gray fields and permanently open the first portal.</p><p>Suggesting that the face-shifter was either a sorcerer himself or worked for someone who was. Only those well versed in magic could use the ley lines.</p><p>Of course, why the hell anyone would want to weaken the only thing that stood between us and the hordes of hell, I had no idea. Not even Azriel could answer that one.</p> <p>But we\u2019d obviously gotten too close to uncovering who the face-shifter was, so he\u2019d stepped out of Nadler\u2019s life and into a new one. Unless Logan could reveal something about the man he\u2019d known as Nadler, our search was right back at square one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can help you,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHe was just a client. I didn\u2019t know much about him on a personal level.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re not interested in his personal life, but rather his business one. I hesitated. What can you tell me about the deal he made with the heirs of James Trilby and Garvin Appleby?</p><p>Trilby and Appleby were the two other members of the consortium the fake Nadler had formed to purchase all the land around West Street. Their heirs had decided to sue the consortium\u2014and therefore John Nadler, who had, when they died, become sole owner\u2014for a bigger piece of the land pie. They\u2019d reached an out-of-court settlement the day before Nadler had pulled the plug on his stolen identity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>Please, Mr. Logan, just answer the question.</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair. The action stirred the ghostly strands, making them whirl into the ether before settling back down.</p><p>From somewhere in the distance came a gentle vibration, and the sensation crept around me, making the shadowy world surrounding us tremble. It almost felt like the beginnings of a quake, but was that even possible on the astral fields? Even as the thought ran through my mind, the shadows around me began to quiver, and Adeline\u2019s warning came back to me. I took a deep breath, imagining calmness. The shadowy world close to us stilled, but the distant vibration continued. It was a weird sensation\u2014and it felt like trouble. I forced myself to ignore it and returned my attention to Logan.</p><p>\u201cNadler agreed to pay them several million dollars each,\u201d he said, \u201cin exchange for them signing an agreement to accept the wills as they currently stand.\u201d</p><p>And will those payments proceed now that Nadler is dead?</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOf course. The heirs just won\u2019t get the payment as quickly, because it\u2019ll be tied up until Nadler\u2019s estate is sorted.\u201d</p><p>And who is Nadler\u2019s heir? He has no children and he divorced his wife a long time ago. A fact, I thought bitterly, that hadn\u2019t stopped the fake Nadler from killing her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there\u2019s a good percentage of men and women who forget to change their wills even after a second marriage, and it\u2019s not unknown for the first partner to get the estate.\u201d He paused, eyeing me critically. \u201cHave you got a will, young woman? It\u2019s never too late to start. I can offer you excellent\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thanks, I interrupted quickly, and rubbed imaginary arms. That vibration was getting stronger, and it was not pleasant. But I\u2019m good will-wise. Now, Nadler\u2019s heirs?</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to remember?\u201d His tone was cross. \u201cI haven\u2019t got the paperwork with me, and he\u2019s not my only client, you know.\u201d</p><p>I know. Just think back to the agreement. Imagine you have it in your hand.</p><p>He frowned and a second later ghostly paper began to form between his hands. I didn\u2019t move, not wanting to startle him and lose the moment.</p><p>Who is his heir, Mr. Logan?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got three\u2014Mr. Harry Bulter, Mr. Jim O\u2019Reilly, and a Ms. Genevieve Sands.\u201d</p><p>A woman? One of Nadler\u2019s heirs was a woman? Are any of them related to Mr. Nadler?</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cI still can\u2019t see why\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Nadler was a very wealthy man, I said easily. And it\u2019s not unknown for heirs to kill their benefactor to get hold of their money.</p><p>\u201cThat, unfortunately, is true.\u201d</p><p>How was Nadler\u2019s estate divided among the three?</p><p>He glanced at the paperwork again. \u201cAll three have equal shares in everything.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. This wasn\u2019t making sense. Why would the shape-shifter go to all the trouble of killing Nadler off, then divide the estate he\u2019d murdered to get control of among three people?</p><p>When was the will drawn up?</p><p>His gaze flicked down to the bottom of the paper. \u201cThe same day he signed the deal with Trilby\u2019s and Appleby\u2019s heirs.\u201d</p><p>Which suggested an on-the-spot decision, but I very much doubted the man we were chasing ever did anything without forethought. Is there anything else you can tell me about Nadler? Any reason you believe someone might want him dead?</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Logan hadn\u2019t actually given us anything we couldn\u2019t have found out via a little subversive hacking, so maybe his death had been nothing more than the face-shifter leaving no threads behind, no matter how small.</p><p>Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr. Logan\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou could repay me by finding my limo, you know. It seems to have disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Just use your phone and call it, Mr. Logan. He wouldn\u2019t get anywhere with it, but hey, if it made him happy, then what the hell.</p><p>He made the right motions, and a somewhat fuzzy white limousine popped into existence. As Logan happily climbed in, I turned away. Time to return\u2014</p><p>The thought was cut short by a scream.</p><p>A scream that suggested there was a woman on the astral plane in very big trouble.</p><p>I froze, not sure I could\u2014or should\u2014do anything. Then the scream echoed again, and it was so filled with fear and pain that goose bumps crawled across my imaginary skin. I glanced around for my watcher. He was standing about six feet away, his expression unconcerned as he looked in the direction from which the scream had come.</p><p>Are you going to do anything about that?</p><p>He turned to me, obviously surprised. Why would I? I am here to report your actions\u2014nothing more, nothing less. But there is nothing to stop you from stepping in.</p><p>I guess not, I muttered, then closed my eyes and imagined myself standing near the screamer.</p><p>There was no obvious sense of movement, but I was suddenly somewhere I didn\u2019t know. The building outlines, though still shadowed, were sharper here, but rubbish lay everywhere, rats ran in full view, and there were vast puddles of putrid-looking water.</p><p>Not the sort of place I\u2019d ever want to be\u2014on this plane, or in life.</p><p>A woman stood ten feet away. She was reed thin, with limp blond hair and an almost gaunt face. Her clothes were little more than gray rags and seemed to be unraveling of their own accord, exposing jigsaw sections of her torso and legs. She wasn\u2019t trying to pull the threads back together, wasn\u2019t trying to do much of anything other than scream.</p><p>But maybe she couldn\u2019t do anything else. The man who stood in front of her had his palm pressed against her forehead and was burrowing ethereal fingers into her skull. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was also the source of that uneasy sense of trouble I\u2019d felt earlier\u2014only it wasn\u2019t coming from the stranger himself, but rather from the area immediately around him. It was as if the air were so repelled by his presence that it violently recoiled.</p><p>And the air wasn\u2019t the only thing repelled. The Du\u0161an crawled around my left arm, its dark eyes spitting fire, as if it wanted nothing more than to be free from the flesh that bound it to attack the man who stood before us.</p><p>A man I wasn\u2019t about to face unarmed.</p> <p>I imagined Amaya in my hands, and she appeared in a blaze of purple fire, her normally shadowed blade so bright on the astral field it was almost impossible to look at her.</p><p>Hey, you. I projected my mind voice so hard it shook the very foundations of the buildings around us. Leave that woman alone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t unhand her. Didn\u2019t react in any way that I could immediately see. Then, slowly, he turned his head in my direction.</p><p>He had no face.</p><p>Where there should have been eyes, a nose, and a mouth, there was nothing. It was as if his features had been wiped clean. It was totally and utterly blank.</p> <p>Impossible, I thought in disbelief. It had to be a trick of some kind. Had to be.</p><p>Go away. His voice was little more than a whisper, crawling around me like a dead thing.</p><p>I shivered and gripped Amaya harder. Maybe you didn\u2019t hear me the first time. I said, leave that woman alone.</p><p>I heard.</p><p>Then do as I say or the sword I bear will sever your ethereal head from its body.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if that was possible, especially after Adeline saying you couldn\u2019t actually die on the plane. But my sword was from neither the real world nor the astral one. She was born of a demon\u2019s death, and was far more than mere steel. She had a life of her own, a serious hunger for blood, and she could destroy demons and spirits as easily as she did flesh. Surely it wasn\u2019t such a stretch to think she could also kill someone on the astral plane?</p> <p>The stranger raised his featureless face, oddly looking like he was sniffing the air even though he had no nose. After a moment, he said, As you wish.</p><p>He released the woman and stepped back. She collapsed in a heap at his feet and remained there. Which was odd\u2014why hadn\u2019t she zapped back to her body? In fact, why hadn\u2019t she done that when she was first attacked?</p><p>Now leave, I said. Get off the fields.</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t reply. He just stood there, his unseeing face pointed in my direction, as if he were studying me. The unease crawling through me grew stronger, but I ignored it and imagined myself closer to the woman. The charm at my neck burned to life, its white light slashing through the shadows. Whoever\u2014whatever\u2014this man was, Ilianna\u2019s magic didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Did you hear me? I swung Amaya in warning. She reacted fiercely to the vibration pouring away from the stranger, spitting and hissing purple fire that danced across the shadowed buildings around us.</p><p>I heard. His voice remained soft and oddly free of emotion. But you should know that what I claim, I keep. You have saved no one here, huntress.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be so sure of that, stranger.</p><p>He cocked his head sideways. If he\u2019d had features, I think they would have appeared . . . amused. If you are so confident that you can save her, why don\u2019t we play a little game?</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of me playing any sort of game with a featureless freak on the astral plane. I swung Amaya again, her kill, kill, kill chant crystal clear in the back of my thoughts. For the moment, my desire for control was stronger than her need to attack, but I had to wonder if that would always be the case, given she\u2019d already tried to take me over once before.</p><p>I\u2019m not interested in playing games. I just want you gone.</p><p>Ah, but this game involves saving the woman\u2019s life. We both know you are interested in doing that, huntress, or you would not be here.</p><p>He was right, of course, but I saw no point in admitting the obvious.</p><p>He nodded in the woman\u2019s direction and continued. She has twenty minutes of life left on earth. If you can find her in that time, I will let her live.</p><p>Twenty minutes? That\u2019s hardly fair.</p><p>Life is never fair. He shrugged. That is the offer. Take it or leave it.</p><p>And if I don\u2019t take it?</p><p>Then she dies as I have planned, and you will be left to wonder if you could have done the impossible.</p><p>And with that, he was gone, taking with him the uneasy sense of trouble. As the charm\u2019s fierceness died to a more muted glow, I imagined Amaya sheathed, then knelt beside the woman.</p><p>Miss? Are you all right?</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond to the soft question, so I lightly touched her shoulder. She jumped, then shimmied away from me, her brown eyes wide and staring.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so much the fear in her expression that surprised me, but rather the mark burned into her forehead. It was raw and weeping, as if it had only just been done. It was also K-shaped, with a tail that looped, reminding me oddly of a serpent. Two wounds marred her wrists, slicing up the center of her arms. While these were neither raw nor weeping, they\u2019d split the skin open and looked painful. Two red marks also appeared to ring her calves, but from where I stood I couldn\u2019t really see if they were open wounds or not.</p><p>Adeline had said you couldn\u2019t be harmed on the astral plane, and yet this woman had been injured, and one of those wounds lay right where the stranger had been touching her. I doubted it was a coincidence.</p><p>Who are you? Her mind voice trembled with the fear so obvious in her pale features.</p><p>I\u2019m a friend, I thought softly. There was a man attacking you\u2014</p><p>Attacking? She frowned. What do you mean, \u201cattacking\u201d? We were having sex, for fuck\u2019s sake!</p><p>Sex? On the astral field? How the hell was that even possible? That\u2019s not what it looked like. Besides, you were screaming in fear.</p><p>She gathered the remnants of her clothing. Just because I don\u2019t like it vanilla doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t sex.</p><p>I frowned. She was making all the right sounds, but there was something not quite right about her eyes\u2014something beyond the fear. It was almost as if someone else was staring out of them.</p><p>I shivered. I need to know where you live, Miss\u2014</p><p>Like I\u2019m about to tell you that! And with that, she disappeared.</p><p>I swore softly, then closed my eyes and imagined myself back in my body. I whooshed back with surprising speed, my eyes springing open as I gasped in shock.</p><p>\u201cReturning swiftly can be quite painful when one isn\u2019t used to traveling on the astral plane,\u201d Adeline commented. \u201cLie there and rest. I\u2019ll bring you your tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I jerked upright, and immediately regretted it as my stomach jumped into my throat. I swallowed bile, then added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><p>Adeline stopped and frowned down at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I came across a woman being attacked by a man with no features.\u201d I pushed to my knees, but the room spun around me, and it was all I could do not to fall back down. \u201cHe gave me twenty minutes to try to save her on this plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning she wasn\u2019t actually being attacked on the astral plane. What you saw was merely a reflection of what is happening here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s branding her with a hot iron and pulling her brains out.\u201d</p><p>Adeline went pale. \u201cThen you\u2019re definitely dealing with a dark traveler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pushed to my feet, then flung out an arm to steady myself, only to catch Azriel rather than the wall. The fingers that wrapped around mine were gentle steel, and heat leapt from his flesh, warming the chill from my body and lending me some much-needed strength.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to find him if he has no features?\u201d Adeline asked. \u201cDid he give you any clue as to his identity? Did the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, so we\u2019re going to have to do this the hard way.\u201d I glanced at Azriel. \u201cYou need to take me to Stane\u2019s. Now. Adeline, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Azriel stepped close and wrapped his arms around my waist. His scent\u2014a scent that was both masculine and sharply electric\u2014filled every breath as his power burned through me, sweeping us from flesh to energy in an instant. A second later we were on the gray fields, but these were very different from the ones I traveled. The fields I knew were little more than shadowed echoes of the real world, a place where things not sighted suddenly gained substance. But in Azriel\u2019s arms, I saw the fields as a vast and beautiful place, filled with structures and life that were delicate and unworldly.</p><p>We re-formed outside of Stane\u2019s electronics shop in Clifton Hill, which happened to be on the very same street that Nadler\u2019s consortium had been attempting to purchase. In fact, only Stane\u2019s building and one other\u2014a bar\u2014remained in private hands.</p><p>I\u2019d known Stane a good part of my life, simply because he was Tao\u2019s cousin. Tao, like Ilianna, was a childhood friend and current housemate, and he and Stane had come from the same brown werewolf pack. Their fathers were brothers\u2014although Tao\u2019s had died when he was young, and Tao himself hadn\u2019t actually lived with the pack; he\u2019d lived with his mother, who was human. Stane was a whiz at all things computer related, and he\u2019d become a rather invaluable source of information and black market technology. If he couldn\u2019t get me the information I needed in record time, no one could.</p><p>\u201cYou should have just zapped us inside.\u201d I glanced at Azriel as I pushed open the somewhat ratty-looking door. A tiny bell rang cheerily above our heads. \u201cIt would have saved us a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStane does not react well to sudden appearances.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>I guess that was true\u2014and certainly the last thing we needed right now was Stane passing out in shock. Once we were inside, the camera above us buzzed into action and began tracking our movements. Not that we could go far\u2014the shimmer of light surrounding the small entrance was warning enough that a containment shield was in action.</p><p>\u201cStane, it\u2019s Risa.\u201d Impatience edged my voice as I stared up at the camera. \u201cI need some help rather urgently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about fucking time.\u201d His voice sounded tinny as it echoed from the small speaker near the camera. The shimmer flared briefly, then died. \u201cI\u2019ve been bored as hell lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, as I ran for the rear stairs. \u201cThe black market business isn\u2019t going so well at the moment?\u201d</p><p>He appeared at the landing and gave me a wide smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going very well. But I\u2019ve grown addicted to the challenges you give me. A little subversive hacking into government databases is good for the soul.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the urgency of the situation, I laughed and kissed his cheek. Stane rather looked like his building\u2014a slender, unholy mess. With his somewhat long and scruffy brown hair, his wrinkled blue shirt, and loose, ill-fitting shorts, he certainly didn\u2019t look like someone who was in any way dangerous\u2014until you actually gazed into his honey-colored eyes. Stane was smarter and harder than he looked.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it this time?\u201d he said, stepping to one side and waving us through.</p><p>\u201cWe have a life to save, and precisely eighteen minutes to do it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He scraped a hand across his bristly chin, then reclaimed his seat at the computer system that dominated his living area. He shoved a second chair in my direction. \u201cYou really are pushing it this time. How can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to work up an image of the woman I have to find, and then I need you to find her address.\u201d</p> <p>He swore again, then stretched out his fingers and cracked his knuckles. \u201cOkay, hit me with the details.\u201d</p><p>I gave him everything I could remember, and within a couple of minutes we had an image of the woman I\u2019d seen on the planes. He flicked it across to another screen, and the search began.</p><p>And all I could do was wait.</p><p>I pushed to my feet and began pacing. Stane watched me for a moment, then said, \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled deeply, then slowly released it. It didn\u2019t do much to ease the tension growing inside me. \u201cWell, I also have the names of Nadler\u2019s heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you manage that?\u201d</p> <p>I grimaced. \u201cI had a conversation with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me for a moment, then said, \u201cI won\u2019t even ask. What are their names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Bulter, Jim O\u2019Reilly, and Genevieve Sands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d Stane frowned. \u201cI can understand naming a number of men, because as a face-shifter, he could step into their lives anytime he wished. But a male face-shifter cannot take the form of a female, and vice versa.\u201d</p><p>A fact that I knew, since I was a face-shifter myself. \u201cHe obviously has a reason for doing it, but it\u2019s not like the man we\u2019ve been calling Nadler is working on any logical playing field, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Stane typed the names into his system, then swished them across to a separate light screen. \u201cYou want a coffee or Coke while we wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoke, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Stane glanced at Azriel, eyebrow raised in question. Azriel shook his head and I continued pacing, pausing only long enough to accept a can of Coke with a grunt of thanks. The time continued to tick away and it seemed to be taking forever to get our answer.</p> <p>Stane reclaimed his seat and watched the screens, his expression intent, as if willing a prompt response. But another five minutes passed before the screen closest to him beeped. He put his coffee down and scooted forward.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d I grumbled, stopping to peer over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, that was actually fast.\u201d He ran a finger across the screen to highlight some lines, then enlarged them. \u201cThe woman you\u2019re looking for is Dorothy Hendricks, from Craigieburn.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Craigieburn was a suburb on the northern edges of Melbourne, developed before the no-larger-than-a-postage-stamp housing plots of today, and popular with families thanks to its decent enough schools and leafy environs. It wasn\u2019t the sort of place I\u2019d expected last night\u2019s woman to live. Given where I\u2019d found her on the astral plane, I\u2019d been expecting a suburb far grimmer. Grimier.</p><p>\u201cWhat address? And what other information have you got on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen Crockett Avenue.\u201d He paused, and quickly scanned the screen. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be anything remarkable about her. Her parents are dead, and she has no siblings. According to her tax records, she works the night shift at the Nestl\u00e9 factory in Campbellfield.\u201d</p><p>That raised my eyebrows. She hadn\u2019t looked like a factory worker, but then, what was a factory worker supposed to look like?</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo record of marriage or kids, no fines of any kind, good credit history, owns her home.\u201d He paused. \u201cShe\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. That was something I hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cWhen did she turn?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cAbout thirty years ago, according to the records. No history of trouble after her rebirth, and she was released from the care of her maker about twelve years ago.\u201d</p><p>According to Uncle Quinn, fledglings could be in the care of their creators for anywhere between ten and fifty years\u2014it just depended on how quickly the newly fledged vampire learned to cope with all the sensations and needs that came with the state of being undead. That Dorothy had been released after eighteen years suggested she\u2019d been a reasonably fast learner. \u201cDoes it list her creator on the certificate?\u201d</p><p>It had been law for a few decades now that everyone who underwent the ceremony to become a vampire registered their details with the Births, Deaths, and Marriages Bureau. Once they had turned, their creator then had to register their \u201cbirth.\u201d There were still vamps who were turned illegally, of course, but the Directorate and the vampire council\u2014both the high council and the local council\u2014took a dim view of this and came down hard on the turnee and the turner.</p><p>Stane glanced briefly at the screen. \u201cBloke by the name of Martin Cresswell. You want me to do a search on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d I dumped the empty Coke can into the bin, then said, \u201cLet me know if you find anything else.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression concerned. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need it.\u201d Especially when there were only eight and a half minutes left. I glanced at Azriel. \u201cCan you take us to Dorothy\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just wrapped his arms around me again. In an instant, we\u2019d zipped through the gray fields, reappearing on the other side so quickly that my head spun and the bitter taste of bile rose up my throat again.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, his voice severe as he stepped back but didn\u2019t quite release me, \u201cneed to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve got the fucking time right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not mean right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I scanned the home in front of us. It was nothing remarkable\u2014just an ordinary brick house in a street filled with similar buildings. I pushed open a picket gate that had seen better days and ran for the front steps. There was a doorbell to the left of the door, so I leaned on it heavily, then rapped impatiently on the door itself. Inside, the chime and knocks echoed, but there was no response. If there was anyone inside, he or she was either deaf or dead.</p><p>\u201cThere is neither life, death, nor undead inside. The house is empty.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch. Eight minutes left. Fuck, fuck, fuck! I closed my eyes and tried to remain calm. Tried to think. \u201cEven if she\u2019s not there, there may be some clue\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get to finish the sentence. He just caught me in his arms again and whisked us inside. I drew in a deep breath the second we re-formed, ignoring another rush of dizziness as I sorted through the various scents in the air. Lavender and furniture polish vied for prominence with the aroma of coffee. Underneath that lay the scent of femininity, though it was far more vague than it should have been if she spent the majority of her time here. Certainly in the apartment I shared with Ilianna and Tao, the dominating scents were horse and wolf, with the tang of females coming in a close third. The masculine, incandescent scent that was Tao was a distant fourth.</p><p>But there was no male scent here. Nothing to indicate she ever had any visitors, human or otherwise.</p><p>I growled in frustration and waved a hand at the first couple of rooms. \u201cI\u2019ll search these; you search the ones at the back of the house.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and disappeared. I moved into the nearest room\u2014a living room that was comfortably furnished and neat as a pin. I did a quick walk around, shifting various bits and pieces, but I couldn\u2019t find anything that jumped up and screamed clue.</p><p>Conscious that we were running out of time, I dashed into the room opposite. It was a bedroom\u2014the main one, if the shoes lined up neatly along the end of the bed were any indication. I scanned the nearest bedside table, seeing nothing but change, then opened the drawers. Knickers and socks. I cursed, ran around the other side, and repeated the process. Nothing. Fuck!</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d Azriel called. \u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>I spun and ran down the hall. Azriel stood near the phone at the end of the kitchen counter, and as I entered, he pushed a notepad toward me. On it was a series of K-shaped doodles, some with snakelike tails, some without. And in one corner, an address\u2014Amcor, main entrance, Alphington\u2014and a time: midnight last night.</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cWe have four minutes left.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just caught me in his arms again and swept us across the fields. This time, when we re-formed, I staggered and would have fallen if not for the fierceness of his grip on me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything\u2014he knew me well enough by now to know the futility of it\u2014but his disapproval swept around me as sharply as any rebuke.</p><p>We\u2019d reappeared in the middle of an old parking lot. I swung around, searching the old buildings, seeing the grime and the many shadows that haunted the place, even in the midmorning sunlight. The air was ripe with disuse, rubbish, and rats, and the wind whistled through the many broken windows. It was very similar to what I\u2019d seen on the fields. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is magic in this place,\u201d Azriel said softly.</p><p>I gave him a sharp glance. \u201cGood magic or bad magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt sits in between.\u201d</p> <p>How the hell could magic sit in between? \u201cWhat about life? Can you sense the woman?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThere is someone in the end of that L-shaped\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for him to finish. I just ran, as fast as I could. I leapt the remnants of the gates and bolted for the shadowed building, nostrils flaring as I dragged in the scents. Death ran underneath all those I\u2019d noted earlier.</p><p>No, no, no!</p><p>I crashed shoulder first into the door, sending it and myself falling into the building. I brushed my fingertips against the concrete to steady myself, then ran on, splashing through puddles and leaping over rubbish as I followed the nebulous scent of death through the various rooms\u2014all the while hoping it wasn\u2019t the woman\u2019s death I could smell, but something else.</p> <p>It was a small hope and, as it turned out, a vain one.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Dorothy Hendricks lay on a table in the middle of the little room. She was naked, her body so pale and thin that I could count every rib. Though she wore no jewelry, something stuck out from her chest, slightly to the left of her breastbone. It took me a moment to realize it was a knitting-needle-sized piece of wood. She\u2019d been staked.</p><p>And yet she looked at peace\u2014her expression was serene, with a smile forever frozen on her lips.</p><p>Either she\u2019d welcomed this death or she hadn\u2019t realized exactly what was happening to her. Given what she\u2019d claimed on the astral plane, I had to guess the latter to be true, especially since there was little in the air to suggest anything sexual had been going on.</p><p>My gaze went to the four-inch cuts on her wrists. She\u2019d obviously been bled out, but there was no evidence of it on the floor underneath her. Which meant someone had collected her blood\u2014or consumed it. Shivers raced up and down my spine. I really didn\u2019t want to know what someone would do with that much blood, and I really, really didn\u2019t want to meet someone who could consume that much.</p> <p>\u201cWe had time left,\u201d I said, my voice flat despite the anger that surged through me. \u201cBut he never intended for us to save her. He was just playing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but this death was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>As Azriel spoke, the gossamer shape of Dorothy\u2019s soul rose from her flesh. She looked happy and content, offering her hand without qualm to the white-haired, white-winged reaper who suddenly appeared beside her body. It really didn\u2019t surprise me that she\u2019d chosen the more traditional version of the reaper. Despite her words on the astral plane, there\u2019d been nothing out of the ordinary to be seen in her house. Certainly nothing that suggested she liked her life to be anything other than vanilla.</p><p>So why had she become a vampire?</p><p>I watched them walk onto the gray fields and disappear, then glanced at Azriel. \u201cWhy would a woman like Dorothy be the target of someone so dangerous? She may have been a vampire, but if the information Stane uncovered is to be believed, she was harmless in every other way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it was nothing more than a weak astral spirit unwittingly attracting a darker soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d The image of the faceless man ran through my mind, and I shivered again. He\u2019d called me a huntress, but he\u2019d been the one hunting, not me. \u201cBut I have a suspicion that his choice of victim was deliberate, not one governed by chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet he offered you the opportunity to save her. Even if that was never to be, it seems an odd decision for one who takes no chances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d My gaze swept Dorothy\u2019s body and came to rest on her calves. Cuts ringed them both, the wounds gaping. I frowned. \u201cWhy would he cut her tendons like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a belief in some cultures that cutting the tendons in the legs prevents the soul from rising.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d staked her because she was a vampire. \u201cThen why bleed her out? It seems a little overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he merely wished to be triple sure of his kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d I scanned the concrete again. Azriel had said earlier that he\u2019d sensed magic, but there was little indication of it. No protective circle, no candles, nothing that in any way suggested there was ever a practitioner here.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wish to do now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat I wish to do is go home, eat the biggest steak I can find, have a long soak in the bath, then catch a week\u2019s worth of sleep.\u201d I grimaced and dug my vid-phone out of my pocket. \u201cWhat I have to do, however, is ring Uncle Rhoan.\u201d</p><p>His expression, when he answered, was resigned. \u201cSo tell me where the body is.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile touched my lips, although\u2014sadly\u2014his presumption was all too correct. Most of my calls to him of late had been about the dead or the about to be dead. Still, I couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cHey, I might just be ringing to say hello to my favorite uncle.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly, amusement crinkling the corners of his gray eyes. \u201cWe both know if you just wanted a chat, you\u2019d ring my sister. Who, by the way, is a little peeved that you missed the weekly get-together.\u201d</p><p>Damn, so I had. Mom and Riley had met for coffee and cake every week for as long as I could remember, and it was a tradition Riley and I were determined to continue.</p><p>While I did have a good excuse\u2014I\u2019d still been in the process of recovering from the fights with both my sword and the Rakshasa, the spirit who\u2019d answered the call of ghosts desperate for revenge at one of the blood whore clubs run by the high vampire council\u2014I couldn\u2019t exactly tell Riley that because she didn\u2019t know about my connection with the vampire council. If she ever did find out about it, she\u2019d hit the roof, not to mention shove me somewhere safe while she confronted Hunter and her cronies. And as strong as Riley, Quinn, and Rhoan were, I had a suspicion it would take more than the three of them to outmaneuver Hunter.</p><p>\u201cYou need to ring her,\u201d Rhoan continued. \u201cShe\u2019s worried. We\u2019re both worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to not tell her so much about what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>He snorted again. \u201cYeah, like that\u2019s going to work. You know she can smell trouble a mile away.\u201d He paused. \u201cOkay, I have your location and will be there in twenty. Don\u2019t disturb any evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the phone back into my pocket, my gaze on Dorothy\u2019s body. Why on earth would anyone go to so much trouble to destroy someone who was, it seemed, totally harmless? It made no sense, and part of me\u2014a small, insane part\u2014wanted to unravel the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cLet your uncle find whoever is responsible for this,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cIt is not something we should get involved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but look again at the woman\u2019s face, though, and there was an unpleasant suspicion in my heart that this was far from over. \u201cWe\u2019ve enough on our plate as it is.\u201d</p><p>Including, I thought, with a glance at my watch, a date with a locker at Southern Cross Station in just over an hour.</p><p>I rubbed my arms, then scanned the immediate area. Rhoan might have warned me not to disturb any evidence, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t look. Besides, I needed to do something while I waited for him.</p><p>Water and trash lay everywhere, and the air was ripe with rotting rubbish and mold. The vaguest aroma of blood laced the thicker, more unpleasant scents in the room, but there was little else. If the stranger\u2014or anyone else, for that matter\u2014had been here, he had no distinct smell. Which went with his lack of a face, I guess.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was here,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cThe air still resonates with energy.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. His blue eyes held echoes of the anger that burned within me. \u201cCan you track it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey used magic to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet there\u2019s no trace of magic on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic can take many forms. The charm around your neck, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this charm is minor magic compared to something that could transport a person.\u201d My gaze went back to Dorothy and I studied the wounds on her wrists again. \u201cHow can there be no evidence of bleeding when she\u2019s been bled out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>I squatted next to the table. The concrete was thick with layers of grime and god knows what else, but the area underneath her hanging wrist bore a faint ring-shaped mark. The blood hadn\u2019t been consumed\u2014it had been collected.</p><p>Why would anyone want to do that? I glanced up at Azriel, but he merely shrugged. \u201cI am not an expert on humans and all their eccentricities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the person behind this was human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have sensed either a spirit or a demon.\u201d</p><p>That the no-face stranger might be human somehow made him seem all the more creepy. I shivered, then rose and walked around the rest of the table. Other than a matching ring in the grime on the opposite side of the floor, there was little to see.</p><p>I retreated to a wall and sat down on the floor. God, if I didn\u2019t get some food and rest soon, I was going to end up back in bed and sick as hell.</p><p>Azriel strolled around to my side of the table. \u201cShuffle forward.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, but did as ordered. He sat down behind me, then placed his fingers against my temples and began to gently massage them. Heat radiated from the epicenter of his touch, and the pain began to recede.</p><p>\u201cAzriel,\u201d I said, somewhat reluctantly, \u201cI thought we agreed you shouldn\u2019t be healing me. You\u2019re the better fighter, so it\u2019s more important that you keep your strength rather than sharing it with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t think and move, then me being the better fighter is irrelevant.\u201d He paused, but his fingers continued to work their magic. \u201cBesides, I can no longer fully heal you. I merely revive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s splitting hairs and you know it.\u201d Not that I wanted him to stop. It felt far too good\u2014both his touch and the sense of reassurance it provided. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReviving does not require the same output of energy.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t believing that for an instant, but I let it slide, and asked instead, \u201cI remember Tao saying something about your inability to heal\u2014what\u2019s gone wrong? You had no problems healing me previously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not exactly sure why this has happened.\u201d</p> <p>Liar. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got anything to do with Amaya\u2019s presence, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your sword will never harm you.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cThen what do you call her attempt to gain control over my body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attempt to save your life. As she saw it, she was the stronger spirit, and therefore the logical choice to control your flesh.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019d agreed to that control\u2014temporarily. I wouldn\u2019t have survived the onslaught of the Rakshasa otherwise. But once I was safe, Amaya had refused to leave my flesh, and it took every ounce of strength I\u2019d had left to get her back into the sword. \u201cDoes that mean every time I\u2019m feeling low she\u2019s going to make a takeover bid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if she believes your life would be in danger if she did not. And remember, you did invite the invasion.\u201d</p><p>Something I will not be doing again. Not unless I\u2019m at death\u2019s door.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I sensed Rhoan\u2019s approach. Azriel rose and held out a hand. I twined my fingers through the warmth of his, and he pulled me up. We ended up standing so close that my breasts touched his chest and his breath teased my mouth with possibilities. God, it would take only the slightest movement on either of our parts for our lips to meet, but as my eyes searched his, I knew he wouldn\u2019t do it. Not this time, not yet. He was still fighting to delay the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cNothing is inevitable.\u201d There was a huskiness in his voice that suggested his control was closer to the knife edge than I\u2019d thought. \u201cAnd you have no idea of the risk we run\u2014\u201d</p><p>Behind us someone cleared his throat, and I jumped as if stung. Rhoan walked toward us, amusement crinkling the corners of his gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cRiley will be pleased,\u201d he said.</p> <p>No, she won\u2019t, I thought grumpily. Not when I was having zero luck in getting Azriel back into bed\u2014a problem she\u2019d never had when it came to men, human or otherwise. I waved a hand at Dorothy\u2019s body. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched her, and only went close enough to the table to check whether her blood had been collected or not.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slipped to the woman on the table, and in the blink of an eye, he became the guardian rather than the uncle. It was a chilling change.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said warily, knowing there had to be something more behind his reaction than merely this particular death.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d</p><p>I briefly closed my eyes. Of course he had. Why I\u2019d thought this was a one-off murder I had no idea. \u201cHow many have there been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree in three days.\u201d His expression was as intense and cold as his voice. \u201cHe normally contacts the Directorate an hour after the death.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo taunt us.\u201d His gaze centered on me. \u201cHow did you get involved?\u201d</p> <p>I told him about the gray fields and what I\u2019d witnessed there.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t give us much to go on.\u201d He paused, then added more severely, \u201cYou\u2019re not intending to chase this one down yourself, are you?\u201d</p><p>It was a warning more than a question, and I gave him a lopsided smile. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not a guardian and have no desire to be.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s the first sensible thing I\u2019ve heard you say in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do sensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rhoan\u2019s tone was disbelieving. \u201cThis is the first evidence of it that I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve known you a very long time.\u201d</p><p>I punched him lightly\u2014though it was like hitting a brick wall\u2014and he grinned. \u201cGo home and get some rest, Ris. You look beat.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a statement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but later will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I dropped a kiss on his cheek, then left. Once we were outside, I raised my face to the sky. Though it was barely ten, the promise of heat was in the air, and sunshine bathed my skin. But it wasn\u2019t warm enough to burn away the uneasy fear that had first stirred on the astral plane. The no-face killer wasn\u2019t my problem, but I still couldn\u2019t escape the notion that he and I would meet again. I had to hope that notion was wrong, because I needed to get back to the business of chasing down portal keys and deadly sorcerers.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to return home now?\u201d Azriel asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d Wished he would just take me in his arms and hold me. Just hold me.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t react in any way\u2014even though he could follow my thoughts and knew my desires as clearly as if I\u2019d spoken them\u2014and I sighed softly. \u201cBut I need to collect my car from Adeline\u2019s, and then we have that meeting at the rail station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should eat\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off with an abrupt wave of the hand. \u201cI\u2019ll grab a burger and chips along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly what you need right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s food,\u201d I cut in wearily. \u201cAnd it\u2019s better than nothing. You\u2019re not my mom, so don\u2019t nag me, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to.\u201d His blue eyes flashed with the annoyance he wasn\u2019t quite containing. \u201cBecause you seem absurdly determined to run yourself into the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t have that when there\u2019s keys to be found, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I have said before,\u201d he said coldly, \u201cthat is not a fair comment.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He once again accepted the apology with an almost regal incline of his head, then said, his tone still frosty, \u201cYou wish to go back to Adeline\u2019s now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stepped close, and once more whisked us through the gray fields. Adeline jumped when we reappeared in her living room.</p><p>\u201cGracious,\u201d she said, placing one hand on her heart. \u201cYou could at least give some warning before you pop into existence like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could sense reapers.\u201d I stepped free from the warmth of Azriel\u2019s arms, but distance did little to ease the fires his presence ignited. I picked up the cup of tea Adeline had poured earlier and gulped it down. I might not be fond of the stuff, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf they are on this plane, yes, but not before then.\u201d She eyed me for a moment, then said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t succeed in saving her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but only because he didn\u2019t keep his end of the bargain. He killed her too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a dark energy, so that can be expected.\u201d</p><p>Stupid of me to expect otherwise, I suppose. \u201cThis isn\u2019t his first kill, though. The Directorate is on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you could provide a description\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d I interrupted. Because he didn\u2019t have a face on the fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is unusual.\u201d She frowned. \u201cHow indistinct were his features?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally\u2014he had no facial features whatsoever. It was as if someone had completely erased them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not possible.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWell, obviously, it is, but it is extremely rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cI mean, you can change your outward appearance, can\u2019t you? Things like clothes, shoes, even hair color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it is almost impossible to change your actual features. Normally your spirit won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this guy\u2019s spirit did.\u201d I paused, remembering the sensations that had rolled over me. \u201cI actually felt him out there long before the woman screamed. It was as if the astral plane was rejecting his presence. It set up this really weird vibration.\u201d</p><p>Adeline chewed her lip for a moment, then said, \u201cAnd the woman? What was she actually doing?\u201d</p><p>I described what I\u2019d seen, then added, \u201cThe woman claimed they were having sex, but that sure as hell wasn\u2019t what it looked like.\u201d I paused. \u201cIs it even possible to have sex on the astral plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but you have to be very careful about who and what you form such a connection with. Once you open that door, it may never close.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. \u201cCould this guy be some form of incubi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, it\u2019s possible, but both incubi and succubi tend to take physical advantage of us on this plane. It is rare for them to act on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRare means it\u2019s still possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but from what you described, he was not sexually interacting with the woman, despite what the woman believed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the astral plane? Not that I\u2019m aware of. I would think you\u2019d have to find him in the real world.\u201d</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Nor was it my job. Leave it to Rhoan, I reminded myself, and set the cup back down. \u201cThanks again for your help, Adeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She escorted me to the door, then added, \u201cI\u2019m here if you need anything else.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a smile and headed down the street to my SUV. The Toyota wasn\u2019t my preferred mode of transport\u2014that honor went to the silver Ducati I\u2019d bought when RYT\u2019s, the caf\u00e9 I co-owned and ran with Ilianna and Tao, had made its first profit. Unfortunately, the Ducati and I had a serious parting of ways thanks to a pack of demons, and she was still in the shop getting repaired. She was an old bike, and her parts were hard to get, so I was going to be without her for a while. Which was why I was seriously considering buying another one. I preferred the feel and freedom of a bike as opposed to the sedate safety of a vehicle like the SUV. Even Tao\u2019s Ferrari couldn\u2019t give the high of the bike\u2014not on Melbourne streets, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A breeze stirred the air, cooling the early-morning heat but doing little to ease the furnace-like intensity of the man who walked close behind me. Part of me wished I could ignore him, that we could just go back to the time when the attraction was muted and he was more antagonistic. More distant. But there was no way on earth to put that particular genie back in the bottle.</p><p>After a moment, I asked, \u201cWhat did you mean before, when you said I had no idea of the risk we were running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that. This attraction breaks all the rules\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour rules, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He paused. \u201cI thought we had agreed that we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped back. \u201cYou decided we should attempt to ignore this. I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the danger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo whom?\u201d I swung around and stabbed a finger into his chest. It felt like I was hitting steel. \u201cNot to me, buddy boy, and don\u2019t pretend otherwise. You\u2019re protecting your ass here, not mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d His expression was as enigmatic as ever, and yet there was an undercurrent in the air that was both frustration and anger. At himself, at me, at the situation. \u201cBut you have no idea of the dangers I face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you won\u2019t fucking explain them to me.\u201d I glared at him for a moment, then shook my head and walked on. \u201cYou know what? Forget it. It\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t important, you would not be this angry.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and just kept moving. He was silent until we got to the SUV, then appeared in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cAs I said before,\u201d he commented, as I pulled out into the traffic, \u201cthe longer I remain in flesh form, the more I take on certain human characteristics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s not like a little human emotion is going to destroy you or anything, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, his voice holding an edge that suggested he was barely holding on to his patience, \u201cis where you are very wrong.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him sharply. \u201cHow the fuck is that even possible? I mean, emotion isn\u2019t a physical force. Being emotional can\u2019t destroy you.\u201d I paused, then remembered Jak, the man I\u2019d thought I would marry one day, and all the heartbreak he\u2019d caused me. \u201cAlthough sometimes it does feel like it can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile gaining the emotions that come with flesh form is, of itself, not dangerous to us, the fact that you and I are connected at a chi level makes it so.\u201d</p><p>I slowed down as the lights ahead went to red, then said, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cA chi connection is a connection of life forces\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware what a chi connection is,\u201d I snapped. \u201cJust tell me why you believe it\u2019s so damn dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He released a breath that was more a hiss. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous because it can lead to assimilation.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cAssimilation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt happens when a reaper becomes so attuned to a particular human that their life forces merge, and they become as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he spat back. His expression was as grim as I\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cIf that happens, my reaper powers will become muted, and I will never again be able to function as a soul bearer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can still be a Mijai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But this is not a position I wish to retain for eternity.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cAnd I suspect you would not wish the connection between us to strengthen any further, or become permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d I liked Azriel\u2014a lot\u2014but he wasn\u2019t Mr. Long Term. And neither was my Aedh lover, Lucian. I wanted someone who was flesh and blood real, someone who could give me a family and a life on this plane.</p><p>The lights changed again, so I pressed the accelerator and continued. \u201cDoes that mean the attraction between us is a sign that we\u2019re on the cusp of assimilation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d He looked away for a moment, studying the road ahead. \u201cBut it is never wise to play with fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t wise when we made love,\u201d I commented. \u201cIt didn\u2019t stop either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The ghost of a smile crossed his lips. \u201cAnd as much as I cannot regret that moment, to continue down that path is to risk the link strengthening into assimilation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to be the strong one, because I\u2019m damn sure I won\u2019t be.\u201d I tried to envision being around him and not being able to touch him. It just wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>\u201cIf I was capable of such strength,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthere would not have been a first time.\u201d</p><p>My gaze briefly met his. Deep in his differently colored blue eyes desire burned. He might be keeping it in check better than I was, but he definitely wasn\u2019t as immune to my nearness as his actions sometimes led me to believe.</p><p>I swung onto Spencer Street and headed toward Southern Cross Station. \u201cYou do realize this decision of yours means that you can\u2019t object to me being with Lucian. I may not be driven by the moon\u2019s heat as most werewolves are, but I do have an above-average sex drive.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to see his expression to know that his anger had just ratcheted up several notches. The force of it singed my skin and senses. \u201cYou know I do not trust the Aedh.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I did. Just like I knew that his distrust\u2014hell, I\u2019d even call it hatred\u2014left him unable to even say Lucian\u2019s name. It would have been amusing if it wasn\u2019t so damn frustrating.</p><p>\u201cAnd we both know,\u201d I snapped back, \u201cthat your distrust stems more from the fact that I\u2019m with him than from anything he\u2019s actually done.\u201d</p><p>For once, he didn\u2019t dispute it. \u201cI am not jealous, if that is what you are implying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you have a problem with me being with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is using you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re using each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but his reasons are not what he states. He lies, Risa. I can taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s lying, then he\u2019s doing it so well my internal radar isn\u2019t picking it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been earthbound for many, many centuries. Have no doubt that he is well practiced in more than the art of sex.\u201d</p><p>That, at least, was something we both agreed on. But it still didn\u2019t mean Lucian was lying to me\u2014or rather, I hoped it didn\u2019t. I swung into the parking lot under the Flinders Street bridge and squeezed into a spot between one of the bridge stanchions and a large four-wheel drive.</p><p>I turned off the engine, then faced him. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. Either you and I run the risk of assimilation, or you accept the fact that I will be with others. No more shitty aloofness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first is not an option, and the second will not be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything else, I climbed out of the car and headed for the Southern Cross railway station. The building\u2019s undulating roofline gleamed crisply in the bright sunshine and, as ever, reminded me of snow mounds\u2014albeit snow mounds covered in pigeons and pigeon poop. A constant rush of people flowed in and out of the station, and the vast area under the unusual roof was filled with the sounds of chatter, footsteps, whistles, and trains.</p><p>I made my way through the interior to the main locker area, my footsteps slowing as I neared the doorway. I flared my nostrils, dragging in the air, and I couldn\u2019t smell anything out of the ordinary. But I hadn\u2019t the last time I was here, either, and that time two Razan\u2014the human slaves of the Aedh\u2014had been waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>Azriel shook his head. \u201cThere is no human or non-human life within.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a trap waiting inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cThere is no sense of magic, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I considered the doorway for a few seconds longer, then took a deep breath to fortify my nerves and headed in. The locker room was large and the air cool. There were two rows of cream-colored lockers in the center of the room, while more lockers lined the walls. The one I wanted sat about midway along the central locker row. I dug the little key out of my pocket and walked toward them. Trepidation crawled across my skin. Nothing, no one, was here, and yet every sense I had tingled.</p><p>My fingers shook as I opened the door. It was a stupid and illogical response given everything I\u2019d survived over the last couple of weeks, but I just couldn\u2019t help it. I feared my father. Feared him more than the Raziq themselves, even though he\u2019d done little more than threaten me and my friends if I didn\u2019t comply with his wishes.</p><p>And his threats were nothing compared to what the Raziq had actually done\u2014they\u2019d torn me apart, placed a tracker in the fabric of my heart, and then rebuilt me.</p><p>Perhaps that was the problem. I knew what the Raziq were capable of, and I knew what they wanted. Hell, I knew what Azriel, the Mijai, and even the vampire council wanted from me. But my father\u2019s motives were little more than murk. All I could be sure of was that what he said he wanted and what he actually planned were two entirely different things.</p><p>It was the not knowing that scared the shit out of me. That, and the intuition that he could be far more dangerous than the Raziq as a whole ever could be.</p><p>The locker door swung open, revealing a totally empty interior. No letter, nothing to indicate what he wanted or what I was supposed to do next. It didn\u2019t make sense. Why send me here if he didn\u2019t intend to leave instructions?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of the sentence died in my throat, because it suddenly felt like someone had a hand around my heart and was threatening to squeeze the life out of me.</p><p>And hot on the heels of that came the awareness of an approaching presence. Only it wasn\u2019t body heat I sensed, wasn\u2019t humanity, but rather the heat of a being that was all energy, all power. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An Aedh.</p><p>My father, to be precise.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>As the awareness of my father\u2019s presence grew, so did the ache in my heart, until all I felt was pain, inside and out.</p><p>I doubled over, unable to do anything more than gasp. But it wasn\u2019t a heart attack. It was something far more deadly\u2014the transmitter the Raziq had placed in my heart, reacting to my father\u2019s presence.</p><p>Calling the Raziq, telling them he was coming.</p><p>And I could barely even breathe, let alone give him any sort of warning.</p><p>An instant later, I was flung up against the lockers, my feet off the ground and a band of iron against my neck.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d The voice was a deeper, angrier version of mine, and it seemed to shake the foundations of the room around us. \u201cWhat have you agreed to?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to answer, but no words came out because no air was getting in. Panic surged, and for a moment I wondered if he intended to kill me in sheer and utter rage.</p><p>Blue-edged steel appeared in my line of vision, the sword\u2019s sharp point aimed at the heart of the fierce energy holding me captive.</p><p>\u201cTell us where we can find the keys,\u201d Azriel said flatly. \u201cOr die now.\u201d</p><p>Deep inside me anger flared. For fuck\u2019s sake, Azriel, I\u2019m choking and in serious pain here, in case you didn\u2019t notice!</p><p>He either didn\u2019t hear me or didn\u2019t care. Neither, apparently, did my father. The iron band of energy continued to squeeze my neck, and it felt like my lungs were about to burst. Tiny spots began to dance in front of my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIf you kill me, reaper, you will fail in your quest to capture the keys.\u201d</p><p>There was no hurry in my father\u2019s voice, no urgency. As the shadows of unconsciousness began to crowd close, I wondered where the hell the Raziq were. At least their arrival would break this uncaring tableau.</p><p>\u201cAs will everyone else who seeks them,\u201d Azriel replied. \u201cThat is an outcome I could live with.\u201d</p><p>It was an outcome I could live with, too. If I got to live, that was.</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know such an outcome would be unacceptable to those who sent you here, reaper.\u201d Amusement ran through my father\u2019s deep tones. \u201cIt would appear we have reached an impasse.\u201d</p><p>Azriel!</p><p>The mental shout was filled with desperation, and his gaze flickered briefly toward me. Frustration and anger burned in his eyes. \u201cRelease her. Or I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>And hurry. The spots were getting larger, my heart felt like it was about to shatter, and the need for air was so fierce my lungs were on fire.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kill me, reaper.\u201d The trace of amusement was gone from his voice. \u201cAs I\u2019ve already stated, you need the information I carry too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we both need her alive. Release her\u2014now!\u201d Valdis\u2019s flames skittered across the fierce energy that was my father\u2019s presence, enveloping him in a fiery cage.</p><p>Whether it was the threat of the flames or simply the realization that he did need me alive, the steely band of energy bruising my neck suddenly disappeared and I collapsed to the ground. There I remained, on hands and knees, dragging in shuddering gasps of air and grateful that I could still do so.</p><p>\u201cYou bear the device of the Raziq in your body,\u201d my father said. Though the force of his anger no longer held me captive, it vibrated through the undernotes of his voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I had no fucking choice, I thought, but the words remained locked in my throat as I continued to suck air into my still burning lungs.</p><p>God, where the hell were the Raziq? My father might have released his death grip on me, but the Raziq\u2019s transmitter had not. The pain of the device was all-encompassing, and spots still danced madly across my vision.</p><p>\u201cIt was not her choice,\u201d Azriel answered. \u201cAnd if you know a means of removing it without killing her, tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no removal except death.\u201d My father paused, and the energy of him pulsated. \u201cThe Raziq come. I will find another way to contact you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave a damn note\u2014\u201d I croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to read your mind and understand what the players around you do.\u201d</p><p>And despite the net of fire enveloping his form, the force that was my father disappeared. I couldn\u2019t say I was entirely sorry to see him go. I might not have gotten any answers, but at least the fire in my heart began to ebb away. It left me trembling and weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it is not over yet.\u201d Azriel tucked an arm under my arm and hauled me upright. \u201cThe Raziq come, as he said.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left his mouth when another storm swamped me. Panic surged, but I drew Amaya and tried to ignore it. Of course, past experience told me she wouldn\u2019t be enough against the force of them, but at least this time I had Azriel by my side. Surely he wouldn\u2019t fall victim to the mind tricks the Raziq had used last time I was with them.</p><p>Fire dripped from the points of the two swords. It hissed and spat as it hit the concrete, and spread out in a sweeping arc, forming an incandescent barrier around us. It was almost as if the swords had drawn a line and were daring the Raziq to cross it.</p><p>The storm grew stronger, until I was being physically buffeted by it. I narrowed my gaze against the dust and rubbish flying through the air, my breath caught somewhere in my throat and my stomach churning. Every time I\u2019d faced the Raziq, something had gone wrong.</p><p>Every single damn time.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Azriel said. He took a step forward, half protecting me with his body.</p><p>No protect! Amaya\u2019s protest echoed through my brain. Want to kill.</p><p>There is time enough for that, I snapped, my gaze on the flicker that was growing beyond the circle of fire. Once upon a time I would not have seen it, but my sight seemed to have altered fractionally since Amaya had become one with me.</p><p>Want now, she grumbled, but her voice had at least lowered a couple of octaves.</p><p>Soon. I waved her lightly back and forth. Her fire spat through the air, reaching past the wall of fire, landing near the edge of the Raziq\u2019s shimmery presence. But there was more than one here. There had to be. The wash of energy was too fierce.</p><p>And Azriel\u2019s readiness to attack was so strong that the force of it vibrated through every part of me, vying for prominence with the energy crawling across my skin.</p><p>\u201cI told you my father would sense your approach,\u201d I croaked, before either the Raziq could say anything or Azriel could react. \u201cHe\u2019s far more cunning than you give him credit for.\u201d</p><p>Red flames flickered down Valdis\u2019s sides. I wondered if it was an indicator of the sword\u2019s annoyance or her master\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt is also possible that you warned him.\u201d</p><p>The voice was cool, without inflection or emotion, but it nevertheless sent a chill down my spine. This was one of the Raziq who\u2019d torn me apart to place the tracker in my heart.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t warn him, trust me on that. I want as little to do with him as I do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, at least, is true.\u201d The energy in the air sharpened. \u201cDo not release your weapon, Mijai. There are too many of us here, and your numbers are few enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur numbers are irrelevant.\u201d Though his voice was as calm and cool as the Raziq\u2019s, his stance had shifted imperceptibly. He was readying for action. \u201cWhat matters is my ability to counter your presence, and that is not in question.\u201d</p><p>The fierceness in the air suddenly sharpened, and a thick sense of impending doom swamped me. If Azriel attacked, he\u2019d die. I was as sure of that as I was of the moon rising tonight. There was no way known that I was about to let that happen.</p><p>I stepped forward and wrapped my fingers around his arm. It felt like I was gripping stone.</p><p>The force of Valdis\u2019s flames ramped up, but Azriel didn\u2019t react. Which didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t feeling anything. The force of it just about blew my brain circuits.</p><p>\u201cYour presence here does nothing to encourage my father to come back,\u201d I said, trying to keep calm against the twin storms buffeting me. \u201cIf you want him, you had better leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe now knows about the tracker. The point of it is useless.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went suddenly dry. If the tracker was useless, did that mean I was as well? I swallowed heavily, and somehow said, \u201cAnd here I was thinking the Aedh were clever enough to work out a way around that.\u201d</p><p>He obviously didn\u2019t catch the sarcasm in my voice. \u201cThat is without question. But your father is also Aedh\u2014he will find a means to mute the transmitter.\u201d</p><p>No doubt. \u201cThen you\u2019ll just have to work faster than him, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr develop a different way of drawing him to you.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe will be in contact, Risa Jones.\u201d</p><p>The threat hung in the air as the energy of their presence began to dissipate. Azriel wrenched his arm from my grip, then drew Valdis back and released her in one violent movement. The sword sang through the air, the sound fierce, joyous. She hit the fading remnants of the shimmer and there was a short, sharp explosion, accompanied by a shrill scream. Then there was no energy, no Raziq.</p><p>Only fury.</p><p>Valdis looped around and returned to her master. Azriel caught her one-handed, then swung to face me. His expression was as angry as I\u2019d ever seen it.</p><p>\u201cDo not ever do that again.\u201d Though his voice was flat, every inch of him seemed to vibrate. Valdis\u2019s steel wasn\u2019t even visible, so dark were her flames.</p><p>And Amaya responded, her hissing fierce enough inside my head to make my eyes water. She was ready to protect, whether it be against foe or friend.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here to protect you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have died.\u201d I sheathed Amaya\u2014although it didn\u2019t shut her up\u2014and rubbed my arms. Not that it did much against the force still assaulting me or the chill that the mere thought of losing him sent through me.</p><p>\u201cThere is always the Aedh,\u201d he practically spat. \u201cYou trust him so much, after all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anger surged. Anger and hurt. \u201cDamn you, Azriel, that was totally uncalled-for!\u201d</p><p>I shouldered past him, blinking back ridiculous tears as I stepped over the dying embers of our swords\u2019 fire. Damn it, far worse had been said to me over the years, so why would I let a comment like that get past the armor?</p><p>Because, my inner voice whispered, you care more than you should. More than is wise.</p> <p>And he didn\u2019t. Because he was energy rather than flesh and didn\u2019t do emotions the same way the rest of us did. I knew that. Just as I knew his mission would always come first, no matter what. But the knowledge didn\u2019t help ease the pain of that situation or this one.</p><p>I made it five steps past the flames before he caught my hand and stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI should not have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered, not turning around and still blinking furiously.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI did not mean to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>My smile held little humor. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t intend to hurt, you shouldn\u2019t have said the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Risa, please, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep, somewhat shuddering breath, then obeyed.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry.\u201d He wiped a lone tear from my cheek with his thumb. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>My gaze scanned his, but I could see nothing more than regret there. Whatever else he might be feeling or thinking, he was controlling it tightly. I sighed and rested my forehead against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t offer the same. If I think you\u2019re going to die, Azriel, I\u2019ll do what it takes to protect you. I can\u2019t do anything else. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>And not just for protection.</p><p>He brushed a kiss across the top of my head. Warmth tingled through me, filling the spaces that had been so recently shivering under the force of his fury. \u201cIf dying is my fate, then so be it. I am here to do a job, Risa, and neither of us should forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that job if you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I have said, if death is my fate, then so be it. You are the important one in this equation. You and the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m only important because I\u2019m the only way to those keys.\u201d I snorted softly. \u201cYou know, if I did die, the world would be better off. No one would be able to find the keys or open hell\u2019s portals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think your father or the Raziq would stop searching simply because you were dead, you are sorely mistaken.\u201d Azriel\u2019s voice held a sharp edge. \u201cDeath cures nothing, Risa.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. I pulled away from the comfort of his touch. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the car. I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>He released my hand and I walked out the door\u2014only to run nose-first into an all-too-familiar chest.</p> <p>\u201cSpeak of the devil and he arrives,\u201d Azriel muttered.</p><p>I shot him a warning glance, then stepped back. If ever there was a man who was perfectly formed in every imaginable way, Lucian was it. He was truly beautiful to look at, and yet there was nothing effeminate about his looks or his presence. He was tall, towering over me by a good six inches, and his build was that of a warrior\u2014muscular and strong.</p><p>He had the facial features of an angel, and in the past\u2014before his golden wings had been torn off\u2014he probably would have been mistaken for one. Because even though reapers were the true soul guides, it was the Aedh who were the source of the angel seen in so many myths. And like many of those mythical angels, he had golden hair and eyes that were the most glorious shade of jade, but his were so full of power that it was almost impossible to meet them without flinching.</p><p>Normally, my heart rate would have leapt into overdrive at the mere sight of him, but given my recent brushes with both my father and the Raziq, I couldn\u2019t muster anything more than annoyance\u2014though it was edged with a bit of suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Lucian?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other for almost a week, and this is the greeting I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when you suddenly appear where you\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I looked, this was a public train station, not a private one.\u201d His expression was amused, despite the slight edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d His gaze ran past me. \u201cSo nice to see you again, reaper. And I can see by the bruises around Risa\u2019s lovely neck that you\u2019ve been doing an outstanding job of protecting her again.\u201d</p><p>Azriel didn\u2019t reply, but then, he didn\u2019t have to. Even Lucian couldn\u2019t have missed the sudden jump in air temperature. I wondered briefly just how dark Valdis\u2019s flames were, but didn\u2019t turn around to check.</p><p>\u201cStop avoiding the question, Lucian. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. \u201cYou were here to meet your father, were you not? I thought I might be of some use\u2014especially since the Raziq were likely to turn up and cause problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how the hell did you know we were even going to be here? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been anywhere near each other recently, so you couldn\u2019t have read it in my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>The Aedh generally could read human\u2014or non-human\u2014minds only when they were in close proximity to them. However, they formed a strong mental link with their partners during the act of sex, enabling them to hear their thoughts from a distance.</p><p>That bond was\u2014according to Lucian\u2014somewhat inoperative between the two of us. In fact, he\u2019d claimed he could read my thoughts only when he was physically making love to me. Whether that was true or not I had no idea. I trusted him, but no matter what Azriel might think, it wasn\u2019t blind trust. I knew he had secrets. Knew they were more than likely dangerous ones.</p><p>\u201cIf you do not wish anyone to know where you are,\u201d he said, \u201cthen you had better inform your friends of this fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlianna told you?\u201d That surprised me. I would have expected a little more caution, even though she knew Lucian was involved in our quest for the keys.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was at your home waiting to see you, and the note from your father was lying in plain view on the table. If you didn\u2019t want anyone to know where you were, you should have hidden the evidence.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough, I guess. But I hadn\u2019t thought it necessary to hide the note in the safety of our own home. Yet . . . something still niggled. And I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether it was disbelief or Azriel\u2019s distrust flowing through the far reaches of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWell, as it turns out, you\u2019ve missed all the action.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was less than impressed by the discovery that I have a tracker in my heart. He left the minute he sensed the Raziq\u2019s approach.\u201d</p><p>I stepped around him, then headed out of the station. He fell in step beside me. Azriel was a seething mass of annoyance that followed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Raziq? I venture they were not pleased by such an outcome.\u201d His gaze raked me, and deep inside, desire stirred. Goddamn it, what was it about this man that called to me, even when I was annoyed with him? \u201cAre they the reason you have the bruises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re thanks to my father.\u201d I stopped at the traffic lights and punched the button with a little more force than necessary. Who, exactly, I was more annoyed at I couldn\u2019t say for sure\u2014my father, the two of them, or myself for not being strong enough to tell Lucian to fuck off and leave me alone.</p><p>In fact, right now, I wished both of them\u2014and the rest of the damn circus that had entered my life around the same time\u2014would just go away and leave me in peace.</p><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d Surprise edged his tone. \u201cViolence might be one of his mainstays, but it\u2019s rarely unleashed when he still requires that person\u2019s assistance.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a long look. \u201cAnd just how do you know that about my father?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s a Raziq, is he not? They are rebels and outcasts for the precise reason that they do not conform to Aedh standards\u2014not only in ideology, but in their very natures.\u201d</p><p>He lies, Azriel said. There is more to his knowledge than what he claims.</p><p>Just as there\u2019s more to your dislike than what you claim? I grouched back.</p><p>And yet I couldn\u2019t dismiss his doubts, simply because I agreed with them.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said sounded more like firsthand, personal knowledge than like a general statement about the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d ask around about your father, and I have. Aedh numbers may place us on the verge of extinction, but that does not mean there are none in this city. Hieu is old even in Aedh terms, and not unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that sounds a little too convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes the truth is.\u201d He caught my hand and pulled me to an abrupt stop. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m on this hunt. I want the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he interrupted fiercely. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t just want them dead. I want them burned from existence. I want them erased from the memory of the earth itself and their names never to be mentioned, even in the darkest whispers in the darkest of places.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, for the first time seeing the true extent of the anger and darkness in him. And I couldn\u2019t help wondering just what he would do to get that revenge\u2014and what he\u2019d already done.</p><p>More than either of us currently suspects, Azriel commented.</p><p>Suspicion gains us nothing, I replied, despite the fact that my own thoughts were careening along the same line. And just because he wants the Raziq erased doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be trusted. Hell, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t mind it one little bit if the Raziq no longer existed.</p><p>I returned my gaze to Lucian. \u201cLast time we saw each other, you were intending to hunt down information about the tracker the Raziq placed in me. Is that why you were waiting at our place?\u201d</p><p>The anger in him faded, but didn\u2019t completely disappear. It remained in the edge in his voice, in the fierceness of his gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a fierceness that had me trembling, because it wasn\u2019t entirely anger. Lust burned in the deeper recesses of his eyes, and it was growing stronger by the moment.</p><p>I might be tired, I might have the mother of all headaches developing thanks to Amaya and the events of the day so far, but it seemed even that wasn\u2019t enough to stop the growing hum of desire.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t like I had many other options with which to satisfy my needs. With Azriel intent on remaining a monk, my only other possibilities were Jak\u2014the man who not only betrayed the trust I\u2019d placed in him by writing a newspaper article about my mother that basically called her a fraud who lied about her background, but who broke my heart in the process\u2014or I could head down to Franklin\u2019s, a private wolf club where I was a long-term member. And while I did have a regular partner there, his touch had lost some of its appeal since Lucian and Azriel had come into my life.</p> <p>A smile teased Lucian\u2019s lips. Despite his claim to the contrary, he was obviously catching at least some of my thoughts. I tugged my hand free from his and strode toward my car.</p><p>He was back beside me in a heartbeat. \u201cIn answer to your question, yes, I have been researching ways to mute the tracker, and yes, I was at your home to discuss one possibility.\u201d</p><p>I opened the car door but didn\u2019t climb in. \u201cAnd what is the possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dark sorcerer, but not one who uses blood magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sorcerer who trades with darkness is not a wise choice,\u201d Azriel said. Though his voice retained its usual even tone, his distaste and annoyance still shivered through me.</p> <p>Which was odd. It was almost as if the chi connection had somehow deepened, allowing me greater access to the ebb and flow of his emotions. And from what I\u2019d gathered, that shouldn\u2019t have been the case.</p><p>Unless it was a sign that assimilation was a whole lot closer than we\u2019d presumed.</p><p>No.</p><p>I glanced at him. If it\u2019s not assimilation, then what is it?</p><p>He gave me the mental equivalent of a shrug and my annoyance surged. Some things, it seemed, would never change.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had the chance to explore our options with the Brindle witches yet,\u201d I said to Lucian.</p> <p>And since they were some of the most powerful witches in the land, you\u2019d have to think they should be able to come up with something.</p><p>\u201cWhat you bear in your heart is unlike anything the Brindle witches have seen before,\u201d Lucian commented. \u201cIt is Aedh in origin, and their magic far exceeds anything ever seen here on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy that logic,\u201d Azriel said, before I could even open my mouth, \u201ca dark sorcerer will be of as little use as the Brindle witches.\u201d</p><p>Lucian gave him a somewhat scathing glance. \u201cExcept that witches rely on natural magic, whereas a dark sorcerer uses the magic of this world and the other. In this case, that is probably as close as we\u2019ll ever get to Aedh-strength magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich does not mean we should discount other options without even exploring them.\u201d Azriel\u2019s voice held a dangerous edge. \u201cRisa, you cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to at least talk to this sorcerer,\u201d I cut in firmly even as trepidation crawled across my skin. I\u2019d heard too many of Ilianna\u2019s stories to ever be comfortable in the presence of a dark sorcerer. \u201cEven if we do nothing with the information he gives us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least someone in this little group has some common sense,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a meeting for this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working at the caf\u00e9 until eleven.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cShall I pick you up, or would you prefer to meet us there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latter.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be reliant on him to get back home, simply because that was one sure way to end up in his bed rather than alone in mine. Amusement teased his lips again. I added, somewhat crossly, \u201cI thought you could only read my thoughts during sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is mostly true.\u201d</p><p>Azriel snorted softly. I ignored him and said, \u201cDefine \u2018mostly.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lucian shrugged again. \u201cThoughts of a sexual nature are easier to pick up. Anything else is very muddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuddy\u201d didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t read them, just that they were harder to hear. Fabulous. Not.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where do you want to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lovely little bar down the Paris end of Collins Street\u2014Maxwell\u2019s, it\u2019s called. Shall we say midnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, get the hell out of here so I can go home and get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grouchy side is showing, my dear.\u201d His gaze swept to Azriel. \u201cUnderstandable, I guess, given the company you\u2019re forced to keep twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>Azriel took one step forward, then stopped. Other than the slight tightening in his jawline, his expression remained as impassive as ever. But the emotional turmoil that exploded through my being just about sent me staggering.</p><p>Lucian was a dead man if he ever gave Azriel the slightest reason to attack.</p><p>He will not, Azriel said. He is not that stupid. Nor am I that rash.</p><p>You might be if you hang around me for too much longer.</p><p>Many things might happen if I hang around you too much longer.</p><p>It was a comment that sparked an avalanche of questions and possibly some hope, but before I could say anything, Azriel winked out of existence\u2014neatly avoiding said questions\u2014and Lucian stepped closer. His scent was an enticing mix of lemongrass, suede, and musky, powerful male.</p><p>\u201cUntil tonight.\u201d He caught my hand in his and raised it to his lips. The kiss was light and teasing, and oddly erotic. \u201cWear something sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of wearing anything sexy\u2014either for you or for this dark sorcerer.\u201d I ripped my hand from his, but the warmth of his lips lingered, making my skin tingle.</p><p>Amusement played about his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t still be in the bad books for previous behavior, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, and you are.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some pretty stellar behavior to get you out of the bad books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a challenge. I like that.\u201d He hesitated, then added, \u201cOne thing, though.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows in question when he didn\u2019t immediately go on, and he half smiled. \u201cThis may seem a strange request, but do not wear your demon sword when you meet our sorcerer. They tend to be sensitive to demon magic, and it would create the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not really caring about the impression I give to a sorcerer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might if you want a solution to your problem.\u201d He caught my hand again and dropped a soft, sweet kiss on it. My toes curled in delight. \u201cI promise to protect you from any harm the sorcerer might offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who\u2019s going to protect me from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, his voice filled with mock distress. \u201cYou\u2019ve uncovered my evil plan to have you helpless with desire by the evening\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>Despite the annoyance\u2014at both myself and him\u2014I couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cAmaya\u2019s presence won\u2019t stop that from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it may stop the sorcerer from helping us. Will you leave her behind? Please?\u201d</p><p>I eyed him for a moment, then said, somewhat reluctantly, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He bowed lightly. \u201cUntil tonight, then, when the games will commence.\u201d</p><p>He gave me another smoky smile, then turned and walked away. And I knew that if I didn\u2019t end up in his bed tonight, it would be a goddamn miracle.</p><p>It was just after three by the time I arrived at the caf\u00e9 we\u2019d named RYT\u2019s, an acronym for rich young things, which was precisely what we\u2019d been at the time we\u2019d started the business. Though I was a good fifteen minutes late, the caf\u00e9 wasn\u2019t that busy, with only a couple of regulars sitting at the bar drinking Irish coffees and a third at one of the tables reading the newspaper. The article, I noticed with amusement, was one of Jak\u2019s, but I resisted the temptation to peek over the customer\u2019s shoulder to see just what he was reporting on this time. He might have stepped back into my life, but that didn\u2019t mean I now needed to keep up with everything he was doing.</p><p>Even if that wistful, not-quite-over-him-no-matter-what-he\u2019d-done piece of me desperately wanted to.</p><p>\u201cHi, Risa,\u201d Manny, one of our newer waiters, said as I walked in.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s things going today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA particularly insane lunch rush has been followed by this lovely lull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy it while you can,\u201d I said with a smile, \u201cbecause it won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>The afternoon rush usually hit between five and seven, when werewolves hungry from the afternoon spent at the werewolf sex club Blue Moon came in to eat, and those on their way to the club came in to fuel up.</p><p>I looked around for a moment, then added, \u201cWhere\u2019s Linda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently one of the kitchen hands didn\u2019t turn up today, so Tao\u2019s asked Linda to help with the dishes while we\u2019re slow.\u201d</p><p>I cursed softly. If there was one position we couldn\u2019t seem to keep filled long term, it was the damn kitchen hand. It paid well enough, but it was hot, grubby work, and it seemed the younger generation weren\u2019t inclined that way\u2014it was all middle management and high starting salaries for them, or it was nothing.</p><p>Which was a comment Mom often used to make. I smiled, even as the wistful ache that she was gone swept through me again. No matter how close I was to my aunt Riley, she wasn\u2019t Mom and never could be.</p><p>I grabbed the banister and headed up. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go do some paperwork, Manny, but give me a yell the minute it gets busy down here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and I continued on up to the office.</p><p>I was near the top of the stairs when the kitchen exploded in flames.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>There was a gigantic whoosh; then the kitchen doors burst open and a fist of flame punched through them. I ducked instinctively, but the flames were sucked back into the kitchen almost as soon as they\u2019d appeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t a natural action.</p><p>The flames were Tao\u2019s.</p><p>He\u2019d lost control. Had to have. Fuck.</p> <p>I jumped over the banister, landed lightly in a half crouch, then surged upright and ran forward. The fire alarm went off, forcing me to shout as I said, \u201cManny, get everyone outside!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his face white as he herded the three customers out. I made a quick dash into the bathrooms to ensure that no one was there, then bolted for the kitchen.</p><p>I hit the doors with enough force to wrench one from its hinges. Water poured from the ceiling sprinklers and soaked me in an instant, but it wasn\u2019t doing anything to extinguish the source of the fire\u2014Tao. He was on his knees in the middle of the kitchen floor, his arms wrapped around his chest and his entire body alight. It wasn\u2019t burning him\u2014it couldn\u2019t, because he was now more a spirit of flame than a werewolf with pyrokinetic abilities, thanks to the fire elemental\u2014a creature created from magic\u2014that he\u2019d consumed to save Ilianna\u2019s life. But his flames leapt high enough to fan out across the ceiling, and there were thick scorch marks above the stainless-steel oven surrounds\u2014obviously, that was where the initial loss of control had happened. Yet nothing else had been set on fire, even though the intensity of the heat pouring off him had me flinching.</p><p>My gaze swept the rest of the kitchen, looking for Linda and Rachel\u2014the other chef who was rostered on to help today. Neither of them was here, but the rear door was half open. Tao must have sent them out just before he exploded.</p><p>I scooped up tea towels from the nearby bench, dunked them in a sink that had trays soaking, then wrapped them around my hands as I approached Tao.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he croaked. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fucking control it.\u201d</p><p>His gaze leapt to mine\u2014haunted, desperate. \u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s not my fire-starting abilities\u2014it\u2019s the elemental.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip against the urge to say something comforting. That was not what he needed right now. \u201cAnd you\u2019re both now, like it or not. You can do this, Tao. You can control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could, I wouldn\u2019t have exploded,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>True enough. But all I said was, \u201cWell, the only thing on fire in the kitchen is you, so don\u2019t bullshit me about not being able to control it.\u201d</p> <p>I grabbed him under the armpits and dragged him toward the freezer. His entire body shook violently, as if the flames that enveloped him were physically assaulting him. Heat soaked through the towels and singed the hairs on my arms, but the flames leapt no farther up my arms\u2014he was controlling it, even if imperfectly.</p><p>I opened the freezer, shoved him inside, then grabbed the safety-release knob and slammed the door shut behind the two of us. The flames were so fierce it felt like I\u2019d stepped into an oven, and I briefly wondered if he\u2019d get himself under full control before everything started melting\u2014me included.</p><p>He squatted on the freezer floor and hugged his knees, making the overall area of his flames small. I stepped past him and grabbed some bags of ice, tearing them open, then pouring the contents down his back. The blocks melted in an instant, but it didn\u2019t matter. What that did was get his core temperature down so that he could have some hope of regaining control.</p><p>Gradually, the flames subsided, until they were little more than fireflies dancing across his skin. I poured the last of the ice down his back, then tossed the bag on the floor beside the others and knelt behind him. I wrapped my arms around his still-shaking shoulders and held him tight. I was soaked to the skin\u2014we both were\u2014but I wasn\u2019t cold. The flames might be practically out, but the heat in his body was still enough to warm an entire battalion of people.</p><p>After a while, he took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again, Risa.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to be my day for getting told that. But there was no anger in Tao\u2019s voice, only resigned weariness. I said, \u201cYou know it\u2019s pointless telling me that, so why even waste the words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I keep hoping one day you\u2019ll actually listen to someone.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cAnd how long have you known me?\u201d</p> <p>He made an odd sound that stood somewhere between laugh and groan. \u201cOkay, point taken. But it was still one hell of a risk. I wasn\u2019t in control, and I could have hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve already pointed out, you were the only thing alight in the kitchen.\u201d And that alone meant he had some level of control, even if he couldn\u2019t immediately douse the flames. I dropped a kiss onto the back of his neck, then pushed to my feet. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t let the elemental hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I might.\u201d He took my offered hand and let me haul him upright. As a werewolf he was naturally lean, but these days, thanks to what resided within him, he could only be considered skin and bone. Not abnormally so, not yet, but not far from it, either. \u201cAnd the fire trucks have just about arrived.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head a little and caught the wail of the approaching fire engine. \u201cYou want to go out the back and reassure Linda and Rachel? I\u2019ll go talk to the firemen.\u201d</p><p>His smile was a little on the wan side, but it nevertheless warmed me. He was going to be okay\u2014at least this time. \u201cYou always did like a man in uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost women do.\u201d I gave him a grin. \u201cAnd some men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, not unless you\u2019d walked in on one of Ilianna\u2019s potion-making moments.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cOnce this mess is all sorted out, you\u2019d better meet me upstairs and tell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression suddenly grim. Prickles of concern danced through me, but I shoved them aside, then hit the freezer door release and headed out not only to meet the firemen but to see what could be done about the mess.</p><p>As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t a whole lot we could do. We cleaned up the best we could, but the kitchen itself was shut down, thanks to all the water damage, and it wouldn\u2019t reopen until everything was checked and passed by the local government council, who controlled the planning and permits for the area. I spent the next hour lining up plumbers, electricians, and the gas people, while Tao rang the insurance company, then put signs in the windows explaining the situation. I hoped we weren\u2019t closed for too long. Customers could be fickle creatures at the best of times.</p><p>I locked up, then pulled a couple of beers out of the fridge and headed upstairs.</p><p>\u201cSo, give with the details.\u201d I handed Tao a beer and plopped down on a nearby chair.</p><p>He sighed and put his feet up. His warm brown eyes, when they met mine, were somber. \u201cI was pulling a double shift because Jacques had his dad\u2019s funeral today, and no one was able to fill in.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I knew all that\u2014just as I knew that Tao could have called in a temp but didn\u2019t because he was a little on the fussy side when it came to just who worked in his kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLunch was madder than normal and the kitchen was its usual stinking-hot self.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIn this day and age you\u2019d think they\u2019d make air-con that could function more efficiently in kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they do. Problem is, we don\u2019t actually own this building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Might have to fix that now that the place is pulling decent money.\u201d He thrust a hand through his still-damp brown hair. \u201cAnyway, the heat had the thing inside me stirring. The hotter the air got, the stronger it got, but both Rachel and I were working flat out and I just couldn\u2019t take time to go sit in the freezer for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think it would get to the point that it did.\u201d I said it softly, without accusation. Tao wasn\u2019t the type to risk the lives of others.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been this bad before. I don\u2019t know why it was this time.\u201d</p><p>I drank some beer and contemplated him. The elemental\u2019s flames still burned fiercely within him\u2014the power of it glowed under his skin.</p><p>\u201cObviously, the kitchen heat had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a sip of beer and leaned back in the chair. \u201cI had all the jets going on the stove. It seems to feed on that sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>It was a fire elemental, so that was logical. \u201cIt might also have been the sun. It was warm today.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cNo sun gets into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt mightn\u2019t need direct sunlight. Maybe just the warmth is enough.\u201d I paused. \u201cAt least no one was hurt. You controlled it that much; in the end, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I almost didn\u2019t.\u201d His expression was bleak. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death it\u2019ll take me over, and I\u2019ll destroy everything and everyone I love.\u201d</p><p>I put my beer down, then knelt in front of him and took his hands in mine. \u201cI promise you, Tao, we won\u2019t let this thing destroy you or anyone else. It hasn\u2019t won the fights, and it won\u2019t win the battle. We won\u2019t let it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d But his expression suggested he actually held very little hope himself.</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cMaybe you should work at night for the time being. At least until you\u2019re more confident of your ability to control the elemental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tugged his hands free from mine and pulled me close. For several minutes he did nothing more than hug me\u2014it almost felt like he was attempting to hold on to his own humanity by hanging on to mine. Gradually, the heat in him began to dissipate, until his body temperature was only a little above what would be considered normal for a werewolf.</p><p>Only then did the tension in him subside.</p><p>He released me and said, \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve both got an unintended night off.\u201d</p><p>I forced a smile and sat back on my heels. \u201cI guess the fire did have one benefit, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it did.\u201d He scrubbed a hand across his stubbly chin, the sound like sandpaper against a wall. \u201cI might take myself down to the Blue Moon and lose a couple hours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the ghosts of fear, I suspected. They were ghosts I knew all too well, because they were inside me, too. \u201cI\u2019ll ring Ilianna and update her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, I forgot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I cut in quickly, as the air temperature suddenly spiked. The elemental might be down, but it wasn\u2019t yet out. He needed to keep calm. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Just go have some fun and relax.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d He rose and kissed the top of my head. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I caught my bottom lip with my teeth as I watched him walk out. Because I knew, despite my promises, that there was no guarantee he would win this battle. He had to find the strength within himself\u2014none of us could do that for him, and certainly there was no magic or potion that would work in this sort of situation. Lord only knew, Ilianna and the Brindle witches had tried hard enough to find one.</p><p>Tao was one of the strongest people I knew, but he was obviously struggling. And I knew, deep down, that there was a very real possibility that we might yet lose him to the monster that resided within.</p><p>In the end, I decided against leaving Amaya behind. Lucian might fear the sorcerer\u2019s reaction to her, but I wasn\u2019t about to walk into the unknown without the means to fully protect myself. And if that meant that the sorcerer walked, then so be it.</p><p>Maxwell\u2019s, it turned out, was more than just a lovely little bar situated at the upscale end of Collins Street. It also happened to be an extremely discreet wolf club.</p> <p>Not that you could tell from merely stepping inside the place. It appeared to be nothing more than a very stylish, very elegant bar that catered to humans and non-humans alike. The surrounds\u2014old-world architecture, luxurious leather couches, and a stunning marble bar\u2014gave it the feel of a gentlemen\u2019s club, although overall it was far more friendly and welcoming.</p><p>It was only the faintest trace of sex and desire stirring lazily through the air that gave the game away and, even then, it was only an occasional tease.</p><p>I briefly contemplated walking out, but if I did that, I might throw away our one and only chance to talk to someone with the skill to either stop or mute the transmitter in my heart. We needed to at least hear our options before we declined them.</p><p>Although if I was being completely honest, the real reason I didn\u2019t walk out was that I was intrigued. I\u2019d never heard of Maxwell\u2019s\u2014not even a whisper on the grapevine\u2014which meant whoever ran it maintained extreme control. And that made me wonder why. Franklin\u2019s\u2014the private wolf club I was a member of\u2014was also very discreet, but it was not unknown in the wolf world, and I imagined it catered to the same sort of upmarket clientele.</p><p>A waiter approached, a polite smile creasing his pleasant features. \u201cWelcome to Maxwell\u2019s, ma\u2019am. Are you here for a casual drink, or would you prefer a seat in our restaurant?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet a friend\u2014Mr. Lucian Dupont\u2014but I\u2019m not sure whether he\u2019s booked a table or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh yes, Mr. Dupont said you might be late. He and his other guest have been here for just over an hour.\u201d Though there was no censure in his voice, it was nevertheless a gentle rebuke. Obviously, one did not keep members waiting. Amusement teased my lips as he motioned a waitress forward. \u201cAmy will show you to the private dining area.\u201d</p><p>Was \u201cprivate dining\u201d a euphemism for the werewolf section? I guessed I\u2019d find out soon enough. I followed the willowy waitress through the main bar and up the stairs. The third floor held the wolf club, if the strengthening smell of sex and lust was anything to go by, but we didn\u2019t stop there. We went on, up to the fourth floor, then along a corridor that had darkly stained wood-panel doors at regular intervals. She stopped at the seventh one and knocked politely. \u201cYour final guest has arrived, Mr. Dupont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease send her in,\u201d Lucian replied, in a cool and authoritative tone. The high-end investment adviser, not the lover.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pleased or annoyed.</p><p>The woman keyed open the door and waved me inside. As the door closed behind me, I paused and looked around. I\u2019d half expected some sort of private boudoir, but it was actually set up as a plush but comfortable dining room. A mahogany table dominated the space but, oddly, there were only two chairs. Maybe dark sorcerers didn\u2019t eat. Or maybe I wasn\u2019t invited to eat. He might be taking the \u201cbehave yourself\u201d request to a whole new level.</p><p>And that would definitely be annoying. I mean, just because I was angry that he\u2019d forced intercourse one time to read my mind, that didn\u2019t mean I never wanted to partake of his particular brand of loving again.</p><p>The scent of sex was heavier in the room than in the hallway outside, but it was oddly entwined with the sharpness of blood. I frowned and glanced toward the end of the room, which seemed to be the source of the scents. The entire width of the wall was covered by heavy red velvet curtains. I was half tempted to walk over to see what they were hiding but resisted, and scanned the rest of the room instead. The remaining walls were paneled in dark wood, once again giving the impression of something you\u2019d see in a gentlemen\u2019s club. A bar dominated the other end of the room, and it was against this that Lucian leaned. He gave me a wide smile when my gaze met his, but it was his companion who caught my attention.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t a man, like I\u2019d been expecting. And\u2014for one fleeting moment\u2014she seemed very familiar. But before I could figure out who it was she reminded me of, she turned fully around and the moment was gone. All I saw was a stranger.</p> <p>She was a tall, full-bodied\u2014almost matronly\u2014woman, with angular features and dark hair cut close to her head. Her nose was large and Roman, and gave her an arrogant air. But it was her eyes that sent shivers skating across my skin. They were a blue so pale it was almost impossible to separate the iris from the white. And in those pale depths, eons of knowledge seemed to glow.</p><p>Enough knowledge to steal a portal key, perhaps? Maybe, just maybe.</p><p>And yet this wasn\u2019t the person who had stolen the key from under our noses. Not because the person who\u2019d taken it had been a man\u2014in truth, gender could temporarily be altered, whether by a glamour or by more basic means such as makeup and wigs. It was more that she didn\u2019t feel the same. The man\u2014the sorcerer\u2014who had taken the key held an energy that was dark, ungodly, and bitter. This woman didn\u2019t, although she didn\u2019t exactly feel clean, either. There was a definite taint to the energy that poured off her, but it was more an uneasy vibration of something not quite right than anything truly dark.</p><p>\u201cRisa.\u201d Lucian stepped in front of me, effectively blocking my view of the stranger. \u201cYou look divine, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a black dress, and there\u2019s very little flesh on show.\u201d</p><p>And for a very good reason\u2014I still had too many bruises. Old ones, as well as the new one my father had given me. Divine didn\u2019t give me enough coverage; this simple shift, with its high neckline, did.</p><p>\u201cAh, but it skims your curves delightfully, and teases the imagination. That is extremely sexy to those with good imaginations.\u201d He kissed both cheeks, every action overly polite.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow in silent query. He grinned and said in a low voice, \u201cYou did warn me I needed to be on my best behavior if I ever wanted to get into your bed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t exactly expect such immediate and polite compliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It is, after all, to my benefit if I do.\u201d He swung around, offered me an arm, then said in a more normal voice, \u201cLet me introduce you to our guest.\u201d</p><p>He escorted me toward the bar. The stranger\u2019s gaze flickered down my body and it felt like I was standing there naked, being judged inside and out. Her expression seemed to say I\u2019d been found wanting. And that, unsurprisingly, was something of a relief. The last thing I wanted was to attract the interest of someone who dealt with the dark forces of this world on any level other than that of hunting them.</p><p>Not that the man who did hunt them had been sighted for the last few hours. Which suggested Azriel had taken to heart my snarky wish that they\u2019d all leave me in peace and was keeping watch from a distance rather than up close and personal.</p><p>Lucian waved a hand in the stranger\u2019s direction. \u201cRisa Jones, Lauren Macintyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvening.\u201d Lauren\u2019s voice was mellow and soft, the opposite of what I\u2019d been expecting. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand. My pause was brief, but nevertheless there, and something flickered through her eyes. Not amusement. Something deeper. Darker.</p><p>The fingers that wrapped around mine were long and warm, her grip strong. But there was nothing untoward in her touch, no dark shimmer or foul feel, despite that flicker in her eyes and the vibrations that continued to roll off her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d Lucian walked around the bar. \u201cWe have wine, beer, and champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampers, please.\u201d I propped on a barstool and returned Lauren\u2019s gaze steadily. \u201cI\u2019m gathering Lucian has told you the reason I wished to see you?\u201d</p><p>A small smile touched her lips, though little amusement reached her ice-colored eyes. \u201cA woman who gets straight down to business. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she was a no-nonsense person.\u201d Lucian slid a glass of bubbly toward me, then leaned on the bar.</p><p>Desire slithered through me, quick and hungry. I took a drink and tried to keep my attention on the sorcerer, not the lover.</p><p>And wondered, even as I did so, why the hell he affected me so strongly. He might be Aedh, and able to ensnare lovers with just a kiss, but this was something else. Something that was almost darker.</p><p>And that was worrying.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cSo tell me, what do you think of dark sorcerers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy personal opinion is that you should all be dumped in the deepest, darkest hole in hell and forgotten about.\u201d My shrug was casual, but tension rode me. I couldn\u2019t be anything less than honest, even though she was obviously ready to walk, given the slightest reason, and being honest might well give her that reason. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve seen too much pain and catastrophe caused by your kind to want anything else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd yet here you are, wanting my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I hate what you do doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t use you if I need to.\u201d</p><p>White teeth flashed in what I presumed was a grin, though it was an oddly unsettling one. \u201cIf you had answered any other way\u2014if you had been less than honest\u2014I would have walked out the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen thank god for honesty.\u201d I contemplated her over the rim of the champagne glass. \u201cSo, back to my original question\u2014did Lucian fill you in on why we wanted to speak to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The amusement died from her lips. \u201cI know of the reapers\u2014one such as I cannot help but be aware of them. However, I did not know there were beings called Aedh who once manned the gates to heaven and hell. Or that some fool wants the gates of hell opened permanently.\u201d</p><p>That raised my eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t you trade with hellkind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want all hell to break loose here on earth. If demons were as common as ants, it would destroy my business.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. Consorting with demons was a business, was it? \u201cThen you also know why I need your help.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cHowever, we are talking about a device created by beings who aren\u2019t of this world. I will need to get the feel of it before I can say whether I could help you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a bit hard, given that it\u2019s woven into the fabric of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Lauren gave me a cool smile. \u201cI did not mean that in the literal sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply need to touch you. Stand up.\u201d</p><p>I took a large gulp of champagne, then did so. She pressed her hand under my left breast, the coolness of her long fingers sending goose bumps skittering across my skin. There was nothing sexual in her touch, nothing dark or uneasy, and yet all of those things slid through me.</p> <p>Lauren closed her eyes. For several minutes, she neither moved nor breathed, although she obviously was breathing, since otherwise she\u2019d have passed out.</p><p>Then she retracted her touch and opened her eyes, a frown creasing her smooth features. \u201cThe device is very powerful. I\u2019m not entirely sure if it could be stopped from functioning for any length of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I sat back on my chair and met Lucian\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt was worth a shot, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung woman, you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d Her soft voice held more than a hint of rebuke. \u201cI said I couldn\u2019t stop it for any length of time. Meaning, it might just be possible to stop it for brief minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few minutes is better than nothing.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cBut whether we could use it would depend on just what it takes to achieve that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid down my length. Horror swamped me. Not that, I thought. Anything but that. Or blood.</p><p>But when her gaze met mine again, there was little in the way of desire. Just cool calculation. And if I hadn\u2019t been aware of it before, then that look alone was enough to tell me she was very dangerous.</p><p>\u201cLucian has already informed me of your aversion to blood magic\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said she didn\u2019t do blood magic,\u201d I cut in, glancing at Lucian.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf I had said anything else, would you have come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that explains the lie. You need to explore all options, Risa. It is foolish to do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood magic is not an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a shame, as it\u2019s the most powerful form of magic available here on earth,\u201d Lauren commented.</p><p>I met her gaze again. \u201cIt also taints the user in the extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a debate I will not get into. It does, however, lessen our options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least there are options.\u201d Hopefully, there were some that were a little less unhealthy than blood magic. Although Ilianna was going to hit the roof either way.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She glanced at Lucian, then rose and finished her drink. \u201cI will be in contact if I uncover any possibilities.\u201d</p><p>She gave me another of those cool, thoughtful looks, then walked out. But as I watched her leave, foreboding shivered through me. She would find a way to mute the Raziq\u2019s device\u2014I had no doubt of that.</p><p>Just as I had no doubt that the price would be one I\u2019d be reluctant to pay.</p><p>I rubbed my arms against the sudden chill in my flesh, and couldn\u2019t hold back a sigh of relief when the door closed behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she isn\u2019t staying for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Lucian topped up my glass. \u201cAs much as I like the occasional threesome, I have this odd feeling you would not have been your usual unrestrained self.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a wry smile. \u201cThat is, of course, presuming I\u2019ll have anything to be unrestrained about.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an innocent smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my legs. \u201cSo how come you know about this place and I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA client told me about it and offered an introduction.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was on my legs and his hunger stirred the air. It echoed through me, warm and delicious. \u201cAn introduction? You have to be introduced and approved to be a member here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFranklin\u2019s caters to the rich. This place caters to the \u00fcberrich, as well as those who derive pleasure from watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can watch in any of the wolf clubs. And Franklin\u2019s has private viewing rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we are not talking about common sex here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBDSM?\u201d I had no problem with that in and of itself, but beyond the odd handcuff fantasy, I really wasn\u2019t into that sort of sexual play.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd blood play, fetishes, fantasies\u2014but not all at once. Every night has a different \u2018theme.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the theme tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBondage.\u201d His gaze pinned mine, the intensity making my heart hammer. He didn\u2019t care where we were; he just wanted\u2014intended\u2014to make love to me tonight. And while I hungered for his touch, somewhere in the dark recesses unease stirred anew. Because while I was part wolf, and did have an above-average sex drive, this was definitely more than that. But no matter how uneasy I was feeling right now, it wasn\u2019t enough to make me walk away. Not yet. He added, \u201cBut we do not have to stay. We can walk to my place, and I shall personally cook dinner for you.\u201d</p><p>And then we shall love until you can take no more and beg for me to stop.</p><p>The thought whispered through my brain, distant and tantalizing. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that the thought was mine, although I wasn\u2019t telepathic, and certainly hadn\u2019t been able to catch his thoughts before now. But then, did I need to? The hunger in his eyes made it very evident where his thoughts were headed.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your place a little too far away?\u201d I had no problem about actually walking there, but not in these heels.</p><p>A smile teased his lips. \u201cAs it so happens, I recently purchased a nearby building for investment purposes, but I\u2019m keeping the top floor for myself. The entire place is being renovated, but I have a kitchen and bathroom in working order.\u201d</p><p>I was betting the bedroom was in working order, too. \u201cWhy arrange to meet here, then? Why not just meet in your apartment in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He caught my hands and raised them, palms toward him, to his lips. \u201cBecause Lauren wanted someplace public, but absolutely secure. Maxwell\u2019s is certainly that.\u201d</p><p>Lie, lie, lie. But the thought died abruptly as he began to place gentle kisses on each of my fingertips, then drew one into his mouth and sucked on it lightly. My breathing hitched, then became more erratic. I might have doubts about him, but there was no denying my attraction, enhanced or not.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he added eventually, \u201cwhat is it to be?\u201d</p><p>From the minute I\u2019d walked into this room, there was only ever going to be one outcome, and we both knew it. The where was a secondary consideration. I raised an eyebrow, and a victorious grin lit his features.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much, which is why I already have a lamb roast in the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone knows a good lamb roast is a guaranteed way of getting into any werewolf\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that and dessert. Which is a triple-layer chocolate mousse cake.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, then leaned over the counter and dropped a quick kiss on his lips. It left mine tingly with anticipation. \u201cI might just forgive you if the food\u2019s as good as it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Shall we make a retreat?\u201d</p><p>I downed the rest of the champagne, and felt its effervescence all the way down to my toes. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He came around the counter and offered me his arm. I slipped mine through his, and he escorted me out of the building and across the road to his apartment. It was one of those grand old Victorians that Collins Street was famous for, and only five stories high, which meant his floor was at treetop level. The old lift rattled and shook as it swept us upward, then opened to reveal a vast room that was filled with building debris and smelled of paint and dust.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my palace.\u201d He grinned as he caught my hand and guided me through the mess of dustcovers and workmen\u2019s tools.</p><p>We walked through the remains of a wall into the kitchen area. It was very rudimentary. There was an oven, a fridge, and the bare bones of two small counters\u2014one of which held the sink\u2014but just about everything else had been gutted. Plates were stacked on the non-sink counter and a drawer that held cutlery sat on the floor near it. But the mouthwatering scent of roasting meat filled the air. I breathed deep, then sighed in contentment.</p><p>\u201cGod, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better scent in this world.\u201d I crossed my arms and leaned against the free bench.</p><p>Lucian\u2019s smile was wicked. \u201cOh, I can think of one or two. What would you like to drink? I have wine or champagne in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampers again, thanks.\u201d I watched him pour the drinks, then asked, \u201cSo how did you actually find Lauren?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked over to the oven and opened the door. Steam billowed, and the smell of roasting meat intensified. My belly rumbled happily. \u201cI asked around, as I said. She was the only one willing to meet me. Us.\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of champagne, enjoying the tease of bubbles on my nose. \u201cSo you\u2019ve never met her before today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated, and looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cIt just seemed a little odd that you\u2019d be in a place like that with someone you didn\u2019t know for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did have to explain the whole damn situation.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cAs an aside, did you leave your demon sword behind, as requested?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at both the sudden change of direction and the fact that he couldn\u2019t sense her. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sensitive to her magic, so no.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI would have thought all Aedh would be sensitive to anything demon-related, given their traditional role of gate guardians.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment the darkness in his eyes was so intense it almost verged on insanity. It was gone just as quickly, but its mark remained, leaving me cold inside. It made me wonder why the hell I was spending so much time with him\u2014what was the draw, beyond great sex? Why oh why did he have this incredible pull on me? Was it just a matter of Aedh calling Aedh? Or was there something else at work? Something deeper. Darker.</p><p>I really didn\u2019t know, but I was beginning to suspect it might pay to find out.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned before,\u201d he said, \u201cmany things were ripped from me when they stole my wings and forever contained me in flesh.\u201d</p><p>I forced a hand up and lightly caressed his cheek. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you any less an Aedh in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and the final remnants of darkness fled. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m still potent where it counts. Now stop avoiding the question.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. He couldn\u2019t sense Amaya and\u2014given that she was shadow-wreathed and little more than invisible particles right now\u2014he certainly wouldn\u2019t feel her, so I saw no reason not to lie. Especially since I still had that niggling, deep-down chill and more than a small suspicion that he wasn\u2019t being honest with me. \u201cWell, there was much protest from Azriel, but I did do as you requested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. And thank you for trusting me.\u201d</p><p>A statement that only made me feel bad for not trusting him.</p><p>He closed the oven door and walked around to where I stood. His lips brushed the back of my neck, and then he said softly, \u201cDinner will be another hour, at least. What do you suggest we do?\u201d</p><p>His breath teased my earlobes, and a delighted shiver ran through me. \u201cHow about we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d The sound of my shift\u2019s zipper being slid down seemed to echo through the vast space around us.</p><p>\u201cHow about why it took an hour to update the dark sorcerer, for a start. We both know that\u2019s a lie, Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d His fingers brushed my spine, and desire coursed through me. \u201cThese scars are new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a present from the Rakshasa I killed.\u201d My voice held a slightly husky edge. I swallowed some more champers, but it didn\u2019t do a lot to curb the rise of desire. And whether the fierceness of that desire was natural or not didn\u2019t really seem to matter at this point in time. \u201cExplain what you mean by \u2018perhaps.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He slid his hands around my waist, linking them just under my breasts. My nipples went tight. Ached with expectation.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said you wanted to talk, I didn\u2019t actually think you meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want an honest answer, Lucian. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sinister going on, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying. The simple fact is, no dark sorcerer does anything for nothing. She wanted payment, in blood.\u201d</p><p>Horror twisted through me. I turned in his arms. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give it to her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? This is just a form I\u2019m forced to use, Risa. I do not cherish it the way you all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut giving a dark sorcerer your blood? That\u2019s like giving a thief free access to your credit card. It\u2019s stupid\u2014and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do anything worse than what has already been done to me.\u201d His voice was both grim and dark, and again it had me wondering just what lengths he\u2019d go to for the sake of revenge. More than I could ever guess, I suspected. \u201cI do not fear her, Risa, and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t believe that statement one little bit.\u201d</p><p>We were standing so close all I could smell was musky, powerful male, and all I could feel was the heat of his desire. It took every ounce of control to just stand there in his arms\u2014to not tear his clothes off and beg him to take me there and then. But I wanted answers. Wanted honesty, and he wasn\u2019t giving me either right now.</p><p>\u201cShe is an extremely old\u2014and powerful\u2014sorcerer, Risa.\u201d He hooked his fingers under the shift\u2019s shoulders and slid them down my arms. It fell to the floor in a river of soft black silk and puddled at my feet. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get there by making foolish moves. She knows a reaper protects you.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my fingers, fighting the urge to wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him. \u201cI got the feeling she wasn\u2019t particularly scared of reapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t be wary of the reapers, and as I said, she is no fool.\u201d</p><p>My gaze searched his, but what I was looking for I couldn\u2019t honestly say. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that; you don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her kind,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust as I know your kind.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed me, and any sense of resistance fled. I gave in to desire and just enjoyed. Somewhere in all our kisses, my bra came off, as did my panties. Then his mouth left mine, and he kissed his way down my chin, then my neck. When he licked along my collarbone, I flung back my head and moaned softly. He chuckled, and continued his downward journey, catching one nipple lightly between his teeth. A shiver that was part fear, part delight, ran through me. He teased me with his teeth, stopping just on the cusp of hurting, then swirled his tongue around my nipple, taking away the sting before he moved across to the other side. Then his lips left my breasts and moved down my trembling belly. He dropped kisses on either thigh, then gently parted my legs and kissed me, his breath washing coolness against my heated flesh. Then his tongue swirled around my clit, alternating fast flicks with long, slow strokes and driving me insane in the process. I shuddered, shook, and moaned, as the low-down tightness spread rapidly through the rest of me, until it felt like I was on the edge of a precipice, unable to think, unable to breathe, and more than ready to fall over.</p><p>Then he was in me, driving hard, thrusting deep. I climbed up onto him, wrapped my legs around his waist, and forced him even deeper, my movements as frantic as his. There was little sound except the slap of flesh against flesh, and the heat of lust and sex was so fierce that the air shimmered with it. I came, screaming in pleasure, my body convulsing around his. Heard his answering growl, felt him come deep inside me, his body suddenly rigid against mine.</p><p>When I could finally breathe again, I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him, long and slow. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, with a somewhat cheeky grin, \u201cthat filled five minutes. What next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d he said, cupping his hands under my butt, \u201cwe take this to a more comfortable situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kitchen bench wasn\u2019t?\u201d I murmured, wiggling a little against him. Despite having come only heartbeats ago, he was more than half ready to go again. The stamina of an Aedh left a werewolf for dead.</p><p>\u201cIt was suitable enough for a quick encounter, but I\u2019m planning our next campaign to be a long one, and that always requires comfort.\u201d</p><p>He shouldered open a door to reveal another large room. A king-sized bed dominated the middle of it, but in the far corner sat the working skeletons of a bathroom\u2014including the biggest damn bathtub I\u2019d ever seen. You could practically swim in it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the roast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ravish, we eat, then I ravish some more, until you can no longer take it and beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Which was almost word for word what I\u2019d heard earlier. Trepidation shivered through me, but it was quickly lost to the assault of desire as he put his plan into action.</p><p>He was a man of his word.</p><p>And in the end, I did indeed beg him to stop.</p><p>The scent of coffee stirred me from sleep. I flared my nostrils and drew in the delicious scent\u2014one that ran through the heavy aroma of sex that still clung to the air. Hunger stirred, but it was a sluggish sensation. Which aptly described the rest of me. Deliciously so.</p><p>Footsteps approached, but I didn\u2019t bother moving or opening my eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d My words were muffled by the pillow I was facedown in.</p><p>\u201cNine o\u2019clock.\u201d Cutlery clinked as Lucian placed a tray beside the bed. \u201cI have coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. The mattress dipped as his weight hit it. \u201cYour phone rang about ten minutes ago. You want to see who it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I should.\u201d I made a weak \u201cgive me\u201d motion with my hand and forced an eye open. It was Jak\u2014he wanted to meet around lunchtime. I groaned, not sure I would even be capable of moving by then.</p><p>\u201cAnything important?\u201d Lucian asked.</p><p>\u201cA reminder that I have to meet someone for lunch.\u201d I let the phone drop back to the bed and snuggled deeper into my pillow. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to do anything more than sleeping for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking werewolves had stamina.\u201d</p><p>His fingers began tracing lines up and down my back. While it felt nice, I barely had the energy to breathe, let alone go another round with him. And that was something I\u2019d never thought would happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs werewolves go, it seems I\u2019m a poor specimen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re also half-Aedh.

Absolutely, totally zero.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly and the bed bounced as he nudged my legs open a little wider. His caress found my clit and I bit my lip against the moan that rose up my throat. \u201cLucian, I\u2019ve only had three hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I\u2019d really rather\u2014\u201d His fingers slipped slowly inside me at that point, and the rest of the sentence was lost as my muscles clenched around him and pleasure shot through me.</p><p>\u201cAh, the stirrings of desire,\u201d he murmured, his voice filled with satisfaction. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can get it a little stronger.\u201d</p> <p>But his touch withdrew, and disappointment swirled. So much for having no energy, I thought, amused. Then he shifted, and something hot hit my back. I flinched instinctively, but it didn\u2019t actually burn. The scent told me what it was\u2014coffee. It drizzled down my back, following the line of my spine, until it ran between my legs. The heat was a stark contrast to the coolness of the room, and I shivered in expectation and delight. Then his tongue touched me, swirling across the moisture, lapping it from my skin, following the trail of it down my spine and between my legs.</p><p>Any pretense of zero interest flew out the window there and then.</p><p>He chuckled again and repeated the process, until the moans were thick and constant, and all I wanted was him inside me.</p><p>And that was when the phone rang. I cursed softly, knowing the ringtone, not wanting to answer it but knowing I had to. Uncle Rhoan rarely rang unless it was urgent and it would undoubtedly mean an end to the morning\u2019s delights.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it.\u201d Lucian gripped my hips and lifted me into a doggy position.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I reached for the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s my uncle.\u201d</p><p>Lucian slid his cock through my slickness, teasing but not entering. \u201cI\u2019m sure your uncle would understand. He is, after all, a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t normally ring me. My aunt normally does all the social stuff, so this has to be urgent.\u201d I hit the ANSWER button, but not the vid-screen option. No matter how open werewolves were about sex, I wasn\u2019t inclined to let Rhoan know just what I was up to right now. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucian hadn\u2019t stopped his seduction, so it came out a little more breathless than it should have.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just busy. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Lucian slid fully inside of me and I bit back a gasp of pleasure. He withdrew, then thrust inside again, and then again, his movements becoming faster, more demanding, with every stroke. Pleasure pulsed through me, thick and heavy.</p><p>\u201cWe need to you to come down to the Directorate,\u201d Rhoan was saying. \u201cWe have a major problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is your problem suddenly my problem?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea how my voice came out so even. Lucian\u2019s movements had grown fiercer, his grip on my hips harder, and I responded, pushing back against him, wanting all he could give, as fast as he could give it.</p><p>Then my orgasm hit, and I bit my lip against the scream, trying to hear what Rhoan was saying as Lucian surged within me, coming with such intensity it felt like he was spearing through my entire body.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I somehow said.</p><p>Rhoan growled low, then said, \u201cDamn it, Risa, pay attention. Our killer has contacted us again. But this time, he doesn\u2019t want to gloat. This time, he\u2019s offering a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenge?\u201d I repeated, too lost in the haze of satisfaction to understand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rhoan snapped. \u201cHe offered the chance to save his next victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Except for one thing. He wants you on the case, Ris. And only you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>It took me ten minutes to shower and dress, and another five to catch a tram down to Spencer Street, where the inconspicuous green-glass building that housed the Directorate was located. Given it was rush hour, it was quicker and easier than a car.</p><p>Pale blue light swept my length as I walked into the foyer. It was the only visible indication of the vast array of scanners installed in this place, and they all had one purpose\u2014to protect those within. Not even a gnat could get into the Directorate without security being aware of it, let alone anyone armed with some form of weapon\u2014be it metal, plastic, or laser. Though there wasn\u2019t any sensor in the world capable of detecting Amaya\u2019s presence.</p><p>A different kind of energy shimmered across my skin as I walked toward the security officers. Azriel.</p><p>\u201cSo nice of you to finally join me.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to look his way, yet awareness of him hummed through me.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been awkward had I joined you earlier.\u201d His voice was as even as ever. It was only the anger vibrating through my being that suggested he wasn\u2019t as calm as he appeared.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, unable to resist the urge to needle him. \u201cA threesome can be quite fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not know, nor do I have any intention of ever knowing.\u201d</p><p>Especially when the third is someone I would rather kill. The thought was soft and vehement, and one I suspected I wasn\u2019t meant to hear.</p><p>Which suggested that the link between us was not only getting stronger but beginning to flow both ways. And although it was something I was sure he wouldn\u2019t be happy about, I wasn\u2019t about to complain. Any insight into my reaper\u2019s thoughts\u2014good or bad\u2014was more than welcome, given his general reticence when it came to explanations.</p><p>I stopped at the desk and smiled at security. To Azriel, I silently said, Can they see you?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The blond guy behind the desk leaned back in his chair, his expression courteous. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have an appointment with Rhoan Jenson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to take a seat, I\u2019ll inform him you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I walked over to the square of comfy chairs situated to one side of the foyer and sat, legs crossed. I was still wearing the shift dress, so a decent amount of thigh was revealed. But if Azriel noticed, he gave no indication\u2014either physically or mentally. I squashed the sliver of disappointment and said, \u201cWhy have you been so absent?\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged, the movement casual and eloquent. \u201cI have no wish to be near when you are with the Aedh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted, but what about before that? When I was at the caf\u00e9, and Tao exploded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously had everything under control. I did not see the need to interfere.\u201d</p><p>In other words, he\u2019d been too pissed off to interfere. I sighed. \u201cAzriel, this distancing is not the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it not what you wished for?\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, wondering if he was deliberately being obtuse. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve a problem by ignoring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I try, I will never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there has to be a better way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was sharply said, with an air of finality.</p><p>And it made me suspect there was more to this pull between us\u2014more than just assimilation\u2014that worried him. But, as ever, he didn\u2019t deign to confirm or deny the thought\u2014though I had no doubt he\u2019d heard it.</p><p>Footsteps echoed softly on the highly polished concrete floor. I turned and watched Rhoan approach. His expression was grim as he stopped a couple of feet away. \u201cWe have ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He spun and walked back to the lifts. I hurried to catch him. His tension and anger stung the air and snatched at my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? And why are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>The doors swished shut behind the three of us, and the lift dropped rapidly to the basement levels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry because I hate having to bring you in on a Directorate case, and because Riley is going to kick my ass over it. Not that I have any choice. And what I meant was, we have ten minutes to set you up for your meeting with our killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on\u2014you never mentioned any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t have the time. And I did tell you to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you told me he wanted me on the case, not that he wanted to meet with me again.\u201d My voice was defensive, hinting at anger but also fear. The very last thing I wanted to do was to meet the no-face stranger again.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, he\u2019s offering a challenge.\u201d</p><p>The lift came to a halt and the doors opened. The thick smell of vampire swept in, and my stomach began to knot.</p><p>Rhoan strode from the lift. I followed somewhat reluctantly. \u201cSo why ring to offer a challenge, and then demand to meet me? And where the hell does he want to meet?\u201d</p><p>But even as the question left my lips, I knew. We\u2019d meet on the astral plane again, where the Directorate could employ no traps and he could not be killed.</p><p>Rhoan confirmed what I was thinking, then added, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give us the details, Ris. He wants you, and only you.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my arms and tried to ignore the trepidation that crawled through me. This could only end badly. I didn\u2019t know enough about the astral plane or hunting madmen to avoid the trouble I sensed I was stepping into. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, as if I didn\u2019t have enough on my plate already.</p><p>I followed him silently through the maze of corridors. Though I\u2019d never been down here before now, I\u2019d learned enough over the years to be able to draw a rough floor plan of the place. If the ten levels aboveground were the public face of the Directorate, then the five below were the heart. The majority of the guardians were housed and trained down here, and it was also where the liaisons\u2014the people who made the guardians\u2019 reports legible, who catered to their everyday needs, and who gave them their assignments\u2014operated.</p><p>Rhoan slapped his palm against a scanner, and the door slid open. Three other people were already there, but only two looked up as we entered. The first\u2014a brown-eyed, heavy-jowled woman in her mid-fifties\u2014was a stranger. The second, a tall, dark-haired werewolf with handsome features, was Harris West, who\u2019d been recruited by the Directorate after he\u2019d helped Riley out of a deadly situation; I had met him before.</p> <p>But it was the third man who caught my attention, even though he wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary to look at. He sat at the far end of the table, the bright glow of the com-screen in front of him casting a bluish light across his weatherworn features and bald head.</p><p>I\u2019d never actually met him, but I knew him all the same. This was Jack Parnell, senior vice president of the Directorate and the man in charge of the entire guardian division.</p><p>He was also Madeline Hunter\u2019s half brother, and that made him very, very dangerous, even if he didn\u2019t look it.</p><p>He finally looked up from the com-screen, then leaned back in his chair and studied me. There was little in his expression to give away what he might be thinking, but that was no surprise. He might be a few hundred years younger than his sister\u2014an oddity due to both the long life span of shifters and the fact that they were born at either end of their father\u2019s life\u2014but he was still a vampire and more than a little practiced at controlling himself. I guess with a sister like Hunter, he\u2019d have to be.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d he said, his voice gravelly and holding the slightest hint of warmth. \u201cThank you for coming so promptly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got any other choice, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the sort of comment Riley would make. You\u2019ve been hanging around her and Rhoan too long.\u201d A half smile teased his lips, but it faded quickly as his gaze ran past me. \u201cAnd this is your reaper?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not my anything. He\u2019ll never be my anything. I swallowed the hollow bitterness that accompanied the thought, and simply said, \u201cHis name is Azriel.\u201d</p><p>Jack raised one eyebrow. \u201cAll reapers are called Azriel, are they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Azriel stopped beside me, his energy warm and intoxicating. \u201cAnd you are well enough aware of the reason why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll names have power,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIs that why Risa has you at her beck and call?\u201d</p> <p>I opened my mouth to refute the statement, but again Azriel jumped in before me. \u201cYou know the reasons I am here. Let us not play these games when life hangs in the balance.\u201d</p><p>Again a smile played briefly about Jack\u2019s lips. I glanced questioningly at Azriel, but he merely looked away. Which was frustrating, to say the least.</p><p>Rhoan motioned me to sit, then slid a mug of coffee in front of me. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. Our hunter wants to meet you on the astral field, where he will outline the details of his macabre challenge.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my fingers around the mug, but it didn\u2019t do much to ease the chill from them. \u201cSo no one else can be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Directorate personnel,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut he did say the follower you had on the plane was permissible, as he would not interfere. We need to know who your follower is, and whether you can trust him.\u201d</p><p>Him. Not her, not them. In those bright depths, I saw awareness. He knew who was following me. Knew why.</p><p>But was that so very surprising? Hunter might not want the Directorate overall\u2014and Rhoan and Riley in particular\u2014to know about my dealings with her and the vampire council, but Jack was her brother and the vice president of the Directorate. It was doubtful she\u2019d keep too many secrets from him.</p><p>Although I had to wonder what he thought of her plans to take over the council.</p> <p>\u201cMy follower is someone who currently means me no harm.\u201d I hesitated, then half shrugged.</p><p>Rhoan frowned, his gaze flickering between me and Jack. He knew something was going on. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a ringing endorsement\u2014who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one important.\u201d I took a sip of coffee, then added, \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t the time to discuss this if our killer wants to meet me in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Rhoan\u2019s gaze went to the woman. \u201cElga?\u201d</p><p>She leaned her arms on the table, her gaze narrowing. \u201cYou have not had much experience on the plane, have you?\u201d</p><p>A smile twitched my lips. \u201cYou can tell this by just looking at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a certain energy that radiates from those who travel frequently. How many times has your spirit walked free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the astral plane? Once. But I do walk the gray fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is something, I suppose.\u201d She pursed her lips and didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cWe must go prepare.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cTake her. Harris, monitor all incoming energies and let me know the second there\u2019s any spike. Rhoan, you\u2019ve got the sensors ready?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and rose. I gulped down my coffee, scalding my throat in the process, then followed suit.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Elga murmured, her long skirts swishing as she strode past me.</p><p>I followed her out the door and down the corridor. The room she entered was small and dark, and reminded me somewhat of Adeline\u2019s room, without the thick padding underfoot. But the air was ripe with the scents of lavender and chamomile, and there was a comfortable-looking bed stuck in one corner.</p><p>It was also a room protected by magic. It caressed my skin, a touch that was warm and yet filled with power. It wasn\u2019t as strong or as ancient as the force that protected the Brindle, but it wasn\u2019t something anyone sane would want to mess around with.</p><p>Although I\u2019d hazard a guess that our no-face killer didn\u2019t exactly fall into the sane category.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rhoan said, as he came into the room after me. \u201cStrip off that dress.\u201d</p><p>I did as I was bid, suddenly glad that I\u2019d had the foresight to tuck clean underclothing into my purse before I\u2019d met Lucian. Rhoan carefully stuck seven sensors on me\u2014one at the base of my spine, then the others at the top of my head, middle of my forehead, my throat, near my heart, solar plexus, then the final one below my belly button. The chakra points, I realized. They were monitoring my energy flow, not my vital signs. I glanced around to Elga.</p><p>\u201cWe need to detect incoming energies.\u201d She waved a hand to the bed.</p><p>I walked over and lay down. \u201cAnd if you do detect them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will recall your astral body instantly.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a problem, as this room is well protected. But it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry when we have no idea what\u2014or who\u2014we are dealing with.\u201d</p><p>With that, I could only agree.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she continued, \u201cdo you remember the process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I prefer it to be dark.\u201d</p><p>The lights went off instantly. Though it was pitch-black, Azriel\u2019s eyes seemed to glow, blue stars in a world that was otherwise black. He didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t do anything, and yet, strength surged. He was here, and I was safe.</p><p>But on the astral plane it was a different matter entirely.</p><p>I closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathing, waiting until the sense of peace enveloped me. Then I imagined that cord hanging above me, and reached for it. This time, pulling free seemed faster and easier.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hang about, simply imagined the dark and grimy warehouse area where I\u2019d first confronted the no-face stranger, and suddenly I was there.</p><p>The first person I saw wasn\u2019t our faceless killer but my Cazador follower.</p><p>Fancy meeting you here, I said, my voice dry.</p><p>He bowed slightly, amusement creasing the corners of his brown eyes. You sound about as pleased to be here as I am.</p><p>It\u2019s more accurate to say I\u2019m less than pleased about my reasons for being here. A soft vibration began to stir the air, a sensation that crawled across my skin and made me shiver. I rubbed imaginary arms and added, I gather you\u2019re still on a watching brief?</p><p>Yes. His gaze swept me critically, one warrior sizing up another. Not that I\u2019d ever be half the warrior Aunt Riley was, let alone go up against someone like him. But your energy levels do not seem up to scratch right now, so I will step in if he threatens harm.</p><p>I frowned. Why?</p><p>Because Hunter would not be pleased if you were in any way hurt during this.</p><p>Yeah, because then I wouldn\u2019t be able to do her dirty work. The unpleasant vibration was getting stronger, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I turned and scanned the shadowy environs, glad that at least on the fields you couldn\u2019t actually smell anything. With the heat of the last few days, the rubbish and putrid-looking puddles would have been close to rank.</p><p>The sensations rolling across my skin seemed to reach a peak. Once again both the Du\u0161an and the charm at my neck reacted, the latter burning so fiercely it cast the figure of the man who suddenly appeared into stark relief.</p><p>Fear stirred briefly. There was something very wrong with this man. Yet he wasn\u2019t evil. Just wrong.</p><p>I resisted the urge to retreat and studied him as intently as he seemed to be studying me. He still had no facial features, but lank hair that seemed to merge with the shadows around us covered half his brow, and he was dressed casually in faded jeans and an Adidas sweater. For some reason, that struck me as odd. I hadn\u2019t noticed his hair last time, let alone his clothes, and I suddenly wondered why I was doing so now.</p><p>Was it deliberate on his part? Because he certainly didn\u2019t look comfortable in them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You came. His voice, as before, held little in the way of emotion, and yet I had an odd sense of amusement.</p><p>For the second time that day, I said, It\u2019s not like I had any other choice.</p><p>No, it is not. You, huntress, are the type determined to save. It is your failing.</p> <p>Perhaps. The air continued to roll away from him, washing his darkness across me in fetid waves. I resisted the urge to step back, sensing I couldn\u2019t afford to show any form of weakness to this man.</p><p>If a man he was.</p><p>Right now, I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>If I am the type to save, then what is your type? Because it wasn\u2019t me hunting on these fields, stranger.</p><p>He tilted his head sideways, and I had the sudden impression of a cat contemplating its prey. I was not hunting when you found me. My prey had been well and truly ensnared by the time we arrived here.</p> <p>Why even hunt her in the first place? She was harmless\u2014</p><p>No one who has the darkness within them is ever harmless, he cut in forcefully. The buildings around us shimmered, as if caught in a blast of heated air. She had to die. They all have to die.</p><p>I had a vague suspicion that if he\u2019d had features I\u2019d be seeing the glow of madness in his eyes right now. But why? Because you say so? Or is there an actual reason behind this madness?</p><p>There are always reasons. In this case, they are good ones. But they\u2019re not ones I wish to share just yet.</p><p>Meaning he intended to string me along just like he was the Directorate. So what has any of this got to do with me?</p><p>Ah, he said, and once again his voice was even, without inflection or emotion. It was weird\u2014almost as if he flowed between humanity and not. The speed with which you found dear Dorothy impressed me. I thought it might be interesting if we had a little challenge.</p> <p>What is the point of another challenge if you\u2019re only going to kill your victims anyway?</p><p>What if I were to offer a guarantee that I would not kill my next victims until their allotted time?</p><p>Why would I trust a man who can\u2019t keep his word? A man too scared to reveal his face or share his name?</p><p>Just for a second, the vibration in the air halted, and I had an odd sensation of everything around me freezing\u2014as if the astral plane itself held its breath. Then that moment passed, and the vibrations rolled on, little maggots of energy that crawled across my skin.</p><p>I cannot show what I cannot see. As for my name . . . His voice lowered, forcing me to lean forward a little to hear him.</p><p>But rather than continue, his hand shot out, something I felt rather than saw. I pulled back, Amaya instantly in my hands, an action that was more reflex than any spoken desire on my part. His fingers hit her blade rather than me, and his skin split. Blood flowed, though it was black rather than red. Purple fire leapt from the blade to his hand, and he jumped back, shaking his fingers in an attempt to rid his fingers of flames.</p><p>Amaya, release him.</p><p>Her grumbles filled the back of my mind, but the flames crawled from his flesh and dropped harmlessly to the ground.</p> <p>I swung her lightly back and forth in warning. The stranger\u2019s features followed the movement, even though he had no eyes.</p><p>Do not attempt to do to me what you did to Dorothy, stranger. Amaya still burned with hunger and the need to attack, but her flames failed to lift the shadows around us. Whoever this stranger was, he seemingly had the ability to control how I saw the plane.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds, simply continued to study me as he shook fingers that looked red and blistered. It was a clear indication that you could be harmed on the astral plane, and made me wonder what the hell he\u2019d actually been trying to do.</p><p>But waiting for him to speak made my nerves crawl, so I said, What is this challenge you\u2019re offering?</p><p>It is a race, of sorts.</p><p>Define \u201cof sorts.\u201d</p><p>I had an odd impression that he was smiling, but I didn\u2019t think it was a nice sort of smile. Tomorrow I will send the Directorate a clue to help you find my next victim. You\u2014and you alone\u2014will conduct the search.</p><p>And what will you be doing while I\u2019m trying to save the next victim?</p><p>The sense of cat and prey suddenly sharpened. I shivered, and the buildings around me darkened even more. I swallowed heavily and thrust away the fear, but it didn\u2019t do a whole lot to ease the tense atmosphere.</p><p>What will I be doing? he repeated softly. Well, my dear huntress, what I will be doing is hunting you.</p><p>With that, he disappeared.</p><p>And all I could think was, what the hell was he going to do when he found me?</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I cursed mentally and swung around. Any idea where he went?</p><p>He has left the astral plane. Markel studied me for a moment, then said, It is impressive that your sword works on this plane. Usually, such a weapon would not.</p><p>Amaya is no ordinary weapon.</p><p>To which she practically preened. My sword was gaining a personality. Fabulous. Not.</p><p>Were you able to read his mind?</p><p>He shook his head. Unless there is some form of physical contact between astral bodies, you can\u2019t.</p><p>I frowned. Is that what he was doing when we came across him the first time? Reading Dorothy\u2019s mind?</p><p>I suspect he was doing much more than that, because mind reading usually does not leave a burned imprint.</p><p>I shivered, and the shadows around me trembled in time with the movement. So basically, you got no more from him than I did?</p><p>He half smiled. Cazador or not, on this plane I am just another traveler.</p><p>Somehow, I\u2019m not believing that.</p><p>It was wryly said, and he acknowledged it with an almost regal nod. Perhaps I do oversimplify.</p><p>Perhaps? I seriously doubted there was any \u201cperhaps\u201d about it. I hesitated, then asked, Just how closely do you follow me?</p><p>Again that half smile appeared. It gave his almost stern features a softer edge, but didn\u2019t ease the impression of . . . not menace\u2014not exactly. Perhaps it was more an underlying sense that the urban exterior was little more than a veil concealing a darker, more deadly soul.</p><p>I cannot enter your home, if that is your concern.</p><p>Surprise rippled through me. So the vampire threshold rule applies on the astral plane?</p><p>Yes. He hesitated. I tail you everywhere else, though.</p><p>Everywhere else? I repeated, a little mortified by the thought.</p><p>He cleared his throat, and I had an odd sense that he\u2019d swallowed a laugh. This Cazador did not fit the image I\u2019d created of them. But then, neither did Uncle Quinn. Well, bathrooms are out of bounds, of course. As are boudoirs.</p><p>Oh, thank God.</p><p>This time, he did laugh. It was a somewhat harsh sound, as if he didn\u2019t do it often. You\u2019re an interesting person to talk to, Ms. Jones.</p><p>Thanks. I think.</p><p>He bowed again. You\u2019d best return to your body. The weakness grows in you.</p><p>Odd that he could sense that and I couldn\u2019t. But then, I\u2019d become very good at ignoring my needs of late. Chat with you later, Markel.</p><p>Undoubtedly, he said.</p><p>I closed my eyes and imagined my body, and suddenly I was back there. I gasped at the shock of it and opened my eyes, but I didn\u2019t move, wary of causing a repeat of the sickness that hit me last time.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rhoan said, voice impatient. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her time to regain her full senses,\u201d Elga said crossly. \u201cIn fact, go get her coffee and chocolate. This poor girl needs some fat on her body; otherwise she\u2019s going to be of no use to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a werewolf,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWe\u2019re naturally lean.\u201d</p><p>But when even speaking hurt, I really was in trouble. I closed my eyes and rubbed my forehead somewhat gingerly. There was a low-grade throbbing deep inside my skull, and I knew it was a result of doing too much on too little sleep and food.</p><p>\u201cWerewolves are lean, granted,\u201d Elga commented. \u201cBut you, my dear, are positively scrawny. You obviously need someone to sit you down and make you eat regular meals.\u201d</p><p>Is this one of those occasions where an \u201cI told you so\u201d would be appropriate? came Azriel\u2019s silent thought.</p><p>Probably. But I wouldn\u2019t suggest it because I might get nasty.</p><p>And that is supposed to scare me? The dry amusement in his tone swirled through me, sending warmth fluttering.</p><p>It would scare most men.</p><p>I am not a man.</p><p>True. You, reaper, are frustration personified.</p><p>Not unexpectedly, he made no reply. Rhoan came back carrying a large bottle of Coke and two chocolate-covered protein bars. I carefully hitched myself upright, but the room still spun around me. Elga was right\u2014I couldn\u2019t keep risking the astral plane feeling like this. Not when we were hunting someone who was obviously very familiar with it, and also very dangerous on it.</p><p>Elga frowned. \u201cCoffee would be better\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not coffee that refuels her, but Coke. She was born with the stuff running through her veins, I think.\u201d He squatted beside the bed and handed me the Coke. \u201cI know I\u2019m rushing you, and I\u2019m sorry, but we really do need to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>I took several gulps, felt the delicious fizz work its magic all the way down to my belly, then filled him in on all that had happened.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would he want to play a cat-and-mouse game like this?\u201d He tore open a protein bar and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s actually playing with a full deck, so who really knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever this person is, he\u2019s very adept at covering his tracks and keeping his identity secret\u2014neither of which the insane tend to be.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cCan you tell us anything else about him personally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he had hair this time.\u201d I frowned suddenly. \u201cBut oddly, it didn\u2019t really have any color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There just wasn\u2019t any color. It merged with the shadows, as if it were part of them. It was weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Elga said suddenly, \u201che could be blind.\u201d</p><p>We both turned to look at her. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Rhoan asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he was born blind, then he would have no understanding of color,\u201d she explained. \u201cOf course, the blind can be taught to associate certain levels of heat with specific colors through the use of various colored-light filters, but they will never know colors as the sighted see them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould that explain why he has no features on the plane? Because he\u2019s never actually seen his face?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNot really, because while he may not see it, he can feel it. He would know the shape of his nose, mouth, and face, at the very least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are his features missing on the field? I thought your soul wouldn\u2019t allow such deception.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormally, it doesn\u2019t. However, he may not be concealing it. What he may be doing is changing your perception of what you\u2019re seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means we\u2019re dealing with a very powerful individual indeed.\u201d Rhoan thrust to his feet. \u201cDamn it, Ris, I like that you\u2019re involved in this even less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m any happier?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cTrust me, if I could go home and leave you to it, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just frustration speaking.\u201d He made a sharp motion with his hand. \u201cUntil we get our phone call, there\u2019s not much more we can do. I suggest you go home and catch some rest while you can.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could, but I still had a meeting with Jak to get to. I downed the rest of the Coke, then said, \u201cHe wanted me to chase the leads, not you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get into this place, not even astrally, so he\u2019s not going to know who is doing what straightaway. And if he\u2019s as clever as I think he is, he\u2019ll know we\u2019ll be beside you every step of the way, regardless of what he orders. He simply doesn\u2019t think the Directorate is a threat. That\u2019s evident enough from his taunting phone calls.\u201d</p><p>I finished the last of the protein bars, then licked the chocolate off my fingers and got slowly to my feet. The room did a slow turn, so I pressed my fingers against the wall and said, \u201cHave all his victims so far been women?\u201d</p><p>Rhoan nodded. \u201cDifferent ages, but all women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve nothing in common?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the fact that they\u2019re all vampires, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about their makers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>Meaning Stane\u2019s search for information on Dorothy\u2019s maker would be fruitless, because he wasn\u2019t the connection. Which, in turn, meant there was nothing to even remotely suggest who his next victim might be. Frustrating, to say the least. I pulled off the monitors and got dressed. \u201cYou\u2019ll ring me the minute the phone call comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring the minute we uncover anything useful. You, in the meantime, will get some rest. Promise?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. He grunted, then swung around and offered me his arm. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>He escorted me back upstairs, then dropped a kiss on my cheek, reminded me to ring Riley, and left. I glanced at Azriel as I made my way out to Spencer Street. Though he walked beside me, he kept a careful distance between us. It didn\u2019t erase the awareness that stirred within, or the flow of heat that caressed my skin.</p><p>\u201cHow can the Directorate stop someone from entering that building astrally, and yet none of their devices even reacted to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am not human. All the devices and magic are aimed at catching abnormalities in or on flesh-based rather than energy beings.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo it should have reacted to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, because this body is not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt damn well feels real when I touch you.\u201d And it had certainly felt real when we\u2019d made love. \u201cBesides, you said you can find death in this form, so how can it not be real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bleed, and I can die in this form, true, but my being is energy, not flesh and blood.\u201d He hesitated, frowning a little. \u201cThat place would not react to you, either, if you were in Aedh form. Neither their technology nor their magic is attuned to what you and I are.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously aware of both reapers and Aedh, so why wouldn\u2019t they have some line of defense against either of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause reapers interact with humans only on a soul-collecting basis, and why would anyone want to stop that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Aedh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a long history of ignoring humanity, except when it comes to their own needs\u2014procreation, for instance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no major need for the Directorate to protect themselves against us, and they are well aware of that fact.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Lucian could have followed us into the building, if he\u2019d wished. Though why that particular thought occurred to me I have no idea. And it wasn\u2019t like he could lurk in Aedh form anywhere nearby without Azriel being aware of him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if this person we\u2019re chasing is also not flesh-based?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot be energy, as that would make him either Aedh or reaper. And no reaper can interact with those on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still leaves the possibility of another Aedh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAedh have no need to use magic to transport themselves to and from locations. This killer did.\u201d</p><p>I grunted. I\u2019d forgotten about that. \u201cSo what we need to do is uncover who in Melbourne sells powerful transport charms. It\u2019s something either the Brindle or Jak will know or can find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of Ilianna? And do you not think the Directorate would be already chasing that possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve involved Ilianna in enough dangerous shit already. She doesn\u2019t need this as well.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd the Directorate probably have investigated such an angle, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask the Brindle witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why even bother with Jak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got to meet him anyway, so it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I eyed Azriel for a moment. \u201cHas Jak suddenly become a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just think you risk his well-being needlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only going to ask around about charms, Azriel. I\u2019d hardly call that dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything immediately, but then, he didn\u2019t need to. His disapproval stung the air. \u201cAnd after this meeting, you will rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d If nothing else came up, that was.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because if you do not, I will be forced to make you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it, and I really will get nasty\u2014\u201d But I was speaking to air. He\u2019d disappeared again.</p><p>Even though the bar was crowded with lunchtime patrons, Jak Talbott was easy enough to spot. It wasn\u2019t that he towered above everyone else, because at five ten, he was pretty much the average height for male werewolves. It was more that he exuded a raw masculinity that drew the eye. Or maybe it just seemed that way to me because I still wasn\u2019t entirely over the damn man, no matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise.</p><p>He actually wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call handsome, but his rough-hewn features were easy on the eye and his body was well toned without being too muscular. His hair, like his skin, was a rich black, although there was a lot more silver glinting in the shaggy thickness of it these days. It gave him a genteel edge, which was something Jak would never be able to claim otherwise.</p><p>He leaned back in the chair as I approached, but his smile of greeting faded as his gaze swept me. \u201cDamn it, Ris, you look worse every time I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My voice was dry as I pulled out a chair and sat down opposite him. \u201cYou\u2019re looking swell, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was a warm, carefree sound, and the deep-down part of me that wouldn\u2019t entirely let go of the past, and this man, sighed wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, lack of sleep does that to me,\u201d he said, a little too cheerfully. He obviously had news of some kind that he was excited about. \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. What have you uncovered?\u201d</p><p>His expression was one of resignation, but there was a twinkle in his dark eyes that had my pulse suddenly skipping. Once upon a time that twinkle had signified a sexual onslaught\u2014one I\u2019d always been willingly swept away by. \u201cI thought we\u2019d moved past this whole \u2018business only\u2019 deal with our rather erotic dance and kiss.\u201d</p><p>That rather erotic dance and kiss had actually been shared with Azriel, who\u2019d taken Jak temporarily out of the picture\u2014and taken on his form\u2014to protect him. But because so many people had seen somebody they thought was Jak with me, I\u2019d asked Azriel to supply him with memories of the evening. I just hadn\u2019t expected said memories to be so complete.</p><p>\u201cThen you thought wrong, Jak. As I told you on that night, there\u2019s nothing left between us and there will be no repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing left, huh?\u201d His hand whipped out and snared mine. His grin was devilish as I tried\u2014without success\u2014to pull away. \u201cSo the racing pulse, and the desire that stirs the air, is nothing more than my imagination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more,\u201d I said, and wished it was. Wished the past would just leave me the hell alone. But then, I\u2019d invited it\u2014and him\u2014back into my life, so I had only myself to blame.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I leaned across the table and kissed you,\u201d he said, in a voice so intimate it felt like a caress, \u201cyou would feel nothing more than the press of lips against lips?\u201d</p><p>My gaze dropped to the lips I\u2019d once known so well, and then I closed my eyes, drew back a foot, and kicked him. Hard. He yelped and released me, and I shifted out of immediate reach.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s safe to say that was not the response I was hoping for.\u201d His grin was somewhat rueful as he rubbed his shin. \u201cBut do not think me defeated. If I breached your defenses once, I can do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJak, give it up and just concentrate on business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I love a good challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, almost as much as you love a good story, and that\u2019s what wrecked our relationship in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is undeniably true.\u201d He caught the attention of a passing waitress and ordered a couple of beers. \u201cSo, business. I\u2019ve been asking around about the murders of Frank Logan, his ex, and his secretary, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m getting nowhere fast. No one is talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot surprising, given that everyone who knows anything is ending up dead.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI did discuss Logan\u2019s murder with his partners, but other than sussing out who\u2019s handling his estate, I wasn\u2019t able to get anything helpful, either about Logan or Nadler.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms on the table and leaned forward a little warily. His spicy, woodsmoke scent teased my nostrils, warm and familiar. \u201cJust as well I managed to get something, then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the names of Nadler\u2019s three heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree heirs? He\u2019s making damn sure we can\u2019t easily track him down again.\u201d He contemplated me for a moment, then added, \u201cHow did you manage that feat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Logan\u2019s ghost.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI thought it was your mother who could talk to ghosts, not you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn this plane, yes. I talked to him on the astral plane. He died before his time, so he\u2019s stuck there rather than moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. The things you learn.\u201d He gave the waitress a cheery smile as she arrived with our drinks. When she\u2019d left, he added, \u201cWhat are their names? I take it you\u2019re following them up?\u201d</p><p>I gave him the three names, then said, \u201cWe\u2019ve initiated searches, but haven\u2019t found anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if any of my contacts can tell us anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Also, could you nose around and see if there\u2019s anyone in Melbourne selling transport charms?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cI may not know much about magic, but even I can tell you those things are rare. And expensive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. But someone used one recently, and I want to find out where it came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis related to our quest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen am I allowed to know what it\u2019s related to?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s a Directorate investigation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire drainings.\u201d His voice was grim. \u201cHas to be. Not that we\u2019re allowed to print anything about them, which stinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll ask around, but don\u2019t expect much.\u201d He took a drink, then licked the froth from his lips, the simple movement raising memories of other things he\u2019d done with his tongue. Desire stirred anew, and the heated spark in his eyes grew. But all he said was, \u201cNow, to my news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking we\u2019d have to dance around it some more.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI thought about it, but decided to take pity on you. You really do look like crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I look that way because people keep saying it,\u201d I grouched, and downed half the glass of beer. Which wasn\u2019t a good thing to do on a practically empty stomach, but I was half were and it wasn\u2019t likely to affect me the same way it would a human. I waved a hand at him. \u201cSo, give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I may have discovered where the fake Nadler\u2014if he is indeed our dark sorcerer\u2014has his base of operations on West Street.\u201d</p><p>West Street being the street where Stane was located, and the area Nadler\u2019s consortium had bought up. But before I could say anything, Azriel popped into existence behind Jak and pressed two fingers against his temple. Jak froze instantly, but no one seemed to find this\u2014or a half-naked, sword-bearing reaper\u2014interesting. Azriel was obviously controlling what everyone saw again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I asked in exasperation.</p><p>Azriel raised his eyebrows, though his attention wasn\u2019t really on me, but rather Jak. \u201cGetting the information he holds, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t get it the old-fashioned way?\u201d I said. \u201cYou know, by actually letting him tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that when this is quicker?\u201d His differently colored blue eyes clashed with mine, as distant and matter-of-fact as his expression. \u201cI will be back.\u201d</p><p>Before I could object, he disappeared again. I growled, but stifled the sound as Jak regained life. I said, \u201cSo how did you manage this minor miracle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy keeping my ear to the ground.\u201d He took another sip of beer. \u201cThere\u2019s been some rumblings among the homeless in the area about being forcibly moved on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe consortium has armed security patrolling the warehouses to stop the looters and taggers, so that isn\u2019t really strange.\u201d Especially in this situation, where the abandoned buildings surrounded one of the most powerful ley-line intersections in Melbourne. A sorcerer intent on using it wouldn\u2019t want anyone stumbling upon anything by mistake.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice dry. \u201cBut these particular guards were dogs. Dogs that were big and black, with glowing red eyes.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cHellhounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe in them, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re more than real. Tao and I barely survived an attack from a pair of them.\u201d And if Nadler\u2014or whoever he now was\u2014had hellhounds patrolling the area, then he sure as hell was hiding something big.</p><p>Which might mean our suspicions were correct. The sorcerer had used the power of the intersection to get onto the gray field and open the first of hell\u2019s portals.</p><p>\u201cAnd just when did this event occur?\u201d</p><p>I returned my attention to Jak. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHellhounds. You and Tao. Details, woman, details.\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not important right now.\u201d</p><p>His growl of frustration practically echoed the one I\u2019d stifled. \u201cBut you will fill me in later, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I lightly bit my lip. \u201cDid you uncover an exact location, or was it more general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExact. A warehouse on the corner of West and Reeves.\u201d</p><p>Which was the other end of the street from Stane. Maybe that was why the consortium had left him and the bar\u2014the only two businesses in the area to remain in private hands\u2014alone.</p><p>Azriel reappeared behind Jak. \u201cI cannot access the site, but whatever is within, it is not the intersection itself. It lies farther down the road.\u201d</p><p>Jak jumped and swung around. \u201cFuck it, reaper, you could at least give some kind of warning before you pop into existence like that.\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cHow the hell did you even know about the site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can read any mind he chooses to,\u201d I explained, and switched my gaze to Azriel. \u201cHow come you can\u2019t get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are wards similar to the ones your father once used set around the warehouse. I cannot enter when they are in place.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI wonder if the wards are set to repel all energy beings, or just reapers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell. The magic involved is beyond my understanding.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna would no doubt be able to tell us what it was, but I wasn\u2019t about to ask anything else of her unless it was absolutely necessary. She\u2019d already placed herself in enough danger for this quest of mine. \u201cWe need to get into that warehouse to see what the wards are protecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Jak commented, \u201cbecause you\u2019re not going anywhere without me.\u201d</p><p>I flicked my gaze to him. \u201cHellhounds are not something you want to tangle with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but this is my story, remember, and I\u2019m damned if I\u2019m going to be cut out of it.\u201d</p><p>Do you wish me to tamper with his thoughts and send him home? Azriel asked.</p><p>I hesitated. No. I don\u2019t want to go into that warehouse alone.</p><p>If there are hellhounds, you will be better off calling your uncle. Jak will be of little use\u2014you endanger his life for little reason.</p><p>We can\u2019t keep preventing him from taking risks. It\u2019s neither fair nor right when he\u2019s holding up his end of the deal.</p><p>Doing what is fair and right did not stop you from diverting him last time.</p><p>That was a different situation because the threat was direct and real. Only it was Logan who the killer had been hunting, not Jak, as we\u2019d presumed. Besides, we won\u2019t be heading there unarmed.</p><p>Naturally. Amaya is always with you.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean Amaya. While I had no doubt Amaya could handle hellhounds, I wasn\u2019t about to walk into a possible confrontation with them without some form of backup. In this case, that was holy water.</p><p>I do not think this a wise course of action.</p><p>It isn\u2019t like I have many other choices. I wasn\u2019t going in alone, and if I called Rhoan, he\u2019d cut me out of the investigation completely. Which meant I went either with Jak or with Lucian\u2014and Azriel sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want me going anywhere with him. But your disapproval has been duly noted.</p><p>And ignored, he said, mental tones flat. As you wish.</p><p>He disappeared again\u2014an action that was really starting to piss me off.</p><p>Jak cleared his throat. \u201cWhy do I have this feeling that there\u2019s a whole conversation going on that I know nothing about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there is.\u201d I waved a hand at his beer. \u201cFinish that. We have to go see a witch about some holy water.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna looked up from the magazine she was reading when I walked through the door of our home, but she jumped to her feet when she saw who was behind me, her expression suddenly furious.</p><p>Shit, I thought, as she muttered something under her breath and flicked a hand. I swore again and spun around\u2014just in time to see Jak hit the floor face-first, then go slithering back toward the door. Which was shut. He grunted, then began to curse as his body plastered itself to the metal.</p><p>\u201cIlianna!\u201d I spun back round to face her. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she spat back, her green eyes practically dripping with fury. \u201cI did warn him never to darken our door again or there\u2019d be consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him here. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I, after all the heartache he caused you? Damn it, Ris, he walked away unharmed and unregretful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe, but that was the past. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing? Letting it go and forgiving? I thought you had more sense than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, hello?\u201d Jak said, his voice a little hoarse. \u201cRemember me? Still stuck to the door here, and it\u2019s getting rather uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>I gave her a pointed look, and she sighed. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>She made another flicking motion, and there was a thunk as Jak was released from the door.</p><p>\u201cSo nice of you,\u201d Jak muttered in a dark voice.</p><p>Ilianna snorted again. \u201cTrust me, if it weren\u2019t for the rule that states whatever harm I do to you will be returned to me threefold, I would have done a whole lot worse than try to force you out the door.\u201d</p><p>He climbed slowly to his feet, then rotated his shoulders, as if trying to work out a kink. \u201cLook, I can\u2019t take back the past\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t, even if you could,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have regrets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you regret is not being able to unleash the second part of that damn story because you were under the threat of jail time\u2014or worse\u2014from her uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d I interrupted before things could get more out of hand. \u201cLet it go. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for.\u201d</p><p>Ilianna gave me a somewhat cross look. \u201cI don\u2019t care what he\u2019s here for.\u201d</p> <p>I walked over and caught her hands in mine. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said softly, \u201cfor caring so much. But right now we need all the help we can get, and I\u2019m afraid that means using Jak. Just trust me, okay? I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched mine, concern evident in those rich depths. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p><p>Unease slipped through me. I might have inherited clairvoyant abilities from Mom, but my abilities were nowhere near as reliable as either Mom\u2019s or Ilianna\u2019s. She could predict a sparrow\u2019s fart to the second if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBringing him\u201d\u2014she cast another scathing glance in Jak\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cback into the fold is dangerous, for both the quest and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in my bed, nor ever likely to be.\u201d As for our quest, could it really get any more dangerous? Somehow I doubted it. Yet even as the thought crossed my mind, I had to wonder if I\u2019d just tempted fate. \u201cAnd as far as my love life goes, it\u2019s surely impossible for that to get any worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\u201d She touched a hand to my cheek. \u201cJust be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like I wanted another bout of pain and heartache\u2014though I had a horrible suspicion that was exactly what I was headed for. Only the source wouldn\u2019t be Jak, but rather a stubbornly distant reaper.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She glared at Jak once more. \u201cAnd if you do anything to hurt her again, I will cast a spell so strong that you\u2019ll never even fancy a woman again, let alone get it up.\u201d</p><p>Jak winced and held up his hands. \u201cI promise. I don\u2019t intend to hurt her or write another story about her or anyone else related in any way to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She tossed her hair, her eyes sparkling. A mare enjoying her victory. \u201cNow, tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly water,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Her voice was dry. \u201cBecause it couldn\u2019t be something easy like demon deterrent, now, could it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have demon deterrents on you?\u201d Jak asked, walking a little closer to the lounge.</p><p>Ilianna cast him a look that stopped him in his tracks. \u201cNot on me, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have got them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly water,\u201d I interrupted, in an effort to keep the conversation heading in the right direction. \u201cHave you got any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Given the shit that has happened of late, I thought I\u2019d better keep a good supply at the ready.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHellhounds. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhy are you two tackling hellhounds?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a quick update, then added, \u201cWe need to get into that warehouse and see what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you actually need me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted forcefully. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis, I know magic. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Azriel said the warehouse isn\u2019t on the ley intersection, so until I know for sure that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with, you\u2019re not going anywhere near that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in the intersection to use the power of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be magic there, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been leashed or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the sorcerer has used the intersection to hit the gray fields and open the first gate, it\u2019s been leashed.\u201d She paused, her concern deepening. \u201cAnd if he has leashed the magic, then he\u2019ll have more than hellhounds protecting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly. Which is why I don\u2019t want you in the middle of it until we\u2019re sure what we\u2019re facing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why does he get to go, when he knows jack shit about magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause risking his life means less to me than risking yours.\u201d I flashed him a smile to take the sting out of the words.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he muttered, but there was amusement in his eyes.</p><p>I snorted softly and returned my attention to Ilianna. \u201cI need you to do a couple of other things, too, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s two things I need.\u201d</p><p>Actually, there were three, but one I couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014ask with Jak present. I wasn\u2019t about to give him that much information about the current state of my love life.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d Ilianna said.</p><p>\u201cThe first\u2014can you contact the Brindle and ask if they\u2019ve sensed any dark magic at work on or near the intersection? If he did use it, they\u2019d have to know about it. Maybe they can tell us about either the magic or the man behind it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNot necessarily. It depends what sort of protection circle he\u2019s using. It could be inclusive\u2014keeping the magic and the spells within the circle and undetectable beyond it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely the ley line itself would not be contained so easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll ask. The second task?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cTao\u2019s struggling to pull himself together after the accident in the kitchen yesterday. I was wondering if there was some sort of potion or charm that might help him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhatever I give him would be more illusion than reality. I\u2019ve told you before, there\u2019s no magic beyond time that will help him heal.\u201d</p><p>If he ever does. She might not have said the words, but they nevertheless hung in the air between us.</p><p>\u201cThe illusion of help might be all he needs right now.\u201d</p><p>She slowly nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can brew up.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated again. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze swept me shrewdly. She\u2019d guessed that neither of my requests was what I\u2019d really wanted. But all she said was, \u201cThe minute you sense anything magic related, you ring me. At the very least, I can advise you long distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can agree to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go get something to eat before you collapse on your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do wish people would stop ordering me to eat,\u201d I muttered, but nevertheless headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Ilianna said. \u201cYou seem damn determined to run yourself into the ground lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is an echo of what Azriel said not too long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should listen to him more often.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at her. \u201cHow much is he paying you to say that?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSpeaking of our reaper, where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSulking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to the poor man?\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cHe\u2019s neither a man nor poor, and you should be on my side, not his.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, amusement tugging at her lips as she headed for her bedroom. I opened the fridge to study the contents, then decided on lamb sandwiches.</p><p>I glanced up at Jak. \u201cYou want a sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He propped his butt up on the counter. \u201cWhat sort of accident did Tao have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your damn business.\u201d I slapped thick slices of lamb between slices of bread and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He bit into his sandwich, then added, \u201cSo what is going on between you and Azriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019s a reaper.\u201d I squashed my sandwich down with a little more force than necessary. \u201cThey don\u2019t do love or life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich, interestingly enough, does not preclude them doing sex.\u201d</p><p>I pointed the knife at him. \u201cDrop it. Now.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and held up his hands again. \u201cA little too close to the mark, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore wide of the mark, and still none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, Ilianna chose to call me into her bedroom at that moment. It was a cool green and normally very calming, but it didn\u2019t do a lot to ease the tension suddenly coursing through me. She closed the door, then crossed her arms and said, \u201cOut with it.\u201d</p><p>I plopped down on the edge of her enormous bed. \u201cIs it possible that some sort of attraction spell has been placed on me?\u201d</p><p>Surprised flitted across her features. Whatever question she\u2019d been expecting, that obviously hadn\u2019t been it. \u201cWhy on earth would you think something like that has happened?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause it would explain my unrelenting need to be sexual with Lucian whenever I\u2019m with him.\u201d</p><p>The surprise gave way to amusement. \u201cWhy does a spell have to be involved? I mean, he\u2019s a hot and sensual man and you\u2019re a werewolf\u2014unrelenting need comes with that sort of combination, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I was shaking my head before she\u2019d finished. \u201cThis is something else. It\u2019s almost a compulsion. It takes a huge amount of effort to say no to the man, and I\u2019ve never been like that with anyone before now, werewolf heritage or not.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned and walked across to me. She raised her hands and skimmed either side of my body, not touching me but close enough that I could feel the sudden tingle of energy flowing from her fingertips. Reading my aura.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cI can\u2019t sense any obvious spell, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t one on you. It could be a geas of some kind, which tends to be subtler and harder to trace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I thrust a hand through my hair. \u201cHave you got anything that might be able to counter such magic?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then went over to the huge, walk-in floor-to-ceiling cupboard that housed all her magical bits and pieces. She opened one side, revealing shelves stocked with all sorts of bottles, herbs, various tools, and other stuff I had no idea about, and fished around for several minutes. Eventually she returned with what looked like a thin rope bracelet entwined with dead leaves.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t strong enough to totally counteract any spell or geas, but it will mute the force of it and allow clearheaded thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is all I really need.\u201d Sex with Lucian might be extraordinary, but I sure as hell still wanted the option of saying no occasionally.</p><p>She slipped the bracelet over my left hand, but as it settled on my wrist, the Du\u0161an came to life, its head whipping around as if to study the intruder. Its tail lifted from my skin, curled around the bracelet, then returned to my flesh. And the bracelet went with it, prickling and itching as it leached into my skin. After a few seconds, it was little more than a leafed tattoo that encircled my wrist, one that was entwined by the Du\u0161an\u2019s serpent-like tail.</p><p>My gaze shot to Ilianna. \u201cWas that supposed to happen?\u201d</p><p>Ilianna\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel?\u201d</p><p>He appeared and I shoved my hand at him. \u201cAny ideas about this?\u201d</p> <p>He studied my newest tattoo with a frown. \u201cUnfortunately, I do not know enough about the magic that created the Du\u0161ans, let alone understand what they are fully capable of. I had thought they were unable to be active on this plane, but that is patently untrue when it comes to the one that resides in your flesh.\u201d His gaze met mine. His expression was flat, giving little away, and yet I felt the turmoil in him. He was fiercely glad that this had happened, and just as annoyed by the strength of that reaction. \u201cThis is not a bad thing, though.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, though I suspected his reasons for thinking that stemmed more from a hope that I\u2019d now stay totally away from Lucian rather than merely being less compelled in his presence.</p><p>Ilianna tentatively touched the tattoo. \u201cThe magic is still alive within it. Amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope that if there is a compulsion, it works, because it looks like I\u2019m stuck with it.\u201d</p><p>But if there was a geas, and this bracelet did work, did that in any way imply that Lucian had meant me harm?</p><p>He\u2019d made no secret of his desire for revenge, and definitely no secret of the fact that he would do anything\u2014use anyone\u2014to get it. Having a geas placed on me might be nothing more than his way of ensuring a continuing supply of the information he needed to hunt down the Raziq, especially since the only time he could fully read my mind was when we had sex.</p><p>Or was I simply trying to excuse the behavior of someone I liked, geas or not?</p><p>There was no easy answer to that one\u2014or at least not one I wanted to confront right now\u2014so I pulled the sleeve over the tattoo and said, \u201cHoly water?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Azriel stepped to one side as Ilianna returned to her cupboard. She came back a few minutes later carrying a purple satchel and a knife. \u201cThere\u2019s six bottles in here. If you need any more than that, you get the hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she said grimly, \u201cis for Jak. And no, I\u2019m not going to stab him, as much as I might want to.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, slung the satchel over my shoulder, and led the way back to the kitchen. Azriel made himself scarce again, although the heat that caressed my spine suggested he hadn\u2019t gone far.</p><p>Ilianna handed Jak the sheathed knife and said, \u201cThis is for you, though you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He took the knife tentatively. \u201cI\u2019m not much into weapons, you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling hellhounds, you\u2019d better be,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just a knife\u2014it\u2019s a blessed knife. It\u2019ll work when other weapons don\u2019t, so use it. I don\u2019t want Risa hurt protecting your useless ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the concern,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I restrained my smile and glanced at Ilianna. \u201cAre you and Mirri still having dinner with your parents tonight?\u201d</p><p>Mirri was Ilianna\u2019s girlfriend, though like many mares she was bisexual rather than just a lesbian like Ilianna. She was also very open about her sexuality, whereas Ilianna kept hers a closely guarded secret\u2014at least where her parents were concerned. She and Mirri had been in a steady relationship for a while now, but it was only very recently that Ilianna had acceded to Mirri\u2019s requests to meet her parents\u2014as friends, nothing more.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cYes. And Carwyn will be there.\u201d</p><p>Carwyn was the stallion her parents were trying to set her up with. According to Mirri, he was rather hot\u2014in bed and out\u2014but given Ilianna\u2019s preferences, she was either going to have to be honest with her parents or get stuck in a situation that could only end badly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, well aware that Jak was rather avidly listening in. Once a newshound, always a newshound. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to need it.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cJust make sure you ring me if you find magic.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then picked up my sandwiches and headed out. Jak followed so close on my heels that his breath washed the back of my neck. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou can drive,\u201d I said, as the front door slammed behind us.</p><p>\u201cColor me shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I was thinking you didn\u2019t trust me to keep my hands to myself when you were in the same vehicle as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Which is why you\u2019re driving.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly, but opened the passenger door of his red Honda Accord, ushering me in before running around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take us long to get to West Street. We cruised slowly past the warehouse, then turned into Reeves Street. Halfway down the block, we stopped and I climbed out of the car, then leaned against it, my gaze sweeping the building. It was one of those old two-story, redbrick places that had become so popular with inner-city renovators. The iron roof was rusted and covered in bird shit, and the regularly spaced windows were small and protected by bars as rusted as the roof. But considering its age, it still seemed surprisingly solid. Like many of the other buildings in the area, it had walls littered with graffiti and tags, and rubbish lay in drifting piles along its length. It looked and felt abandoned.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Though there was no sign of guards or movement, there was an odd, almost watchful stillness about the place. In fact, the whole area was unnervingly quiet. Even the sound of traffic traveling along nearby Smith Street seemed muted.</p><p>Azriel reappeared, but the heat of his presence did little to chase the growing chill from my body. \u201cI can sense no human life inside.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept the building again. It was waiting. Ready. Trepidation shivered through me, and I rubbed my arms. \u201cWhat about unlife? Or hellhound-type life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing in there other than vermin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why does it feel like a predator is about to pounce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jak said, from the other side of the car, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to find out what\u2019s going on by standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hesitated and glanced at Azriel. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wards are set just within the building walls. Destroy them, and I can enter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do that, whoever set them will likely feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He half raised a hand and, just for a moment, he leaned closer, as if to kiss me. Then he stepped back. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d I muttered, then spun and walked away.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Jak\u2019s voice was conversational as he fell in step beside me. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing going on with that reaper and you, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drop it, Jak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. I ignored him and kept walking. There were no doors on this side of the building, and all the bars\u2014despite their rusted appearance\u2014were solid. But there were two entrances on West Street\u2014one of them heavily padlocked and apparently leading into an old office area, and the other a roller door over what once must have been a loading bay. The door itself was battered and coated with grime, and the bottom edge had been torn away from the guides. Obviously, this was where the homeless had been getting in.</p><p>I took a long, slow breath that didn\u2019t ease the tension knotting my stomach, then squatted and squeezed through the gap.</p><p>The room beyond the roller door was still and quiet. I shifted to one side so Jak could enter, and studied the immediate area. A platform ran around three sides of the dock, and there were stairs down at the far end that led up to it. I could neither see nor smell anything or anyone out of the ordinary, and yet there was something here. Something that crawled along the edges of that other part of me\u2014the bit that saw the reapers and was sensitive to the feel of magic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jak hunkered down beside me. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>His voice was little more than a whisper. Maybe he felt the closeness of something, too. Azriel? Can you hear me? There was no response. Obviously, the magic was broader than he\u2019d suspected. I shook my head and said, \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust rats and rubbish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I pulled the satchel around and gave him a couple of Ilianna\u2019s little blue bottles. \u201cPut these in your pocket. If there are hellhounds here, pop the cork and use the water. It\u2019ll deter them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo holy water really does work?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cYou investigate paranormal events and happenings, and you don\u2019t know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReporters are natural skeptics. Until I see it, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen ley lines or the gates to heaven and hell, yet you believe in those.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows in amusement. \u201cNo, I believe you believe. I\u2019m still holding out for proof.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cYou may regret that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I usually do. It never stops me, though.\u201d</p><p>A truer sentence had never been uttered. I rose and padded forward, still drawing in the scents around us, trying to find some hint of the magic I sensed was here. It might not be related to the ley line, but something was definitely going on in this place.</p><p>We followed the loading bay to its end, then carefully went up the steps and headed to the left. Several doors lay ahead. I paused and glanced questioningly at Jak. He hesitated, then pointed to the one in the middle. It was as good as any, I supposed.</p><p>I reached for the handle and felt the shimmer of . . . not energy, something else. Something darker. I said, \u201cBe ready. Whatever is going on, I think it\u2019s happening on the other side of that door.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, his expression a mix of excitement and wariness as he drew Ilianna\u2019s knife. I hoped like hell he\u2019d use it if we got into trouble.</p><p>I took a deep breath, released it slowly, then opened the door. The room behind it was deep and dark, and the air still. The sensation that had briefly caressed the door handle wasn\u2019t evident in the room itself, yet my uneasiness increased, and I wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>I took one step into the room. The flooring was wood rather than concrete, which seemed odd. I paused, waiting.</p><p>Nothing happened. No one and nothing jumped out at us.</p><p>I took another step. Still nothing. Yet tension continued to crawl across my skin, and the feeling that something watched\u2014waited\u2014was growing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t smell anyone or anything unusual.\u201d Jak stopped beside me. His words seemed to jar uneasily against the still blackness of the room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d I took another step.</p><p>It was one step too many.</p> <p>With very little warning, the floor collapsed and we fell into deeper darkness.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Wood and dust rained around us as the blackness swallowed us whole. There was no light, no stirring of air, no sound except the harsh rasp of our breathing.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, I hit the dirt feetfirst and stumbled forward a couple of steps before falling on my face. Pain shot up my legs, then raged through the rest of me, until even the mere act of breathing hurt.</p><p>Jak landed with a grunt and slightly more balance, ending up on his knees rather than his face\u2014a fact I knew simply because the sharp rasp of his breathing was close but not ground-close.</p><p>For several seconds neither of us moved. My breath was caught somewhere in the middle of my throat, and tension wound through my limbs as I waited for the axe to fall.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jak asked eventually. Dirt stirred, and then his hand caught mine. I gripped it gratefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>He helped me to a sitting position. \u201cWinded, but okay. Can\u2019t see a goddamn thing, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I dusted my hands, then reached back and drew Amaya from her shadowy sheath. Flames flared along her blade and spread across the darkness in lilac waves.</p><p>\u201cAnd where the fuck did that come from?\u201d Jak asked.</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>My gaze swept our cage. The pit was about ten feet square, and smelled of earth and age. I squinted up. Even if I stood on Jak\u2019s shoulders and jumped, I wouldn\u2019t be able to catch the edge and haul myself out. And I doubted I\u2019d be able to take my energy form. If the magic in this place prevented Azriel from entering, it was a fair bet it would also prevent me from changing into Aedh.</p><p>It was also a wonder both of us had come through the fall relatively unscathed. But then, I guess werewolf bones were stronger than human ones, even in those of us who couldn\u2019t actually shape-shift.</p><p>But our going through the floor was no accident\u2014the concrete slab had been neatly cut, as had the timber that had covered this hole. It had held only long enough to catch the two of us.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a traditional sword,\u201d he murmured, and reached out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d I said at the same time that Amaya hissed and spat tendrils of fire at his fingertips.</p><p>He quickly withdrew. \u201cShit, that thing is alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive and aware.\u201d</p><p>His gaze jumped to mine. \u201cHow the hell is something like that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014not in this world, anyway. She was born on the gray fields\u2014forged in the death of a demon\u2014and she has a life and a mind of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you control her?\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cOnly sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my dear Risa, are becoming more and more interesting.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly and pushed to my feet. \u201cRemember Ilianna\u2019s threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I am.\u201d He rose with a wince and rubbed his left knee. \u201cHow the hell are we going to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I used Amaya\u2019s flames to inspect the walls more closely. The earth looked hard-packed and solid. I didn\u2019t fancy our chances of digging ourselves out.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t fancy waiting around for the creator of this pit to arrive, either.</p><p>Not, Amaya said.</p><p>I frowned. Not what?</p><p>Solid. Not.</p><p>My gaze swept the walls again. They look it.</p><p>Not. Left go.</p><p>I walked to the wall on my immediate left. Amaya flared, sparking brightly off the quartz in the dirt. I don\u2019t see\u2014</p><p>Magic. Touch.</p><p>I carefully extended the tip of her blade and touched the wall. Only she didn\u2019t hit it. She went through it.</p><p>The wall was fake.</p><p>I reached out and ran my hand across it. Grit and rock brushed my fingertips. I pressed harder. The wall resisted briefly, then, with a slight sucking sound, my hand went through. Cold damp air caressed my fingertips.</p><p>I withdrew, then repeated the procedure a few feet on either side. Real wall, not magic-enhanced wall. The doorway was a foot or so wide. Enough for a human to squeeze out sideways.</p><p>Or a hellhound to get in.</p><p>I swallowed heavily and looked around at Jak. \u201cThere\u2019s a concealed exit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t fancy staying here, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your knife handy.\u201d I went through sword first. It felt like I was walking through molasses\u2014the magic creating the illusion was thick and syrupy, and clung like tendrils to my body, resisting my movements and then releasing me with an odd sucking sound. I shuddered, my skin crawling with horror. Whatever\u2014whoever\u2014had made that wall was not into white magic.</p><p>I forced my hand back through the wall. Jak\u2019s fingers entwined with mine, and he came through as I had\u2014shuddering.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s revolting,\u201d he muttered, shaking himself like a dog trying to rid his coat of excess water. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I raised Amaya again. We were in a tunnel of some kind, and it was a tight fit\u2014there was only an inch or two between my shoulders and the walls. Jak was forced not only to stand sideways but to keep his knees bent as well.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be a good place to be caught in. There was no room to fight.</p><p>I looked to the left, then the right, but couldn\u2019t see much in either direction\u2014just the tunnel sweeping away into darkness. But as my gaze moved back to the left, the odd sense of unease increased. Something was down there. Something bad.</p><p>I shivered, then glanced up at Jak. \u201cDoes your nose tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t smell much more than age and dirt.\u201d He hesitated, then glanced past me to the right. \u201cIt smells a bit fresher down that direction, though.\u201d</p><p>It did? I studied the lilac-lit shadows dubiously, then glanced to the left again. There wasn\u2019t a chance I was heading down there, so that left only Jak\u2019s choice.</p><p>With Amaya\u2019s fire lighting the way, we crept forward. The tunnel continued to narrow, until the bits of rock and debris in the soil were tearing into my shoulders and the scent of blood stung the air.</p><p>If there were hellhounds ahead, it would call to them.</p><p>I swallowed heavily and tightened my grip on Amaya. Her hissing ramped up, and I didn\u2019t know whether she was reacting to something I\u2019d yet to see, or merely echoing my tension. I hoped it was the latter, but I had a horrible suspicion it was the former.</p><p>At least I was better off than Jak\u2014even as awkwardly bent over as he was, he kept hitting his head against the roof.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said eventually, \u201cI really think we need to turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s something down the other end of this tunnel\u2014\u201d I yelped as a particularly sharp rock sliced into my arm.</p><p>\u201cAt this rate,\u201d he muttered, \u201cwe\u2019ll bleed to death before we ever reach an exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather bleed than chance whatever is at the other end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be any worse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\u201d</p><p>The words were barely out of my mouth when I burst out of the tunnel like a cork being popped from a champagne bottle. I stumbled to gain my balance and took a quick look around, once again using Amaya for illumination. No hellhounds, nothing that appeared immediately dangerous\u2014just two innocuous-looking stones that stood like petrified soldiers in the middle of a cavern. Which didn\u2019t mean we were out of trouble, but wherever the hell we were, it had to be better than the tunnel. Jak all but exploded out of it three seconds later and came to a halt beside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck me!\u201d he said vehemently. He swept the sweaty strands of hair from his forehead with hands as bloody as mine and looked around. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. And not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you of those words the next time we make out\u2014\u201d Jak stopped, and his eyes widened. \u201cWhat the hell are those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>It was somewhat absently said as I studied the two pillars. They were about six feet tall and stood the width of a body apart from each other, so that they formed an odd sort of doorway that seemed to go nowhere. Though they were mostly gray in color, their surface was littered with quartz that Amaya\u2019s flames sparked to life, sending rainbow-colored flurries skating across the earthen walls. There were markings and weird symbols etched into each pillar, but it was no language I\u2019d ever seen, and it felt ancient. No, not just ancient\u2014powerful.</p><p>I stepped forward cautiously. Energy caressed my skin, similar to the magic I\u2019d felt briefly when I touched the door handle. I swept Amaya\u2019s light across the floor. While it was mainly dirt, there was a series of wide, flat stones that formed a circle around the pillars. While there was no quartz within these stones for Amaya\u2019s flames to catch, there was writing. This time I recognized the language, even if I didn\u2019t entirely understand the spell. They were runes, meaning the stones were some sort of protection circle.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s a gateway of some kind?\u201d Jak said.</p><p>\u201cOf some kind.\u201d I walked around the pillars, making sure to keep close to the walls and well away from the runes. \u201cBe careful where you step, Jak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI may be a skeptic when it comes to many things magic, but even I can sense the wrongness in whatever is written on those stones.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s precisely what it was. A wrongness. The magic in this place wasn\u2019t dark, it wasn\u2019t evil\u2014it was just wrong.</p><p>Like the man without a face, I thought absently, though it was doubtful they were in any way connected.</p><p>Each rune in the circle was a little bit different from its neighbor, except at the north and south points, where a set of six identical ones appeared. Exit and entry points, perhaps?</p><p>I stopped when I reached the tunnel entrance again and studied the walls themselves. There appeared to be another exit to the left, but on closer inspection, it proved to be little more than a niche. Whoever had built this place obviously used it for storage, because it was filled with an odd assortment of things\u2014including a shovel, a crowbar, a hammer, and various-sized jars of nails. The sort of stuff you\u2019d need if you wanted to repair a floor or bury a body.</p><p>I shivered, and hoped like hell we got out of this damn hole long before we had to worry about either of those things.</p> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Jak crossed his arms and stared at the pillars thoughtfully. \u201cDo we attempt to breach the magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, we use our \u2018ring a friend\u2019 option.\u201d I dug the phone out of my pocket, hit the vid-button, then called Ilianna.</p><p>\u201cYou found something?\u201d she said by way of hello.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I need you to tell me what it is. Hang on and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d I turned the phone around and did a slow sweep of the cavern.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s some heavy-duty magic they have happening there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what sort of magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what the script on the pillars is, but it\u2019s obviously some form of gateway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo heaven, hell, or somewhere in between?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d guess in between, if that\u2019s where earth falls in that little list.\u201d</p><p>I supposed that was something. At the very least, it meant we didn\u2019t have the immediate worry of hellhounds making a sudden appearance. I walked around to the north point. \u201cDoes this signify an exit or entrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pattern the stones are placed in suggest exit. The entrance should be the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can identical rocks form a pattern?\u201d I walked around to the other side.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not identical to the trained eye.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the phone down so she could see the stones, and she added, \u201cYep, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is there anything in these runes that would stop Jak and me leaving via this gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the fact that it would be sheer stupidity, you mean?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cYeah, other than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Ris\u2014\u201d Jak said.</p><p>I made a \u201cquiet\u201d motion with my hand as Ilianna said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThe runes shouldn\u2019t offer a problem, but as I said, I can\u2019t read the script on the pillars so I really have no idea just what might happen or even how to activate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis\u2014\u201d Jak intervened again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, looking up in exasperation.</p><p>He waved a hand at the pillars. Light shimmered between them, as if it were a mirror catching the first sickly rays of the day.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d I said. \u201cThe pillars just activated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get the hell out of there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove to, but we\u2019re stuck underground in a fucking cavern. Call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t. I turned the phone off and met Jak\u2019s gaze grimly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back into that tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too tight for any sort of speed. Niche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiche,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd let\u2019s hope whoever\u2014or whatever\u2014is coming through that gate has neither good sight nor a strong sense of smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that,\u201d Jak muttered, and lunged for the niche.</p><p>I squeezed in beside him, and watched as light continued to pulse and swirl between the pillars. Its color was a sickly green\u2014the same color that now glowed within the runes. Amaya screamed, a battle cry that was audible both in my head and in the cavern.</p><p>Fuck, flame out and be quiet, I ordered fiercely.</p><p>No. Fight what comes.</p><p>Not yet. Flame out, Amaya.</p><p>Should fight. It was all but a snarl, but her light died. I wished I could say the same about her fierce screaming, but at least it was only inside my head.</p><p>The sickly light of the pillars spread tendrils across the darkness, lifting the shadows in some sections of the cavern but casting others into deeper darkness. Our niche fell between the two. Whatever was coming through that gateway had only to glance our way and we were gone.</p><p>Then, suddenly, the light stopped pulsing and a shadow stepped through. It was a man\u2014a tall man, with broad shoulders and dark hair. As he strode toward the exit, the light between the pillars died, leaving only the sickly glow of the runes to lift the sudden darkness. It wasn\u2019t enough, and the stranger became little more than a shadow, hinted at but not fully fleshed out.</p><p>He paused at the north point of the circle and waved his hand over them. The light in the six runes died and he strode toward the tunnel, quickly disappearing. Oddly enough, though he\u2019d appeared taller than Jak when he\u2019d first come into view, I had no sense that he was in any way restricted by the tight confines of the tunnel. Maybe it was just the weird light that had made him seem taller.</p><p>As the sounds of his steps faded, Jak bent closer, his breath warm against my left ear as he murmured, \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he came through those pillars, why can\u2019t we use them to exit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll sense the magic kicking in and will either give chase or send something after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither option is better than getting caught in this damn niche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when we have no idea if the pillars are both exit and entry. For all I know, the exit point here is nothing more than a ruse. It could be what I sensed down at the other end of the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ilianna said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she didn\u2019t understand the entire spell. It won\u2019t hurt to wait, Jak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just might if that man comes back and sees us,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust because I have a knife doesn\u2019t mean I can use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing I can use the sword, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I all but snapped.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d His free hand slipped down my back and came to rest on my butt. \u201cYou have no idea how exciting I find that.\u201d</p><p>Actually I did, given how close we were standing. But then, he was a werewolf, and danger was an aphrodisiac to most wolves, even if they didn\u2019t actively seek it out. I grabbed his hand and shoved it away. \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly, but otherwise did as bid. I flared my nostrils and sifted through surrounding scents, trying to get some idea of the man who\u2019d come through the gate. But no matter how hard I tried, I could neither smell nor hear him. Maybe there was an exit at the other end of the tunnel. Maybe he\u2019d done little more than check what his trap had caught and then moved on-</p><p>A gruff voice cut the thought short. \u201cLook, I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to tell just how close he was because his words seemed to echo in the still blackness. One thing was sure\u2014his voice was unfamiliar, and that was something of a relief. I\u2019d half expected otherwise\u2014that it would, somehow, be Lucian. Azriel\u2019s distrust had a lot to answer for.</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently vermin can set the trap off,\u201d the stranger said. Despite the hint of exasperation, there was a deeper edge of wariness enriching his voice. He feared the person he spoke to. \u201cAs I said, there\u2019s no one in the hole.\u201d</p><p>He was definitely closer now, and tension wound through my limbs. I licked my lips, and once again tightened my grip on Amaya. Her screaming ratcheted up several notches, but at least she was restrained enough to keep it internal\u2014although that didn\u2019t help the ache in my head any.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve released them.\u201d The stranger paused. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll head up now and move any cars that might be hanging about, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jak muttered. \u201cIf he damages\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stamped on his foot, hard. He hissed, but otherwise fell silent.</p><p>The stranger reappeared. He made a motion with his left hand, and the sickly glow reappeared in the runes. It wasn\u2019t strong enough to light the niche, but it did throw off just enough to make him a little more visible. He was about my height, with thick shoulders, muscular arms, and tree-trunk legs. He reminded me somewhat of a wrestler, but he was extraordinarily light on his feet. He passed close by our niche, but didn\u2019t see or smell us\u2014he was human, not shifter or were, and for that I was suddenly grateful.</p><p>But as he passed, I noted the tats on his shoulders\u2014one of a dragon with two swords crossed above it and the other a ring of barbed wire.</p> <p>I\u2019d seen both a number of times over the last few months. The dragon and swords meant he was a Razan, and while I wasn\u2019t sure what the barbed wire tat represented, I\u2019d seen it on the man who\u2019d arranged the delivery of the Du\u0161an that now resided on my left arm, as well as on one of the men who\u2019d killed Logan\u2019s secretary. How the two were connected I had no idea, because while we suspected that my father was responsible for the Du\u0161an, there was no logical connection between him and the murder of Logan and his secretary. In fact, we were pretty sure the person responsible for those was the man who\u2019d been impersonating Nadler.</p><p>Which meant we really needed to question this man.</p><p>The stranger strode on, the light in the six runes dying as he approached. As it did, the pillars came to life again.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>I motioned Jak to stay put, then carefully squeezed out of the niche and padded silently forward, flipping Amaya around to hold her by the blade rather than the hilt as I did so. I suspected\u2014given her generally shitty mood\u2014that if I used her blade she might take matters into her own hand and kill our quarry rather than just knock him out.</p> <p>I raised the sword, but he suddenly dropped and turned, and Amaya whooshed harmlessly over his head. He surged upright, but I spun and kicked him hard in the gut. He flew backward, hit the wall with a loud crack, and slithered to the floor. I flipped Amaya, holding her hilt once more, but the Razan didn\u2019t get up. After another moment or two, I stepped forward and pressed two fingers against his neck. His pulse was steady and strong, so I hadn\u2019t done much more than knock him out.</p><p>\u201cNow what do we do with him?\u201d Jak came out of the niche and stopped beside me.</p><p>\u201cWe find out who he is and who he was talking to.\u201d</p><p>I knelt beside the Razan and went through his pockets. I found the phone and tossed that to Jak, then continued the search until I found his wallet.</p><p>\u201cAccording to his license,\u201d I said, \u201chis name is Henry Mack, and he lives in Broadmeadows.\u201d</p><p>Jak grunted. \u201cThe phone is locked. Any ideas?\u201d</p> <p>My gaze went to his birth date on his license. It was a long shot, but a lot of people used such things for passwords. \u201cTry one-four-oh-four.\u201d</p><p>He did so, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cReverse it.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the appropriate buttons. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I gave him the year; then, when that also proved a bust, glanced at our last hope\u2014the post code\u2014and said, \u201cThree-oh-four-seven, either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo to the latter.\u201d</p><p>I placed his license on the stone near his hand, then pulled out the other cards. There were four credit cards\u2014two in the name of Henry Mack, and two in the name of Jason Marks\u2014a transit card, and various receipts from shops. Mainly for clothes and grocery items, although interestingly, there was a small receipt from a place called Esoteric Supplies, which I knew from Ilianna was one of the main suppliers of wiccan items in Melbourne.</p><p>There was little else in the wallet except cash, so I placed the remaining cards on the stone, took a photo of both them and our stranger, and shot both off to Stane with a quick note to see what he could uncover.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Jak, \u201che\u2019s only got a couple of numbers in his address book, and his last call came from a blocked number. I don\u2019t suppose we can take the risk and call it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let whoever is behind this know we have his Razan? Not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Jak flicked through other screens. \u201cThey\u2019re going to know something went on, anyway. I mean, you knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I hesitated, awareness suddenly prickling across my senses.</p><p>And suddenly remembered the Razan\u2019s last words. Yes, I\u2019ve released them.</p><p>I spun around. The stones\u2019 circle was complete again, and its fading glow did little to light the immediate darkness. The pillars had fallen completely silent. There was no escape that way\u2014not unless we could get the gate open again.</p><p>A low growl reverberated around the darkness, raising the hackles along the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Jak\u2019s voice was filled with trepidation as he studied the tunnel behind us.</p><p>\u201cThat\u201d\u2014I grabbed his hand and dragged him toward the northern end of the stones\u2014\u201cis a hellhound. We need to get out of here\u2014fast!\u201d</p><p>We reached the northern entrance and stopped. The runes didn\u2019t react to our presence. They just continued to glow that same sickly color.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Jak\u2019s voice was grim and there was fear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the gesture the Razan had made when he\u2019d reentered the cavern, and repeated it as best I could. Nothing happened. The runes continued to glow ominously.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>The air began to stir, became a thick scent of malevolence. They were coming.</p><p>I grabbed one of the bottles from Ilianna\u2019s satchel and popped the cork. It flew toward the still-glowing runes but never made it across them. There was a sharp report, a flash of fire, and the cork was little more than cinders falling harmlessly to the stone floor.</p><p>That would be us if we weren\u2019t very careful.</p><p>The smell of death, decay, and ash began to fill the air. I licked dry lips and looked around wildly. There was no decent place to stand and fight. Our best bet was to try to keep them in the tunnel.</p><p>And the only way to do that was to use the holy water as some sort of barrier.</p><p>But I\u2019d barely taken two steps when evil flowed into the room. The creatures were big, bigger than the ones I\u2019d seen previously, their large heads held low and their red eyes glowing brightly in the shadowed darkness. Thick yellow teeth gleamed eerily as the pair of them snarled. The sound echoed like a death knell.</p><p>I flung the water at them.</p><p>It flew across the air like a silver ribbon, hitting the first one on the snout and splashing across the coat of the other, sizzling and bubbling where it struck.</p><p>The first hound twisted and howled as its face began to disintegrate. Flesh dropped from its cheeks in chunks, until all that was left was bone. Soon that began to crack and shatter, until nothing remained of that half of its face.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t die. It was disfigured, but still very much alive.</p><p>It would be just my luck to get a stronger breed of hellhound this time around.</p><p>And then I remembered that Azriel had killed the hounds with his sword when they\u2019d been distracted by the burning water.</p><p>I had no choice but to do this the hard way.</p><p>I switched Amaya to one hand and carefully reached for more holy water. Her kill, kill, kill chant was fierce and rapid, matching the pounding of my heart.</p><p>\u201cJak?\u201d My voice was little more than a murmur, as I had no idea just what would set these creatures into motion. Right now, they didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything more than watching us, but I doubted that would last. I suspected that once we moved, they would.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Though I could smell the fear on him\u2014as he could no doubt smell it on me\u2014his voice was amazingly steady. But then, I guess he\u2019d seen more than his fair share of dangerous beings in his years as an investigative reporter.</p><p>Just not this dangerous.</p><p>\u201cUse the holy water to form a wide half circle around yourself, then press back against the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRis, if the holy water works as a barrier, why don\u2019t we both just wait behind it?\u201d</p><p>I carefully opened the bottle. The cork hit the dirt near my feet and bounced a little before settling. The hounds\u2019 eyes gleamed a fiercer red in the darkness, and tension rippled across their sleek black hides. They were getting ready to pounce.</p><p>\u201cHellhounds have one design function, and that\u2019s to kill. Holy water might work as a short-term deterrent, but it\u2019s not strong enough to provide long-term protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only has to last long enough for us to ring for help. Your uncle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not get here in time. No one can. Hellhounds aren\u2019t stupid, and they\u2019re not going to wait around while we ring for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the knife if a hound decides to ignore the holy water and attempts to get at you.\u201d God, how did that come out so calmly when my stomach was twisted into knots and my hands were shaking? \u201cAnd good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you, too.\u201d</p><p>We were both going to need it. I took a deep breath and gripped Amaya tightly. Her desire to kill was so fierce it was almost blanketing, and suddenly not only was she in my head, but I was in hers. In the steel, at one with her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t question it. I just threw the second bottle of holy water and followed it up fast. The creatures split, one flowing to the left of the runes and the other to the right. The silver ribbon of deadly water flew harmlessly between them, hit the wall, and dribbled down to the floor stones.</p><p>Shit, I thought, and swung Amaya. Her steel was little more than a blur as she cut through the air. The hound snarled in response\u2014an action made grotesque by the fact he had only half a face\u2014and slashed with a viciously barbed paw. Claw and steel crashed together, the sound reverberating across a darkness that was no longer so silent. One of the creature\u2019s claws hit the top of my hand, slicing skin even as Amaya\u2019s flames leapt from steel to flesh and burned with fierce joy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jumped back and swung Amaya again. Blood sprayed across the ruined remains of the hound\u2019s face, and the gleam in its eyes grew stronger. It ducked the blow, then leapt. I had no time to move and took the full brunt of its weight, staggering backward but somehow avoiding the snapping, slashing teeth. One of its claws hooked into my right shoulder, and a scream tore up my throat. I flung Amaya over its head, then caught her with my free hand and brought her down on the creature\u2019s spine. The force of the blow reverberated up my arm, but it did little more than cut the hound\u2019s flesh. She didn\u2019t sever muscle or bone, as I\u2019d hoped she would.</p><p>Will, she screamed. Time need!</p><p>And that was the one thing we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of.</p><p>I clawed at the creature\u2019s remaining eye. It snarled and shook its head, its breath fetid, washing my skin with the smell of death. The movement dislodged its claw from my shoulder and I fell backward with a grunt of pain. Energy washed across my spine and I realized with horror that I was near the runes. Then air stirred, and the scent of malevolence grew stronger. The hound was in the air, coming straight at me.</p> <p>I became one with Amaya again\u2014felt the fierceness of her spirit rush through me. We leapt to one side. One foot skimmed the edge of a rune and sent a warning ripple of sickly green light across the darkness. We raised the sword, brought her down hard. Hit the creature\u2019s spine even as it hit the runes. The runes didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t flare, didn\u2019t cinder.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>This time, the combined strength of both Amaya and me drove the sword, and it burned and flamed swiftly through the hellhound\u2019s flesh, cutting through skin and bone with the ease of butter.</p><p>The hound screamed as it flopped to the floor, but it still had movement. It dug its claws into the stone and dragged itself around, snapping at my legs with its remaining teeth. I leapt back\u2014separated from Amaya\u2019s spirit once again\u2014then swung the satchel around, dragged out another bottle of holy water, and poured it over the creature from head to foot. The rancid smell of burning flesh filled the air as the creature twisted and howled in fury and pain. I raised Amaya again and brought her down\u2014point first\u2014with as much force as I could muster. This time she didn\u2019t sever, she consumed. Purple flames erupted, swept swiftly across the hound\u2019s hissing, disintegrating flesh, until there was no skin, no bone, no sound, just purple fire and the wretched smell of death. Then, with a sharp report, the flames and the hound were gone, and Amaya suddenly felt heavier in my hand.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean she was in any way satisfied.</p> <p>I swung around. Jak had created a protective ring using the water, but it wasn\u2019t as secure as we\u2019d hoped. It stopped the bulk of the creature, but it hadn\u2019t stopped the creature\u2019s slashing attacks with wicked-looking claws.</p><p>I spun and ran around the runes, coming up on the hellhound from behind. It sensed me\u2014it was always going to, as I was making little effort to sneak and Amaya was screaming her heart out\u2014and twisted and leapt in one smooth motion. I threw myself forward, turning as I fell, coming up under the creature as it flew above me. Amaya\u2019s screaming was at fever pitch\u2014wanting, needing bloodshed\u2014so I gave it to her. I drove her blade into the creature\u2019s belly and ripped her along its length. Blood and gore splattered across my face, stinking to high heaven and stinging like acid. These creatures may not be truly flesh, but god, when their innards spewed it damn well felt real.</p><p>\u201cJak, you okay?\u201d I scrambled to my feet, Jak\u2019s circle at my back and Amaya held out in front of me like a baton.</p><p>\u201cNo worse off than you\u2014watch out!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a warning I needed. The creature had barely hit the stone when it was in the air again. I threw the last bottle of holy water, but the hound somehow twisted, and the water hit trailing innards, not flesh. I swung the blade, slicing across the creature\u2019s snout, then twisted out of its reach. It had barely smacked down on the stones when it leapt again. But as it did, Amaya and I once again became one. All her fury, all her energy and her vicious need to kill became mine, and I screamed as she screamed. Together, we severed the creature\u2019s head clean from its neck even as it managed a last, desperate slash with its claws. I sucked in my gut, felt clothing and skin part, but little else, still held by the fury that was Amaya. As the hellhound hit the stone in separate parts, her fire leapt from the blade and covered both. In very little time, there was nothing left but ash.</p><p>I lowered Amaya\u2019s point to the stone and leaned against her, suddenly weak with relief. We\u2019d done it. Somehow, we\u2019d beaten them.</p> <p>All we had to do now was get out of here.</p><p>Jak\u2019s hand slid around my waist as he leaned next to me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, somewhat quivery breath, and released it slowly. \u201cYeah. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScratched, bleeding, and fucking glad to be alive.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, as he no doubt intended, then straightened and stepped away from his touch. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can get out via these gates. I think we need to go back through the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to leave our prisoner. It\u2019ll be next to impossible to drag him through it.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cBut we can\u2019t afford to leave him. The last thing we want is him reporting back to his masters. At least if we get him upstairs, Azriel can alter\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped as once again awareness swept over me.</p> <p>Someone else was in the tunnel, and they were coming our way.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I half raised Amaya, then stopped as fear gave way to realization. It wasn\u2019t a foe who walked toward us; it was a friend.</p><p>Uncle Quinn\u2014Riley\u2019s moon-sworn lover, and the half Aedh who\u2019d taught me how to use my own Aedh skills\u2014to be exact. He was also a former Cazador, and one of the few who not only survived the experience but walked away virtually unscarred. And that, to me, only emphasized just how deadly he could be.</p><p>It was a damn shame he hadn\u2019t turned up five minutes earlier. He would have handled the hellhounds with one hand tied behind his back and very little bloodshed.</p><p>\u201cRisa?\u201d The muffled confines of the tunnel made it hard to judge how close he actually was, but the Irish lilt usually evident in his voice had all but disappeared\u2014a sure sign he was ready for battle. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sheathed Amaya.</p><p>\u201cThen why do I smell blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess because I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess? You, my dear, have been around Riley entirely too long.\u201d</p><p>So people kept saying. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t a bad thing when it taught me to survive situations like this.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed out of the tunnel a damn sight more elegantly than either Jak or I had, and strode toward me. While no half-breed got the wings of the Aedh, many did inherit their mesmerizing looks, and Quinn was no exception. He was, in every way, angelic, from his beautiful face that was framed by night-dark hair to his well-toned body.</p><p>His dark gaze swept me, then moved on to Jak. What he thought of his presence I couldn\u2019t say\u2014Quinn was a very old vampire, and well practiced in keeping emotions contained.</p><p>Rather like Azriel, I thought absently.</p><p>\u201cThat may be the case, but she\u2019s not going to be pleased that you not only failed to call in help but got wounded in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it is,\u201d I said, then remembered I was talking to a vampire. He\u2019d know exactly how much blood I was losing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you have to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if anyone can hide secrets from that woman.\u201d Undercurrents of amusement and love ran through the comment. He ripped the sleeve from his shirt, tore it into strips, then roughly bandaged my shoulder. \u201cShe already suspects the worst, given the rather frantic state your reaper was in when he appeared to fetch me here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel?\u201d I interrupted, surprised. \u201cFrantic?\u201d</p><p>His gaze jumped to mine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t send him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even heard from him, simply because the magic was still in place. They couldn\u2019t stop our chi connection, however, so he would have understood the danger we were in. But frantic? He knew I had Amaya, and besides, while I\u2019d seen him angry, I couldn\u2019t imagine my often uptight reaper showing anything more than mild concern.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean Riley\u2019s here as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I took Aedh form to get here fast.\u201d</p><p>It also enabled him to get around the usual sunlight restriction, although as one of the old ones, he could actually stand huge amounts of daylight.</p><p>\u201cSo where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting at home, medi-kit in hand.\u201d His gaze moved to Jak, and his voice lost some of its warmth as he added, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing a Band-Aid and a stiff drink won\u2019t fix.\u201d Amusement ran through Jak\u2019s voice. He\u2019d obviously noted the temperature change, too.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s dark gaze swept the room, and narrowed slightly as it settled briefly on the pillars. He knows what they are, I thought. But he said nothing, and looked down at our captive instead. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to his ID, he\u2019s either Henry Mack or Jason Marks, and he\u2019s a Razan.\u201d</p><p>His gaze leapt to mine again. \u201cA Razan? Whose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, indeed, is the question.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWe suspect he was talking to his master before we knocked him out, but the number was blocked and we dare not call it back.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile touched Quinn\u2019s lips. \u201cIn other words, you want me to read his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, that would be nice.\u201d</p><p>Quinn considered me for a moment, then said, \u201cAs long as you agree to come back home with me, so Riley can reassure herself that you\u2019re alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then tell me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly. But seeing as you refuse to seek help from those of us who have more experience with things such as hellhounds, it\u2019s well deserved.\u201d</p><p>A point I didn\u2019t argue with, although I could have. Easily. He and Riley had been through enough shit in their time together\u2014they didn\u2019t deserve to get hit with mine now that their life was relatively sane and quiet. Besides, I\u2019d already lost my mom. I wasn\u2019t about to lose anyone else I was close to. It was bad enough that I\u2019d involved Ilianna and Tao as much as I had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have a deal.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then glanced at Jak.

Then his gaze met mine again. \u201cAn Aedh has been active in this man\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning that while he knows the name and location of his master, any effort on my part to access it would immediately notify said master of the intrusion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt is possible to circumvent such blocks, but it takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich we don\u2019t have. I suspect that if he doesn\u2019t report back soon, it\u2019ll make our quarry suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich might just draw him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that type. He\u2019s more likely to cover his tracks and start somewhere fresh.\u201d</p><p>Although the ley intersection was near here, so he wasn\u2019t likely to go too far from it. Still, we needed to avoid warning him just how close we were. \u201cYou can\u2019t get anything useful from him at all?\u201d</p> <p>Quinn hesitated, and glanced down at the Razan again. \u201cThere\u2019s three of them left. They live together in an old warehouse in Dawson Street, Brunswick West, and he\u2019s more than a little pissed about running these sorts of errands when he was trained as a soldier. He believes he could take care of any intruders and be a hell of a lot less conspicuous about it than hellhounds.\u201d</p><p>But hellhounds didn\u2019t need to eat or drink or go to the toilet\u2014they were on watch twenty-four/seven, until ordered otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he serve?\u201d Although he didn\u2019t look that old, Razan were linked to the life force of their masters and could live for centuries. Knowing which war might be handy to track down his real identity, because I very much doubted that the license and cards he carried were actually his.</p><p>Quinn hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s a Middle East army veteran. Retired about eighty-five years ago.\u201d</p><p>Not very old in Razan terms at all. \u201cAnd his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark Jackson. I can\u2019t tell you at what point he became Razan, because that memory lies behind the shield.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I squatted down beside the Razan, rolled him onto his side, and pointed to the barbwire tat. \u201cHave you seen one like this before?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shook his head. \u201cBut it is not usual for Raziq to mark their Razan with their own unique brand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis particular brand has been seen on Razan who we are fairly certain belong to different masters.\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged. \u201cThat is not unusual, either. There were Razan who served the Aedh priests at the gate temples who belonged to all. Maybe this tat signifies a joint venture of some kind.\u201d</p><p>Which again lent weight to the idea that my father and this dark sorcerer were in cahoots, but I just didn\u2019t think that was the case. Not now, at least.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t like I could be sure of anything when it came to my parent.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the pillars?\u201d</p><p>Quinn raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you ferret out any information about them\u2014where they go, how they operate, that sort of stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you most of that.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there, given his reaction\u2014or lack of it\u2014when he\u2019d first seen them. \u201cSo you have seen pillars like this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly like these, no. But the writing on them is a variation of old cuneiform, and they were once used to summon Aedh.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bless crops or hunts, to garner favors, and in some cases, to offer one of their own to gain the blessing of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Aedh aren\u2019t gods.\u201d I could understand them being mistaken for angels, but gods?</p><p>\u201cWe know that, but the prehistoric world was a much simpler place.\u201d</p><p>I guess. \u201cBut these pillars aren\u2019t summoning devices. They appear to be some mode of transport.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we use them?\u201d</p><p>He half smiled. \u201cNo, we cannot.\u201d He picked up the Razan\u2019s wrist and pushed up his sleeves. On the inside of his arm was a small tat that was a mix of cuneiform and scrollwork. \u201cThe magic within this allows the wearer to pass through such gates. But even if we could pass through them, I wouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re still bleeding.\u201d He cupped a hand under my elbow and carefully helped me to my feet. \u201cIf you bleed to death before Riley can give you a piece of her mind, there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. Right now, him being chewed out by my aunt was the least of my worries. \u201cWhat about Jak? And our captive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give both appropriate memories. You start back through the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then did as he bid. It wasn\u2019t very long before I heard them behind me, Jak cursing like a trooper as he once again scraped his way through the tunnel. Quinn had left rope dangling into the pit earlier, so even with my various aches and pains, it was fairly easy to climb out.</p><p>I\u2019d barely crawled through the gap in the roller door when Azriel took my hands in his and gently pulled me upright.</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately say anything, just kept hold of my hands as his gaze swept me. His expression gave little away, but his anger and concern raged through my inner being, the sheer force of it rocking me back on my heels. Maybe Quinn hadn\u2019t been overstating when he\u2019d said Azriel had been frantic. And while that thought warmed me, the snarky voice deep within couldn\u2019t help but note that if anything happened to me, his mission would fail. And in the end, his mission was everything.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot keep going like this,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cIt will be the death of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, tell that to the bad guys who keep attacking us.\u201d I pulled my hands from his, even though all I really wanted to do was step fully into his embrace and let the heat and warm strength of him melt into my bones and make me feel safe.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t care if that feeling of safety was as temporary as the man himself.</p><p>\u201cRis\u2014\u201d He stopped.</p><p>I shifted briefly into Aedh form to stop the bleeding, then crossed my arms and regarded him steadily. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t bother denying the temporary situation, Azriel, because really, how can you ever be anything else? Especially when you don\u2019t want anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I do and don\u2019t want.\u201d It was vehemently said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut to be honest, I don\u2019t really think you do, either.\u201d</p><p>I resolutely turned away, suddenly too tired to get into a fight with him again. It didn\u2019t help. Awareness of him whispered through me: the flex of his fingers, the slow release of breath, the close shimmer of heat as he reached for\u2014but didn\u2019t quite touch\u2014me.</p><p>I know what I want, Risa. His thoughts ran through my mind like whiskey on a cold night\u2014warm, and yet with an edge that bit. And for both our sakes, you had better hope I never decide to take it.</p><p>That sounds like a threat, reaper.</p><p>It is nothing more than honesty.</p><p>And as usual, you being honest doesn\u2019t actually tell me a whole lot, does it? I shook my head slightly. One of these days, Azriel, you might just regret your reticence.</p><p>I do every day I\u2019m in your presence. His words stabbed deep, but he continued relentlessly. But it cannot alter my actions. It will not.</p><p>No, because what he truly wanted was to become a soul guide again. And nothing, not this quest, and certainly not whatever this thing between us was, would divert him from his path. He\u2019d never made any secret of it, either, but it was beginning to rankle me more and more.</p><p>Because I cared, more and more.</p><p>I was, I decided, an idiot.</p><p>I crossed my arms and watched Quinn and Jak crawl through the gap. Quinn kept within the shadows of the building, even though the midday sun had passed. Habit more than necessity, I thought.</p><p>\u201cShall I meet you back at your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Quinn said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Jak.</p><p>I glanced at him, surprised. He waved the notepad in his hand. \u201cI took note of the numbers in that man\u2019s phone book, and I want to chase them down just in case our sorcerer starts covering his tracks again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d It also saved me the hassle of having to explain to Riley his reemergence in my life. \u201cYou\u2019ll call if you find anything?\u201d</p><p>Jak snorted softly. \u201cLike I have any other choice, given your uncle\u2019s threat.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled, and he gave me a sketchy farewell wave and headed back to his car. Once he was gone, I met Quinn\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat does he remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more than my arrival, and me rearranging the Razan\u2019s memories.\u201d</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t rearranged all Jak\u2019s memories.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said mildly; then, as shock shivered through me, he smiled. \u201cThe micro-cells do provide some measure of protection against most vampires\u2014even the ones as strong as Madeline Hunter\u2014but they create little more than a mild barrier for someone as telepathically strong as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Riley?\u201d I asked, even though the answer was obvious. She was stronger than even him, after all.</p><p>His smile widened. Oh, fabulous, I thought, and pointlessly tried to remember everything I\u2019d thought since his arrival. Undoubtedly he\u2019d caught more than a few interesting ones\u2014though generally, both Quinn and Riley had strict rules regarding mind reading, and rarely indulged in casual telepathy. According to Riley, the thoughts of most people weren\u2019t worth it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cleared my throat, hoped I didn\u2019t look as embarrassed as I felt, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then melted into mist and disappeared. I shot Stane another quick note, asking him to add Mark Jackson to his search, and then Azriel\u2019s arms were around me and we were whisking through the gray fields.</p><p>We reappeared in the middle of Aunt Riley\u2019s living room. She was, as Quinn had said, waiting for us.</p> <p>\u201cAbout fucking time.\u201d Her gaze swept over me and her expression became grim. \u201cWhat the hell have you been tangling with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHellhounds.\u201d I stepped free from Azriel. \u201cThere were two of them, and two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfair odds in anyone\u2019s book. Those bastards fight nasty.\u201d She waved me toward the bathroom, then glanced at Azriel. \u201cYou can wait here. Or you could do something useful and help Quinn in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Azriel making coffee struck me as funny, but he merely offered a short bow and headed for the kitchen. But then, very few people ever argued with Riley when she used that tone.</p><p>I stripped my clothing off as I walked into the bathroom, and dumped the bloodied remnants of it in the bin rather than the laundry chute.</p> <p>Behind me, Riley sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cWhat the hell happened to your back?\u201d</p><p>I cursed mentally. I\u2019d forgotten about the damn scar. \u201cI fell off my bike and hit a pole.\u201d Which was the truth, just not the reason for the scar. \u201cBoth the bike and I got smashed up pretty badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d Her tone was dry and suggested she didn\u2019t believe my excuse, but she motioned me toward the shower without further comment. The water came on automatically as I entered, the water hot and the spray sharp and massaging. It felt sensational against my battered and bruised body.</p><p>\u201cWho else was with you in that tunnel today? Azriel obviously wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but there was little point in lying. Especially since Quinn already knew. \u201cJak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost brain cells or something?\u201d There was an edge of incredulity in her voice. \u201cWhy the hell are you messing around with him again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I needed someone who knew the streets and who could mix it up with street scum without raising suspicions.\u201d I couldn\u2019t quite hide my irritation. I\u2019d really had enough of people questioning my judgment today. \u201cHe\u2019s a source, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She studied me for a moment; then a warm grin broke loose. \u201cSpoken like a true daughter of mine. Your mother would be horrified.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cShe always did blame you for my wild ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did.\u201d Her grin faded. \u201cSo tell me about the hellhounds.\u201d</p><p>I did so. Once I was out of the shower, she sealed the few wounds that were still bleeding, patched up the rest, then fetched me some clean clothes. When I was dressed, she dragged me into her arms and hugged me fiercely.</p><p>\u201cRis, we\u2019re here if you ever need help. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back sudden tears. \u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are incredibly stubborn and want to do things your way.\u201d She stepped back, a slight smile twisting her lips. \u201cYou really could have been mine, we\u2019re so damn alike. Which is why I\u2019m reminding you. I don\u2019t want you making the same mistakes I did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched mine for several seconds, and her smile become stronger. \u201cYou won\u2019t seek help, you mean.\u201d Her voice was wry. \u201cNot unless you absolutely have to.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. She laughed, then caught my hand and tugged me toward the living room. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you fed, before you fade away into nothing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d made it through three meat and salad sandwiches and was feeling a hell of a lot more sociable when the phone rang. The ringtone told me it was Rhoan, and trepidation tripped through me.</p><p>I swallowed to ease a suddenly dry throat, then hit the vid-phone\u2019s ANSWER button. Rhoan\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cHe\u2019s made contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a name\u2014Vonda Belmore.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy would he give you her name? It makes the hunt far too easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what\u2019s got us worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cAt your place.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Riley\u2019s listening\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Riley said mildly, over my shoulder. \u201cAnd she\u2019s very interested in the reason why you\u2019re involving Risa in Directorate business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have no other damn choice, that\u2019s why. Look, I\u2019ll explain everything later. Right now, we have a murderer to hunt, and Ris has to be in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this something I can help with? I have more experience than Ris\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s not going to help in this case. She made contact with the killer on the astral plane before she knew we were after him, and now he won\u2019t deal with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a murderer. He should be dead, not dealing with anyone, least of all Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, he\u2019s a fucking ghost and we can\u2019t find him. We have to use Risa to have any hope of tracking him down, but trust me, we\u2019ll take good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Rhoan. I just don\u2019t trust the killers you hunt.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed my shoulder, then walked away, leaving me feeling warm deep inside. I might have lost my real mom, but in very many ways, I still had another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you the address,\u201d Rhoan said. \u201cMeet me there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then grabbed the last sandwich as I stood.</p><p>\u201cTo repeat myself, be careful,\u201d Riley said, her expression concerned.</p><p>I smiled grimly. \u201cAs Azriel has already noted, I\u2019ve lost more than enough blood for one day. I\u2019m not intending to lose any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s your intentions she\u2019s concerned about,\u201d Quinn noted.</p><p>I half smiled, then walked around the table, kissed them both, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I won\u2019t do anything stupid. I promise.\u201d</p><p>And I hoped like hell it was a promise I could actually keep.</p><p>The address Rhoan sent me was for a small house in Campbellfield. It was off a busy main street, on one of those long blocks that had been subdivided years ago, with a second dwelling built at the back. That was the one we were interested in.</p><p>I sat on a brick fence on the opposite side of the road. The rumble of trucks and cars going past was so damn loud that the clatter of a helicopter overhead was almost lost to it. The air was an unpleasant mix of exhaust, rubber, and the various scents coming from the fast-food shops down the road, and my nose twitched against the need to sneeze.</p><p>I glanced at my watch. We still had a couple of minutes to wait, and frustration swirled through me. It was tempting\u2014very tempting\u2014to just head in myself, but I\u2019d promised Riley to be careful and that wasn\u2019t exactly careful-type behavior. Besides, I wasn\u2019t at the top of my game right now\u2014in fact, a gnat could probably overpower me with very little effort. I needed sleep, and I needed more food despite everything I\u2019d already eaten. But most of all, I needed the bad guys to be sensible and give me a break.</p><p>And seeing as I couldn\u2019t control them in any way, shape, or form, I guessed the sensible had to come from me.</p><p>I sighed wearily and leaned against Azriel\u2019s shoulder. He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t wrap his arm around me and pull me closer, but the skin-on-skin contact was still oddly comforting.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone inside?\u201d I asked eventually.</p><p>\u201cA woman, a man, and a child in the first house. No one alive in the second.\u201d Amusement warmed his otherwise formal tones as he added, \u201cAnd before you ask, there\u2019s no one dead, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if this is the next victim\u2019s address, he might already have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is more than possible.\u201d</p><p>I glanced left as a black Ford turned into the street. Rhoan. Given the Directorate plates, it couldn\u2019t be anyone else.</p><p>The car slid to a halt in front of us. There were two men inside, but only Rhoan climbed out. He didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>The trepidation that had been up until now little more than a muted background buzz suddenly sharpened. I straightened. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole setup. He\u2019s deviating from his previous MO and I\u2019m not liking the possible reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s some sort of trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be anything else,\u201d he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a quick background check on Vonda. She turned vamp about one hundred years ago, and has been leading a relatively low-profile life ever since. She works the night shift at the Ford vehicle factory in Broadmeadows and doesn\u2019t socialize much.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat about feeding? How does she cope with that if she doesn\u2019t socialize much?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe probably uses synth blood. They\u2019ve gotten better at manufacturing it in recent years.\u201d</p><p>A fact he knew because his vampire half sometimes demanded blood, even if he didn\u2019t have the teeth to go with the hunger. \u201cSo Vonda has nothing in common with the other victims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than that she seems the least likely target for a serial killer, no.\u201d He spun around and studied the houses on the opposite side of the road. \u201cShe lives with her sister, who also works at Ford. We had an infrared-equipped helicopter sweep the area a few moments ago. There\u2019s three people in the first house, but no one is at home in our target house.\u201d</p><p>He was half vampire and had infrared vision himself, so he didn\u2019t really need the helicopter to tell him that. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to get too close to the house and spook our quarry\u2014not that he was inside from the sound of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a trap if there\u2019s no one inside.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan glanced at me. \u201cJust because we can\u2019t detect any form of body heat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing waiting.\u201d</p><p>Like a spell of some kind. I shivered and rubbed my arms. \u201cWhat did he say when he rang?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe gave us the name, and said for you to be in the house\u2014alone\u2014by two p.m. if we wish to save his next victim.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch again. \u201cThen I\u2019d better get moving. We\u2019ve only got a few minutes left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He studied me, expression worried. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d</p><p>I touched his arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Azriel will be with me, and he can\u2019t afford to let anything happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan\u2019s gaze went past me briefly. \u201cOkay. But you\u2019re wearing these, so I know what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled two blue stones out of his pocket, and I studied them with interest. \u201cI\u2019m gathering they\u2019re not just earrings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is a camera, the other is a mic. Until this case is over, I want you to wear them.\u201d</p><p>My gaze jumped to his. \u201cUm, you know I love you and all, but there\u2019s certain parts of my life I have no desire for you to see or hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t want to know about them, either.\u201d Amusement briefly crinkled the corners of his gray eyes. \u201cYou can turn them off easily enough\u2014you just press the left stone once. Two presses activates them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when I shower? Do I have to take them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the two stones onto my earlobes. They had to be some form of nanotechnology, because the stones warmed the instant they touched my skin, and they clung to my earlobes without anything to actually secure them. He lightly squeezed the right stone, then stepped back. \u201cKarl, you getting the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the man inside the car said. \u201cSound, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His gaze came back to me. \u201cAt the first sign of trouble, I\u2019ll be in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but he didn\u2019t need to. He wasn\u2019t worried about my ability to protect myself; he just didn\u2019t want to see me hurt.</p><p>I headed across the road. My gaze swept the first building, but came to a halt at the security camera.</p><p>\u201cAzriel, you might want to become invisible.\u201d</p> <p>He did so immediately, then said, You suspect he might have hacked into the security system?</p><p>Well, not him specifically if he\u2019s blind, but someone working for him certainly could. It\u2019s safer for me if they don\u2019t know about you.</p><p>You\u2019re considering your own safety? His mental tones held an edge. This has to be a first.</p><p>Sarcasm doesn\u2019t become you, reaper. Even if it was true.</p><p>I walked down the side of the first house. Though I couldn\u2019t see anyone, the curtains twitched, a clear indication that someone was watching.</p><p>It is the woman, Azriel commented. He hesitated, then added, Her thoughts are odd.</p><p>Odd how? I scanned the second house as it came into sight. There was another security camera perched on the side of this house and metal protection bars on the windows. Obviously Vonda and her sister didn\u2019t trust either their neighbors or the neighborhood.</p><p>They are vacant. It is like she has nothing else to do but look out the window.</p><p>Maybe she hasn\u2019t. Or maybe she\u2019s been made to take something. I doubted her behavior was a coincidence, given the reason we were here.</p><p>I rounded the corner of the first house and headed for the front door of the second. The security door was thick and heavy, just like the bars on the windows. I twisted the handle and it opened, as did the wooden front door. My stomach began to churn. This was way too easy.</p><p>Possibly, Azriel said, and it took me a mental moment to remember what he was replying to.</p><p>What about the man and the child in that house? Are they okay? I pushed the door open with my fingertips. The air inside was fresh and cool, and ran with the scent of femininity.</p><p>They sleep. He paused. Deeply.</p><p>Something in the way he said that had me looking around before I remembered he wasn\u2019t actually visible. What do you mean?</p><p>Just that it does not appear to be a natural form of sleep.</p><p>So they\u2019re all drugged up? I took a cautious step inside.</p><p>I do not know much about drugs, but as I have said, this sleep is not natural.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t like it, which no doubt meant there was something wrong. Something we should check out.</p><p>I stopped just inside the door, my bottom lip caught between my teeth as my gaze swept the room. The furnishings\u2014though sparse\u2014were of good quality. The main living area was L-shaped, with a kitchen tucked in the shorter end of the room. There was a hallway to my right, with a number of doors leading off it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see anything out of place, nor could I hear anything or anyone. Which I guess wasn\u2019t surprising; Azriel had already said there was no one here. I flexed my fingers, then headed into the hallway. A quick check revealed two bedrooms\u2014one messier than the other\u2014a bathroom, and a small laundry with a door leading out into an even smaller courtyard. There was nothing odd to be found, and no sense that Vonda had, in any way, feared for her life.</p><p>But then, neither had Dorothy Hendricks, and our hunter had been bleeding her to death here while burning a brand into her forehead on the astral plane.</p><p>I retreated back through the living room and went into the kitchen. It was small, neat, and filled with the latest in cookware\u2014which was an odd thing for a vampire to have.</p><p>I crossed my arms and walked over to the front window, staring at the back of the first house. The back door was ajar and there was no security or wire door in place. Which seemed odd with a small child in the house, even if he was asleep.</p><p>Is the woman still standing where she was? I asked.</p><p>She has not moved since we appeared on the other side of the street.</p><p>Which was not normal behavior. Not for the mother of a small child. Sitting, I could understand. Even catching a nap. But simply standing there like a zombie? I\u2019m sure looking after a young child made mothers the world over sometimes feel like the rambling dead, but this was definitely something stranger.</p><p>I swung around and headed for the front door. \u201cRhoan, I\u2019m going to talk to the people in the first house, and see if they can tell me about Vonda\u2019s recent movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d His voice reverberated inside my earlobes and made me jump. I hadn\u2019t actually realized the connection was two-way. Which meant he could tell me off if I did something wrong\u2014just what I needed.</p><p>I crossed the little patch of sunshine between the two houses, then pressed my fingertips against the rear door and carefully opened it. The small laundry was filled with clothes\u2014some in clean stacks on top of the washer, others in sorted piles on the floor. The door of the front loader was ajar, and half filled with dark clothing. She\u2019d obviously been in the middle of loading when she\u2019d decided to move into the living room and stare out the window.</p><p>Odder and odder.</p><p>I stepped over the piles and stopped at the next doorway. The only sound to be heard was the gentle ticking of a clock coming from the right. The air was rich with the scent of humanity, but underneath it ran something else\u2014something sharper.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Tension tightened through me. I flexed my shoulders, but it did as little as flexing my fingers had earlier. To the left was a hallway with several doors leading off it. If the layout of this house was similar to the other, then they\u2019d be the bathroom and bedrooms. I hesitated, then padded softly to the first door and carefully pushed it open. A small child lay still and silent on a cot. For a moment I thought he was dead, and it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. Then I noted the slow rise and fall of his chest. Asleep, as Azriel had said. Whether it was natural or something else was the question that needed to be answered.</p><p>I closed the child\u2019s bedroom door and stared at the next one. Though I had no doubt that the father would also be asleep, I couldn\u2019t escape the notion that I had to check. That I had to confirm whether this sleep was natural.</p><p>Of course, if it was, I\u2019d feel like a complete and utter idiot. Not to mention how furious he\u2019d be about being woken by a complete stranger.</p><p>Trust your instincts, Azriel commented. There is something odd here, as I have said. Their minds have been . . . touched, although whether by drugs or telepathic intervention, I cannot say.</p><p>But you usually can sense it, so why not here? I walked to the other bedroom door and opened it. A fully clothed man lay stretched out on the queen-sized bed, his hands\u2014resting on his chest\u2014rising and falling with each breath.</p><p>If this is telepathic interference, it is only very minor, and that is often hard to catch or define.</p><p>Meaning what? That someone has simply forced them to sleep? Why in the hell would anyone want that?</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but I really wasn\u2019t expecting him to. I walked over to the bed and lightly touched the man\u2019s shoulder. He didn\u2019t react in any way.</p><p>I pinched his cheek. Nothing. I pinched harder, but the result was the same. This definitely wasn\u2019t a natural sleep. \u201cYou seeing this, Rhoan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And I\u2019m liking it a whole lot less. Check the third person.\u201d</p><p>I spun and headed down to the kitchen. It was less tidy than Vonda\u2019s, with baby bottles in various states of cleanliness scattered over the sink and a half-made sandwich sitting on the counter.</p><p>I kept walking into the living room. The woman was still standing at the side window, but as I entered, she slowly turned to face me.</p><p>Shock hit like a hammer, and I stopped.</p><p>Burned into the woman\u2019s forehead was a raw and bleeding K-shaped mark.</p><p>It was the exact same mark that had been burned into Dorothy Hendricks\u2019s forehead just before she\u2019d died.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>My fingers twitched with the need to feel Amaya in my hands, but my sword was, for once, quiet. Whatever was happening here, she didn\u2019t sense an immediate threat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I forced a smile, then walked toward the woman and held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude like this, but I\u2019m looking for Vonda Belmore. I don\u2019t suppose you know where she is, do you?\u201d</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t shake my hand\u2014she didn\u2019t even look at it. Nor did she immediately respond to my question. She just stared at me in an oddly dead way.</p><p>I let my hand drop to my side and stopped just beyond her reach. But it was still close enough that I could smell the wound on her forehead, and it was rank. It was almost as if her flesh had rotted away rather than burned.</p> <p>My gaze swept the rest of her. She was statuesque, with fine, almost regal features and silvery hair that was cut short but well styled. She was also a vampire, which, when combined with the wound on her forehead, meant this was more than likely Vonda. But I wasn\u2019t about to admit that knowledge. Better to play the game, whatever the hell the game was.</p><p>\u201cI do know Vonda,\u201d the woman said eventually. Her voice was whispery and, like her gaze, lacked any sort of life or warmth. \u201cShe faces you.\u201d</p><p>Vonda might be facing me, but she wasn\u2019t the one forming the words.</p><p>He was doing that.</p><p>He was in her mind, controlling her. Maybe even seeing what she saw.</p> <p>It was certainly one way for a blind man to check out his adversary.</p><p>Azriel, are you able to get into her thoughts? Can you catch anything about the man we hunt?</p><p>I am only able to read the minds of those who are in the same vicinity. She currently has no thoughts of her own, and while he may control her, he does so from a distance.</p><p>I guess I should have known it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, and barely resisted the urge to run from this freak show. Or at least run from the freak behind it. The only reason I didn\u2019t was because it wouldn\u2019t help\u2014this was a game and, for whatever reason, it was one he wanted to play with me.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you here rather than in your own house, Vonda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were clever. I just wanted to see how observant you were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve passed the test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you found one, but you did not find the other.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him\u2014her\u2014for a moment, my stomach churning as I remembered that Vonda didn\u2019t live alone. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken her sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t paying attention, huntress. Did I not say victims, plural, last time we spoke?\u201d</p><p>Like I was supposed to understand the nuances of every word spoken by a crackpot? \u201cTaking two women at once doesn\u2019t follow your usual pattern, and I suspect you\u2019re a man who likes his patterns and rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I do. But I have never come across twins such as these before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? And what have any of these women done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not what they pretend to be. They are Kudlak, and therefore must be destroyed. That is my destiny, huntress. It is my task by birthright.\u201d</p><p>It was his birthright to hunt harmless women? Sanity and he really weren\u2019t on speaking terms. \u201cI have no idea what a Kudlak is, but I know these women are vampires\u2014and harmless ones at that. You\u2019re mistaken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not. Nor am I about to argue.\u201d The words were snapped, the tone annoyed. \u201cThe sister has an hour left.\u201d</p><p>And with that, the woman collapsed.</p><p>I lunged forward and caught her just before she hit the floor. The mark on her forehead was even more putrid this close, and her breathing was shallow and uneven, even for a vampire.</p><p>\u201cRhoan, we need an ambulance.\u201d I lowered her gently to the floor and looked up at Azriel as he materialized beside me. \u201cIs she going to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe may not have drained her blood, but he has drained her spirit.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and fought the useless rise of anger. Vonda\u2019s sister was still out there, and getting angry wouldn\u2019t find her any faster. \u201cIs there anything left of her mind now that he has released her? Or has he drained that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is mentally present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you read her?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNo. Her thoughts are blocked. I would damage her mind further if I broke past them.\u201d</p><p>She was dying anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t really have mattered, but I guessed it came down to reaper rules. He couldn\u2019t do anything that might harm an innocent.</p><p>Which meant I had to do this the hard way. I pinched her pale cheek as hard as I could. It was a mean thing to do to someone who was dying, but I really had no other choice. She might just hold the key to finding not only her sister but the crackpot behind these murders. \u201cVonda, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She murmured something that sounded decidedly unladylike, and made a weak movement with her hand, as if trying to swat me away.</p><p>I pinched harder. \u201cVonda, your sister is in danger. We need your help to find her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered briefly open, but there was little life or understanding in the green of her gaze. \u201cDani?\u201d she murmured. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her shoulders and shook her. \u201cYes, Dani. Where is she? Where did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClub.\u201d It was so softly said it was little more than a sigh of air.</p><p>\u201cWhat club, Vonda?\u201d I looked around as Rhoan came in. He glanced from me to the woman, and motioned me to continue. \u201cYou need to tell us or Dani dies.\u201d</p><p>Distress ran briefly across her pale features. She made a couple of attempts to speak before finally saying, \u201cUnderground.\u201d</p><p>Underground? Oh fuck, I thought. Surely she couldn\u2019t mean those clubs\u2014the ones that catered to vampires who were addicted to feeding from blood whores, humans whose whole life revolved around the ecstasy of a vampire\u2019s bite. The council had no intention of ever allowing the rest of the world to know about those clubs; the only reason I did was because one of the clubs was haunted by those who\u2019d been killed there, and their anguish had summoned a Rakshasa\u2014the same Rakshasa that had given me the scar down my spine before I\u2019d killed it.</p><p>God, surely fate couldn\u2019t be so cruel as to send me into one of those places again, could it?</p><p>\u201cWhat club, Vonda?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened and closed again, and though I leaned closer, I barely caught her reply. It sounded like \u201cthe Crimson Dive,\u201d but I wasn\u2019t completely sure.</p><p>\u201cWhere was she planning to go after the club, Vonda?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rolled back into her head and a small sigh escaped her lips. She was leaving us. I shook her again. \u201cDamn it, Vonda! Who was your sister planning to meet? Where did she plan to go after the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHartwell,\u201d she murmured. \u201cZane . . .\u201d</p><p>Her words faded away and her head rolled back. Azriel touched my shoulder, but it was a warning I didn\u2019t need. I released her and closed my eyes. She was gone, and I really didn\u2019t want to see the reaper who\u2019d come for her. Didn\u2019t want to see her soul\u2014and any real chance we had of saving her sister\u2014rise and walk away.</p><p>Rhoan squatted beside me and pressed two fingers against her neck. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cHartwell and Zane aren\u2019t much to go on, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than what we had, and at least we now know the reason behind the forehead branding.\u201d His gaze met mine grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve called in a cleanup team. We\u2019ll sort out the father and son, and go through the sister\u2019s room\u2014maybe we\u2019ll find something to clarify what she meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only have an hour.\u201d I rose and rubbed my arms. \u201cDo you know what a Kudlak is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I will soon enough.\u201d He eyed me thoughtfully. \u201cDid you catch the name of the club?\u201d</p><p>If he was asking that, it meant the mike on the earpieces hadn\u2019t been strong enough to catch Vonda\u2019s whispered reply, and for that I was suddenly grateful. \u201cI think it was Red something or other, but I couldn\u2019t guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run a scan and see if we can find anything that matches.\u201d He thrust a hand through his short hair. \u201cCan you hang around, just in case we find something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside, where it\u2019s warmer.\u201d I paused. \u201cDoes Dani look like her sister?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re identical twins.\u201d</p><p>Which might explain our killer\u2019s statement that he\u2019d never come across two such as these before. Identical twins who were also blood-whore-addicted vampires surely had to be a rarity.</p><p>Rhoan walked out. I pressed the left ear stud to deactivate the earrings, then headed back across the road to watch the sudden influx of Directorate people from a safe distance.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not tell him about the club?\u201d Azriel asked as he sat down beside me.</p><p>\u201cBecause of Hunter. I\u2019m not going to risk giving him information that may well get him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it may help solve the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may. Which is why I\u2019ll ring Hunter myself and ask.\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to do, as I was rather enjoying the brief respite from her overbearing presence in my life.</p><p>I dragged out my vid-phone, said, \u201cHunter,\u201d and watched the psychedelic patterns swirl across the screen as the phone made the connection.</p><p>\u201cRisa,\u201d she drawled. \u201cWhat a lovely surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering you\u2019ve got Cazadors following me around reporting every little twitch, I seriously doubt that it\u2019s either a surprise or lovely.\u201d</p><p>Amusement gleamed in her cold green eyes. \u201cThey do not report every little twitch\u2014although Markel is more circumspect than some.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t something I wanted to hear. With some trepidation, I asked, \u201cJust how detailed do the others get?\u201d</p><p>She gave me that smile\u2014the one that reminded me of a shark about to consume its prey. My stomach sank. Obviously, they followed where Markel did not\u2014and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it, which was infuriating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you already know why I\u2019m ringing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou were wise not to mention your knowledge of the clubs. Rhoan is an asset the Directorate would not like to lose.\u201d</p><p>I bet she was an asset the Directorate wouldn\u2019t like to lose, either, but I sure as hell hoped that one day, it would. In fact, the sooner the better.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a club called the Crimson Dive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dove, not Dive.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019ve rung the manager, and both Vonda and Dani Belmore are members. As were the other victims.\u201d</p><p>And the bitch had known about the connection well before I\u2019d gotten involved\u2014she was just more intent on protecting the secrecy of the fucking club than in protecting its patrons.</p><p>\u201cHave any of them killed while they were feeding?\u201d If they had, it might explain our killer\u2019s insistence that they needed to be destroyed. It was a view I could almost agree with\u2014although his time and attention would have been better spent chasing down those responsible for the clubs\u2019 existence than attacking the addicted who attended them\u2014whether by choice or not.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hunter hesitated again. \u201cThe Dove is not like Dark Earth. It caters to those who are more lightly addicted.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted softly. Addiction was addiction, and unless something was done about it, it would always get worse. But the vampire council seemed content to cater to the situation rather than cure it.</p><p>Damn it, these women weren\u2019t like the men and women I\u2019d seen in Dark Earth. They weren\u2019t so far down the abyss of addiction that they couldn\u2019t function normally. Hell, they held down jobs, something the deeply addicted could rarely manage. They could have been helped, if they\u2019d wanted it, and if that help had been available. So why these woman rather than those who drank from and sometimes killed blood whores in clubs like Dark Earth?</p><p>\u201cThe killer called them Kudlak,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that another name for blood-whore-addicted vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Kudlaks are something else entirely.\u201d She turned around, giving me a brief glimpse of stark white walls and a view out over the bay through ceiling-to-floor windows. She wasn\u2019t at her Directorate office. Maybe she was home\u2014she was certainly old enough that even windows that large wouldn\u2019t be much of a threat sun-wise. \u201cKudlaks originate from Croatia and some parts of Slovenia. They are a form of vampire who are, at their core, evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018form of vampire.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth the Croatians and the Slovenians believed them to be a form of energy vampire\u2014someone who feeds off the emotions of others, and who does evil when alive, but who becomes an actual vampire at death.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cBut you have to undergo a blood ceremony to become a vampire. You don\u2019t just become one willy-nilly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though it did little to lift the darkness in her eyes. \u201cYou and I know that, but truths often get lost in the beliefs and myths handed down through time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why would this man believe his victims are Kudlaks rather than plain old vampires? And why the hell would he think it\u2019s his birthright to kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he believes his victims are Kudlak, it is possible he also believes himself to be Kresnik.\u201d</p><p>Meaning we weren\u2019t dealing with an ordinary, everyday nutter after all, but something far worse. I rubbed my eyes wearily. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Kresnik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s where this gets interesting. According to the myths, a person born with a caul\u2014an embryonic membrane still attached to the head\u2014is destined to become either a Kudlak or a Kresnik. It is said a person born with a red or dark caul becomes a Kudlak, but a person born with a white or clear caul becomes a Kresnik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the destiny of Kresniks to go after Kudlaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what else do these myths say about them? Do they have any special powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never come across either personally, but it is believed Kresniks can leave their bodies to attack their foe, and are also capable of magic.\u201d</p><p>Which explained our killer\u2019s ability to harm someone both astrally and physically, as well as the hint of magic Azriel had sensed when we\u2019d found Dorothy\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cAre Kresniks also vampires?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cSome legends suggest they are enhanced by the goodwill of the community, and that in itself suggests energy vampirism rather than blood.\u201d</p><p>Which meant it was more than possible he could move around in daylight, since energy vampires often didn\u2019t have the same restrictions as blood vamps. The thought had trepidation shivering through me. \u201cWhat kills them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKudlaks are killed by impaling them with a hawthorn stake, then slashing their tendons below the knees and letting them bleed out.\u201d Amusement touched her lips. \u201cOf course, such actions would kill anyone, human or not.\u201d</p><p>Except, I suspected, her. Not because she was immune to such things, but because no one who knew her\u2014or knew of her\u2014would ever be stupid enough to attempt such a thing. \u201cIs Dani Belmore still at the Dove?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t likely, given that the man behind this madness had said she\u2019d only an hour left to live, but it didn\u2019t hurt to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. She hasn\u2019t been there for several days, apparently.\u201d</p><p>So why had Vonda believed that she was? Or was that simply a belief our killer had implanted? \u201cDid you get the club\u2019s management to check the security tapes, on the off chance she met someone near the club?\u201d</p><p>Hunter raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe would not be foolish enough to meet anyone outside the club.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cShe has an addiction, and she\u2019d just come away from feeding it. I seriously doubt she would have been too worried about what she should and shouldn\u2019t be doing as she left the place.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched her lips again. \u201cYou would have made a good guardian, Risa, if you\u2019d chosen such a path.\u201d</p><p>It sure as hell would have been an easier path than working for her. \u201cDoes that mean she did meet someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe caught a cab in Glass Street.\u201d I didn\u2019t ask how they knew this, because I knew she wouldn\u2019t tell me. She continued. \u201cI will send you the details of the company and driver.\u201d</p><p>Hunter paused and gave me that face. The one that said I\u2019d better do what I was told. And yet her face didn\u2019t even twitch\u2014it was more a darkness that crept into her eyes. \u201cDo not inform Rhoan where you got the information.\u201d</p><p>Or you\u2019ll both die.</p><p>The unspoken words seemed to hang in the air, despite the fact that the conversation was over a phone, not in person. But then, this wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard that warning or seen that look.</p><p>\u201cI know the drill,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat about Dani herself? Could the manager tell me anything about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did not know her personally\u2014he had to look up her membership form to remember who she was. I will send you the relevant details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember to check in when you uncover any new information regarding the keys.\u201d And with that, she hung up.</p><p>I sighed in relief, then glanced at my phone as it indicated an incoming message. Hunter was fast, I\u2019ll give her that. But then, she had been warned about the situation by Markel and had undoubtedly been waiting for my call.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t really much information about Dani\u2014nothing more than her address and banking details, which suggested that at the Dove, members paid for the privilege of easing their addiction. But maybe they did that at all the clubs\u2014if they were a moneymaking venture, it would certainly explain the council\u2019s reluctance to address the problem.</p><p>The taxi driver who\u2019d picked Dani up was Charlie Tan, and the depot was in Tullamarine, which was only about ten minutes away.</p><p>\u201cYou wish to go there now?\u201d Azriel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I all but snapped. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I have much of a choice, is it?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me. I sighed again, and waved a hand. \u201cSorry. The anger isn\u2019t aimed at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cYeah. No guarantee about the next time, though.\u201d</p><p>Amusement touched his lips, and warmed places deep inside me. \u201cSomething would have to be very wrong for you not to be angry with me at least a couple of times a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, it\u2019s not that bad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is.\u201d The smile still tugged at his lips, and took away some of the sting of the words. \u201cBut then, you are not alone in feeling frustrated by the situation we find ourselves in, Risa.\u201d</p><p>I guess that was true. He just seemed to control it better than me. I double-pressed the ear stud and said, \u201cRhoan, I need to disappear for a few minutes. Give me a call if you find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask where you\u2019re going, because I have a suspicion you won\u2019t tell me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut if you find anything and don\u2019t tell me, there will be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to check in with a hacker friend. He might be able to help find either this club or what the hell Hartwell is.\u201d</p><p>Rhoan grunted. Whether he believed me or not was anyone\u2019s guess. I turned off the earpiece again and glanced at Azriel. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around my waist and zapped us through the gray fields. We reappeared in the middle of an industrial estate. The place across the road was some sort of auction building, and the parking lot to one side of it was filled with cars of all makes and models. I spun around, spotted the cab company, and headed for the office. Azriel fell in step beside me, then opened the door and ushered me inside. The receptionist gave us a warm smile, but I couldn\u2019t help noticing it was mostly aimed at the man who stood beside me. Which niggled, but also made me wonder what the hell she was seeing. If the intensity of her gaze was any indication, there might well have been nakedness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. There was amusement in Azriel\u2019s mental tone. Although that can be arranged if you so wish.</p><p>If you get naked for her before you get naked for me, I\u2019ll be more than a little annoyed.</p><p>I have already been naked with you.</p> <p>Not nearly enough, I\u2019m afraid.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d the receptionist said.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to Charlie Tan,\u201d I said, a touch more tartly than I probably should have. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to trace the location of a woman who was recently a passenger in his cab.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Azriel made a small movement with his hand. \u201cIt is vital we find her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay. Hang on a sec.\u201d</p><p>She spun away and picked up the phone. I glanced at Azriel. And just what happened there?</p><p>I made her believe we were police.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think you reapers were supposed to intervene in the thoughts of others.</p><p>We aren\u2019t. But I am Mijai, and we do whatever must be done.</p><p>Something ominous crawled down my spine at the emphasis he placed on \u201cwhatever.\u201d I shivered but refrained from saying anything as the woman turned back toward us.</p> <p>\u201cIf you just go through the door to your left, Francis will be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>Azriel gave her a high-wattage smile. \u201cWe appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and all but stammered, \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked toward the indicated door. I followed, torn between amusement and annoyance. You handled that a little too well. Done it before, have you?</p><p>As I said, I do what must be done. In this case, it\u2019s getting the information we need quickly so we can solve this and move back to our real quest.</p><p>Then why not just pluck the information from her mind? Why flirt? And why flirt with a damn stranger and not with me?</p><p>Because she does not know where the cabdriver is, nor can she connect us to him.</p><p>He opened the door and ushered me inside again, one hand pressed against my back. The light contact chased away the ominous sense of trepidation that still lingered, but did little to ease the niggling annoyance.</p> <p>A woman\u2014Francis, I gathered\u2014glanced up from a com-screen as we entered, and gave us a pleasant smile. And once again, it was mostly aimed at Azriel.</p><p>\u201cSue says you need to speak to Charlie urgently.\u201d Her gaze swept him, and interest sparked deep in her brown eyes.</p><p>I felt a sudden urge to grind my teeth. The only reason I didn\u2019t was because it wouldn\u2019t have done any good.</p><p>\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble, yes,\u201d Azriel replied, his voice warm enough to melt ice.</p><p>If it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble, I grouched silently. Good grief.</p><p>Azriel glanced at me, amusement crinkling the corners of his eyes. And you were accusing me of jealousy?</p><p>I crossed my arms and regarded him steadily. It\u2019s not.</p><p>In the same way as mine is not?</p><p>This is different.</p><p>I do not believe it is.</p><p>You\u2019d believe the sky was green if it suited you.</p><p>That is an incongruous statement.</p><p>But true.</p><p>His smile increased, but he returned his attention to Francis as she pressed several buttons, then swished a finger across the screen. The face of a man appeared. He was bald and chubby, with red cheeks and merry blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, officer?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply, but Azriel beat me to it. Perhaps he thought politeness wasn\u2019t in my current repertoire given my sudden bout of grouchiness. And to be honest, he might have been right.</p><p>\u201cWe believe you picked up a woman in Gable Street a day or so ago. Can you remember where you took her?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cListen, I get a lot of passengers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman was regal-looking, with silver hair, a thin face, and a hooked nose,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cShe might have appeared high on something.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cYeah, I remember that one. She smelled funny\u2014like old paper. I dropped her at some abandoned industrial building in Brooklyn. I did ask her if she had the right address, being a woman and alone and all, because it wasn\u2019t a nice-looking place.\u201d He looked suddenly worried. \u201cHas something happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Azriel said, in a reassuring voice. \u201cWe simply need to talk to her. Can you give us the address where you left her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Cawley Road. I don\u2019t know the actual number, but the place had a stack of old shipping containers on the premises. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you very much for your assistance, Mr. Tan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said, and then the screen went blank.</p><p>Francis swiveled in her chair and gave Azriel a somewhat sultry look. \u201cAnything else I can do for you, officer?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and left him to it. I gave the woman at the desk a nod of thanks, but she was paying as little attention to me as the woman in the control room had. Which I could totally understand, but it still rankled.</p><p>I waited outside in the cool air, and Azriel appeared a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I muttered, \u201cyou all set for later tonight?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cI do not understand what you mean.\u201d</p><p>My ass he didn\u2019t. That was obvious from the mischievous twinkle in his eyes. But I bit back my annoyance and my reply, and glanced at my watch. Even though he\u2019d zapped us here, we\u2019d still lost valuable time inside, and the clock was ticking down. Time to stop being so idiotic and start concentrating on what really mattered\u2014saving a woman\u2019s life. A reaper who was becoming more and more of a frustration could be dealt with later.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get moving.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped close, but this time he didn\u2019t immediately wrap his arms around me and dissolve us into mist. Instead, he caught my chin between his fingertips and said softly, \u201cYou are an idiot, Risa Jones.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed me.</p><p>It was fierce yet gentle, everything and yet nothing. It was energy and spirit and desire, and it made me soar even as it made me hunger for things I knew could never be.</p><p>And it was insanely, infuriatingly brief.</p><p>His lips left mine and he wrapped his arms around my waist, but I barely even saw the gray fields as we zipped through them. My head was still dizzy from the power and the promise of the kiss. From the knowledge that it would never go any further unless he wanted it to.</p><p>What I wanted apparently didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We reappeared in the middle of a road. He released me and stepped back, his expression restored to its usual distant self. Like we hadn\u2019t just kissed. Like the kiss meant nothing.</p><p>And yet I knew, deep down, that was far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Azriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is magic here,\u201d he cut in, obviously not wanting to discuss his actions. He indicated the high wire fence to our right. Behind it stood dozens of old shipping containers in various states of repair. \u201cOver there.\u201d</p><p>Fine. Play your games. But don\u2019t expect me to be happy or to play along.</p><p>Once again, he gave no indication that he\u2019d heard the somewhat surly thought. I released a frustrated breath and reminded myself yet again that there was a life at stake here. \u201cCan you sense anything behind it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo life, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d His gaze met mine. \u201cBut no death, either.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sense any life, maybe she simply met our killer here and they went elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There is something here. It is similar in feel to the magic near Dorothy.\u201d</p><p>I swung around and studied the battered, abandoned containers. I couldn\u2019t see anything that jumped up and screamed magic, but then, I wasn\u2019t as sensitive to the stuff as he was.</p><p>\u201cWhere, exactly?\u201d</p><p>He pointed down the road, to the right. \u201cIt appears to be located near the containers behind that warehouse.\u201d</p><p>The warehouse in question was big, old, and had been in disuse for some time if the state of the place was anything to go by. The remnants of the sign over the main entrance said HARTWELL SHIPPING in what must once have been bold red lettering.</p><p>\u201cThis is definitely the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d</p><p>We hurried toward the entrance. My shoes clicked noisily on the road surface and the sound seemed to echo across the odd hush that held the immediate area. It was almost as if the old buildings around us were holding their collective breath, waiting for something dramatic to happen. Trepidation continued to crawl across my skin, and I slowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Azriel said immediately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The nearby cyclone fence was topped with razor wire, which seemed a little extreme given the state of the entire area. It wasn\u2019t like there was a lot here beyond rusting remnants, but maybe they were simply left over from the days when this was a thriving business park. There didn\u2019t seem to be any other security measures present, either. And yet something about the place still felt off.</p><p>I heard a slight tick-tick, and walked closer to the fence. A piece of razor wire had been cut and swayed regularly in time to the breeze, and every time it touched the fence, it ticked. The damn fence was electrified. I walked down to the main gate. It was similarly protected.</p><p>\u201cThe gate doesn\u2019t provide much of a barrier for the likes of us,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>He touched my arm and drew me lightly toward him again, but this time I resisted. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll get in there under my own steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I do.\u201d I wrapped my fingers around my purse and phone\u2014they wouldn\u2019t change unless there was skin-on-skin contact. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re going to keep using those moments to steal kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was wrong of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d I cut in, then closed my eyes and called to the Aedh within. I was still pushing my limits strength-wise, and this was really the last thing I needed to do. But I wasn\u2019t about to keep relying on Azriel to zap us around. Enough was enough. If he wanted distance, he was damn well going to get it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The heat and energy that was my Aedh half surged with the defiant thought, numbing pain and dulling sensation as it invaded every muscle, every cell, breaking them down and tearing them apart, until my flesh no longer existed and I became one with the air. Until I held no substance, no form, and could not be seen or heard or felt by anyone or anything who wasn\u2019t reaper or Aedh.</p><p>I swept in under the gate and headed toward the back of the warehouse building. Even though I had no flesh in Aedh form, I felt heavy and movement was slow. It was just as well I didn\u2019t have far to go, because I wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold this form for long.</p><p>I\u2019d barely reached the rear of the warehouse when my energy gave out and I hit the ground with an undignified splat. I stayed there for several minutes, my head booming and my breath a harsh rasp that burned my throat. Azriel, wise person that he was, didn\u2019t say a word, although he was standing so close that the heat of him washed over me, chasing the worst of the tremors away.</p> <p>I took a deep, somewhat shuddery breath, then released my grip on my purse and phone and climbed slowly to my feet. The world did a couple of mad turns, then settled. I swept the sweaty strands of hair from my forehead and, with some determination, walked on.</p><p>Azriel followed closely. I had a suspicion he was ready to catch me should I fall\u2014a distinct possibility considering how shaky my legs still felt.</p><p>My gaze swept the old building as we neared the rear entrance. It was covered in grime, and there were cracked and broken windows along its entire length, but the roof\u2014or the bits I\u2019d seen of it\u2014seemed in far better condition than what I\u2019d expected. Once again I couldn\u2019t escape the notion that someone was using this place\u2014and that there would be more than just electrified fencing waiting if we dared go inside.</p><p>Something I really didn\u2019t want to do.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cThe magic comes not from within the building, but from a container over to our left. This way.\u201d</p> <p>I followed him through the maze of rusted and rotting containers, although my strides were a whole lot less elegant and assured. In fact, I was amazed I was even still walking, given how crappy I felt.</p><p>\u201cAnd it still feels like the magic you sensed when we found Dorothy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not there?\u201d I knew he wasn\u2019t, because otherwise Azriel would have mentioned it, but I still had to ask. After all, we were dealing with a man who was apparently capable not only of leaving his body to attack his foe, but also of transporting spells and god only knows what other type of magic. And Azriel could be stopped by magic, though I doubted our killer would have that sort of knowledge, let alone have ever come across someone like our Mijai before now.</p><p>\u201cNo, he is not. The magic resonates from the blue container up ahead.\u201d He came to a halt. \u201cIt prevents me from reading what lies within it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for me thinking our killer didn\u2019t have the necessary knowledge to stop you.\u201d I stopped beside him. It was tempting to lean against him and let the warmth and strength of him chase away the worst of the aches\u2014if only for a moment\u2014but I resisted. Give him what he wants, I reminded myself fiercely. Even if it was the last thing in this world that I wanted.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not designed specifically against me. It appears more tuned to stopping anyone sensing what lies inside.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cDoes it just prevent psychic sensing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s olfactory as well.\u201d He glanced at me, his expression blank but his blue eyes angry. \u201cI fear someone lies dead inside, even if I cannot immediately feel it.\u201d</p><p>Meaning that once again our killer had not kept his word. But then, had I really expected him to?</p><p>I flexed my fingers, then stepped forward and grabbed the container\u2019s latch. It was heavy, rusted, and it took a lot of strength to wrench it open. When I did, it opened with such force that the door slammed against the side of the next container. The sound echoed across the hushed stillness, a deeply resonant noise that was almost a death knell.</p><p>That\u2019s what waited in the container.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t fresh.</p><p>I tried breathing through my mouth, but it didn\u2019t really help. The smell of rotting flesh had permeated the air, and it wrapped around me like a shroud, clogging every breath and clinging to my skin.</p> <p>I ignored the churning in my gut and forced my feet forward. Dani lay on wooden boards that spanned two forty-four-gallon drums. Her arms hung limply from her sides, her fingertips stained with the dried remnants of blood. The tendons in her calves had been cut, the wounds no longer clean but flyblown. Bile rose up my throat. I swallowed heavily and stopped beside her. She\u2019d also been staked, but, like Dorothy, had apparently died without pain, without fear. The expression forever frozen on her face was peaceful. Accepting.</p><p>My gaze rose higher. She also bore the K-shaped burn on her forehead, but unlike the other wounds on her body, there was no fly infestation. Maybe even they found the mark distasteful.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d I all but exploded. \u201cWhy is he doing this? Why tell us we can save her when he\u2019s already killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not Rhoan say he taunted the Directorate? Perhaps this is just more of the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pointless! What the hell does he gain by any of this?\u201d</p><p>Azriel shrugged. \u201cIt is often hard to discern the motives of those who derive pleasure from the kill.\u201d</p><p>I glanced sharply at him. \u201cYou think he does this for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think he truly believes that this\u201d\u2014he indicated Dani\u2014\u201cis his calling. But it would seem he gains immense satisfaction from being the puppet master. After all, it is not everyone who can give the Directorate\u2014and now you\u2014so many clues and yet successfully avoid their grasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he thinks they\u2019ll let that continue unchecked, he doesn\u2019t know the Directorate very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd therein might be your answer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, cut off his pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I had a sudden vision of nuts being hacked off, though that obviously wasn\u2019t what Azriel meant.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, amusement briefly tugging at his lips. \u201cI mean, perhaps it would be better not to chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that would mean letting people die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey die anyway. You were never meant to save any of these women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I let my gaze sweep Dani one more time, then spun on my heel and walked out.</p><p>Once I was free of the stinking confines of the container, I stopped and sucked in large breaths of the crisp, clean air. But it didn\u2019t do a whole lot. The smell of death still clung to my skin and clothes.</p><p>With some reluctance, I tugged my vid-phone out of my pocket and rang Uncle Rhoan. \u201cI found her,\u201d I said the minute he answered.</p><p>\u201cFuck it, Risa, I told you to contact me when you found anything. This is a Directorate investigation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one that you dragged me into,\u201d I snapped back, \u201cso don\u2019t get all snotty when I chase a lead that may or may not have gone anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have definitely been hanging around my sister for far too long,\u201d he muttered, and thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe followed the Hartwell name, and it led us to an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn. Dani\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead, if your expression is any indication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. There\u2019s maggots, so she\u2019s been here a while.\u201d</p><p>He swore softly but vehemently. \u201cDamn it, this bastard\u2019s death will be neither quick nor pleasant when I get my hands on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cYou might want to investigate the warehouse, too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s connected in any way to these murders, but someone has electrified the fencing, so there\u2019s obviously something here worth protecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t investigated? Color me shocked.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cSee, there is some common sense left in me after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d He glanced away briefly as someone murmured something behind him, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll get another cleanup team out there. There\u2019s no need for you to hang around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I need to go home and shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRing me if you happen to chase down either the club or the man Vonda mentioned,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go off investigating them by yourself. This bastard is too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I knew that. Not only had I seen the rotting evidence of it in the container behind me, but I\u2019d confronted him on the astral fields. It was not an experience I wanted to repeat in real life.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more you say that, the more I will,\u201d he muttered, and hung up.</p><p>I shoved the phone back into my pocket, then raised my face to the sky, letting the sun bathe the chill from my flesh. After a few minutes, I said, \u201cThis is not getting me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Azriel\u2019s voice held a slight edge, and I glanced at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am just wondering if you\u2019re going to be sensible enough to let me take you there or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven your somewhat dour expression, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve already guessed that particular answer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere is no need to tax your strength when I can very easily\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel, I can\u2019t keep doing this. I can\u2019t touch you, or be kissed by you, without wanting more. I understand the dangers you\u2019ve mentioned\u2014I do\u2014but if you want resistance, then that has to mean complete distance.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a moment, then gave a quick, sharp nod. \u201cPerhaps you are right. It is shortsighted of me to expect such control from you when I am not able to find it in myself.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he disappeared again. And this time I couldn\u2019t even feel him in the immediate vicinity. He had obviously gone back to watching from a distance.</p><p>Not what I\u2019d wanted at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I made my way back through the containers to the main gate. In Aedh form, I slipped under the fence, but re-formed in human shape almost immediately. The pounding in my head was far worse the second time around, and I stumbled to the nature strip and lost everything I\u2019d eaten that day.</p><p>Then I called a cab and went home.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d Tao said from the kitchen as I slammed the front door shut. \u201cSounds like you need coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need coffee, sleep, and a shower, and not necessarily in that order.\u201d I headed for my bedroom, stripping my clothes off as I went. \u201cDid the electricians and gas people come to the caf\u00e9 today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everything has been checked and cleared. I pulled a few strings to get the council inspector in tomorrow, so we should be able to reopen on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><p>I kicked off my shoes as I entered my room, then noticed a pale blue envelope sitting on my bed. It didn\u2019t appear to be a bill of any sort, and while the address was typed, there was no return address on either the front or the back of the envelope. I raised it to my nose and sniffed, but couldn\u2019t smell anything more than crisp paper, ink, and the faintest wisp of exotic wood and oriental spices\u2014Tao\u2019s scent. Whoever had handled this envelope before him had done so very carefully.</p><p>I half wondered if this was yet another letter from my father and flipped it over, sliding a nail under the rim to open it.</p> <p>The sheet inside was the same blue color as the envelope. Obviously, whoever sent it liked matching stationery.</p><p>I tugged the sheet out and unfolded it. And discovered it wasn\u2019t a letter, but rather a warning.</p><p>I know where you live, it said.</p><p>And I know what protects you.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>For a minute, I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p> <p>Then fear set in and I began to shake so badly that my legs wouldn\u2019t support me and I dropped onto the bed.</p><p>He knew where I lived!</p><p>Fuck, oh fuck.</p><p>I stared at the letter for several more minutes, then, without warning, started to cry.</p><p>Fiercely.</p><p>Uncontrollably.</p><p>The sobs were so bad my whole body shook with them and though I was gulping down air like a fish, it caught in my throat and made it even harder to breathe.</p><p>Tao was suddenly on his knees in front of me. He wrapped his arms around my body, making soothing noises low in his throat as he pulled me onto his lap and rocked me as gently as a father would a terrified child. It felt like a furnace had wrapped itself around me, and it went a long way toward chasing away the chill that had enveloped my body.</p> <p>But the tears continued to fall. In anger, in fear, and in frustration. For everything that had happened, for everything I\u2019d lost, for all those who had died because of me, and for all those who might yet die because of me.</p><p>Because I was sick of monsters chasing me and sick of people using me.</p><p>And because I knew, no matter what, there was no going back. This path, this journey, was leading me inexorably into darkness, and I knew with every fiber of my being it was a darkness from which I would not escape.</p><p>My mother had sensed this destiny long, long ago. Had, in fact, told Aunt Riley when I was still a child that I would be involved with angels and demons and god knows what else, and she hadn\u2019t been sure if that involvement would be for the side of good, or for evil. She\u2019d never actually said anything to me, of course, but I\u2019d known. She\u2019d had her secrets, but this was one I\u2019d uncovered fairly young\u2014too young to understand the true depth and cost of such darkness.</p><p>I understood it now.</p><p>Understood, and feared it.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long we stayed like that, but it was certainly long enough that Tao\u2019s legs had to be cramping. He never said anything, just continued to hold me long after the tears had stopped falling. Eventually, I lifted my head from his shoulder and said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a tissue on you, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can produce a handy sleeve.\u201d</p><p>He offered me his left arm. I made an odd sound that was caught between a laugh and a sob. \u201cThanks, but it\u2019s too nice a sweater to ruin with snot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnot can be washed off.\u201d He gently thumbed away a remaining tear, then placed his hands on my hips and lifted me onto the bed. \u201cNow, do you want to tell me what that was all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was this.\u201d</p><p>I handed him the letter. He read it quickly, then met my gaze again, his expression curious. \u201cWho is it from? It doesn\u2019t seem the sort of thing the Raziq or your father would send, and they\u2019re the only crazy people currently in your life, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s Hunter and the vampire council, but this isn\u2019t from them. It\u2019s from someone who brings a very fresh approach to the business of being insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do seem to attract them.\u201d Amusement ran through his voice, but there was concern in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d I rose, stepped past his legs, and walked around the bed to grab a tissue, blowing my nose before adding, \u201cI met this one on the astral plane. Apparently he\u2019s been killing people and taunting the Directorate for a week, but now he\u2019s decided to turn his attention to me. Why, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe insane rarely need a good reason to do anything.\u201d He studied the note for a moment, then threw it on the bed and rose. \u201cHave your shower and then pack. We\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I mean, this place is more secure than just about anywhere.\u201d</p><p>But even as I said that, I remembered that this foe could astral-travel and was apparently able to interact with people on both the plane and the real world while in that astral state.</p><p>And though we had the latest in security gadgets in our apartment as well as wards designed specifically to keep Aedh out, it wouldn\u2019t keep out a human in astral form.</p><p>He knew where I lived.</p><p>All he had to do was wait until I was asleep and vulnerable. And because Azriel couldn\u2019t interact with the astral plane, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him.</p><p>Azriel.</p><p>I wanted the comfort of his presence so badly it hurt, and it was rather surprising that he hadn\u2019t appeared, given the stress I\u2019d been under. But then, he was a man fighting for control and warring against need while trying to do the job he\u2019d been sent here to do. And as our all-too-brief kiss had proved, it was a war he was losing.</p><p>And while part of me did want him to lose that particular battle, I knew in the long run it wasn\u2019t for the best. Whatever my fate might be, whatever my future might entail, it wouldn\u2019t involve Azriel. It couldn\u2019t. He was reaper, I was a half-breed werewolf-Aedh. We were two very different species physiologically, if not emotionally.</p><p>Even if, right at this point in time, what we both secretly hungered for was exactly the same thing.</p><p>\u201cThis place might be secure,\u201d Tao said, dragging me out of my thoughts, \u201cbut if this guy is as bad as you say, then we must go somewhere he doesn\u2019t know about. Stane\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to drag Stane into danger\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tao cut me off with a snort. \u201cOh, trust me, Stane is more than able to take care of himself. Besides, his place is almost as well protected as this apartment, especially with the wards Ilianna gave him still online.\u201d</p><p>I had forgotten about those, though I doubted that even wards designed to keep demons out would deter astral travelers. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should risk\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tao touched a finger to my lips. \u201cNo arguments. I was going to Stane\u2019s for the night, anyway, as it\u2019s game night and we\u2019ve planned to shoot the shit out of people online. So, get ready while I go ring Ilianna.\u201d</p><p>He walked out. I gave in to the inevitable and went to have my shower, lingering long enough to get prune skin. Once dressed, I packed several days\u2019 worth of clothing and other necessities, then slung the bag over my shoulder and headed out.</p><p>\u201cIlianna\u2019s going to stay at Mirri\u2019s. She\u2019s not happy about it, though.\u201d</p><p>Mirri lived in an apartment building in Carlton, and while it was well enough protected magically, there were apartments both above and below Mirri\u2019s and they weren\u2019t well soundproofed. Ilianna hated the sensation of so many people surrounding her, as well as the fact that you could hear every little movement in the other apartments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ply her with her favorite ice cream when we all return home,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019ll ease the grumpiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better make it a couple of tubs, then.\u201d He ushered me out, then set all the various locks and alarms. \u201cOh, and she said to tell you that the Brindle witches haven\u2019t noticed any unusual activity along the ley lines, which means the magic is being contained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say if they were going to follow up the possibility of containment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He opened the car door and ushered me in. \u201cBut you\u2019d think they would. I mean, they wouldn\u2019t want anyone controlling that sort of magic, would they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d But then, when it came to the Brindle witches, who really knew what they would or wouldn\u2019t want? Certainly some of their actions so far had surprised the hell out of me.</p><p>Stane greeted us with a cheerful hello and several boxes of pizza. He kissed my cheeks, then waved his free hand toward his bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours. I\u2019ve even changed the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. I mean, you don\u2019t use the thing, do you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI do tend to sleep on one of the couches, granted, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sheets were clean. I don\u2019t dust and it was thick on the bed.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, then rose on my toes and kissed his cheeks. \u201cThank you. And enjoy your pizza and online destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not going to join us?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cRight now, all I really want is to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try to keep the noise down.\u201d Tao squeezed my arm gently, his touch light but comforting. \u201cYell if you need anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked into Stane\u2019s bedroom. It was very much like the rest of his apartment\u2014filled with all the latest gadgets, and there was little in the way of dust, despite his claim to the contrary. Which wasn\u2019t really surprising\u2014dust could ruin the innards of expensive gadgets, after all, and there were lots of them up here.</p><p>I closed the door, shed my clothes, then tucked Amaya under the pillow and climbed into bed. It was big and warm and comfortable, and I was asleep in no time.</p> <p>The sensation of movement woke me. For a couple of minutes I did nothing more than lie there, dizzy, confused, and feeling oddly transparent. Like my body had somehow disappeared and I was nothing more than particles drifting in the air. When I tried to wake, tried to move, I couldn\u2019t do either. But as panic surged, the movement stopped, and suddenly I was full-bodied and fully aware.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in Stane\u2019s bed.</p><p>Not unless it had suddenly turned to cold stone.</p><p>No, no, no! It can\u2019t be happening again. They can\u2019t have taken me again.</p><p>I opened my eyes. Realized my fears were all too real.</p> <p>They had taken me.</p><p>The last time I\u2019d been in this place the heavy blanket of darkness had been lifted only by Amaya\u2019s lilac flames. This time there were torches on the wall. Why they were there I had no idea, but they sputtered and spat and threw an angry light, as if they had no desire to be in this place.</p><p>It was a desire I fully understood.</p><p>Because this was the place where the Raziq had torn my molecules apart to place the tracker in my heart.</p><p>My heart began to race so fast I could have sworn it was trying to tear out of my chest. But fear wouldn\u2019t help me get through this. Truthfully, nothing would. They\u2019d do what they wanted to regardless of what I said or did.</p><p>But I could at least face it with dignity and strength. If nothing else, it would make me feel better afterward.</p> <p>I forced myself upright. I couldn\u2019t stand\u2014the ceiling in the cavern was far too low to allow that. The air was as stale as ever, and the torches only made it harder to breathe.</p><p>The Raziq were little more than a faint shimmer in the shadows, but the electricity of them crawled across my skin. This time, it was different, though\u2014stronger. There was someone else here, someone I hadn\u2019t met before. Someone more powerful than the other five combined.</p><p>And I was without Amaya.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>Once again I shoved aside the panic that threatened to overwhelm me and hugged my knees close to my chest.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, somehow managing to keep my voice conversational, although it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if it wasn\u2019t. These Aedh had about as much understanding of human emotion as a brick wall. \u201cMy posse has gained a new member\u2014how lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not new.\u201d Though I\u2019d been expecting a male, this voice was not only decidedly feminine, but surprisingly pleasant. \u201cBut I am here due to past actions, both yours and ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you have a name?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t answer immediately. I had the odd impression she was considering the wisdom of doing so, as she no doubt knew I\u2019d ask my father about her. But then, they wanted me in my father\u2019s presence so they could capture him, so there was little harm in telling me.</p><p>It was a conclusion she must have agreed with. \u201cI am called Malin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want from me this time, Malin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want what we have always wanted\u2014your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as I seem to be saying a lot lately, it isn\u2019t like I have much of a choice to do anything else.\u201d I considered the shimmer that was her presence. \u201cHow did you get past Azriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe distance the reaper kept between you was foolish.\u201d There was a hint of smugness in her voice. The Aedh might be unfeeling creatures, but they were not above feeling superior. \u201cHe did not realize the danger he had placed you in until you were in our grasp.\u201d</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t rescue me, either. For some reason, earth inhibited a reaper\u2019s ability to track souls, so being this deep underground meant that not only would Azriel be unable to find me, but our chi connection wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>If he\u2019d been frantic when I\u2019d been confronted by the hellhounds, I could well imagine his state right now. And he\u2019d no doubt blame himself for my capture. But even if he had been close, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop this kidnapping. They\u2019d wanted me, and one solitary reaper could not have stood up to the number of Raziq currently in this place. No matter how fierce a fighter Azriel was, it would have been six against one, and the death I\u2019d feared at the train station would have been real and devastating.</p><p>\u201cLook, my father sensing your damn device was not my fault. I didn\u2019t warn him. I did what you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe realize this. The device placed within you was somewhat hurried in its creation. I plan to rectify this now.\u201d</p><p>Horror crawled through me. \u201cRectifying\u201d was surely just another word for pulling me apart to adjust the thing in my heart. I\u2019d lived through that once. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I could do so a second time.</p><p>\u201cMy father is no fool, and he\u2019s managed to remain one step ahead of you lot all along. He\u2019ll expect changes to be made to the device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is the point of making the adjustment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will provide a nice piece of subterfuge. He\u2019ll see what he expects to see, and will not go looking for any other changes.\u201d</p><p>Any other changes? I was not liking the sound of that at all. My voice shook slightly as I said, \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning I plan to interweave the strands of our beings.\u201d</p><p>I could only stare at the flame-lit shadows in horror. Weave her being through mine? What the hell did that mean? How the hell was something like that even possible?</p><p>\u201cWhen you can pull apart the atoms of a being as easily as a human might a tapestry, such a task is relatively simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d The rest of the sentence got stuck somewhere in the thickness of my throat. I swallowed heavily and tried again. \u201cBut what does it actually mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that not only will you carry the threads of your father\u2019s heritage, you will also carry mine.\u201d</p><p>Was \u201cthread\u201d the Aedh word for DNA? Is that what she was going to do\u2014insert her DNA into mine? What the hell would that do to me? Make me more Aedh? Make me more like them?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that fucking answers the question, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t react to the anger in the statement. No surprise there, I guess. \u201cYou will become more fully Aedh than you currently are, and your skills will therefore be stronger, but it will not affect your overall humanity.\u201d</p><p>The way she said \u201chumanity\u201d made it all too clear that she meant \u201cemotion,\u201d and that was a huge relief. As much as I\u2019d enjoyed being with Lucian, I didn\u2019t want to be like him emotionally. Hell, the only thing he seemed passionate about\u2014aside from sex\u2014was revenge.</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t my father sense such an insertion?\u201d I was his daughter, after all, and he could trace my whereabouts thanks to that fact. Surely that same connection would inform him that something had been altered within me.</p><p>\u201cYour father cares as much for the human part of your nature as any Aedh ever does. As long as that is retained\u2014however minor it might be\u2014he will not notice the change.\u201d The tone was still smug, and yet oddly kind. Like a parent talking to an obtuse child.</p><p>I guess if she intended to weave her DNA through mine she technically could be considered a parent.</p><p>\u201cBut he can read my thoughts as easily as you lot. It\u2019s illogical to think he won\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you will not remember exactly what we have done,\u201d she replied. \u201cIn fact, we bet your life on this.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, they were going to alter my memories. Then the rest of her words sank in and my gut began to churn even harder. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re betting my life on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHieu will not risk our regaining control of the keys, so if he does notice the insertion, he will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. After all, my father seemed overly determined to get the keys for his own nefarious reasons, and I was his only way of doing that when he had no physical form here on earth.</p><p>But then, what did I really know about the man who was my parent? He\u2019d been one of the Raziq, had worked with them to create the keys. They surely had more of an insight to his character than I did.</p><p>\u201cHow will this insertion help you capture my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you have noted, your father has always been one step ahead of us. Now that he knows of the device, he will work on a way to mute it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy threading my DNA through your lesser being, I will be aware of your movements, no matter where you are. If the device within your heart becomes subdued, I will still be able to find you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the energy of the Raziq, and felt ice crawl through me. There was more to this than that. It would do more than that.</p><p>\u201cIf the keys were so damn important, how the hell did you lose them in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did not expect treachery.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cMore the fool you, then. Treachery comes with any attempt at power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe keys were meant to end our servitude to the portals by closing them permanently. They were not a means of power.\u201d</p><p>The person who had control of the keys had control over the gates to heaven and hell\u2014how could that not be considered a means of power? Hell, maybe that was the real reason Hunter wanted the keys. It wasn\u2019t about the high council using hell as their own private prison\u2014a stupid idea if ever I\u2019d heard one\u2014but rather yet another means of Hunter solidifying her power base.</p><p>\u201cCan I remind you that it\u2019s the reapers who have been guarding the gates? The priests who were actually supposed to guard them died out long ago.\u201d Or rather, had died out or become Raziq. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust because we no longer serve or guard the portals does not mean we are free from them.\u201d</p><p>Another statement that didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.</p><p>God, I thought, dropping my head onto my hands. Why in hell didn\u2019t someone wake me? Surely this couldn\u2019t be happening. Surely it couldn\u2019t be real.</p> <p>But it was. And it was a nightmare from which there was no escape. I very much suspected that not even death would help me. After all, beings who could unravel the threads of humanity could command a being to life as easily as they could kill.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the device in my heart? What are you going to do to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle more than mute its power and make it a less tangible presence. Hieu will still sense it, but only because he already knows it exists within you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cDo what you have to.\u201d My voice was flat but not truly steady. It couldn\u2019t be when I was all too aware of what was about to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can do much to stop you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is refreshingly compliant of you.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cFighting you bastards didn\u2019t achieve a whole lot the last couple of times, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it is in your nature to fight regardless of the wisdom of such an action. We were expecting nothing less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich just goes to prove that even those of us with thick heads get sick of constantly knocking ourselves out against brick walls.\u201d I rubbed my arms, and felt a flicker of warmth run through my fingers. I glanced down. The Du\u0161an\u2019s eyes glowed with deep, angry fire. She might not be able to react against whatever the Raziq were about to do, but she was here, with me, and they could neither remove nor alter her. And suddenly I didn\u2019t feel so alone.</p><p>\u201cThen let us proceed.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, dark energy began to swirl around me. I braced myself, expecting the worst, but this time was very different from the last. Maybe it was simply a matter of accepting rather than fighting, but it didn\u2019t rip through my body, tearing me apart cell by cell, until every atom felt like it was on fire and screaming in agony. This was more like a slip into Aedh form. The energy wove through me like a summer storm, powerful and yet oddly warm, numbing pain and dulling sensation as it invaded every muscle, every cell, breaking them down and tearing them apart, until my flesh no longer existed and I became one with the air. Until I held no substance, no form, and was little more than thousands of tiny particles floating aimlessly in the air.</p><p>Then I felt it.</p> <p>A sharpness, like a knife being inserted into flesh. Pain rippled through my being, a burn that got fiercer, brighter, sharper. Silver flickered across the edges of awareness. The foreign line of particles was finer than a hair, but bright, shining, and cold. They wove through the tapestry of my being, stitching themselves to me and forever altering what I was.</p><p>Then the dark energy began putting me back together, piece by piece, until I was again on the stone, quivering and shaking and gasping for air.</p><p>For several minutes I didn\u2019t say anything. Couldn\u2019t say anything. The change into Aedh might not have been of my choosing, but it still affected me exactly the same.</p><p>In some way, that was a comfort. They may have altered strands of my DNA, but I was still reacting as I always had. At least for the moment.</p><p>My skin rippled as the Du\u0161an crawled around my forearm, her claws creating tiny pinholes into my skin with each movement. I glanced down at her, and her head whipped around, her gaze meeting mine. There was displeasure and anger rather than concern in those dark violet depths.</p><p>I rested my fingertips against her gleaming body, gaining some measure of calm from her warm presence in my skin, then glanced up to the shimmer that was Malin and the other Raziq.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we return you and wait for your father to contact you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave no doubt that he will. Hieu wants those keys as much as we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly he doesn\u2019t want to basically destroy humanity by permanently shutting the gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhat Hieu wants would be far worse.\u201d</p><p>Trepidation crawled through me. Her words all but echoed my earlier fears. \u201cAnd what are his motives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDictatorship over all realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in heaven, hell, and earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Which didn\u2019t really seem an adequate response to that bit of news.</p><p>Of course, given who was relating it, maybe I should be taking it with a grain of salt. They wanted my help to capture him, after all, and maybe imparting this bit of mind-blowing news was little more than an extension of their revised plans.</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want,\u201d Malin said. \u201cIt is not important to us.\u201d</p><p>And with that, the dark energy swept around me again, shifting me from flesh to Aedh in the blink of an eye. It didn\u2019t re-form me in Stane\u2019s bed, but somewhere dark, cold, and wet.</p><p>It was rain, I realized, after staring at it running down my arms. I was kneeling in the rain. Why the hell did they dump me in the middle of a storm? Because they didn\u2019t want to risk a clash with Azriel, even with greater numbers on their side.</p><p>I sat back on my heels. The madman in my head was reacting less severely than usual, enabling me to at least look around without feeling like I was about to pass out.</p><p>Not only was I in the middle of a storm, but if the height of the moon was anything to go by, it was also the middle of the night. Obviously, I\u2019d been in the hands of the Raziq for longer than I\u2019d thought.</p><p>A heartbeat later, a hurricane hit, blasting my skin with heat. Azriel dropped onto his knees in front of me, his fingers cupping my cheek as his gaze met mine.</p><p>There was a whole lot of anger in those blue depths. A whole lot of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I whispered, wishing he\u2019d just wrap his arms around me and hold me like he never intended to let go. It might be a lie, but it was one I suddenly needed, if only for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou are changed.\u201d The words came out tight.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point.\u201d</p><p>No, I guess it wasn\u2019t. And like the last time, it couldn\u2019t be undone. Not by him, and certainly not by me.</p><p>\u201cJust take me home, Azriel. Please.\u201d</p><p>He swept us across the fields even before I\u2019d finished speaking, but when we reappeared, it was in Stane\u2019s room, not mine.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice sharp, almost vicious. \u201cI allowed you to be taken once. I will not risk it a second time.\u201d</p><p>And I, for one, wasn\u2019t about to complain about that, even if I\u2019d rather be home. I stepped back and rubbed my forehead wearily. \u201cThe Raziq won\u2019t snatch me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean the Raziq.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him blankly for several heartbeats, then fear struck anew and I began to shake again. God help me, with everything else that had happened, I\u2019d forgotten about our faceless madman.</p><p>But he was still out there, still after me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t cope. Damn it, why wouldn\u2019t everyone just leave me the hell alone? Was that too much to goddamn ask?</p><p>Azriel caught my hands and tugged me into his embrace. I closed my eyes and leaned my cheek against his chest, listening to the rapid pounding of his heart. It felt like heaven. Like I was home.</p><p>\u201cLeaving you alone was what caused you to fall into Raziq hands.\u201d His breath tickled the back of my neck, ragged and warm. \u201cThat should not have happened, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d I lifted my face and met his gaze. And while I ached to brush my lips against his, any move in that direction had to come from him. He knew what I wanted. He\u2019d always known.</p><p>\u201cIf I had been here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have been dead.\u201d Even saying the words had my stomach tightening. \u201cI know you believe otherwise, but there were six of them, Azriel, and one of them was immensely powerful. She said her name was Malin.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment and said something in his own language. And though I didn\u2019t understand one word, I didn\u2019t really need to, given the anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cMalin is the leader,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cShe is the one your father betrayed when he stole the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what she did to me was as much about revenge as the keys.\u201d I hesitated, and suddenly realized I couldn\u2019t actually remember what they\u2019d done. \u201cDamn it, are you able to un-erase my memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And it is better that you do not know.\u201d</p><p>Which suggested he did. Frustration ran through me, but it was quickly forgotten when he brushed a fingertip down my cheek and rested it all too briefly on my lips. \u201cBut you are right about the revenge factor. Your father and Malin were lovers. Malin has commanded the Raziq for a very long time, and she is nearing the end of her life. She wanted to reproduce. Your father refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought that when the Aedh were at the end of their life cycles, breeding wasn\u2019t a matter of choice, but rather an imperative they couldn\u2019t ignore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did my father turn to my mother when he had the option of a full-blood Aedh to breed with?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYour father is an uncommonly powerful Aedh, and one who has long planned domination. It would not surprise me if he foresaw the current problems and created you as a means of working around the Raziq and finding the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he\u2019d known the keys would be lost, why the hell wouldn\u2019t he just ensure that they weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there were other players involved, and Hieu could not control them all. And perhaps you were nothing more than just a backup plan.\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s something every child wanted to hear\u2014although when it came to my father, nothing should really surprise me. \u201cHow come you know so much about Hieu and Malin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen one is a hunter, it helps to understand the prey.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t see either of them giving those sorts of details to their own kind, let alone a reaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. But the Raziq are nearly a hundred strong. It was simply a matter of capturing one of the unwary, lesser beings, and questioning him.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it takes. Whatever needs to be done. The words rolled around the outer reaches of my mind, and though I didn\u2019t know if they were mine or his, I shivered. Because those words were like a death knell ringing in my future.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would the lower-ranked Raziq be privy to information like that, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAedh can read the minds of any who are in close proximity, and though Malin and Hieu are powerful enough to conceal information, they would have considered their relationship neither valuable nor important.\u201d</p><p>Because they didn\u2019t do emotions\u2014although they did seem to have the whole revenge thing down pat.</p><p>I sighed wearily. \u201cThis is all becoming a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Azriel raised an eyebrow, amusement briefly teasing his lips. \u201cBecoming?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cYeah, I guess that train left the station long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d He hesitated, his gaze sweeping my body before coming to rest briefly on my lips. Desire spun around me, but its sweet heat disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t disagree with that. But I also didn\u2019t want to get into that bed alone.</p><p>\u201cAzriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI want what you want, Risa, but it is better that we fight this. Assimilation is a very real threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not assimilation you truly fear, is it?\u201d I said it softly, my gaze searching his. Looking for the emotions he was never going to reveal, but that I nevertheless knew were there. The hum of them echoed through the deeper parts of my being, warm and precious.</p> <p>For a moment I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer, but then he said softly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen for once tell me the truth, Azriel. What is it you truly fear?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was longer this time.</p><p>\u201cWhat I fear,\u201d he said eventually, \u201cis us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Of all the answers I\u2019d expected, that certainly wasn\u2019t one of them. I reached for him, but he stepped away from me.</p><p>\u201cYou do not understand,\u201d he said, his mismatched blue eyes glowing with a fierceness that was part determination, part desperation. \u201cI have a task to achieve, one that is vitally important to both our worlds. I cannot let emotion get in the way or cloud my judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t about emotion\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>His words should have made me want to dance. Instead, they scared the hell out of me. Because he was right. Whatever this thing between us actually was, it was certainly more than just sexual attraction. It had the potential to be something far deeper, far stronger. It was something that could change both our lives, in ways I couldn\u2019t even begin to see or imagine.</p><p>But he obviously could, and that\u2019s what scared me.</p><p>I licked suddenly dry lips and said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve feared this all along, then why did you give in to desire in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was without flaws, I would not be a dark angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s only made things worse.\u201d</p><p>Because now we both knew just how good we were together. And we were both aware that what we\u2019d shared was only a beginning, that there was a whole lot more left unexplored between us.</p><p>\u201cI understand that now, but I cannot undo what has been done.\u201d He paused, then added softly, \u201cNor would I want to. When all this is over and we resume our separate lives, I will at least have something to cherish, even if it is only a memory.\u201d</p><p>Tears prickled my eyes. Goddamn it, I did want an end to the madness. I did want life to resume normalcy. But at the same time, I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine my life without Azriel\u2019s presence in it.</p><p>Which only testified to just how much I\u2019d come to care for my stubborn reaper.</p><p>\u201cWe both hunger for things that should not be,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cBut for the sake of our worlds, it cannot be.\u201d</p><p>It was very tempting to just say fuck our worlds, what about us? I\u2019d always been one to fight for what I wanted, but this was a very different situation. What I wanted\u2014what he wanted\u2014really didn\u2019t matter in the bigger scheme of things. It never had.</p><p>God, I wanted to scream about the unfairness of it all. But that wouldn\u2019t help anyone. I guess I just had to pull on my big-girl britches and deal with the situation as best I could.</p><p>\u201cThat is all the fates can expect of either of us,\u201d he agreed softly.</p><p>\u201cThe fates need to be fucking shot,\u201d I muttered, then thrust a hand through my hair. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to bed alone, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you are.\u201d His words were as flat as his expression, but behind the facade, frustration burned, and it was every bit as deep as mine.</p><p>I forced myself to turn around and climb into bed. Drew the covers up and told myself to sleep.</p><p>Which I did.</p><p>Eventually.</p><p>And not before a very long battle against the urge to get up and claim what we both desired.</p><p>The phone woke me hours later. I groped for it blindly, then realized I\u2019d actually left it in my bag, which was still sitting on a nearby chair. But before I could muster the energy to move, it appeared in my right hand.</p><p>I opened a bleary eye, and came face-to-face with Azriel. \u201cIt is Rhoan,\u201d he said, rather unnecessarily. The ringtone informed me of that much.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he has some good news for a change,\u201d I muttered, then hit the ANSWER button. Rhoan\u2019s face appeared onscreen, and the high-pitched wail of a siren just about blew my eardrum out. I hastily turned down the sound and said, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re on your way to catch the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope so.\u201d If the dark circles under Rhoan\u2019s eyes were any indication, he\u2019d been getting even less sleep than me. \u201cAnd not only do we have a possible location, we have a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you discover that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember suggesting we investigate the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, inside we discovered a marijuana crop that had to have a street value of at least four million. Naturally, there was all sorts of security to protect this investment, including cameras.\u201d He smiled. \u201cActually, your presence must have spooked them, because they were in the process of dismantling and bagging when we arrived. We caught all of them.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least some good had come out of Dani\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m gathering the cameras also picked up the coming and going of our killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And he wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s blind, it makes sense he\u2019d have an assistant.\u201d I paused. \u201cHe did have a face, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a butt-ugly one it is, too. Actually, that could apply to him as a whole.\u201d</p><p>Which made you wonder how he was hooking his victims. But then, sometimes it wasn\u2019t about looks. Sometimes it was about aura and power. And from what I\u2019d seen on the astral plane, our killer had those in spades.</p><p>\u201cSo who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going by the name of Zane Taylor, but we can only trace his existence back about five years, which is when he landed in Australia. We\u2019re currently checking the Croatian and Slovenian databases to see if we can find a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man by the name of Jason Bright. He\u2019s an IT specialist with a history of hacking into high-profile companies and then selling their information on the black market. He\u2019s served a smattering of time, but he\u2019s been flying under the radar since he was released five years ago.\u201d</p><p>If he was an IT specialist, why wouldn\u2019t he have done something about the cameras to stop them from recording their presence? It wouldn\u2019t have been that hard for someone who knew what they were doing\u2014Stane could have managed it with his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cMeaning the two of them somehow hooked up when Zane arrived in Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than likely.\u201d He glanced sideways, said something to whoever was in the car with him, then added, \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to Bright\u2019s last known address now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe address listed in the system was for an apartment that was torn down years ago. But his bank records show activity in the same vicinity as Bright\u2019s house, so we\u2019re hoping they share a residence and we can nab them both.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be that easy. No way, nohow. Our faceless killer might now have both a name and a face, but he seemed way too smart to leave such an obvious trail.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me after you raid the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019m sending through pics of both men, just in case this is little more than a diversion and they\u2019re actually coming after you.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through me. He was coming after me. I knew that for a fact, but at least knowing what he looked like would give me a small advantage.</p><p>Not that it would matter if he came in astral form.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, won\u2019t you? I\u2019d hate to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, I\u2019ve been doing this for more years than you\u2019ve been alive.\u201d Amusement and warmth filled his voice. \u201cEven if Taylor and Bright were aware of the cameras and have done a runner, they won\u2019t have had time to clear away all the evidence. We\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t worried about Rhoan and the Directorate finding them. I was worried about our killers finding him. After all, he was the one who\u2019d pointed out how little respect Taylor seemed to have for the Directorate\u2014and maybe that was because he was always one step ahead of them.</p><p>I had a horrible suspicion he was still one step ahead of all of us.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cJust . . . good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying about me, dear Risa, and just make sure you keep alert until we catch this bastard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch when we have him.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, but the phone beeped immediately as two messages came in. I opened them to discover the faces of both my hunter and his assistant.</p> <p>As Rhoan had noted, Zane was one hell of an ugly man. His face was round and puffy, the left side so scarred that it almost looked like it had melted. His hair was sparse and the same nondescript brown as his eyes, and his nose large.</p><p>Jason Bright, his companion in crime, had thin features, thick-framed black glasses, and dirty blond hair. He was the sort of man you wouldn\u2019t look twice at on the street. The sort of man who looked totally and absolutely harmless.</p><p>And yet it was no doubt thanks to him that Zane had discovered my home address. If he could hack into the systems of high-profile companies, it would have been easy enough to gain access to the security company that monitored Vonda\u2019s and Dani\u2019s homes.</p><p>And maybe he was the reason the Directorate hadn\u2019t been having much luck tracking Zane. If he was so damn good, then it wouldn\u2019t have been too hard to get into the Directorate system and see what they were up to. After all, Stane could do exactly that\u2014though he hadn\u2019t recently because the Directorate had increased security and he preferred to stay out of jail.</p><p>I took one more look at the killer who was hunting me, then dumped the phone on the nearby pillow and closed my eyes. Weariness still rode me, but it was nowhere near as deep as it had been. I half wondered if Azriel had given me a little energy boost while I\u2019d slept.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt would not have been wise.\u201d</p><p>To touch you. The unspoken part of that sentence swam through my thoughts. Frustration rose like a wave and threatened to swamp me yet again.</p><p>Get it under control, I reminded myself fiercely. Accept the reality and just move on.</p><p>But saying that, and actually doing it, were two entirely different things.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked eventually. I could have opened my eyes and looked at the nearby clock\u2014hell, I could have picked up my phone and looked\u2014but right now either required too much effort.</p><p>\u201cFour o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA.m. or p.m.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cP.m.\u201d</p><p>That did wake me. \u201cSo I\u2019ve slept for over twelve hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it. You were running far too close to the edge of exhaustion, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to do anything else considering what keeps getting thrown at me,\u201d I muttered. I flipped the covers away from my face and sat up.</p><p>Azriel\u2019s gaze swept me briefly, then moved away. But not before I\u2019d caught the flash of desire in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTao has gone to the restaurant to deal with the council inspectors.\u201d His voice was back to its formal self. \u201cStane has coffee percolating, Coke in the fridge, and bacon and eggs on standby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need all three. But I need a shower first.\u201d</p> <p>I forced myself out of bed, raided Stane\u2019s closet for an old T-shirt to wear between here and the bathroom, then grabbed my toiletries and clothes and headed out.</p><p>Stane swiveled around in his chair and gave me an appreciative once-over. \u201cThat T-shirt looks a lot better on you than it does on me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHow did the game go last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thoroughly thrashed the opposition, and moved up several levels in the process. What would you like to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzriel mentioned bacon and eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said, and practically bounced toward his kitchen.</p><p>I quickly showered and dressed. Though Azriel wasn\u2019t present in body, he was still nearby, still keeping watch. The heat of him washed across my skin like a summer breeze, warm and sultry.</p><p>I once again forced myself to thrust away the growing slithers of desire, and followed the delicious aroma of fried bacon back out into the kitchen portion of his open living area.</p><p>Stane slid both a Coke and a mug of steaming coffee over to me, then flipped the eggs. \u201cI did that search for Henry Mack, Jason Marks, and Mark Jackson.\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment to remember that Mack, Marks, and Jackson were the aliases of the Razan we\u2019d knocked out in the cavern where the hellhounds had attacked us.</p><p>I propped on the nearby stool. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you might have already guessed, neither the Mack nor Marks identity actually exists. The Jackson one does, although if it is the same man, he\u2019s over a hundred years old.\u201d He served up the bacon and eggs, then picked up his coffee and leaned his elbows on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s listed as a Middle East war veteran,\u201d I said, alternating between speaking, eating, and drinking, \u201cthen it\u2019s the same man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting, given that the photos of his recent incarnations suggest he\u2019s not more than forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a little magical help.\u201d</p><p>Stane snorted. \u201cThen they should package that and make a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s the sort of magical help you wouldn\u2019t want. It amounts to slavery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that they can keep.\u201d He grimaced and drank some more coffee. \u201cThe address listed for both the Mack and Marks identities is Railway Crescent, Broadmeadows, but I couldn\u2019t find them listed as tenants in the apartments there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because he actually lives in Dawson Street, Brunswick West.\u201d If what Uncle Quinn had pulled from his mind was to be believed, anyway. \u201cAny chance of you checking to see if there\u2019s a traffic camera nearby, and monitoring it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can check. Can\u2019t promise results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou know, a crate or two of Bollinger wouldn\u2019t go astray. I\u2019m almost out of the last lot.\u201d</p><p>I choked down a laugh. \u201cDone deal. And cheap at half the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall double the price next time.\u201d</p><p>He could triple the price and it would still be cheap. The information he kept getting for us was invaluable.</p><p>I scooped up the last of the egg yolk with a piece of bacon, then pushed the plate away with a contented sigh. \u201cThat was delish. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. I normally only stock frozen meals, but Mom insisted on having real stuff while she was here.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cMothers are funny like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d His voice was gloomy, but there was a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s even insisting I meet the daughter of one of her friends before she leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe daughter might be hot, you know.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not the hotness that matters, it\u2019s the nerd factor. Most women these days have absolutely no appreciation of either the fine art of hacking or black marketeering. And they always want to dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven forbid,\u201d I said, voice dry.</p><p>\u201cI know! What is with that?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, but didn\u2019t reply as my phone rang. The tone told me it was Lucian, so I excused myself and walked into Stane\u2019s bedroom to answer it.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d he said, his voice low and intimate. Just the sound of it had desire stirring, and though I suspected it wasn\u2019t entirely \u201creal,\u201d it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Nor did Ilianna\u2019s leafy charm appear to mute that reaction.</p><p>But maybe it only worked for face-to-face confrontations. I had to hope so, because if I was going to continue my relationship with Lucian, I wanted it to be because I chose to, not because I was under some sort of compulsion spell.</p><p>\u201cHello, yourself,\u201d I said, keeping my voice as even as possible. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Surprise flitted briefly through the bright depths of his eyes. Obviously, he\u2019d been expecting a stronger response.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can think of one or two things, but the point of the call is what I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>The emphasis he placed on I and you had all sorts of wicked images floating through my mind. I cleared my throat and said, \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the obvious, you mean?\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cYeah, besides that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren believes she might have an answer to our dilemma.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to race a little faster. Now that the moment was here, I wasn\u2019t sure that I should go through with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say. She just said she needs to run a test to ensure it works, and for that she requires your presence.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cLucian, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt to check out what she has to offer,\u201d he interrupted, in a voice that wasn\u2019t about to brook any argument. \u201cAfter all, it may not even work.\u201d</p><p>I had to hope so, because I really didn\u2019t want to be in debt to a dark sorcerer.</p><p>So why even bother going? Azriel\u2019s thought was knife sharp.</p><p>Because I need to know. About whatever magic our dark sorceress had come up with, and about the charm that now encircled my wrist.</p><p>And if the charm doesn\u2019t work?</p><p>Then I guess you have the choice of watching, joining in, or keeping your distance. My reply was somewhat tight. I might understand his reasons for keeping his distance, I might even agree that it was for the best when it came to the task still ahead of us, but that didn\u2019t give him the right to get pissy whenever I happened to be talking to\u2014or was with\u2014Lucian. Even if he had placed a compulsion spell on me.</p><p>I half expected Azriel to disappear in another huff, but he merely crossed his arms and gave me his impassive, not-thinking, not-feeling face.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Risa,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cYou there?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut obviously didn\u2019t hear a word I just said,\u201d he said, amusement teasing the corners of his eyes. \u201cThat reaper giving you grief again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a very good liar, my girl. I said, Lauren will be here at five, if you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s \u2018here\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apartment, not the club.\u201d He paused, then gave me a wide grin. My stupid hormones did a happy little two-step. \u201cAlthough we could visit the club afterward, if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s fancy-dress night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA fancy-dress night sounds a little too tame for your tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that, then we obviously need to go. And it will be my extreme pleasure to teach you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d I said, trying not to smile. \u201cLet\u2019s meet with Lauren, and see how that goes first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you can get here by five?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the clock. It was close to five now, but it wouldn\u2019t take me that long to get there by taxi. I could travel by Aedh form, but even though I felt a whole lot stronger after eating and sleeping, I wasn\u2019t about to waste energy uselessly. Lucian and his dark sorceress would just have to wait if I was late.</p><p>\u201cDepends on the traffic,\u201d I said. \u201cBut probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then tossed the phone in my purse and walked to the bed to retrieve Amaya from under the pillow. Happy, not, she said, as I slung her over my back. Should not leave alone.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t my choice to get snatched without you, I replied, then wondered why in the hell I was justifying myself to my own damn sword. Maybe I was going crazy\u2014which would not be surprising given the mess my life was in at the moment.</p><p>I made the bed, then slung my purse over my shoulder and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cRisa, don\u2019t go,\u201d Azriel said softly.</p><p>Fuck it, Azriel, don\u2019t do this. I stopped. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I do not want you to go.\u201d</p><p>I flexed my fingers, and found myself reeling between the desire to do what he asked and the knowledge that what he was asking was wrong. \u201cYou were the one who said this quest was more important than anything else. If talking to this dark sorcereress gets us closer to the keys, then we have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not talking about the keys. I am talking about you and Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian has his place in this search, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not so much his place in this search that I object to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, you can\u2019t say things like that. Not after everything you said last night.\u201d And while a deeper part of me rejoiced at the admission, it mostly only added to the deepening well of frustration.</p><p>\u201cThere have been a lot of things I should not have said or done, Risa.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and showing me just how truly amazing we could be together, then snatching away the possibility of it ever happening again was certainly one of them.</p><p>\u201cYou said last night that I wasn\u2019t understanding the seriousness of the situation. Well, this time you\u2019re the one not understanding.\u201d I turned. There was very little in the way of emotion to be seen in his face. \u201cI might be part Aedh, but I am also werewolf. Sex may not be the necessity for me that it is for others of my kind, but by the same token, I do not want to live my life without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not asking\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d I said it fiercely, my fists clenched. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to stay out of Lucian\u2019s bed, and right now he\u2019s the only sexual partner I have. And don\u2019t suggest I seek out others, because I can\u2019t afford to bring anyone else into my life with all the shit that is happening. At least Lucian is fully able to protect himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is not to be trust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I cut in. \u201cBut then, who the hell am I supposed to trust in this whole debacle? Every single person involved in this quest is using me for their own reasons\u2014you, Lucian, Hunter, my father. Hell, even Jak\u2019s doing it to get a story, but at least with him it\u2019s a mutual thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tao, Ilianna, and Stane? They are not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my friends, and only part of this quest because I\u2019ve dragged them into it. They\u2019re not using me; they\u2019re trying to keep me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only because you need me to find the keys. If it came to a choice between saving me and gaining the keys, we both know I\u2019d be a goner.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. And whatever he was feeling, whatever he was thinking, he was keeping it all locked down very tightly.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this, Azriel. We can\u2019t keep arguing over this same point. Either you and I take the risk of deepening our relationship, or you accept the fact that I will take other lovers, be that Lucian or not.\u201d</p><p>He made a sharp \u201cwhatever\u201d motion with his hand. \u201cYou are right. I will not mention it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I spun on my heel and headed for the door.</p><p>But as I reached for the handle, he added, \u201cI told you once that reapers are sexual beings, that we mingle energies and recharge ourselves with other energy beings.\u201d</p><p>I paused, my fingers still on the door handle as I glanced over my shoulder. \u201cYes, so?\u201d</p><p>His expression was as remote as ever. \u201cSo, we can only recharge with those who possess a harmonious frequency, and such compatibility is not widespread. When a connection is found, it is to be cherished.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not getting the link between this and what we were discussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe connection,\u201d he said softly, \u201cis the fact that I can recharge with you.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. To say I was surprised was an understatement. Hell, I was flesh and blood, and he was energy. How was something like that even possible?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a reaper. I\u2019ll never be a reaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d</p><p>My confusion deepened. \u201cSo what exactly are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I merely explain what you see as unreasonable behavior.\u201d He hesitated, and something flashed through his eyes, something that resembled pain. \u201cI once had a recharge companion, but she was killed while escorting a soul through the dark portals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need for your sorrow. She died long ago, and was not my Caomh. While I regret her passing, it was not a life-altering event.\u201d</p><p>Caomh was the reaper equivalent of a life mate if I\u2019d understood the little Azriel had said about them. \u201cSo, is the fact that you can recharge through me a sign that the assimilation threat is greater than you were admitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am, as I said, merely explaining why I react to Lucian\u2019s presence in your affections.\u201d</p><p>Because he wanted to protect something that was rare and precious in his world. And yet, at the same time, he was desperate to avoid it because he feared that it might cloud his judgment when it came to his task here. No wonder he seemed all over the place when it came to the two of us.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to reapers who do not find someone who is compatible energy wise?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTheir life span is shortened. Even energy beings eventually need some means of sustaining themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo recharging is as much about food as sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you survive so long without your recharge partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI survive because recharging for a reaper is not the everyday necessity that it is for flesh-and-blood beings. We can go eons before the lack affects us.\u201d</p><p>Thank god I wasn\u2019t a reaper, then, because I actually enjoyed the daily necessity of food and sex.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been put in this position, Azriel, but I can\u2019t stop living my life because you and I share what is rare in your world\u2014especially when it\u2019s something you fear will endanger us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand this now and, as I said, I will not mention it again.\u201d He hesitated briefly, and again emotion flashed through his eyes. This time, though, I couldn\u2019t really define what it was. \u201cI just wanted to explain why I react as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t actually explained why you can recharge with me, when I\u2019m not a full energy being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to continue, but when it became obvious he wouldn\u2019t, I turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>It was the hardest thing I\u2019d ever had to do, given that all I really wanted to do was to wrap myself in Azriel\u2019s arms and let the rest of the world go to hell.</p><p>Which was still a very real possibility if we didn\u2019t get to the remaining keys first.</p><p>I was half an hour late by the time I got to Lucian\u2019s. Even though we\u2019d been going against most of the traffic to get into the city, it was still peak hour, and that generally meant madness no matter which side of the road you were on.</p><p>I climbed out of the taxi and stared up at the old Victorian building. There were still workmen on-site, despite the fact it was nearing five thirty. Maybe they were making use of daylight savings and trying to get ahead of schedule. My gaze swept the top floor, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I was searching for. The windows were covered by heavy plastic, so even if Lucian had been standing at one of them, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see him.</p><p>I took a deep breath, then released it slowly, but it didn\u2019t do much to ease the tension slithering through me. And standing here wasn\u2019t doing a whole lot for it, either. I waited for a tram to pass, then crossed the road and made my way through the scaffolding into his building.</p><p>The old lift rattled upward and came to a bouncing halt at the top floor. The doors groaned open, but it took me several seconds before I could force myself out.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether the reluctance stemmed from not wanting to meet with the dark sorceress or not wanting to have my suspicions about Lucian confirmed.</p><p>Damn it, I liked sex. I especially liked having sex with Lucian. I didn\u2019t want a return to the nun-like state I\u2019d been in before this madness had all begun.</p><p>Of course, confirmation that he\u2019d placed a compulsion spell on me wasn\u2019t exactly a deal breaker, but it would worry me. If he was being dishonest about that, then what the hell else was he being dishonest about?</p><p>I walked through the clouds of dust that filled the room, my footsteps echoing softly in the vast emptiness. There were no workmen on this floor, just the sound of their jackhammers and whatnot echoing up from the floors below. Lucian\u2019s lemongrass and suede scent filled the sub-layers within the dusty air, but it was entwined with an energy that was uneasy and shadowed. His dark sorceress was here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I snuck under a dustcover and entered the kitchen. Except for the addition of four folding chairs, the room hadn\u2019t changed since the last time I\u2019d been here. Lucian and Lauren stood near the chairs, but there was nothing relaxed about either of them. In fact, the heat in Lauren\u2019s cheeks and her sharp gestures very much suggested I\u2019d walked in on the middle of an argument. Hell, Lucian was all but hissing in her face.</p><p>And yet, something in the way they stood\u2014in their very closeness\u2014was oddly intimate.</p><p>Unfortunately, thanks to all the noise the builders were making, I caught only a couple of chopped-up sentences of his conversation with the sorceress\u2014it means nothing, I will have my revenge regardless.</p> <p>And while Lucian had made no secret of either aim, I had to wonder why he was now saying those words to a sorceress he claimed to barely know.</p><p>Because he is a liar. And have no doubt that he will not only lie, but cheat, steal, and kill to gain what he wants. Azriel could have been talking about the weather, for all the emotion he showed, yet we both knew that was as far from the truth as you could get. What we cannot be truly sure of yet is what, exactly, he wants.</p><p>He says revenge, and that\u2019s the one thing I truly do believe he\u2019s being honest about.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>And perhaps he was just incapable of seeing the forest for the trees where Lucian was concerned.</p> <p>That is an incongruous statement.</p><p>But true.</p><p>Possibly.</p><p>As I drew closer, Lucian swung around and gave me a wide grin of greeting. Any sign of anger had completely disappeared. My gaze flicked briefly from his face to Lauren\u2019s. She looked regal and composed\u2014a woman certain of her place and power rather than one who\u2019d seemed ready to tear eyeballs out just moments ago.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Lucian said, the amusement in his eyes at odds with the rebuke in his words. \u201cI was beginning to think you\u2019d had second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m here doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He dropped an overly polite kiss on my cheek, and again I had to wonder if the argument I\u2019d witnessed had been about sex. The only time he\u2019d ever been so frugal with his kisses was when she\u2019d been witness to them.</p><p>And while I was aware that he had a stable of bed partners, I certainly hadn\u2019t expected one of them to be a dark practitioner. Nor was I entirely sure how I felt about it.</p><p>But at least it did explain the heady scent of sex and blood I\u2019d smelled when I\u2019d entered the room at Maxwell\u2019s\u2014it had come from their activities rather than from those on the main dance floor.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA Coke would be good.\u201d</p><p>He tsked. \u201cAnd I had my best champagne on ice, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it for when we\u2019ve got something to celebrate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>My reply was somewhat absent as movement caught my gaze. Lauren folded gracefully onto a chair and crossed her legs. The bright lights gave her dark hair a purple sheen but shadowed her face, softening her stern, somewhat matronly features. Once again I had that odd sense of familiarity, but I still couldn\u2019t place who she reminded me of. Although she did remind me somewhat of a spider. A big black one, sitting in the middle of her nest and contemplating the world around her as she waited for her prey to fall into her web.</p><p>\u201cTake a seat,\u201d Lucian directed. \u201cI\u2019ll grab your drink.\u201d</p><p>I claimed the chair nearest to Lucian\u2019s, and Lauren gave me a thin smile. \u201cAnd still you distrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much you as your profession.\u201d</p><p>She raised one thin eyebrow. \u201cWhich is not saying much given my profession is who and what I am.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take that statement, so I didn\u2019t say anything. Lucian returned and handed me a can of Coke, then sat down between us.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, picking up his glass of wine from the floor. \u201cAs I said on the phone, Lauren believes she has come up with a possible answer.\u201d</p><p>My gaze flicked to hers. Those icy depths watched me closely, and the hairs on the back of my neck rose. Not because of the intensity of her gaze, but rather the hatred so very evident in it.</p><p>Why the hell would someone I\u2019d barely even met hate me so much? Or was it not so much me, but the fact that she considered me a sexual rival?</p><p>If she thought that, then she didn\u2019t understand Lucian. But maybe she hadn\u2019t even known he was Aedh until he\u2019d told her about the device in my heart. She might be knowledgeable about the dark arts and the denizens of hell, but that didn\u2019t mean she had any expertise when it came to the beings who inhabited the gray fields.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not committing to anything until I know exactly what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He said it soothingly, like a parent talking to a spooked child. Irritation swirled, but I forced myself to ignore it and kept my gaze on Lauren.</p><p>\u201cIt is not a spell, so you have nothing to fear along those lines,\u201d she said easily. A little too easily for my liking. It sounded like a well-rehearsed line more than anything approaching sincerity.</p><p>I took a sip of Coke, but it failed to help the sudden dryness in my throat. Despite what I\u2019d said to Azriel earlier, I really didn\u2019t want to be here discussing magic with a dark practitioner. And yet, it was an avenue that had to be explored. We do what we have to do, Azriel had once told me. It was that statement that had driven me to enlist Jak\u2019s help, and if it also meant enlisting the help of a sorceress, then so be it.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it if not a spell?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Lucian. And that had all sorts of alarm bells ringing, if only because it suggested they\u2019d discussed just what she should and shouldn\u2019t say before I\u2019d gotten here.</p><p>Had that been another part of what they\u2019d been arguing about? I knew Lucian was desperate to gain revenge on the Raziq, who\u2019d stolen not only his wings but also his ability to shift into Aedh form, but was he so desperate that he would advise a dark sorceress what to say\u2014and not say\u2014to convince me to use her magic?</p><p>I briefly studied his angelic face and saw a determination that bordered on ruthlessness. Yes, I thought, he was.</p><p>Lauren took a sip of her wine, then casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s a ward.\u201d</p><p>I waved the statement away. \u201cYou and I both know there\u2019s a million different kinds of wards.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It didn\u2019t do a whole lot to ease the tension. Quite the opposite, in fact. \u201cThis one is designed to prevent magic escaping its boundaries once it has been activated.\u201d</p><p>So, similar to the wards Ilianna had used when we\u2019d attempted to read the clues in the book my father had sent me\u2014a book that had been subsequently destroyed when the elementals had attacked. \u201cHow is it powered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by blood magic, if that is what you fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how does it get its power? You felt the energy of the thing in my heart. You know it\u2019s not a creation of this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I do not use the magic of this world.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, my stomach twisting into knots. \u201cYou exploit the power of hell to create your spells? That is a very dangerous practice\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted, the sound unladylike and at odds with the image she was projecting. \u201cI think I understand better than you just what it is I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I doubted that. I might not have had much experience with hell and its denizens, but I did have a healthy respect for just how dangerous they could be\u2014something Lauren appeared to have lost.</p><p>\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t think a ward powered by the energy of hell is something I should be handling.\u201d Especially not when I had a sword at my back eager to kill all things related to hell.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot make that judgment without at least looking at it,\u201d Lucian commented. \u201cI have handled it without harm, and its magic seems no better or worse than what the Raziq use.\u201d</p><p>I cast him a somewhat wry look. \u201cYou would say that, given how desperate you are for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot deny I have a stake in this device working. If we get the remaining keys, we can force a confrontation with the Raziq.\u201d He hesitated, and something flickered briefly in his eyes. Something that was altogether too dark for my liking. \u201cThat is something I have long desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you confront the Raziq, you\u2019ll be dead. There\u2019s too many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not suicidal, dear Risa.\u201d He slid his hand under my skirt and gently squeezed my thigh. His fingers were warm and familiar, but there was no must-have-you-now-or-I\u2019m-going-to-melt hormonal attack. Which didn\u2019t mean it had no effect, just that my response was basically normal when being intimately touched by someone who was as sexy as all get-out. The charm, it seemed, was working. He added, \u201cI plan to be around to devastate your bed long after the keys are history and the Raziq are little more than a bad memory.\u201d</p><p>Anger stirred the air, a sharp burst that was quickly contained. I glanced at Lauren. Her expression was as calm and as regal as ever. The only sign that the flash had come from her was the whiteness of her knuckles as she gripped her wineglass. But the moment she caught the direction of my glance, her grip eased. I resisted the temptation to smile. Lauren was in for one hell of a shock if she thought Lucian would ever stay with just her.</p><p>Although it had to be said, if they were lovers, then Lucian was playing with fire. A sorceress wouldn\u2019t be someone you\u2019d want to make an enemy of.</p><p>\u201cWhich is presuming I\u2019d actually want you in my bed by then.\u201d</p><p>Amusement crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cOf course you will. I\u2019m a magnificent lover, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are is conceited, Lucian Dupont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not conceit when it\u2019s the truth.\u201d But he removed his hand and took a drink of wine. His gaze, I noted, went to Lauren, almost as if he were daring her to react.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, after a moment, \u201cwe are not here to discuss my bedroom skills, but rather the ward. And I reiterate, it cannot harm you to simply look at it.\u201d</p><p>That statement should not be taken at face value when dealing with someone involved in the dark arts, Azriel commented.</p><p>I know that, Azriel. I\u2019m not a total ignoramus about magic, so please don\u2019t treat me as such.</p> <p>I merely comment. It was not a rebuke.</p><p>Well, it sure as hell had felt like one. I drank some Coke, then met Lauren\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cI thought you said it had to be fine-tuned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. To work fully it has to be tuned to your energy.\u201d</p><p>Energy, or aura? I very much suspected the latter, and that had my doubts rising even higher. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my purse. Lucian?\u201d</p> <p>He rose and walked over to the bench. I put my Coke down and followed. I wanted some distance between me and Lauren when I studied her creation.</p><p>Her purse was black leather, and was about as far from feminine as you could get. In fact, it looked more like an over-the-shoulder briefcase than an actual handbag. Lucian gamely delved into it, and his hand came out holding what looked like an oversized die. Only there were no dots on its black surface, which held an odd sort of oiliness that gleamed in the sharp overhead lighting. He set it down on the counter in front of me.</p><p>I leaned closer, but didn\u2019t immediately try to touch it. Despite the oddness of the surface, there was no sense of energy radiating off the black stone. It really could have been nothing more than a numberless die.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t bite,\u201d Lauren said, amusement clear in her voice. She hadn\u2019t moved, but I had an odd sense that she missed nothing, despite the fact that I had my back to her.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for not taking you at your word.\u201d I shifted around to study the other side of the die. It didn\u2019t look any different, and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure why I\u2019d bothered moving.</p><p>\u201cHere, look.\u201d Lucian picked up the die and deftly tossed it from hand to hand. \u201cSee? Nothing bad happens when you touch it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgreed, nothing bad happens when you touch it,\u201d I muttered, my unease growing as I watched the toss of the stone. \u201cBut this thing is supposed to tune itself to me, and I\u2019m not exactly believing everything will be fine and dandy when it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of . . . Nothing is going happen.\u201d Exasperation rode Lauren\u2019s voice. \u201cLucian would not allow it, even if I had wished you harm.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at her sharply. \u201cSince when does a dark sorceress take orders from someone she barely knows?\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s smile was thin and unamused. \u201cCome now, Risa. You saw us arguing and you are no fool. Please do not take me for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are lovers?\u201d My gaze went to Lucian. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that up front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t pertinent.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. How could the fact that he was fucking a dark sorceress not be pertinent information? \u201cAnd just how did you come to that conclusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I spend my time with is nobody\u2019s business but my own.\u201d The comment was decidedly barbed, and I couldn\u2019t help glancing at Lauren. If his words annoyed her, she wasn\u2019t showing it. This time. \u201cThe only reason Lauren is here now is because she is powerful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, but it does make me wonder what else you\u2019re not telling me, Lucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that my life revolves around the need for revenge\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cand it\u2019s what you\u2019ll do to get it that has me worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you\u2019re not behind the compulsion spell that\u2019s been placed on me?\u201d</p><p>My voice was matter-of-fact, and his sudden grin was warm and unrepentant. \u201cI feared my Aedh charms might not have been enough to hold you, so I stacked the odds in my favor. But the spell is harmless, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this one is, but the next one might not be.\u201d</p><p>He held up his right hand. \u201cI promise, I will place no more spells on you.\u201d</p><p>And you can trust every word out of a liar\u2019s mouth, Azriel commented.</p><p>Have you ever heard the saying \u201cIf you can\u2019t say something nice, say nothing?\u201d</p><p>I do not believe so. Nor can I help commenting when he makes such blatantly unbelievable statements.</p><p>It was pointless saying anything further when I was never going to convince him that Lucian was remotely trustworthy, so I didn\u2019t bother. Especially since I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure of it myself.</p><p>I crossed my arms and said, \u201cAnd what about getting other people to place spells on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t do that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean there\u2019s no other spells on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not need more than one.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t actually confirmation that there were no other spells, just that he hadn\u2019t actually needed them. I eyed him for a moment, then sighed softly and waved a hand. \u201cFine. Give me a closer look at the ward.\u201d</p><p>He pushed it toward me. I studied it dubiously for several minutes, then gathered together the threads of my courage and reached for it.</p><p>No touch! Amaya screamed, the sound so high-pitched it made my eyes water.</p><p>At the same time, the Du\u0161an swiveled around in my flesh, its head near my knuckles as it snarled at the ward.</p><p>I snatched my fingers away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said, and stepped away from the counter.</p><p>Anger exploded around me, the force of it so fierce it stole my breath. My gaze snapped to Lucian\u2019s. There was no anger to be seen in his expression, not even the merest hint, but it had come from him nevertheless. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d he said, his voice as flat as his eyes.</p><p>I might as well have been looking into the eyes of death. A shiver that was part fear, part foreboding, rolled through me. \u201cWhat do you mean? Didn\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, my gaze searching his. \u201cThe Du\u0161an. It reacted to the ward.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at my wrist sharply. Now that I\u2019d stepped away, the Du\u0161an had resumed her normal position on my arm. Amaya, however, was still eager to bite into whatever darkness Lauren had employed to make the ward, and she was letting me know it. Banshees had nothing on the noise she was currently making inside my head.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot in this case.\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cI can\u2019t use the ward, Lucian. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He contemplated me, his expression still remote, then turned and faced Lauren. \u201cIt would appear you have wasted your time and energy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lauren rose and moved toward us, her long dress flowing around her legs like the gray tendrils of a web. Definitely a dangerous, dark spider, I thought with another shiver.</p><p>But one who wasn\u2019t entirely surprised or annoyed by my actions, if her expression was anything to go by. My gaze returned to Lucian. Maybe she wasn\u2019t worried because she would still extract the price of the ward from him.</p><p>\u201cA foolish choice, but one that she nevertheless has the right to make.\u201d Her gaze came to mine. \u201cYou may yet regret this decision, however. There are worse things in this world\u2014and the next\u2014than this stone and the magic within it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than aware of that, believe me.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her fingers around the ward, then raised it to eye level and contemplated the oily black surface. \u201cIt is a thing of beauty, is it not?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, but then, she didn\u2019t seem to be expecting me to. She dropped the stone into her bag and then, with a glance at Lucian, turned and left.</p><p>I heaved a silent sigh of relief. One problem down, one silently seething Aedh to go. I hesitated, watching him, wondering if it was better to keep my distance, then shook the thought away. He might be angry, but he surely wouldn\u2019t hurt me. After all, he needed me alive just as much as everyone else did. I walked around the counter. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry to see the back\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of the sentence was cut off as Lucian\u2019s hand shot out and his fingers closed around my neck in a vise-like grip.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Shock held me immobile for too many seconds. By the time my brain did start working, my lungs were burning and my head was pounding\u2014a result of not only lack of air but Amaya\u2019s scream of fury.</p><p>But there was also fear. Not because of the sheer and utter fury in his eyes, but because, for one instant, it felt like his fingers were going through my flesh. That he would, at any minute, rip my throat apart from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve just done?\u201d He shook me with each word, as if to emphasize the point. \u201cYou just let what might be our one chance to win this race walk out the door!\u201d</p><p>I made a gargling sound and kicked him. The blow was weak, ill aimed, and went unnoticed. Amaya, I thought, and flayed my hands back, trying to reach her. I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. She burned through my flesh, answering my unspoken need.</p><p>Hurry, I thought, as spots began to dance in front of my eyes. Only they were spots that burned like fire. Furious, red-tinted blue fire.</p><p>Valdis, I realized dimly.</p><p>\u201cI have been looking for an excuse to kill you for some time now, Aedh,\u201d Azriel said softly. \u201cIf you do not immediately release her, I will have one.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Lucian didn\u2019t respond. Then the fury melted from his eyes and he blinked. A second later, I was a heap on the floor, coughing and spluttering and sucking in great gulps of air.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t on that floor alone for long\u2014Amaya had finished her journey through my flesh and had appeared in my right hand, her shadowed steel spitting dark purple fire as she hissed her displeasure and need to kill. I gripped her, then surged to my feet and aimed her point at the middle of Lucian\u2019s brow. My whole arm shook as I fought the urge to press farther, to let steel taste flesh and blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amaya did not appreciate my restraint.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you\u2019d do as I ask and not bring your sword into the company of a dark sorceress.\u201d His voice was calm, and there was little fear in his expression. The bastard knew I wouldn\u2019t kill him. That I couldn\u2019t\u2014not in such a cold-blooded manner, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know me as well as you thought.\u201d I pressed Amaya\u2019s point to the bridge of his nose. A thin stream of blood trickled from the wound. \u201cI may be many things, Lucian, but I\u2019m not stupid. That\u2019s what meeting Lauren without some form of personal protection would have been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have protected you.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to let Amaya bite just a little bit deeper. \u201cI think your actions just now show where your true allegiance lies, and it\u2019s certainly not with me. Or even, I\u2019d hazard a guess, with Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known for some time just how deep the well is when it comes to revenge.\u201d He reached out, but I snapped my head back and his caress hit my arm rather than my cheek. He let his hand drop again, but there was a brief flash of annoyance in his eyes. \u201cI am sorry for the anger. I didn\u2019t mean to harm or frighten you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done both. But, more important, he\u2019d shattered the trust I\u2019d had in him.</p><p>His reaction had been deep and unthinking. He hadn\u2019t seen me as a lover, or even as a person. I was just some thing that had sidetracked a means of gaining what he wanted.</p> <p>And he\u2019d hated me for that.</p><p>Hated me enough to want to kill me. He might not have meant to, but that would have been the end result if Azriel hadn\u2019t turned up.</p><p>Of course, I had no doubt he would have regretted the momentary lapse of sanity, given that both he and everyone else needed me alive to find the damn keys. But regret after the fact wouldn\u2019t have done me a whole lot of good.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are finished, Lucian.\u201d I stepped back and sheathed Amaya. Her grumbles filled the back of my thoughts, and though the noise had dropped from banshee territory, it was still sharp enough to bring on yet another headache. \u201cI can\u2019t be with someone I can\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, don\u2019t be stupid. I apologized and I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you meant,\u201d I interrupted testily. \u201cIt\u2019s what you did that matters. Damn it, Lucian, I saw the hate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat you saw was not aimed at you.\u201d Perhaps he saw my disbelief, because he added, a little more sarcastically, \u201cThere is only one person I actually hate in this room, and he can lower his sword. I really do not intend you harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could lower it, true,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cBut Valdis rather likes the taste of your flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know she will bite no further, as her master has no desire to flaunt reaper rules and thereby jeopardize becoming again what he once was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not be so sure of that, Aedh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all just going to stand here like this?\u201d he asked, the sarcasm stronger this time. \u201cThat could get a little tedious, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I think,\u201d I said, taking another step away from him, though my retreat wasn\u2019t just physical, \u201cis that Azriel was right. You will lie, cheat, steal, and fuck to get what you want. Nothing and no one else matters\u2014it\u2019s all about you and your endgame. And while I might have been able to forgive the lying, I can\u2019t forgive the attack. I don\u2019t want that sort of violence in my life. Not now, not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached for me again, but I slapped his hand away.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I mean it, Lucian,\u201d I said, anger and perhaps a touch of regret in my voice. Whatever else he was, he\u2019d been a good lover, and I mourned the loss of that if nothing else. \u201cYou and I are finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs lovers, perhaps, but you will need another sword when it comes to finding the keys. Our last attempt proved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather fight alone than fight with someone who plays this game for reasons he has not yet fully disclosed,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I asked for your opinion, reaper,\u201d Lucian snapped, then flexed his fingers and added, \u201cI intend to remain part of this quest, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s an option no longer open to you.\u201d</p><p>My voice was resolute, but deep inside, doubt stirred. There was a saying about keeping your friends close, but your enemies closer. If Lucian was playing a deeper, darker game than mere revenge, it might be far better to keep him around and keep an eye on him.</p><p>That is a very dangerous game to play with one such as him, Azriel commented.</p><p>Perhaps, but I just get the feeling that there\u2019s more going on here than what we think.</p><p>Have I not been saying that? It was wryly said, even if there was a hint of rebuke embedded within the words.</p><p>You\u2019ve said a lot of things, reaper, most of them nasty in regard to Lucian.</p><p>He deserves nothing less.</p><p>\u201cI will not be kept apart from this quest, Risa.\u201d Lucian\u2019s voice was resolute. Dark. Almost as dark as the gleam in his eyes. \u201cWhatever it takes, whatever I have to do, I will be there when you search for the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get in our way, if you attempt to harm or spell or do anything else to me or my friends, I\u2019ll kill you myself,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>And there went any idea of keeping a close eye on him.</p><p>\u201cWarning heeded,\u201d he said. The madness and hate flared again, so strong I could taste it. And while he appeared to have it under control, it nevertheless scared the hell out of me. I\u2019d been sleeping with that darkness. It could have overtaken him\u2014and me\u2014at any time. \u201cAnd now, heed this. Vengeance is mine, and the keys play a major part in that. I will not be deterred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we both know where we stand.\u201d I grabbed my purse and slung it over my shoulder. \u201cIt was fun while it lasted, Lucian.\u201d</p><p>With that, I turned and walked out.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t stop walking until I was out of his building and well down the street.</p><p>That\u2019s when the shaking began.</p><p>I leaned back against the nearby shopfront and sank down, wrapping my arms around my knees as I sucked in great gulps of air. I felt like crying like a baby again, and all I wanted to do was scream, why, why, WHY? to the heavens.</p><p>Just this once, it would have been nice to catch a break, to have my suspicions proved wrong. Why the hell couldn\u2019t fate play nice for a change? Just one break\u2014surely to god that wasn\u2019t too much to damn well ask?</p><p>\u201cIt would seem that it is,\u201d Azriel said softly. He sank down in front of me and placed his hands on my thighs. His touch was like fire, and it chased away the shivers and lent me strength. \u201cI am sorry that it has come to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d I shot back, taking offense where none was intended. \u201cYou wanted Lucian out of my life, and now he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is undeniably true,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I do not wish to see you in such pain. Believe that, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>I did believe it. Just as I believed that the pain I was feeling now\u2014a pain that came from betrayal rather than any emotional depth\u2014was only just the beginning.</p><p>I rubbed my eyes wearily. \u201cThis has all become so totally fucked, Azriel. All I\u2019ve ever wanted is an ordinary life, and that seems so far beyond me now I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever get it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never anything ordinary about you or your life, Risa, however much you might have convinced yourself otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. The restaurant was ordinary, falling in love with Jak and then getting my heart broken was ordinary, wanting kids and a family sometime in the future is very, very ordinary. That\u2019s what I want back, and yet all of those things may now never be.\u201d My gaze pinned his. Deep in those turbulent blue depths I saw the acknowledgment of my words. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands around mine and squeezed lightly. Longing shivered through me, but sadly, he was just another desire that was never meant to be.</p><p>\u201cNothing is ever written in stone, Risa. Fate is a fluid thing that changes with every decision and action. The future I see and the one you fear might never be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what fate do you see?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cDeath. Many deaths.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes again. There were some things better left unknown, that was for sure. And yet I couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is uncertain and depends on our actions going forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You?\u201d</p><p>He half shrugged. \u201cThere are always casualties in a war, and you and I are front-line soldiers. The possibility is always there.\u201d</p><p>I knew that. I\u2019d always known that. But somehow, having him say it made it seem that much more inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not an outcome that would please me, either.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cReally? I mean, it would at least free you from my bothersome tendency to do what I want rather than listen to your good advice.\u201d</p><p>Amusement briefly crinkled the corners of his eyes. \u201cIs there not a saying about challenges being the spice of life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s variety that\u2019s the spice of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are nothing if not variable,\u201d he agreed solemnly.</p><p>I laughed, then leaned forward and brushed a quick kiss across his lips. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched briefly against mine. I had no doubt he was fighting the urge to reach for me and deepen the kiss, because I was fighting the very same battle. \u201cFor what?\u201d he said, voice controlled and very, very even.</p><p>\u201cFor making me laugh when all I want to do is cry.\u201d</p><p>A shadow fell over us both and my stomach twisted in sudden fear. I glanced up hurriedly, but it wasn\u2019t an angry Lucian, as I\u2019d half expected. The man was thin, rat-faced, and not a stranger. He was the shifter my father had used previously to courier packages and notes to me. We\u2019d cornered him in the basement of an abandoned apartment building, but he hadn\u2019t provided a great deal of information, thanks to the fact that my father had erased his memory. As had Azriel, once we\u2019d finished questioning him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames Larson,\u201d I said, my gaze dropping to the simple envelope he held in his hand. It was the same sort of paper that my father had used in his previous notes, and my stomach began to twist even harder. \u201cWhat a pleasure it is to see you again.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and frowned. \u201cHow the hell do you know me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve delivered stuff to me before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>Good. It meant Azriel had been successful and my father would not be aware that we\u2019d found his courier.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d be here?\u201d Surely to god my father wasn\u2019t tracking me that closely.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t,\u201d Larson said. \u201cNot exactly. I was told to keep an eye on the building being renovated up the road, because you\u2019d be there sooner or later. Missed you going in, but saw you exit.\u201d</p><p>So my father knew about Lucian. Through reading my thoughts? Or had he been aware of Lucian way before I\u2019d even entered the scene? It was an intriguing possibility, and one that raised all sorts of questions, especially when Lucian\u2019s fierce need for revenge was factored in. Maybe it was a bit of a leap, but it was altogether possible that Lucian wasn\u2019t after only the Raziq and the keys. Maybe he\u2019d been using me to get to my father as well.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been waiting for me to appear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours.\u201d He shoved the letter at me. \u201cThis is yours.\u201d</p><p>I took it rather warily, then glanced at Azriel. He rose in one swift movement and touched Larson lightly on the forehead. The shifter stilled and his face went slack. Azriel closed his eyes and I watched the passersby, checking that no one was getting too interested in just what Azriel was doing.</p><p>Then he opened his eyes again. \u201cYour father had his Razan deliver the note and, this time, he did not accompany him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve picked the Razan\u2019s image from Larson\u2019s brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And the good news is, Larson picked the Razan\u2019s pocket.\u201d He reached inside the rat-shifter\u2019s jacket, slid a wallet from the pocket, and handed it to me.</p> <p>I flipped it open and pulled out his driver\u2019s license. The Razan pictured was average-looking with blond hair, blue eyes, and a scar running down the left side of his face. Even in the picture, he didn\u2019t look like the sort of man you\u2019d want to double-cross. \u201cAccording to this, the Razan\u2019s name is Pierre Danton, and he lives in Southbank.\u201d</p><p>Which meant he had some money, because that area was expensive, thanks to its close proximity to the city.</p><p>\u201cI do not believe the identity will be real,\u201d Azriel commented. \u201cAnd he has no doubt realized by now that this rat has been through his pockets. He may not be there if we check it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt a rat picking his pocket will overly worry him, other than the inconvenience of having to replace all his cards.\u201d I waved the license lightly. \u201cHow come the Raziq\u2019s Razan live in sewers, and my father\u2019s live in plush apartments? And who the hell does the Razan working for the dark sorcerer belong to, given that they all bear the same sort of ownership tat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot explain why one group lives in luxury and the other not, especially as your father is not known for his generosity when it comes to Razan. As to the other question\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThere are many possibilities.\u201d</p><p>I raised a querying eyebrow when he didn\u2019t go on. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is always possible that either the Raziq or your father works with the sorcerer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBoth were pretty damn pissed that he got the key rather than them.\u201d</p> <p>Azriel nodded. His fingers were still resting on the rat-shifter\u2019s forehead, keeping him still and compliant. \u201cBut working with the sorcerer does not mean they ever intended him to get his hands on the keys.\u201d</p><p>Then the sorcerer had outsmarted them all, and that made him doubly dangerous. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention the third possibility.\u201d</p><p>This time he raised an eyebrow. \u201cI was not aware there was one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not forgotten. I merely discounted him on the basis that the Raziq tore away his power. Thus mutilated, he would not be capable of creating Razan.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he hadn\u2019t lied to me about everything. I guess that was something to be thankful for. \u201cSo you\u2019re certain he hasn\u2019t got full Aedh powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain, yes.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut that does not preclude the possibility that remnants survive. It is far easier to kill an Aedh than to strip them completely of their powers.\u201d</p><p>So maybe I hadn\u2019t been imagining his fingers going through my flesh, after all. I shivered, and wondered what the hell else we didn\u2019t know. A lot, I was beginning to suspect.</p><p>I shoved the license back into the wallet, then handed it to Azriel.</p><p>\u201cYou do not wish Stane to check his identity?\u201d Azriel asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I can remember the name. It\u2019s better if our rat-faced friend doesn\u2019t suspect we went through his pockets.\u201d I slid a fingernail under the seal and opened the envelope. The note inside was brief and to the point\u2014Go to the station. It didn\u2019t say when, so I presumed it meant immediately. I sighed. \u201cYou\u2019d better release him.\u201d</p><p>He did so, and the rat-shifter blinked. \u201cWhat about a tip?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t pick the pockets of scar-faced men who work for would-be dictators. I reached into my pocket, dragged out a two-dollar coin, and flipped it to him.</p><p>He sneered. \u201cOh come on, a chick as classy as you has to have more than that on her. I went without coffee to deliver that note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d I said, a touch irritably. I mean, a fucking courier telling me off for being stingy? He was lucky to even get a damn tip considering this wasn\u2019t America and tipping certainly wasn\u2019t the norm. \u201cYou were paid well enough to deliver the note, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>And got a clip over the ear from Azriel for his trouble. \u201cThat is not polite language to use in the company of a lady.\u201d</p><p>It was a comment that earned another sneer, but Larson wisely refrained from saying anything else and walked away.</p><p>\u201cSince when have I been a lady?\u201d I asked, amused.</p><p>Azriel held out a hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were a lady; I just said it wasn\u2019t the correct language to use when in the company of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s all right, then.\u201d I gripped his hand and let him pull me up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t release me immediately, and there was concern in his expression as his gaze searched mine. \u201cAre you up to facing your father right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s not like I have any other choice. Besides, the sooner we find the remaining keys, the sooner the madness destroying my life might just go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish me to take you there?\u201d</p><p>Yes, I thought, I would. If only to soak in the heat of his touch for a few precious moments. But it would also sharpen the gathering tide of frustration and, right now, I really didn\u2019t need that. \u201cI thought we\u2019d agreed that wasn\u2019t a good option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had, but the note implies haste is required, and traveling the fields is faster than walking. It also taxes your strength less than you taking Aedh form.\u201d</p><p>All of which was true. I hesitated, torn between desire and sanity, then shook my head. \u201cWalking will clear my head. But you could go get the locker key for me. It\u2019s on the dresser\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of its location.\u201d</p><p>He winked out of existence. I went into a nearby caf\u00e9, grabbed a can of Coke and a couple of sausage rolls, then started walking. I didn\u2019t actually feel like eating, but I had a suspicion that I was going to need the fuel over the next couple of hours.</p><p>And it was premonitions like that I could really do without.</p><p>Azriel reappeared as I was halfway through my second sausage roll, and handed me the key. \u201c\u2018Tidy\u2019 is not in your vocabulary when it comes to your jewelry, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I thought you said you knew where it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the location. I did not know it was hidden under a multitude of twisted chains and charms. Do you not have a better method of filing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it involves walking into the closet. It\u2019s easier to simply dump them on the dresser as I\u2019m taking off my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not logical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rather common problem with me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d I finished the sausage roll and dumped the paper in the nearest bin as we walked past it.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He was close enough that his shoulders occasionally brushed mine and, as I\u2019d feared, every brief touch had longing coursing through me. But as much as I wanted to step away, I didn\u2019t. I needed the comfort of those too brief moments, if only because the heat of contact went some way toward combating the chill of gathering fear.</p><p>It took nearly ten minutes to walk down to Southern Cross Station, which was a riot of noise and bodies thanks to the fact that peak time was approaching. We made our way through the crowd, but my footsteps slowed as I neared the locker room.</p><p>\u201cYour father is not waiting within,\u201d Azriel said.</p><p>Something I already knew because I couldn\u2019t feel the power of his presence, but that didn\u2019t erase the churning in my gut. \u201cWhat about Razan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a number of humans, but no one else.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath that did little to bolster my flagging courage, then forced my feet forward. No one looked at us, let alone attacked us. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019d expected otherwise\u2014Azriel had already said there was no one dangerous here. Paranoia, it seemed, might be becoming a staple in my life.</p><p>I stopped in front of the locker and stared at it. Which wasn\u2019t exactly getting us anywhere, but I just couldn\u2019t force my hand up to shove the key into the lock.</p><p>Azriel gently took it and did it for me.</p><p>What we discovered was another square ward roughly the size of a tennis ball. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This one was white rather than black, but its surface was just as slick and ran with the colors of the rainbow.</p><p>\u201cI cannot feel any dark energy coming off this one,\u201d Azriel commented.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel it coming off the other one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wished to explore the option.\u201d</p><p>Against my advice. He might not have said the words, but they swam through my mind nevertheless. The link between us was definitely getting stronger.</p><p>\u201cSo what sort of energy has this one actually got?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is Aedh, and therefore neither light nor dark.\u201d</p><p>My gaze returned to the stone. It sat there, all shiny and harmless-looking. Yet I suspected there was nothing harmless about the magic that went into the creation of this thing, whatever Azriel might think. \u201cDoes the Raziq magic also sit between the two?\u201d</p><p>It certainly hadn\u2019t felt like it, but after what they\u2019d done to me every time they\u2019d used it, it was probably fair to say I was a somewhat biased judge.</p><p>\u201cTheir magic is darker, but it is not powered from the dark path; rather it springs from darker desires.\u201d I felt his gaze on me. \u201cTrust me, even if you do not trust your father. You will not be harmed if you pick it up.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, then reached inside and gingerly picked up the stone. It was a little too warm against my palm, suggesting that it was more than mere stone. But I knew that already.</p><p>\u201cThere is a piece of paper with it.\u201d Azriel reached in and took it out. \u201cIt says, The ward will be activated by a drop of the blood we share. Use it in a secure place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf this thing is activated by blood magic, how can that not be a bad thing?\u201d Misgivings filled me as I stared at the stone in my hand. I didn\u2019t like it and I didn\u2019t trust the magic within it. It came from the hands of my father, after all, and he was one of the bastards responsible for the evil that was the keys.</p><p>\u201cThe ward is not created from blood magic,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cUsing a drop of blood to activate it would merely be a precaution to ensure that if it fell into the wrong hands, they could do nothing with it.\u201d</p><p>I guess that made sense\u2014except for the fact I had a body filled with blood and absolutely no doubt that the Raziq would use every last drop if they felt it would be in their best interests.</p><p>\u201cThen my next question has to be, where in the hell are we supposed to find a secure place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour home is as secure as you are likely to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at Stane\u2019s for the very reason that it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst one who can astral travel,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut Ilianna\u2019s wards ensure the Raziq cannot enter without difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but my father is also Aedh, so how will that help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suspect he will have accounted for that in the creation of this ward.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe only other truly secure place is the old ritual site on Mount Macedon. I doubt the magic within that place will allow you to enter with this ward, because its magic is Aedh based and that site is blocked to all things Aedh or reaper related.\u201d</p><p>I studied the stone for several more seconds, then shoved it into my purse. The heat of it burned into my hip, despite the leather and fabric that now separated us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at home, then.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue. Didn\u2019t offer to wrap his arms around me and transport me there. He simply disappeared. He was sticking to his word, and keeping his distance as much as possible.</p><p>And while I appreciated the effort, part of me still wanted to rant and scream and tell him where he could stick his restraint, because I certainly didn\u2019t want it.</p><p>I have no more wish for restraint than you, came his thought. But the fate of both our worlds hangs on our actions.</p><p>I know, I know. But knowing it, and getting through it, were two very different things. I shoved my phone into the waist of my jeans to ensure that it touched flesh, then reached down for the Aedh half of my soul. Despite my utter weariness, it answered with such a surge that it surprised me. Once I was nothing more than particles drifting in the gentle breeze, I gathered myself together and flowed through the streets, enjoying the freedom of my alternate form even though tiredness quickly began to pulse through me. I still wasn\u2019t fit enough to hold this form for very long, so I practically cheered when my street came into sight.</p><p>But as I neared our warehouse, my particles began to tingle. And the closer I got, the worse it got. It was almost as if there was a force trying to stop me . . .</p><p>Ilianna\u2019s wards, I realized suddenly. In this form, I was as susceptible to them as any other Aedh. But it was good to have confirmation that they were actually working.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get near the front door, so I scooted through the small gap between the garage door and the pavement, then re-formed and splattered rather inelegantly onto the floor. One of these days, I thought, as the headache kicked in and my stomach threatened to revolt, I was going to practice re-formation until I could land with at least some semblance of elegance. Of course, being fit, healthy, and strong would also be a good first step.</p><p>It took at least five minutes for the headache and shaking to subside to acceptable levels, and I was finally able to move. Azriel appeared beside me, one hand half outstretched, obviously ready to catch me should I fall back down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said. And wondered whom I was trying to convince\u2014me or him.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d His fingers caught my elbow as I walked up the steps to the heavy metal door.</p><p>I gave him a somewhat amused sideways glance. \u201cYou sound disbelieving, reaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because both you and I know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what good is admitting the truth? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to help any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing stubborn or refusing help when you need it is not overly helpful, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I never accept help, Azriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is interesting that you make no comment about being stubborn.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s because I fully acknowledge it\u2019s another of my failings.\u201d</p><p>I looked into the scanner, waited until the retina reader did its business, then typed the code into the keypad. The door slid open and we stepped inside. I dumped my bag on the couch, then moved into the kitchen to raid the liquor cabinet.</p><p>After a large glass of bourbon and Coke\u2014heavy on the bourbon\u2014I grabbed a knife, then sat down in the middle of the living room floor and placed the ward in front of me. The rainbow colors seemed to run faster through it, as if it knew what was coming. Which was daft, because it was an inanimate object.</p><p>At least until I dropped some blood on it, anyway.</p><p>Azriel sat opposite me and placed Valdis across his knees. Blue fire dripped from her blade to the floor, then ran around us, creating a living barrier.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow in silent query.</p><p>\u201cIt is not a protective circle,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will be few able to get past the burn of Valdis. Your astral traveler certainly won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Something within me relaxed just a little. \u201cSo why haven\u2019t you used her like this on other occasions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it taxes us both, and it is generally better for you that we remain fighting ready.\u201d He nodded toward the ward. \u201cActivate it.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the knife and jabbed the point into my finger. As blood began to well, I turned my finger upside down and let the blood drip onto the ward. As the droplet hit, the rainbow stopped moving, and everything was still. Silent.</p><p>Then light erupted from the center of the stone and briefly blinded me. When I was able to see again, I was encased in a cylinder of white. I couldn\u2019t see Azriel, and Valdis\u2019s fierce blue flames were little more than shadow. Which meant I hadn\u2019t actually been transported anywhere, even though I\u2019d half expected to be.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I said it out loud, though I wasn\u2019t sure Azriel could hear me.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot,\u201d my father said.</p><p>I jumped and looked around wildly. Normally I could sense my father\u2019s presence the second he entered my vicinity, so why the hell hadn\u2019t I this time?</p><p>\u201cBecause I am not in your vicinity,\u201d he answered. \u201cThis is little more than a communication sphere. It allows you and me to talk without interfering with the energy of the device within your heart.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. So my father was once again ahead of the game when it came to the Raziq. \u201cWhere the hell are you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is unwise for you to know.\u201d He paused. \u201cI see you have been in Malin\u2019s presence. She plays a dangerous game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more dangerous than you, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so she has outlined my intentions. Or what she knows of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. And I have to ask, why lie? Why say you wanted the keys destroyed when the opposite is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought a gentler approach might be wise.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. Yeah, that whole throwing-me-around-the-bathroom episode could definitely be described as gentle. \u201cSo can the keys be destroyed? Or was that also a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not a lie, but it is also not possible. Not unless you wish to destroy existence.\u201d</p><p>Of course, I thought wearily. Why on earth I\u2019d actually expected the destruction of the keys to be a simple thing with few repercussions, I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cWhy would destroying the keys destroy the gray fields and earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause blood was used in their creation, and it now links the keys to the structure of the portals. Destroy the keys, and you will more than likely shatter the power of the portals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this different from the sorcerer forcing the gates open or the Raziq wanting them closed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn either event, the link shared between portals and keys is not altered or disrupted. But destroy them, and the portals\u2014which are woven into the very fabric of existence\u2014are endangered.\u201d</p><p>Well, fuck. What was I supposed to do now? Let a dictator win? Or worse still, the Raziq or the dark sorcerer? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAm I not the better option for humanity? At least the portals would still remain viable.\u201d</p><p>Until he decided it was better for him that they weren\u2019t. Whatever else my father might be, I very much doubted that he\u2019d be a benevolent dictator.</p><p>But that was not an argument I was going to get into. \u201cMalin did something to me, but I can\u2019t tell you what. She erased the memory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe more than likely sharpened the frequency of the device so that its call would be more instantaneous. That\u2019s what I would have done in her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Maybe not. I wasn\u2019t trusting an Aedh to do the expected, my father included.</p><p>\u201cNor should you.\u201d He paused. \u201cI see that you have had a parting of the way with the Aedh. That is unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>It was, but why the hell would my father think that? Had I been right in my earlier suspicions? And did I really want to know just how much Lucian had played me for a fool?</p><p>No, I thought. But I asked all the same. \u201cWhat Aedh are we talking about now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not stupid, Risa. Please do not act like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian.\u201d God, I thought, had every single moment with him been filled with nothing more than lies and schemes?</p><p>\u201cAs you have partially guessed, he and I are adversaries.\u201d There was cool amusement in his voice, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cBut what you do not know is that once we were allies. In fact, he was my chr\u00e1n\u00ed\u2014what you would call either a student or prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Shock coursed through me. \u201cYou and Lucian? Allies? Then why in the hell does he hate you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never intended to share domination. Once the keys were safely in the possession of my Razan, I betrayed him to make my own escape.\u201d</p><p>He was the reason Lucian had been stripped of his powers. Fuck, the hate I\u2019d seen had been aimed at me as much as the Raziq\u2014not only because I was Hieu\u2019s offspring, but because I\u2019d also betrayed him by not using his sorceress\u2019s ward.</p> <p>\u201cThen how did you get caught? Or was that another lie to get me to do your bidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chr\u00e1n\u00ed knew more than I thought, hence I was captured. I was stripped of my flesh form during Malin\u2019s attempts to gain the location of the keys, but I could not give what I did not have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did they keep you alive? After all, I was born by that time. They didn\u2019t need you to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was the only one who knew the clues. Malin, for all her power, could not take that information from me.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019d somehow escaped his prison. But thanks to his capture, he\u2019d missed his meeting with his Razan\u2014who had, as he\u2019d ordered, killed themselves to protect the earthly location of the keys. \u201cWhy was Lucian left alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, he was my chr\u00e1n\u00ed. I have no doubt that Malin thought I might attempt to contact him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a stupid thought given how much he appears to hate Raziq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would not understand such emotion. Few of us do.\u201d</p> <p>Because they didn\u2019t do emotions. And yet Lucian did. Was it simply a result of being made less than he was, or were there deeper reasons?</p><p>My father was obviously following my thoughts, because he said, \u201cFor an Aedh, being less than you were is a far worse fate than being dead.\u201d</p><p>Which explained the fierceness that drove my father. He wanted domination\u2014particularly over those who had made him less than he was.</p><p>\u201cEven as I am, I am far more than Malin and her rabble will ever be.\u201d There was no conceit in my father\u2019s voice, no hint of boasting in his words. He merely stated a fact as he saw it. From the little I\u2019d seen of the two parties, he did seem the stronger. And he was certainly more cunning.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn me that Lucian was an adversary? He\u2019s linked sexually to my thoughts, and no doubt tracking your intentions through me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was tracking his movements and thoughts\u2014and therefore the movements of the dark sorceress he plays with\u2014through you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy would you be tracking her movements? She\u2019s not the one who took the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sure of this? Because I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer energy wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d It was almost stubbornly said. I knew what I\u2019d felt, and Lauren\u2019s energy wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d sensed when the key went missing.</p><p>So why did she seem familiar to me? I didn\u2019t know, and that niggled.</p><p>\u201cI still would not erase the possibility that she is involved, especially considering the chr\u00e1n\u00ed\u2019s liaison with her. Everything he does, he does with intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike master, like student,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d my father agreed. \u201cI taught him well.\u201d</p><p>Too fucking well. And the worst thing was, he was yet another person who was going to create trouble for me in the weeks ahead.</p><p>I rubbed my forehead wearily. \u201cLook, you called me here for a reason. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would it be? You need to find the next key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want me to find it after the shitty mess I made of the last attempt?\u201d It was a stupid question, but I couldn\u2019t help asking it all the same. I mean, miracles did occasionally occur, and there was always the faint hope that my father would decide I was useless and try to find someone else.</p><p>And by tomorrow, pigs will have flown.</p><p>\u201cYou are my only child, and therefore my only option.\u201d</p><p>Meaning if he\u2019d had another option he probably would have taken it. And as much as I\u2019d always longed for a sibling, I was suddenly glad that I was an only child. It was bad enough risking the lives of my friends; I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it to a brother or sister.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so hit me with the clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said in the book you destroyed, the second key bears the semblance of a dagger. It was sent to the northwest, where the alluvial fields run deep and the soil is stained by rebellion.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, and I waited. He didn\u2019t go on. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I dared give my Razan. I could not be more specific in case I was captured\u2014which I was.\u201d</p><p>I thrust a hand through my hair. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me a lot to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the whole point. But you found the first one; you will find the others.\u201d</p><p>I was glad someone had confidence in me. Although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I wanted my father\u2019s confidence.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do when I get it?\u201d Especially now that I knew I couldn\u2019t destroy the keys\u2014if my father was telling the truth, that is. He had told me previously that they could be destroyed, and Azriel seemed of the same opinion as well.</p><p>\u201cUse this stone to contact me. I will give you further directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Azriel?\u201d He wanted the keys destroyed\u2014or at least in Mijai hands, and I had no doubt he\u2019d take it the minute we found it. Especially given what had happened with the first key.</p><p>\u201cDo not let the reaper gain possession of the keys. Whatever it takes, whatever you have to do, do it. Otherwise, your friends will not live to see another dawn.\u201d</p><p>Fury, fear, and frustration swirled through me, and I clenched my fists. Uselessly, because there was nothing and no one here to hit. \u201cDamn it, how the hell am I supposed to stop a reaper? I\u2019m only human\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never human. You are a creation of my flesh, and that well runs deeper than you realize.\u201d He paused, and the energy in the cylinder became so electric the hairs on my arms stood on end. \u201cDo what I say, Risa, or face the consequences.\u201d</p><p>And with that, the white light died and I found myself blinking furiously against tears as I stared at Azriel.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, concern in his voice.</p><p>I brushed away the solitary droplet that trickled down my cheek. \u201cYou weren\u2019t following events through the chi connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the ward severed the connection.\u201d</p><p>I guess that was no surprise\u2014my father was more than aware of Azriel\u2019s presence in my life. \u201cHe gave me the clues to find the second key, and then gave me a fucking horrible choice.\u201d</p><p>Azriel studied me for a moment, his expression giving little away, then placed Valdis on the floor and rose in one smooth movement. He disappeared into the kitchen, but was back within minutes, a large glass of bourbon and Coke in one hand. \u201cDrink this, then tell me.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cWith the amount of booze I can smell in this glass, I\u2019d normally think you were trying to get me drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a werewolf\u2014is that not impossible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can get drunk. It just takes a hell of a lot of time and booze, and it usually doesn\u2019t last long enough to make the effort worthwhile.\u201d I took several large gulps and felt the burn of the bourbon all the way down to my belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Azriel said softly.</p><p>I briefly closed my eyes. \u201cHow sure are you that the keys can be destroyed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs sure as we can be. The keys are not part of all creation, as the portals are, so therefore we should be able to destroy them without overwhelming effects to our worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be in your father\u2019s best interest to have you believe so.\u201d But a frown marred his usually calm expression.</p><p>\u201cHe says the keys were created in blood, and that blood now links them to the fabric of the gates. If we destroy the keys, we risk destroying the gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think that is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know for sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but there are those who will.\u201d He hesitated, his gaze capturing mine. \u201cThat is not all, is it?\u201d</p><p>He knew it wasn\u2019t. I gulped down more alcohol, and swallowed the subsequent burp. \u201cIf I let you take the remaining keys, he will kill Ilianna and Tao.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t have to. I could read his thoughts as clearly as if they were mine. Anger surged, so fierce and bright that Valdis\u2019s flames flared in reaction.</p><p>\u201cThey will not be casualties in this cause, Azriel. I\u2019d rather give the keys to my father than let either of them die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fate of our worlds rests\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking care!\u201d My grip on the glass tightened. How it remained intact I have no idea. \u201cThis isn\u2019t negotiable, Azriel. If what my father says is true, then you won\u2019t be getting the keys. End of story.\u201d</p> <p>Red flickered through the tips of Valdis\u2019s flames. It was an indication of her master\u2019s emotions\u2014emotions he was otherwise very carefully controlling.</p><p>\u201cThen I had better check the legitimacy of his comments as quickly as possible,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou\u2019d better. And while you\u2019re at it, ask what can be done if the keys can\u2019t be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they cannot be destroyed, we are all in trouble. Neither the Raziq nor your father will rest until they possess them.\u201d He eyed me critically. \u201cIlianna\u2019s and Tao\u2019s fates hang in the balance no matter what option you choose, Risa.\u201d</p><p>I knew that. I\u2019d always known that.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t alter the fact that I wasn\u2019t willingly going to do anything that would place them in the direct path of either my father or the Raziq.</p><p>Azriel sighed. It was a frustrated sound. \u201cWhat is the clue?\u201d</p><p>I repeated what my father had said, and he frowned. \u201cThat does not tell us much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly what I said. And he basically said \u2018tough.\u2019\u201d</p><p>My phone rang, the ringtone telling me it was Rhoan. I dug it out of my pocket and hit the vid-answer button. No picture came up, which was odd, but maybe he didn\u2019t want me to see what was going on around him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Rhoan,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve caught the bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed I have,\u201d a familiar voice said. \u201cHe\u2019s currently tied up tighter than a turkey at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Ice entered my body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Rhoan on the other end of the phone.</p><p>It was Zane Taylor, my faceless hunter.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>For too many minutes I couldn\u2019t speak. All I could think was, He can\u2019t be dead. Please, God, don\u2019t let him be dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done to him?\u201d It came out a hoarse whisper, because my throat was locked tight with fear.</p><p>\u201cNothing that will kill him just yet.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes in relief, but it didn\u2019t last long. Not when the madman at the other end of the phone had Rhoan\u2019s life in his hands\u2014and no doubt wanted mine.</p><p>\u201cHow did you even know\u2014\u201d I stopped, suddenly realizing the answer to my question before I\u2019d asked it. \u201cThe cameras at the warehouse. You deliberately revealed yourselves so that we could find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI had worried that the Directorate might catch on to our little trap, but, as usual, I overestimated them.\u201d</p><p>Because no one in his right mind would expect a suspect to deliberately parade about in front of security cameras. But then, Taylor and sanity weren\u2019t exactly chummy.</p><p>\u201cRhoan isn\u2019t the one you were hunting, so why are you even bothering to keep him captive?\u201d My voice shook as I spoke, and I took a slow, deep breath in an attempt to remain calm. Clearheaded thinking was what this situation needed, not panic, not fear\u2014even if there was plenty of both.</p><p>\u201cHe and I were playing this game before you came onto the scene, and would no doubt have arrived at this situation sooner or later.\u201d He paused, and I could almost feel the satisfaction oozing from his pores, even though the screen was blank and he was nowhere near me. \u201cAs to why he is still alive, that\u2019s simple. I believe he might be a much better lure to capture you than anything else I could have come up with.\u201d</p><p>He had that right. God, if anything happened to Rhoan, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself\u2014let alone face Aunt Riley. He might be a guardian, and this might not be my fault but rather a danger Rhoan willingly faced every day, but that still didn\u2019t alter one fact. I was involved, and I\u2019d bear the brunt of guilt if he was hurt. Or worse, killed.</p><p>Oh please, don\u2019t let it be worse.</p><p>I took another deep breath that did nothing to ease the queasiness threatening to overwhelm me, then said, \u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, dear huntress, you, of course.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. Even though I\u2019d expected the answer, the thought of willingly walking into this man\u2019s trap horrified me. \u201cWhy? I\u2019m not one of your so-called aberrations you\u2019re destined to destroy. Why hunt me, when your calling gives you so many other options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question.\u201d There was an edge in his voice that spoke of amusement. This bastard was sick. Sick, sick, sick . . . I thrust the mental chant away. That way lies madness. He continued. \u201cThe simple answer is boredom. That is why I originally started playing my game with the Directorate. In a life as long as mine, a challenge is sometimes needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing these women because you\u2019re bored?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHuntress, that is not what I said. I kill the women because that is my calling. I taunt the Directorate because it is fun.\u201d</p><p>He was definitely a fruitcake. He had to be, because taunting the Directorate was stupid and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cSo where do I come into the picture?\u201d I knew where well enough. I\u2019d defied him on the fields, threatened him, marked him. For someone who obviously considered himself beyond the Directorate\u2019s reach, that had to be galling.</p><p>\u201cYou intrigued me, huntress. You, and the one who guards you both. I have not come across your likes before.\u201d</p><p>A chill ran through me. How the hell could he know about Azriel? \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tsked. \u201cCome, huntress, let\u2019s not play this particular game.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily. If he knew about Azriel, then he probably also knew how to stop him. My reaper might not be of this place, but he could be blocked and killed here. That might be in this madman\u2019s plan. After all, what bigger buzz could there be for someone as sick as Taylor than killing a celestial guide?</p><p>God, this situation was getting worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about him? Few can see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did do a good job of concealing himself, but the astral plane is my world, not his, and there are few there who can hide themselves from me.\u201d</p><p>Markel. He was talking about Markel, not Azriel. Thank god.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter who I have following me around? This is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the end battle will be, for sure, but that does not dampen my wish to see just what your guardian can do.\u201d</p><p>Markel couldn\u2019t do half of what Azriel could, but that didn\u2019t make him any less dangerous. Not that Markel would actually be getting involved\u2014not unless it was absolutely necessary. Especially when Azriel could project any human form he desired.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said in a flat voice, \u201cyou wish to challenge us. How do you plan to do that this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the game hasn\u2019t changed; the stakes are just a little higher.\u201d</p><p>The stakes being Rhoan\u2019s life. I closed my eyes again and tried to control the rush of panic. I could do this. I had to do this.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time it is easy. I give you an address; you and your guardian go to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I asked, when he didn\u2019t go on.</p><p>\u201cInside, you will find Rhoan Jenson. You will lie down beside him and take astral form. From that point on, you and I will begin a battle from which only one will return.\u201d</p><p>It was too simple, too easy. For a man who claimed to love his games, there had to be more than this. My grip on the phone had become so tight my hand was beginning to ache. I flipped it over to my left hand, then flexed my fingers. It helped with the ache, but not the overall tension.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked that you don\u2019t trust me, huntress.\u201d</p><p>I very much doubted it. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you want me to do, why do you want my guardian along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are one or two things I forgot to mention.\u201d His voice was still jovial, but this time it held a darker edge that had horror crawling down my spine. \u201cThe first being the fact that your uncle has been injected with hemlock. So far, it has done little more than rob him of speech and movement. However, the suppression of movement will soon spread to his respiratory function, and death will result.\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck, oh fuck. I gulped down air and tried to keep calm. But my heart was racing and there was sweat dribbling down my spine and all I wanted to do was run into the bathroom and throw up. Only sheer force of will\u2014and fear of what might happen to Rhoan\u2014kept me on the spot and on the phone. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t tell me why you want my guardian there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guardian is there because you have a choice to make. He can keep your body safe, or he can save Rhoan Jenson. He will not be able to do both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you wish your uncle to live, he has to be taken to hospital. But doing so will leave your physical form unprotected.\u201d</p><p>Trepidation crawled across my skin, but I had no intention of worrying about what he\u2019d planned in the event I was left unprotected. I wouldn\u2019t be, as simple as that, even if it meant calling in not only Markel but the whole damn Directorate.</p><p>\u201cAnd do not think to call in aid from the Directorate,\u201d Taylor said, seemingly reading my thoughts. \u201cBecause the place you walk into has been wired with explosives. The minute my people see anything out of the ordinary, they will detonate. And that, dear huntress, would be an inglorious end for one such as you.\u201d</p><p>And it sure as hell wasn\u2019t the way I wanted to go, either. I shivered, feeling colder and more helpless than I ever had before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He does not know about me, Azriel said, his words warm and comforting as they whispered into my mind, and he will not know I am there unless someone attempts to harm you.</p><p>But it means we have no choice but to involve Markel.</p><p>I do not think he will mind.</p> <p>Maybe not, but his boss might. Hunter had put him on watch duty, and she was the sort to expect exact compliance with her orders.</p><p>But she does not want you harmed, unless she is the one doing the harming. She will allow this.</p><p>I guess. But it meant Markel was yet another person being drawn into the web slowly closing around me. And while he might be an elite killer for the high council, that didn\u2019t mean I wanted his death on my conscience any more than I wanted Rhoan\u2019s on it.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t really much of a test for my guardian, Taylor. It\u2019s a choice for me, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But you will not choose death, huntress, and we both know it. Therefore, your guardian will remain and he will be tested.\u201d</p> <p>And things would attack. Undoubtedly nasty things. While I had no doubt Azriel would cope, that didn\u2019t make me feel any better. I rubbed my forehead wearily, then said, \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t explode the place when I win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all part of the game.\u201d</p><p>Some fucking game. \u201cWhat address do I have to go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so eager to begin. The address will be sent to you, huntress. And do not bother to trace the phone, because it will not be anywhere near my person by the time you find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. See you shortly, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p> <p>He hung up. I did the same, then threw the phone at the nearest wall. It hit with a satisfying thud, then clattered to the floor. It didn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Azriel said calmly, \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t wise given that you need the phone to receive the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I doubt I did any real damage\u2014the cover is thick enough to protect it.\u201d</p><p>As if to prove my point, the damn phone rang. This time I didn\u2019t recognize the tone, so it wasn\u2019t a call from anyone in my contacts list.</p><p>I climbed to my feet and walked over to retrieve the stupid thing. \u201cRisa Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, it\u2019s Jack from the Directorate,\u201d he said, voice brusque. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI just got a call from our favorite psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhoan\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor now. I\u2019m just waiting for his location to be sent to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d There was relief in his gravelly tones. \u201cWe need to get you here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted again. \u201cHe wants a showdown on the astral plane\u2014just him and me. And if you or anyone else gets involved, he\u2019s going to blow our bodies to kingdom come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t even fucking see us coming, let alone get the chance to blow you both up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBright is an IT specialist. They\u2019ll be watching from a distance, and they\u2019ll detonate the same way.\u201d</p><p>Jack was silent for a moment, then said, \u201cFine. We\u2019ll play it his way, at least for the moment. The minute you get a location, you contact me. We\u2019ll start scanning the area for rogue frequencies and start blocking. Once we have the place locked down, we can storm his location and kill the bastard.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right until then, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I had to be. There was no other choice except death, and I wasn\u2019t going there willingly. \u201cBut I very much doubt Taylor is going to be in the same location as me and Rhoan. He\u2019s not that stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. But I doubt he\u2019ll be far away from either the location or his lieutenant. He\u2019d want the pleasure of watching Rhoan burn after the fight he undoubtedly thinks he\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>And Taylor wasn\u2019t the only one who thought that the odds were on his side. As another bout of foreboding shivered down my spine, the phone indicated an incoming text. \u201cHang on, Jack\u2014I think he just contacted me.\u201d</p><p>I switched screens. It was the address from Taylor. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, switching back to Jack. \u201cHis address is Twenty Keeshan Court, Altona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll begin the scanning process immediately. Take your time getting there, because the more time we have, the better it will be for you.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cAnd be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d Whether it would be enough was another matter entirely. \u201cWhat about Aunt Riley? Shouldn\u2019t she be involved? Or at least informed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley contacted me a few minutes ago. I\u2019ve told her the situation is in hand.\u201d</p><p>I snorted softly. \u201cI can imagine what she said to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she may be older, but she certainly hasn\u2019t mellowed.\u201d His tone was wry. \u201cAvoid contact with her. I can\u2019t stop her from searching for her brother, but we need to get this done before she finds him. There\u2019s already been enough people hurt today. I do not want her on the list as well.\u201d</p><p>God, I hadn\u2019t even given a thought to the men and women who would have been with Rhoan in that house. \u201cI hope there weren\u2019t any deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, I\u2019m afraid. We didn\u2019t get them to the hospital in time. It\u2019s only thanks to the comlinks that we knew they were in trouble.\u201d</p><p>The comlinks were small disks inserted into the earlobes of all guardians, and they worked in a similar fashion to the earrings I wore\u2014only the comlinks had a \u201cpanic\u201d button that sent out a distress signal when things went bad. \u201cHave an ambulance waiting nearby. If I can get Rhoan out before I step onto the astral plane, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not jeopardize your life to save his,\u201d Jack warned. \u201cRhoan would not appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t, even though he\u2019d do exactly the same for me. I hung up, only to have the phone ring yet again. I glanced at it, but the number was blocked. Trepidation surged anew, but I hit the ANSWER button and said, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisa, it\u2019s Markel. I overheard your conversation with Taylor from the astral field and have returned to flesh. I will be able to meet you at the location Taylor gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve cleared it with Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Neither she nor the council currently has any desire to lose your services, so I am to do whatever needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>Considering he was a Cazador and could basically do anything he liked to get the job done, that was a pretty chilling statement. \u201cThe only thing I need you to do is to get Rhoan out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that is not what Hunter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t care what Hunter wants.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then said, in a distinctly cooler voice, \u201cIf that is your wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall be there in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>I hung up a second time, then met Azriel\u2019s steady gaze. \u201cI have a really bad feeling about all this.\u201d</p><p>He half raised a hand, but let it drop before he ever touched me. And at that particular moment, I almost hated him. I certainly hated the reasons he was distancing himself almost as much as I hated the madman I\u2019d soon have to face. Right now, I didn\u2019t want distance and I certainly didn\u2019t care that those reasons made perfect sense. I just wanted the comfort of his arms wrapped around me, the heat of his body pressed against mine, the tease of his lips against my ear as he whispered everything was going to be all right.</p><p>Even if we both knew it was a lie.</p><p>Something flicked in his eyes, but he didn\u2019t move or otherwise react. \u201cYou are not unprotected on the plane, Risa. You have Amaya, and she will do all she can to keep you safe. As I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d I hesitated, and rubbed my arms. \u201cHe\u2019s not sane, Azriel. He\u2019ll do the unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d He hesitated, and a flash of frustration ran across his otherwise impassive expression. \u201cI wish I could do more, Risa. I really do.\u201d</p><p>My gaze searched his for a moment, and I suddenly realized he wasn\u2019t talking about fighting, but rather the desire to comfort me as I longed to be comforted. I clenched my fists against the increasingly familiar urge to rant and scream in the face of the unfairness of it all. There was no point in saying anything, let alone ranting. We\u2019d hashed this all out a hundred times and there was nothing more to be said unless he changed his mind. And I couldn\u2019t see that happening anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better remain invisible until we get the lay of the house,\u201d I said, somehow keeping my voice even. \u201cI don\u2019t want Taylor setting off a damn bomb because he spots you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will not.\u201d</p><p>I thrust a somewhat shaky hand through my hair, then said, \u201cI guess I\u2019d better take the car. I don\u2019t think it would be wise to let Taylor know I\u2019m something more than a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cAnd him not knowing might also give you the advantage\u2014especially if you travel near the umbra.\u201d</p><p>The umbra was the area where the real world and the gray fields merged, but I couldn\u2019t see how that actually became an advantage.</p><p>\u201cThe Du\u0161an,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can take full form in the umbra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all I have to do is get the bastard there and let her loose.\u201d But how did I do that? How would I even know when I was getting close to it?</p><p>\u201cThe plane works in much the same way as your atmosphere,\u201d Azriel said. \u201cThe closer you get to the umbra, the thinner or more distant this reality will be.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo all I have to do is imagine myself flying up toward it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not that simple. Nor would Taylor allow it to be even if it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how the hell do I reach it?\u201d Frustration, and perhaps more than a little panic, edged my voice. I didn\u2019t want to do this, even if I would never be entirely alone on the astral plane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe plane is separated from the gray fields by a series of\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cLayers, I suppose they can be called. The umbra is the fourth and last of these layers. Most astral travelers are only able to access the first two. The very seasoned can access the third and see the umbra. Psychics such as your mother and yourself can access the umbra itself and interact with the beings there.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut I thought you said most psychics only interacted with ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Ghosts inhabit the umbra, which is why even those who astral travel are rarely aware of their presence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I was in the umbra when I met Taylor the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You were in the umbra when you talked to Logan, but retreated to the base level when you went to rescue the woman.\u201d</p><p>Ha. The things you learned. \u201cSo all I have to do is lure Taylor through the levels until we\u2019re in the umbra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting him there will be the problem. He will be wary of astral traveling too close to the umbra. Most seasoned travelers are.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause while a soul generally cannot be killed on the astral plane, that rule doesn\u2019t hold on the umbra portion.\u201d</p><p>I digested that for a moment, then slowly said, \u201cThat\u2019s what he plans. He said only one of us will be coming back from this battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it is you, Risa. I could not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut the rest of the sentence off, leaving me wondering just what he\u2019d been about to admit. The part that hungered for his touch desperately wanted to believe it was something along the lines of not being able to live without me, but that was stupid, given that he had a totally different physiology. More likely, he was simply going to remind me that he couldn\u2019t continue the quest without me.</p><p>Which he\u2019d reminded me of often enough.</p><p>I waved a hand toward the front door. \u201cWe\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p> <p>Because the sooner we got to that house and whatever delights Taylor had waiting, the sooner we could get on with the business of finding the next key.</p><p>But even as I made my way down to my car, a dark voice within was whispering, You\u2019ll be finding nothing but the afterlife if you lose this battle. And you could lose it. Very easily.</p><p>And if I kept thinking along those lines, I\u2019d be defeated long before I ever made it onto the astral plane.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take all that long to get across to Altona, thanks to the fact that peak hour had pretty much passed. I parked under a streetlight at the top end of Keeshan Court\u2014there was little point in hiding\u2014then climbed out and studied my surroundings. It was a typical middle-Melbourne suburban street, filled with tidy-looking brick houses and neat front yards. The sort of street I could imagine kids playing in happily, never realizing there was a psycho in their midst.</p><p>I shivered, then reached back into my car and grabbed my coat.</p><p>\u201cSo, we meet in the flesh at last,\u201d a deep voice behind me said.</p><p>I bit down a squeak and spun around. A tall man dressed in dark jeans and a black sweater stood in front of me. My gaze traveled up the long, lean length of him, and clashed with the darkness of his. Recognition stirred.</p><p>\u201cMarkel Sanchez,\u201d I said, relief evident in my voice.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He bowed slightly. \u201cIt is a pleasure to finally meet you on this plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it was in better circumstances,\u201d I muttered, and pulled on my jacket.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d His gaze moved from me to the street. \u201cI have done a brief reconnoiter. Number twenty bristles with hardware, some of which is cameras.\u201d</p><p>The rest no doubt being the bombs Taylor had mentioned, as well as other nasty stuff. \u201cHow many people are inside the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one. I presume it is the guardian, Rhoan Jenson.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, then asked, \u201cIs he still alive?\u201d</p><p>Markel\u2019s dark gaze returned to mine. \u201cAt this moment, yes.\u201d</p><p>I released the breath I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d been holding. \u201cWhat about the other houses in the court? Have you checked those?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cOf course. I am the professional here, remember.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was. But it was my life on the line, not his. \u201cSo did you find anything unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Taylor and his accomplice are not in this street as far as I was able to discern. That does not mean he is not nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be nearby.\u201d Watching, waiting. Anticipating.</p><p>I shivered again, then shoved shaking hands into my pockets and began walking toward the house.</p><p>Markel fell in step beside me. \u201cWhat of the reaper, Azriel? Is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Azriel said, his voice coming from the opposite side of me to the vampire. Not that I needed to hear his voice to know exactly where he was.</p><p>Markel didn\u2019t seem altogether surprised, either. Maybe he\u2019d asked the question simply to confirm what he\u2019d already sensed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you really think this madman will allow us to rescue Jenson? I cannot see it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll expect it, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll stop it, either. Either Rhoan dies or I\u2019m left unprotected, so he wins either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are not unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Markel nodded and continued to study the house we were all too quickly approaching. It was almost as if he were trying to read the mind of an enemy who wasn\u2019t even present. His movements were fluid, easy, and there was absolutely no sense of danger emanating from him. It was oddly disturbing, but not entirely surprising. Cazadors might be the most efficient and deadly killers ever trained by the high council, but very few people knew they existed. And that, no doubt, was helped by the \u201cwouldn\u2019t-hurt-a-fly\u201d feeling Markel was currently emitting.</p><p>Which, in my estimation, only made him\u2014and them\u2014more scary.</p><p>Except, I\u2019d bet, to people like Hunter. I don\u2019t think that woman feared anything, alive or dead.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s got an ambulance standing by,\u201d I said, my gut churning more and more the closer we got to the damn house. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of the ambulance\u2019s location,\u201d he cut in. \u201cI will deposit Jenson into their care and come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Azriel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaylor is no fool.\u201d Markel\u2019s gaze met mine briefly. In the flare of the streetlights, red glinted deep in the dark depths. Not anger, not bloodlust, but something else. Something deeper\u2014more remote and dangerous. I resisted the urge to step away from him as he added, \u201cHe undoubtedly has plans for your body once he thinks you are left unprotected. He will also have his people watching what is going on, and they will not react favorably when they realize you are not as unprotected as they thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019ll react favorably to you coming back into the house, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a risk we must all take.\u201d Thankfully, his gaze returned to the house. \u201cI have my orders, Risa. I will obey them.\u201d</p><p>Meaning it was pointless to argue. We reached the end of the court. Number twenty loomed in front of us, dark and silent. While the surrounding houses might be well cared for, it was obvious that this place had been left empty for a while. The grass in the front yard was long enough to brush my knees, and there were trees sprouting in the gutters. Metal shutters covered all the windows, making it impossible to steal a glimpse inside, but the front door stood slightly ajar.</p><p>It was an invitation to enter that I wished we could refuse.</p><p>I flared my nostrils, sucking in the air and sorting through the scents as Markel pressed his fingertips against the door and pushed it all the way open. The house smelled of age and damp, but underneath these ran teasing scents of humanity and wolf. The latter undoubtedly belonged to Rhoan, but did the other belong to Taylor or his assistant, or someone else?</p><p>There is no one other than Rhoan inside, Azriel commented. As Markel has already said.</p><p>But they\u2019ve been here, and very recently. If the strength of that scent was anything to go by, at least.</p><p>Naturally. They had to set their trap.</p><p>A trap we were willingly walking into. I shivered again, and rubbed my arms as I forced myself to follow Markel inside. With the windows shuttered, the only light coming into the house was from the door behind us, and it did little to lift the deeper darkness of the hallway. Rhoan\u2019s scent was coming from the room at the far end of the hall, but we approached cautiously, peering into each of the rooms we passed even though there was little enough to see. Markel and Azriel might be certain that no one else was here, but neither of them was taking any chances. For that, I could only be thankful.</p><p>Markel pushed the door at the far end of the hall open. The light that hit us was so fierce and bright that I had to blink back tears.</p><p>It revealed a room that was stark, white, and empty. Or rather, almost empty. Rhoan lay on the tiles in the middle of the room, his arms crossed across his chest and his face deathly white. Panic surged.</p><p>No, God no! I pushed past Markel, but he caught me before I got more than a step.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I said, twisting violently against his grip in a desperate attempt to rip free and get to Rhoan. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour haste will kill us all,\u201d he said, and pointed at my legs.</p><p>Or rather, the trip wire that waited only inches away from my shins.</p><p>It felt like someone had tipped a bucket of ice water down my back. That one moment of panic reaction could have killed us all.</p><p>Think, I reminded myself fiercely. Don\u2019t react blindly. That\u2019s what he wants.</p><p>And while I doubted he\u2019d actually want us dead just yet, I was betting he wouldn\u2019t have minded having Markel, at least, incapacitated.</p><p>\u201cFollow me\u2014carefully,\u201d Markel instructed.</p><p>He stepped over the trip wire and proceeded forward with caution. I did the same, practically stepping on his heels.</p><p>\u201cTrigger plates,\u201d he said a few seconds later, and pointed at the tiles directly ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I peered around him. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d They looked exactly the same to me as all the other tiles.</p><p>\u201cThe edge is fractionally raised. The trap waits above.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up. The trap was four rows of long, wickedly pointed metal stakes. They might not kill a vampire\u2014only wooden stakes to the heart or decapitation could really do that\u2014but they would still make a goddamn mess. \u201cThis is no seat-of-the-pants trap. He\u2019s been planning this for some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the moment you clashed on the astral plane, I would suggest.\u201d</p><p>He stepped over the tiles, then offered me his hand. I accepted it gratefully. Four rows of tiles might not be much of a leap, but if I became unbalanced and fell backward into one, I\u2019d be dead. Those stakes would kill me.</p><p>We continued moving forward carefully, but there were no more traps and we were soon by Rhoan\u2019s side. Markel motioned me to remain where I was and knelt beside Rhoan. I flexed my fingers, fighting the urge to drop down, press my hands against his pale, still body, and feel the life within him even though I could clearly see he was breathing.</p><p>It seemed to take forever for Markel to pat Rhoan down, but eventually he glanced up and gave me a nod.</p><p>I dropped down beside Rhoan and touched a hand to his cheek. It was clammy and cold, and though he was definitely breathing, it was becoming labored. That could only mean the hemlock was beginning to fully kick in.</p> <p>I glanced up. Markel regarded me steadily. It was oddly unnerving. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get him to hospital soon, he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>He must not die tonight, Azriel said. No reaper waits.</p><p>And that meant he\u2019d be one of the lost ones if we couldn\u2019t save him. I closed my eyes and fought the rush of panic. It wouldn\u2019t happen. He wouldn\u2019t die. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I reached across his body and gripped Markel\u2019s arm. \u201cGet him to that ambulance,\u201d I said fiercely. \u201cMake sure they know he\u2019s been injected with hemlock. And be careful, because I wouldn\u2019t put it past Taylor to have some sort of backup attack on the off chance I did decide to save Rhoan\u2019s life rather than protect myself.\u201d</p><p>Markel\u2019s sudden smile was fierce. \u201cOh, he\u2019s very welcome to try an attack. It would be a pleasant way to stretch the kinks from my body after the inactivity of following you via the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>I found myself hoping Taylor wasn\u2019t that stupid, if only because I didn\u2019t want my uncle caught in the cross fire between Taylor and Markel.</p> <p>He scooped Rhoan into his arms, then rose. \u201cTread carefully on the plane, Risa Jones. Hunter will not be pleased if your life was ended before her plans have come to fruition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I really care,\u201d I retorted, then saw the amusement crinkling the corners of his eyes. \u201cYou have a warped sense of humor, vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo remain sane in my profession, it pays to,\u201d he commented, then headed out.</p><p>I watched him leave, and prayed like hell that Rhoan would be okay. Then I took a deep breath, gathered the fading strands of my courage, and lay down.</p><p>Three minutes later I entered the astral plane alone.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>There was nothing to be seen except gray. There were no vague outlines of buildings, nothing to hint that anything existed beyond the fog. The astral world was still and quiet, and an odd sense of peace enveloped me.</p><p>It didn\u2019t last too long.</p> <p>Air began to roll past me like waves receding from a distant shore.</p><p>It meant Taylor was here, somewhere.</p><p>I flexed invisible fingers, scanning the grayness, waiting for him to appear. I had no doubt that he would. He was the type to want to taunt me before he got down to the business of killing me.</p><p>Or at least, trying to.</p><p>Noise began to stir the fog\u2014a soft, steady sound, like the rhythm of a heart at rest. It grew in tempo, getting louder and louder, until the fog churned with the force of it and the fibers of my being vibrated in violent harmony.</p><p>Game, Amaya said. Play not.</p><p>She was right. This wasn\u2019t some weird storm on the astral plane. This was little more than foreplay, designed for fear rather than pleasure.</p><p>And it was certainly something I didn\u2019t have to stick around for if he had no intention of appearing.</p><p>I closed my eyes and imagined a beach, sunshine, and a calm, clear day. There was a brief sensation of movement and, when I opened my eyes, I was standing on the edge of an ocean as stormy as Azriel\u2019s eyes. I had no idea which ocean and, in the end, it didn\u2019t really matter.</p><p>Stop hiding and show yourself, Taylor, I said, my gaze sweeping the deserted sands around me.</p><p>He appeared at the far end of the beach, a thin form who cast a shadow that devoured the distance between us, stealing the heat in the air and the warmth from the sand.</p><p>Goose bumps ran across nonexistent skin, but I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Welcome to your doom, huntress. His soft voice carried as easily as thunder.</p><p>If that is my fate, then so be it. My voice was even. But you should know that fate and I are well acquainted, and I don\u2019t think she has plans to release me from her grip just yet.</p><p>His shadow drew closer, though he hadn\u2019t physically moved. I resisted the urge to step back. Resisted the desire to call Amaya into hand and swat at the creeping darkness near my toes.</p><p>Fate is a fickle friend, huntress. I would not be so sure about her intents if I were you.</p><p>Ah, but that\u2019s the benefit of being a strong clairvoyant\u2014surety of the future. Which was something more than a white lie when it came to my talents, but he wasn\u2019t to know that. Death will find me sooner than it should, but it will not be via your hands.</p><p>His shadow inched over my toes. It felt like oil, slick and dangerous, and my skin crawled at the sensation.</p><p>Kill, Amaya screamed. Touch you not.</p><p>Not yet. He was too far away. Too watchful.</p><p>I flexed my fingers, but otherwise didn\u2019t react as his slimy darkness began to twist itself around my ankles. It was nothing but shadows. Nothing to fear, despite appearances.</p><p>Taylor laughed. The sound grated across the stillness around us. I see you will not be rushed into foolish action, huntress. I\u2019m glad.</p><p>Making you happy is not my intent, I replied, voice still despite the darkness creeping farther up my legs. Why don\u2019t you give this game up, Taylor, and just turn yourself in?</p><p>And what? Avail myself of the Directorate\u2019s mercy? We both know there is no such thing for someone like me. No, I prefer to play the game my way. At least then I am surer of a favorable result.</p><p>Then let the game begin, I said, and called Amaya.</p><p>She appeared in a blaze of furious lilac fire, eager to taste flesh, be it real or astral. I swung her across my legs, severing the darkness that clung to me. Her flames dripped onto Taylor\u2019s long shadow and raced back down its length, but they never reached his body, stopping abruptly several feet away.</p><p>Come, huntress, he said, his tone mocking. You can do better than that.</p><p>All I intended was to release your leash, I said. This is your game, Taylor, not mine. I think the first shot should be yours.</p><p>As you wish, he said, then disappeared.</p><p>I\u2019d half hoped he would make an all-out frontal assault, but it was obvious the bastard was going to make this battle long and slow. Which didn\u2019t mean I had to play it that way.</p><p>I closed my eyes and imagined myself standing next to him. Though there was little sensation of movement, I suddenly found myself at the far end of the beach. Taylor\u2019s footprints marred the white sand, but Taylor himself was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>I frowned and half turned, my gaze searching the emptiness around me. There was nothing\u2014nothing except the sensation of air recoiling. It wasn\u2019t from Taylor, but rather from something else. Something that was approaching really fast.</p><p>Then I remembered that Taylor could alter the way I saw the astral plane.</p><p>I ducked and flung Amaya upward. She connected with something so hard the force of it reverberated down my arm and made imaginary teeth rattle.</p><p>White ash, she screamed. Hate!</p><p>White ash was used by witches to repel all manner of darkness, demons included\u2014which meant that Taylor knew what my sword was.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>I dropped her away from the invisible ash staff and scrambled backward. Taylor laughed, an eerie sound that came out of the emptiness surrounding me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother hanging around to see what he was going to do next, but lunged forward, using the tremor of recoiling air as a guide as I attempted to slice him in half. Azriel might have said it wasn\u2019t actually possible to do that on this level of the astral plane, but I had hurt him last time I\u2019d called Amaya into action, so it was worth a shot.</p><p>It was a shot that proved futile, because her blade hit nothing but air. I paused, Amaya held at the ready, my gaze searching the immediate area as I tried yet again to pinpoint his position.</p><p>And in doing so, I realized the beach was different. It was fading. Or rather, a fog was devouring it\u2014the same sort of fog that had greeted me when I\u2019d first stepped onto the plane. But why? What advantage did it give him when I couldn\u2019t see him now under the fierce sunshine I\u2019d imagined?</p><p>The thought died as awareness prickled my skin.</p><p>He was behind me.</p><p>I raised Amaya and spun around. Caught a glimpse of Taylor\u2019s wickedly pointed staff swooping toward me before the fog whisked him from sight. I lunged forward, under his blow, attempting to skewer him with Amaya\u2019s point. Once again I stabbed nothing but air. I swore and caught my balance. Felt the wash of movement against my skin and jumped back.</p><p>But nowhere near fast enough.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s staff whacked my left arm with such force that it knocked me sideways. The pain of the blow reverberated through every fiber, as sharp and as real as if I was wearing flesh. Warm stickiness flowed from the impact point and I glanced down quickly. There was no blood, no indication that I\u2019d even been hit, nor should there have been since I wasn\u2019t here physically.</p><p>And yet the blood still flowed.</p><p>Imagination, I reminded myself fiercely. He was playing with my mind.</p><p>The fog crept over the remnants of my beach, obliterating it completely. Again I had to wonder why. Was it something to do with his blindness in real life? Did he think the fog gave him some advantage over me? It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t already have enough of those\u2014The thought stopped as I suddenly realized what he was doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taylor wanted me dead, and to do that he had to get me up into the umbra. He had no idea how skilled or not I was at astral traveling, so he was using the fog not only to disguise his movements, but to hide which level we were on.</p><p>I swished my sword back and forth. The fog boiled away from her flames, and I caught a glimpse of Taylor moving to my left. I imagined standing behind him, unseen, unheard. Moved in an instant, and swept Amaya left to right. Made contact, though where or what I hit I couldn\u2019t say. It could have been Taylor; it could have been his staff. He made no sound to give me any indication either way.</p><p>Yet the smell of blood suddenly seemed to permeate the air.</p> <p>His or mine?</p><p>And how was something like that even possible, given that Azriel had said a soul could be killed only in the umbra?</p><p>Killed, yes, a voice inside me whispered\u2014a voice that sounded suspiciously like Azriel\u2019s\u2014but remember Adeline\u2019s warning. What happens to you on the plane can become reality if the illusion is powerful enough.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s illusion was certainly powerful enough.</p><p>To repeat a favorite phrase, fuck, fuck, fuck!</p> <p>Which meant it really was time to stop playing the game his way. I needed to start moving up the levels, but I doubted he\u2019d follow easily. He wanted to play, and I very much suspected he\u2019d want me far weaker\u2014bloodied and bleeding and on the edge of exhaustion\u2014before he stepped onto the umbra and attempted to finish me off.</p><p>I had to convince him that I\u2019d reached that state\u2014that I was scared and on the run\u2014long before I actually reached that point. And that meant I had to take far more blows than I already had.</p><p>Not something I really wanted to do, but I had little choice.</p><p>I gripped Amaya a bit tighter. Her hissing ramped up a couple of notches, an echo of the tension that gripped me. I swung her back and forth and watched the recoiling fog, trying to catch another glimpse of Taylor. For several heartbeats there was nothing; then air caressed my skin.</p><p>Once again, the bastard was behind me.</p><p>I waited until the last possible moment\u2014until my nerves were a mess and the need to move so fierce it felt like every piece of me quivered\u2014then twisted around and lashed out with Amaya.</p> <p>She hit something solid and screamed in pain. I jumped back, releasing her from the ash, and heard the whip of air coming in from the right. I bit my lip, and once again waited until the very last moment to jump out of the way.</p><p>Something thin and leather-like snapped across my spine and bit deep. A scream was torn from me and blood flowed, on the field and no doubt in real life.</p><p>And while the wounds might be nothing more than a product of imagination and Taylor\u2019s will\u2014here on the astral plane, at least\u2014they damn well felt real.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t do much about any of the wounds that were appearing on my flesh, either here or in reality, simply because I needed to make Taylor believe I was scared enough to run. No hard task, as it was becoming the truth.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t hurt enough yet. Taylor had nicknamed me huntress, and he wasn\u2019t likely to believe I\u2019d be panicked into running so quickly. I had to take at least one more serious hit.</p><p>I watched the fog roll away from Amaya\u2019s point, feeling the backwash that was the plane reacting to Taylor\u2019s movements, but not actually reacting to them myself. The coward was coming in from behind again. My skin crawled as he drew closer and closer, until the itch was so bad I could have sworn I\u2019d have to react or go crazy.</p><p>Staff! Amaya screamed. Up!</p><p>I didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t obey. I just waited, my body tense, as the whoosh of air came down hard and fast. Amaya hissed and spat her fury. The flames that roiled from her steel crawled upward, as if seeking to incinerate the staff before it reached us. As her lilac fire began to wrap itself around the oncoming weapon and her screaming ramped up to fever pitch, I threw myself sideways.</p> <p>The blow that was meant to split my head hit my shoulder instead, and once again it bit deep. I yelped in pain and there was nothing false or forced about it. As an odd weakness began to wash through my astral being, I closed my eyes and imagined myself on the second layer of the plane.</p><p>I opened my eyes, registered the lack of the enveloping grayness, then heard the air snap with sound. The whip slicing toward me again.</p><p>I imagined my fingers wrapping around the thin end of the leather weapon. Imagined it coiling around my hand as I stepped onto the next level of the astral plane. Felt the sudden shift in the air, and opened my eyes to see a beach that was far darker and more faded than before, and one that remained free of Taylor\u2019s fog. The third level, if all had gone according to plan. All I had do now was hope Taylor took the bait and followed. He should, since he actually wanted me in the umbra as much I wanted him there, but the insane often don\u2019t do the predictable.</p><p>Pain rippled across my fingers. I glanced down and realized I was still holding the whip in my hand. It was long and wicked-looking, and it was eating into my flesh with needle-sharp teeth.</p><p>I yelped again and flung it away without thought, then realized leather couldn\u2019t actually do that. It was Taylor, altering reality as I saw it. Which meant he was here, somewhere.</p><p>I did a slow turn and scanned the darkened beach. No Taylor, no creepy, oily shadow, but that didn\u2019t mean much. He was here somewhere\u2014the quiver in the air told me that, even if it didn\u2019t seem to be giving away his location. Maybe he\u2019d worked out that I was using it to track him.</p><p>I swung Amaya back and forth, and imagined her flames wrapping around the unseen and revealing their presence.</p><p>Fingers of lilac fire immediately swept across the empty beach, the arc wide at first, then gradually narrowing, until they formed a fist around emptiness.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t empty.</p><p>Very few people have such control on the plane, huntress, he said, as he reappeared. The flames cast an odd purple light across his skin, and made it look like he was wearing a bejeweled death mask.</p><p>It was a death mask that held no features.</p><p>I shivered\u2014an action that reverberated across the faded beach. Taylor smiled. I smell your fear, huntress. It is a fine scent.</p><p>Him so pleasant, Amaya commented.</p><p>Amusement ran through me, though it did little to lessen the tension. My sword seemed to be gaining a sense of humor, and though I wasn\u2019t sure if this was a good thing or not, it was certainly better than her continual screaming for a kill.</p><p>Kill good.</p><p>Maybe her bloodthirstiness was rubbing off on me, because I could only wholeheartedly agree that killing Taylor would be good. But it could happen only in the umbra, and we weren\u2019t there yet.</p><p>Fear is a useful tool, I commented. It sharpens the reflexes.</p><p>I wondered if Amaya\u2019s fire was capable of dragging Taylor onto the next level, if only because it would be a whole lot easier\u2014not to mention less painful\u2014if I could. I briefly imagined her flames dragging him closer, and though they rippled and moved, nothing changed\u2014certainly not Taylor\u2019s position.</p><p>Which in turn meant her flames might not actually have him contained. Maybe he was simply pretending to be so in an attempt to lure me into a false sense of security.</p><p>God, the bastard had me second-guessing everything I did.</p><p>But is it so useful? he said. Perhaps we should test this theory of yours, huntress.</p><p>He threw something into the air, but I ignored the instinct to follow the movement and see what it was. I wasn\u2019t that green.</p><p>He chuckled, the sound grating down my spine. I shifted my feet, readying for an attack, but for several seconds nothing happened. His eyeless features just stared at me through the glow of his lilac cage.</p><p>Without warning, something hit me side on and threw me into the air. I twisted around, landing in a rolling tumble, then bounced back to my feet.</p><p>There was nothing there. Nothing I could see or feel, anyway.</p><p>Amaya?</p><p>Something, she replied. Hides.</p><p>Obviously. Where?</p><p>Everywhere.</p><p>Oh, great.</p><p>I swished her back and forth, but her flames didn\u2019t reveal anything\u2014sinister or not\u2014hiding.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at Taylor. He was still encaged, but an odd sense of satisfaction oozed from him. Bastard, I thought, and imagined myself standing next to him. The minute I was, I lashed out with a clenched fist. I should have hit nothing but air, but his head snapped back, as if I had hit him.</p><p>Then he disappeared again, and the lilac flames fell to the ground, landing in tight coils that writhed and burned.</p><p>Seems you could do with a little fear yourself, I said.</p><p>It was certainly a blow that should never have hit. I shall endeavor to restrain my confidence a little bit longer.</p><p>His voice was so close to me I felt the brush of air past my cheek. I spun around and lashed out with my sword, but hit nothing.</p><p>Then something hit me again.</p><p>I staggered sideways, then caught my balance and swung around, sweeping Amaya from left to right. Still nothing but air.</p><p>Another blow, this time to my right side. I twisted, lashed out. Caught nothing.</p><p>What the fuck were these things?</p><p>A growl rolled across the silence. I swallowed heavily. Damn if that didn\u2019t sound like a hellhound . . .</p><p>This time I felt the stir of air. I leapt up, twisted around, and stabbed downward. Hit something so hard my whole body shuddered with the impact. Amaya\u2019s flames fanned outward, encasing a hound-like shape.</p><p>Whether it was actually was from hell or just another product of Taylor\u2019s twisted mind, I had no idea\u2014and right now it wasn\u2019t important. I pulled Amaya free and slashed at the hound\u2019s neck. It exploded, sending me tumbling through the grayness.</p><p>They come! Amaya\u2019s shriek was so fierce and loud I could have sworn it echoed across the plane, not just in my head.</p><p>Oh, fuck! I had no time to think or do anything else, because they were on me. Invisible beasts that snarled and slashed and tore at skin that didn\u2019t exist on this plane. Pain burned through me on all levels and blood flowed, until I was slick with it. I fought, god how I fought, but there were too many of them. Far too many, even for Amaya.</p><p>Run! the voice that sounded so much like Azriel screamed.</p><p>Instantly, I reached for the level that divided earth and the astral plane from the gray fields. Imagined myself there, free from the teeth and claws that rent my skin. Felt the plane shift, and then blessed silence. I didn\u2019t immediately move. I just lay on my back, panting madly, desperate to regain equilibrium and strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, I opened my eyes. The umbra was a place of shadows and darkness. I could see only a little of the beach on this level, but this was the dividing line between earth and the fields, and that was to be expected.</p><p>Something moved. I tightened my grip on Amaya, then realized that this time the movement held no threat.</p><p>The Du\u0161an had stirred to life.</p> <p>She coiled up my flesh, then moved across my shoulders and down my right arm. Her eyes glinted in the distant, smoky surrounds of the umbra, and her teeth shone. She wanted out, wanted action.</p><p>Not yet, I murmured. Not just yet.</p><p>I agree. Taylor\u2019s voice was so close beside me I jumped. Death shall not find you just yet, but it will come, huntress. Even now, your flesh weakens. Soon, your heart will stop, and you will find yourself trapped in this place of nothingness, never to move on or be reborn.</p><p>Panic surged and I scrambled upright. Or tried to. My legs were like jelly and they refused to support my weight. One heartbeat later, I was on my knees. Which was stupid, because the wounds weren\u2019t real. The hounds hadn\u2019t chomped and chewed; I was whole and unhurt and fit.</p><p>But no matter how much I repeated that to myself, it didn\u2019t seem to make one jot of difference. Maybe the umbra didn\u2019t work that way.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I took a deep breath, imagined it flowing through my being like a sweet breeze, blowing away the hurt and the pain as it refilled the wells of my strength.</p><p>Then slowly\u2014and somewhat unsteadily\u2014I climbed to my feet, Amaya clenched tightly in my hands. Her fire dripped from the end of the steel and formed a wide circle around me, as if drawing a line in the sand and daring Taylor to cross.</p><p>He didn\u2019t accept the challenge. He remained where he\u2019d appeared, his arms crossed and satisfaction oozing from his pores.</p><p>Standing there watching me die seems a bit anticlimactic after all your huff and puff, I commented. I was under the impression you wanted to kill me yourself.</p><p>I wanted a challenge and you certainly provided it. But I am no fool. I have you here now, and here you\u2019ll stay.</p><p>I snorted. You can\u2019t stop me from returning to flesh, Taylor\u2014</p> <p>On the contrary, he interrupted. I can.</p><p>Fear slithered through me. I was playing into his hands, I knew that, but he was far too watchful for me to release the one ace I held up my sleeve. Or on my arm, as was the case with the Du\u0161an.</p><p>No one has that much power, Taylor. Not even someone like you.</p><p>His amusement swam around me, taunting and stinging. Do you remember Dorothy?</p><p>Yes. I continued to swing Amaya back and forth, watching him warily. The Du\u0161an had settled into my right forearm, her glow fading but not her readiness. She felt like a coiled spring, ready to explode from my flesh the minute I gave the word.</p><p>She was screaming, unraveling, and yet she did not return to her flesh. I prevented that, as I will prevent you.</p><p>That\u2019s what you were doing when you touched her forehead, I replied, suddenly realizing what had happened.</p><p>He nodded. By touching her, I not only marked her with what she was, but I pinned her in place while I drained her, both in real life and on the plane.</p> <p>Well, he wasn\u2019t going to be touching me, that was for fucking sure. So basically, you\u2019re a coward.</p><p>Anger snapped around me, thick and fast. I am no coward, huntress. As you can see. He made a motion with his hand. Silver spun out of the darkness, slashing toward my torso. I raised Amaya and steel clashed with steel.</p><p>Coward, I spat. Everything you do is from a distance, Taylor. Why? Do you fear getting close to someone who can actually defend herself?</p><p>More steel came out of the shadows. I slashed and parried and battered it away, calling him a coward at every blow. His anger grew, and the attacks became more furious, until all I could see was silver and all I could feel was blood and pain.</p><p>Now, I said to the Du\u0161an. Do it now.</p><p>She ripped free with a scream that seemed to echo all the pain and fury that filled me, and formed shape, growing and expanding as she hurtled toward Taylor.</p><p>I felt his shock as strongly as if it were my own; then the steel assault stopped and he began to fade\u2014but nowhere near quickly enough to escape. The Du\u0161an whipped across the shadows and wrapped around him, coiling so tightly she would have snapped bones if he\u2019d actually been wearing flesh.</p><p>He screamed then, and began to struggle, but to little avail. The hunter had finally been snared.</p><p>I blew out a relieved breath, and lowered Amaya as I walked toward him. Fury battered me, but it was tinged now with fear. His fear, not mine.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>There\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t know about me, Taylor, I said softly. I\u2019m not human.</p><p>His fear increased. God, it was so sweet. No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re a werewolf.</p><p>Oh, I\u2019m much more than that, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m what the reapers are\u2014a being of energy rather than just flesh and blood. Remember mentioning that my control was greater than most on this realm? Well, that\u2019s because this place is far more mine than it will ever be yours.</p><p>If he\u2019d had a face, I think his eyes would have been wide and staring. I stepped closer to him and stopped.</p><p>This is for Dorothy, I said. As well as Vonda and Dani Belmore, and all the other countless women you\u2019ve killed over your many years of hunting.</p><p>He snarled and spat at me. I sidestepped, and the globule landed near Amaya\u2019s point, hissing like acid.</p><p>Do your worst, he snapped. I will be reborn, and I will remember. Fear for the future, huntress, because I will be back.</p><p>I snorted. I may fear for my future, Taylor, but it won\u2019t be because of anything you might or might not do\u2014because you won\u2019t be doing anything. We\u2019re in the umbra, remember. Death here is final.</p><p>He screamed then. Screamed long and loud and fearfully.</p><p>I raised Amaya and killed him.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I rose through the levels of consciousness slowly, gradually becoming aware of the sounds and scents that surrounded me.</p><p>They were not pleasant scents. Not to the sensitive nose of a wolf, anyway. Antiseptic mingled with the smells of the dying and the diseased, creating a veil of misery and pain that permeated not only the air but the very foundations of the building. The minute I became aware of them, they became a weight that pressed down on my chest and made it difficult to breathe.</p><p>I was in a goddamn hospital. God, I had to get out of here, had to move\u2014</p><p>A hand caught mine. Warm, familiar, feminine hands. Ilianna, not Azriel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d My voice cracked, and my throat felt raw. I opened my eyes. Ilianna smiled, but there was little disguising the worry in her expression. Not out of the woods yet, obviously. \u201cI\u2019m in a goddamn hospital, so how the hell can I be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive, and that\u2019s pretty amazing considering all you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>She poured a glass of water, then offered it to me, straw first. I tried to lift my head, but it suddenly seemed heavier than a thousand bricks. She tilted the cup a little more, and managed to get some moisture down my throat.</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment, then asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTao and I have been taking turns sitting by your side. He headed to the caf\u00e9 about twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Even that hurt. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive days\u2014longer than Rhoan, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Relief hit, so thick and fast tears stung my closed eyelids. \u201cHe\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>It was an inane question\u2014if he was awake he was obviously alive\u2014but I still wanted her to say the words.</p><p>\u201cNot only alive, but home. He got the all clear yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Riley had Quinn stationed in here so she could get constant updates on your condition while she was beside Rhoan.\u201d</p><p>I glanced past her, for the first time seeing Uncle Quinn sitting in the corner. His warm smile crinkled the corners of his dark eyes. \u201cRiley says to hurry up and get well, because she intends on knocking both your and Rhoan\u2019s thick heads together.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, which hurt, but at that particular moment I didn\u2019t really care. I was alive, Rhoan was alive, and Taylor was dead.</p><p>\u201cNow that I have seen for myself that you are awake, I shall leave.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I need to eat.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure there would have been more than a couple of nurses willing to offer their services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but there is only one neck I desire.\u201d He walked over to the bed and dropped a kiss on my forehead. \u201cDo not lapse back into a coma. Riley would be most displeased.\u201d</p><p>If he thought I was in any danger of lapsing, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving. \u201cGive her a kiss for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He left, and my gaze returned to Ilianna. \u201cSo why was I out so long? Even if I\u2019d lost a lot of blood, I shouldn\u2019t have been out for five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the poison.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cPoison? What poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the hounds that attacked you on the astral plane,\u201d Azriel replied, and suddenly appeared on the other side of the bed.</p><p>I very much suspected he\u2019d been there the entire time, though I hadn\u2019t actually sensed him. But there was more than one reaper in this place, so maybe I was suffering some sort of temporary sensory overload.</p><p>My gaze met his. Anger and relief vied for dominance in the turbulent depths of his blue eyes. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t real. They were just a product of Taylor\u2019s imag\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t,\u201d he cut in. \u201cAnd because these particular beasts were little more than plague bearers, the wounds became poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought the hospital would have known how to cope with that sort of poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t,\u201d Ilianna said. \u201cKiandra did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was here?\u201d Holy shit!</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even have to call her.\u201d Ilianna wrinkled her nose. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have an easy time of pinning down the particular branch of poison, though. It really was touch and go for a while there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMeaning Taylor was close to winning anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d Ilianna rose suddenly from the bed. \u201cAnd on that cheery note, I\u2019m off to the canteen to grab a bite to eat. Don\u2019t do anything daft while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I muttered, \u201cthere goes my idea of line dancing down the hall with all the other reapers.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, collected her purse, then headed out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said, amusement teasing my lips, \u201cwas a very obvious exit. Your doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sat down on the bed and caught my hand in his, entwining our fingers. Heat pressed into my skin, and warmed far more than it should have. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat for? It\u2019s not like you could have done anything to help me on the astral plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if I had not been so foolishly stubborn, I could have done something once your astral being had returned to flesh.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him, confused. \u201cBut what? It\u2019s not like you can heal me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but that\u2019s not entirely the truth.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment. Though I wasn\u2019t really surprised that he hadn\u2019t been honest with me\u2014even with something as simple as that\u2014it still hurt. I thought we\u2019d at least gotten past the lies\u2014</p><p>\u201cI did not entirely lie,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI currently cannot fully heal you. Not against major wounds or the infection the hounds caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot heal because I no longer have the energy.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to recharge,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have gone a long time without doing so, and it is beginning to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you and I made love,\u201d I said, my confusion growing. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have recharged then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d His fingers tightened around mine. Pain rippled, but I didn\u2019t say anything. He could have crushed my hand and I don\u2019t think I would have said anything. My gaze\u2014and my attention\u2014was on his face. A face that did not reveal his emotions, even though the turbulent force of them ran like quicksilver through my being. \u201cI erroneously believed it was better for the mission and us both that I hold myself apart, and not take what I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I hesitated, then said, \u201cIt increases the risk of assimilation, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And at the time, I feared that more than I feared not being able to heal you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked, my gaze searching his, seeking an admission, wanting to hear that he cared even though it was obvious that he did. More than he should, more than was wise.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI know there is a fate far worse than remaining a dark angel for time eternal.\u201d</p> <p>Tears stung my eyes. While it was an admission I\u2019d ached to hear, it was nevertheless a dangerous one for us both. We both had dreams of a future once this quest was ended, and what now lay acknowledged between us was as dangerous to those dreams as the quest itself.</p><p>\u201cSo where does that leave us?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The only thing I do know is that I could not ever relive the horror of the last five days. Fighting to protect your body while you were battling for your life on the astral plane was bad enough, but being able to do little more than watch you weaken from wounds I should have been able to heal . . .\u201d He paused and took a deep breath. \u201cNot again. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>Just for a moment, the control vanished, and emotions were there for all to see, so deep and dark and raw that it made my heart ache.</p><p>I tugged him toward me, wrapped my free arm around his neck, and just held him. The press of his body felt so real and right that tears trickled down my cheeks. Because it might be real, but it wasn\u2019t right. Not really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to risk assimilation if it helps us both,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut the decision has to be yours. You\u2019re the only one who truly understands the consequences either way.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything immediately; then he sighed and pulled away. His gaze, when it caught mine, was troubled.</p><p>\u201cThen we take the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd may fate be gentle on us both.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
