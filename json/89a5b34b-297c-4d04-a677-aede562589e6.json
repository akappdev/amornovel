We stared at each other across the small table like foes across a battlefield, weapons honed and at the ready.</p><p>But we weren\u2019t enemies.</p> <p>We just weren\u2019t anything else, either, exactly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to play sometime tonight?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re scared, I can give you a little more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t rush genius,\u201d I said, looking over the fan of cards in my hand at the man who sat across from me.</p><p>He was tall and lean with light brown hair long enough to tuck behind his ears or flop into his eyes. His eyes, blue and usually glazed with happiness, smiled back at me. He looked young\u2014fresh-faced and eager\u2014but he had the skills of a warrior and the heart of a tiger. Quite literally.</p><p>Jeff Christopher was a shape-shifter and a member of my family\u2019s Pack, the North American Central.</p> <p>I crossed one leg over the other, my skirt, tights, and dark boots not doing nearly enough to combat the chill in the air. Little Red, the bar where we played cards, was much beloved by the North American Central Pack. But it was old, dingy, and exceedingly cold.</p><p>Tonight we were nearly alone, except for my aunt Berna, who stood behind the bar furtively\u2014or so she thought\u2014reading Twilight for the fourteenth time, and the wail of Robert Johnson on the jukebox across the room. But the sun had barely set. Soon enough, more of the city\u2019s shape-shifters would fill the bar with leather, magic, and muscle.</p><p>I pulled the four of clubs from my hand and dropped it onto the first of three piles of cards on the table. Jeff glanced at it, then looked at me with calculation.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose again.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMy manly ego can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour manly ego doesn\u2019t care as long as I don\u2019t beat you at \u2018Jakob\u2019s Quest.\u2019 \u201d That was his favorite video game. He was a master at it, as he was with most things related to tech.</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re, what, twelve games to nine now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve to eight,\u201d I said, biting back a smile. And he wouldn\u2019t make it to nine, given the cards in my hand. \u201cBut nice try.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, picked up the four, and stuffed it into his deck, then debated which card to give up. If he was picking up a four\u2014a basically useless card\u2014he must not have many options.</p><p>Jeff made his decision, dropping a three onto the table. It was a good choice; threes were even more useless than fours. But it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>And now, I thought, it\u2019s time to pull the trigger and put him out of his misery.</p><p>I slid a card from my hand, and placed it on the middle of the three piles with a snap of its corner.</p><p>\u201cI call the crown,\u201d I said with a grin, the ace of diamonds shining victoriously.</p><p>Shock flashed in his eyes; he hadn\u2019t known I held the ace\u2014much less the ace of diamonds, the penultimate card in Call the Crown, a favorite game of the NAC.</p> <p>Jeff looked up at me again, smile blooming. \u201cI was sure that thing was in the handmaiden deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. I pulled it in the third round.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brightened with amusement. He had such an innocently handsome face, but it belied his strength and passion. Like me, he was fiercely loyal to the Pack.</p><p>I was Fallon, the only daughter in the Keene family. Gabriel, the oldest, was Apex of the Pack. I was second oldest, and I was followed in age (and alphabet, because my mother had had a weird sense of humor) by Eli, Derek, Christopher, and Ben. Adam had once been the baby, but he\u2019d betrayed Gabriel, the family, and the Pack. He was no longer a Keene.</p><p>If anything happened to Gabriel, I was next in line for the crown. That made me the first possible female Apex in the history of the North American Central. Technically, Gabriel\u2019s son, Connor, was the heir apparent. But he wasn\u2019t even a year old yet, and control of the Pack couldn\u2019t pass to an infant. For now, that made me the runner up.</p><p>It also made me the biggest shape-shifting prize in the country.</p><p>I put the rest of my cards on the table and gathered up my winnings. The tabletop, one of ten or fifteen around us, was etched with time and sticky with decades of beer and whiskey. It took two passes to collect the quarters we\u2019d anted.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes thirteen,\u201d I said, sliding them into my jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve won nine,\u201d Jeff said with a smile, pulling the rest of the cards into a tidy deck. \u201cWe\u2019re still close. Nearly evenly matched.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d meant the cards . . . and us. The game in which we\u2019d both been pawns. My stomach tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, reaching over and putting a hand over mine. He must have sensed my dismay.</p><p>The contact sent a jolt of magic and emotion through my body, that sense of belonging and familiarity that Jeff Christopher triggered with every touch and heartrending smile.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t for me. And that\u2019s what it all came down to.</p><p>I pulled back my hand, glanced at my watch. \u201cNo worries. But I should be going.\u201d</p><p>He tried for a smile, but it wasn\u2019t convincing. \u201cAre you going to turn into a pumpkin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to meet someone,\u201d I said, and those few words were enough to make the cheer in his eyes fade away.</p><p>His doubt only lasted a moment; his eyes steeled with determination, and he settled them on me. \u201cSomeone?\u201d he asked, but he didn\u2019t wait for me to answer. \u201cA potential mate, you mean.\u201d</p><p>The Pack believed every Apex needed a companion, a man or woman strong enough to help the Apex hold the Pack. Since I could one day be that Apex, it fell to my family to identify potential mates. A doomsday plan in dating form.</p><p>Brains and brawn were popular traits, but they weren\u2019t the only qualifications. Each family of shape-shifters took a specific animal form. The Keenes were wolves, the same form as the first known shape-shifters, Romulus and Remus, and thus the most prestigious. Wolves were the First Animals of the First Pack.</p><p>The shifting was magical, but the form was all about genetics. And that\u2019s what it really came down to.</p><p>Jeff Christopher, brilliant and charming, was a beautiful and powerful animal: sleek fur; wide, predatory eyes; heavy paws; long, swishing tail.</p><p>Jeff was a tiger.</p><p>Pack protocol\u2014Pack tradition\u2014said shifters who transformed into different animals shouldn\u2019t be together. Sure, some people ignored the rules. But those people weren\u2019t members of the Apex\u2019s family, and they certainly weren\u2019t second in line to the throne. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of rebellion.</p><p>Gabe and Jeff had been friends for some time. I\u2019d met him a few months ago. Gabe trusted and respected Jeff, who worked with Chuck Merit, a former cop who\u2019d been hired by a former mayor to help supernaturals in Chicago. Chuck Merit\u2019s agency was no longer official, but Jeff and his sorcerer colleague, Catcher Bell, still volunteered to solve supernatural dilemmas.</p><p>Gabe hadn\u2019t stopped our friendship or complained about the time we spent together, believing we\u2019d drift apart eventually. And as each season passed, the number of potentials Gabe trotted in front of me increased. Jeff was good people. But there were rules.</p><p>\u201cThe price of Jeff Christopher is too high,\u201d Gabriel was fond of saying. \u201cYou cannot have him and the Pack both.\u201d</p><p>Jeff knew about the tradition; every shape-shifter did. I think he\u2019d hoped Gabriel would change his mind, or the Pack would. That hadn\u2019t happened. But cold, hard facts hadn\u2019t done anything to diminish the fiery spark between us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said, slipping from his chair across the table to the one beside mine. His unique scent moved with him\u2014the deep and heady aromas of jungle and his warm and velvety cologne. So did his magic. It was usually bright and almost cheerful, shining like ripples of sunlight across water. But the mood had darkened, and so had his magic, the power that electrified the air like the moment before a storm.</p><p>He touched my hand again, sending a shock of magic up my spine. I fought hard against the promise of it. Our relationship hadn\u2019t been exactly platonic, but there were lines we hadn\u2019t crossed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Keene,\u201d I reminded him . . . and myself. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition. It\u2019s part of the Pack, part of who we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lame tradition. And I\u2019ll tell that to Gabe\u2019s face.\u201d His expression was fierce, but I knew better. Jeff Christopher was as loyal as they came.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d I said, but even I could hear the quiet whisper of doubt in my voice.</p><p>He reached up to brush a lock of my wavy hair behind my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a Keene. You\u2019re allowed to be Fallon, too.\u201d</p><p>Magic blossomed between us, an invisible arc that enveloped us both, sending goose bumps along my arms.</p><p>I swallowed down a bolt of lust. I pushed down the obvious interest from the wolf that prowled inside me, felt her keen disappointment when I stood up and pushed back my chair, which squealed in protest against the sticky and stained linoleum floor. The wolf didn\u2019t care about Jeff Christopher\u2019s form. That he was magic\u2014ferocious and male\u2014was enough for her.</p><p>There was no denying Jeff Christopher and I had good magic. But magic didn\u2019t win every battle. Sometimes family had to win, because it was the only victory a girl could afford.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re counting on me,\u201d I said, avoiding his eyes, afraid he\u2019d see my doubts, even though I\u2019d pushed them as far down into my gut as possible. \u201cAnd you know the other option.\u201d</p><p>Abdication. I could have Jeff Christopher if I gave up my claim to the Pack, my spot in the line of succession. But I\u2019d also be giving up my family, rejecting the training and education I\u2019d received as a potential Apex.</p><p>I cared about Jeff, but he wasn\u2019t for me. We weren\u2019t for each other. It might have been one of the great tragedies of my universe, but that didn\u2019t make it any less true.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days I\u2019m going to start taking your rejections personally.\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice was confident, but there was pain in his eyes. Still, he put up a good front. \u201cToday\u2019s not that day. I\u2019ll see you, Fallon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice drew my gaze back, and the promise in his eyes was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you,\u201d he said again, his guarantee.</p><p>2</p> <p>The Pack was based in Memphis, but our family had decamped to Chicago earlier in the year. We\u2019d made a promise to help Chicago\u2019s vampires manage the supernatural crises that emerged once they\u2019d announced their existence to the world.</p><p>We\u2019d looked for place that reminded us of home, and found a farmhouse long past its prime but with plenty of room to roam and bedrooms for the lot of us. The house wasn\u2019t in the best shape\u2014the once-vibrant cornflower blue paint had faded to a watery blue-gray\u2014but even tired around the edges she was beautiful. An enormous round porch wrapped nearly half the front of the house\u2014a must-have for a family with Southern roots\u2014and a turret with a conical roof jutted proudly from one side. The rest of the facade was a jangle of windows, shutters, and dormers.</p><p>The interior of the house still carried the scents of the generations that had come and gone. Each generation, each year, layering one smell over another like geological strata. Bundles of herbs hung to dry in the kitchen. Soft, old-fashioned perfume. Dirt and grass from long days of work.</p><p>I think that\u2019s ultimately why Gabe had picked the place\u2014because memories still lingered in the house, and they took the places of the Pack members we\u2019d left behind in Memphis.</p><p>I walked inside, hung my black peacoat on the baroque rack by the front door, and glanced into the antique mirror that hung there for a final check.</p> <p>I had plenty of earrings and ink, and my taste in clothes ran toward black and gray, muted colors, and interesting layers. My dark blond hair waved with curl I\u2019d gotten from my mother. My brandy-colored eyes were lined with kohl, and my cowl-necked sweater was dark, with long pointed sleeves, and fell nearly to the hem of my black pleated skirt.</p><p>As I prepared to meet another potential mate, a wolf in human clothing, I gave myself an honest appraisal. My eyes were sharp and clear, my mouth just wide enough to seem cheeky. I had good teeth, a great laugh, and a public school education that had done me plenty well. That didn\u2019t mean the potential would feel the same way. And even if I wasn\u2019t thrilled about the prospect of meeting him, no one liked rejection.</p><p>I tucked a lock of hair behind my ear, blew out a breath, and walked into the living room.</p><p>The entire family was in attendance amongst the faded velvet furniture: my brothers\u2014Gabriel to Ben\u2014plus Tanya, Gabe\u2019s wife, and Connor, his son and the prince in waiting. But as I ticked them off my mental checklist, I realized there wasn\u2019t a suitor in sight. Maybe he changed his mind, I thought with a thrill, and I could meet Jeff for pancakes, or we could watch a movie at his place.</p><p>The family huddled around Gabriel, tall and tawny-haired, with amber eyes that occasionally swirled with magic and broad shoulders. He was a presence, always. Occasionally the biggest man in the room, always the most imposing.</p><p>Eli had our mother\u2019s dark hair and blue eyes. Gabe, Ben, and Christopher, had the blond-brown hair and amber eyes of my father\u2019s side of the family, and Derek was a mix of the two, with dark hair and amber eyes. My parents had been a strange and beautiful pair\u2014his sundrenched athleticism against her small, exotic beauty.</p> <p>Like my parents, Tanya was Gabriel\u2019s physical foil. Absolutely beautiful in a soft and natural way, with cheeks that always seemed to glow healthy pink and dark hair currently pulled into a topknot. She bounced Connor in her arms and winked at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d Ben said, slinging an arm around me. \u201cI thought you were out with Jeffrey tonight.\u201d Ben wasn\u2019t a fan of the mate-parading tradition.</p><p>\u201cGabe wanted me to meet someone,\u201d I said, sliding my eldest brother a glance. He ignored the jab, kept his gaze on the box that sat on the pedestal table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cA potential?\u201d Ben asked, glancing at Gabriel. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here for you,\u201d Gabriel said, then looked at me. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time for the unveiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we unveiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old man\u2019s brought the crown out of storage,\u201d Eli said, stepping forward.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cFor Connor\u2019s initiation.\u201d</p> <p>The initiation was another Pack tradition, an opportunity for the actual heir apparent to be formally inducted into the NAC. Tomorrow, Connor would get a crown. Tonight, I got a blind date.</p><p>The prince won that round.</p><p>Wordlessly, Gabriel opened the box. The coronet, delicate and golden, with arches across the top, gleamed like a star\u2019s corona, nestled on a cushion of purple velvet.</p><p>Magic, heavy and ancient, spilled into the room.</p><p>Gabe lifted the crown, the etchings along the band catching the light and sprinkling it around the room. The history of the world was drawn there, the origin story of the men and women whose shadows unified the worlds of men and animals. The artist was long forgotten, but his or her craftsmanship lived on. As did the magic that had been spelled into it.</p><p>\u201cI think Connor might be a little small for it,\u201d Christopher said.</p><p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s got Gabe\u2019s gigantic melon,\u201d Ben said, reaching out and knuckling the top of Gabe\u2019s head. Only Ben could have gotten away with the gesture without pulling back a nub. He was the happiest of the Keenes, the one who smiled the most. And now that Adam was gone, he was the baby.</p><p>\u201cEvery melon in my family is fine,\u201d Gabe said, handing the coronet to me and running a hand through his hair to settle it again.</p><p>The crown was heavier than I\u2019d expected, and the metal was warmer. It had adorned generations of Pack leaders, Keenes and otherwise, and as the story went, had absorbed their magic along the way. Maybe that explained the weight.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can get the giraffe away from him long enough to get that thing on his head?\u201d Christopher wondered.</p><p>The giraffe had become Connor\u2019s favorite toy. He bathed with it, slept with it, played with it. And when it was taken away for cleaning or dinnertime, the young prince made his displeasure known to all.</p><p>Gabriel looked at him with a considering glance. Connor smiled back, kicking his feet merrily against his mother and holding his giraffe with drool-covered, pudgy baby fingers.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cBut it cost a fortune to get a guarded courier to bring it from Memphis. He\u2019ll wear it with or without the giraffe.\u201d</p><p>When Gabe extended a hand, I offered the coronet back to him, happy to have it out of my hands. We had no scepter, no ermine cape, no crown jewels. But we had the coronet. And as long as the Keene family held the crown, we held the Pack.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just a symbol of the NAC; it was the heart of the Apex\u2019s power. It allowed the Apex to reach the individual members of the Pack and call them together. It was a profound power\u2014the ability to compel shifters to the side of their alpha\u2014and one that had to be judiciously used. There weren\u2019t even many who knew what it could do; there wasn\u2019t much to be gained by advertising its power.</p><p>Many Pack members, including our extended family, had stayed in Memphis. We\u2019d left the crown and its weighty power in their trusted care. Now that it was here, the burden was ours to protect it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting it in the safe?\u201d Christopher asked.</p><p>We\u2019d stored emergency supplies inside an ancient steel safe we\u2019d hauled out of a building in Memphis that was being demolished.</p><p>\u201cSeems the best place for it,\u201d Gabe said, returning it to its cushion and closing the box again. \u201cAlthough there are spiders downstairs. I do not like spiders.\u201d</p><p>Gabe had faced pissed-off shifters, irritated vampires, and worse. But spiders were his mortal enemies. To be fair, the basement\u2019s spiders were large and in charge.</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Ben said, clapping him on the back. \u201cWe all have our burdens to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe have company.\u201d</p><p>We all looked to the doorway, where a man nearly blocked it completely.</p><p>He was built like a linebacker. Shoulders wide as mountains, every muscle defined beneath a leather jacket, snug cotton shirt, and jeans. He had dark, wavy hair and gray eyes beneath a hooded brow; his mouth was lush. He had the kind of good looks people would describe as \u201crugged,\u201d and he certainly looked like he could handle himself.</p><p>He tugged leather gloves from his hands and stuffed them into the pockets of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cPatrick York,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Gabriel hadn\u2019t told me whom I\u2019d be meeting today, and I hadn\u2019t bothered to ask. But I absolutely hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><p>There were three other Packs in the U.S.: Consolidated Atlantic, Western, and Great Northwestern. Within those packs were a few big, old families, including ours and the Yorks, led by patriarch Richard, Patrick\u2019s father. But while we controlled a Pack, the Yorks were members, and not very active ones. The family lived in Wisconsin, which put them in the territory of the NAC Pack, but they hadn\u2019t attended a Pack convocation in years.</p><p>If Patrick York was here to meet me, that was changing. And the pressure was on.</p><p>\u201cPatrick, meet the family,\u201d Gabriel said. He pointed us out in turn. \u201cChristopher, Ben, Eli, Derek, Tanya, Connor. And Fallon.\u201d</p><p>I offered a wave, my stomach clenching with nerves.</p><p>Patrick smiled at me, his gray eyes intense. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your drive?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks. Hasn\u2019t started snowing yet, although I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d His gaze fell on the box on the table, and his eyes widened. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll four pounds of it,\u201d Gabe said, giving him a considering glance. \u201cYou want to hold it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Patrick said with a grin, lifting his hands and stepping back. \u201cDefinitely not. I don\u2019t want any part of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want part of a crown?\u201d Ben asked, patting Gabe on the back. \u201cAll the power. The fame.\u201d He glanced around the living room, which had seen better days. \u201cThe glamour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely, but I\u2019m happy to take your word for it. You preparing for Connor\u2019s initiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Would you like to join us?\u201d Initiations were usually family affairs, but Gabe knew when to extend the olive branch.</p><p>Patrick shook his head. \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t want to intrude. And I\u2019m only in town for the night. Leaving in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>He was, he\u2019d meant, only in town to meet me. Which somehow made the potential mate thing feel even more tawdry.</p><p>Gabriel smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay longer next time, get a feel for Chicago. It\u2019s a great town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked like it coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least the parts I saw from the car. I\u2019ll see a bit more of it on the way to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded. \u201cSince you\u2019re only here for a little while, we should get out of your hair.\u201d Gabe looked at the rest of the family, who made awkward throat clearing noises. Ben winked at me, picked up the box, and headed out of the room.</p><p>The air\u2014and the magic in it\u2014thinned.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re . . . intense,\u201d Patrick said.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI have a lot of brothers. It\u2019s the worst case scenario for potentials.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with curiosity. \u201cYou are not at all what I expected.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to take that. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA debutante, I guess.\u201d He looked me over, took in hair and clothes. \u201cLess serious. More giggly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am definitely not giggly. But I can kill a man in forty-two different ways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForty-two. That\u2019s impressive. I appreciate a woman who can take care of herself.\u201d He looked around the room. \u201cI have a car outside. Would you like to go for a drive?\u201d</p><p>Fraternal magic\u2014hopeful and concerned\u2014seeped in from the next room. Space seemed like a good idea.</p><p>\u201cMore than you can possibly imagine.\u201d I headed for the door.</p><p>3</p><p>I\u2019d donned my coat on the way out, but that hardly battled back the chill in the air. The air was cold and heavy, unusually still. I agreed with Patrick; snow was coming.</p><p>A sleek, black SUV sat in the gravel drive in front of the house. A man in a slick black suit\u2014head shaved, eyes dark and piercing\u2014held open the back door.</p><p>Patrick gestured to the driver. \u201cTom Webb, this is Fallon Keene. Fallon, Tom Webb. He\u2019s been helping the family for many years.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know the details of the Yorks\u2019 business, but it had something to do with timber. If Patrick had a driver, I guessed business was good.</p> <p>Webb smiled, but his eyes were still appraising. I read loyalty in the look, the fact that he took my measure and considered whether I was the right woman for the Yorks\u2019 favorite son.</p><p>I slid into the backseat, and Patrick followed.</p><p>\u201cNice ride,\u201d I said when Tom had closed the door behind us.</p><p>Patrick\u2019s grin was sheepish. \u201cThanks. I need the space.\u201d He gestured toward his long legs, which filled the foot well. His shoulders practically filled his half of the backseat.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d Patrick asked.</p><p>It was dark, and February. There was only so much that one could see of the city from the backseat of a car. \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve never been to Chicago, I\u2019m honor bound to at least get you a look at the skyline.\u201d</p><p>I leaned toward the front seat. \u201cHead left, and when you get back to the main road, turn right. There\u2019s an historic marker about three miles down. Pull in when you see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Tom said. The tinted screen rose, separating the front and back seats, and we pulled away from the house and back onto the long, gravel drive.</p><p>Patrick looked at me with interest. \u201cArchaeology field trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see when we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always up for an adventure,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cTell me about yourself. Other than the fact that you\u2019re next in line for control of the North American Central Pack.\u201d</p><p>His tone was sarcastic, which helped me relax. There\u2019d been plenty of other potentials\u2014men with whom I\u2019d shared coffee or pizza\u2014whose first questions were about Gabriel, the kingship, the Pack. They\u2019d slipped through Gabriel\u2019s screening and were interested in me only because I could help them get closer to him.</p><p>Potentials like that gave the process a bad flavor. But I\u2019d become adept at scaring them away, at feigning enough crazy to give them second thoughts. And if they became too handsy, a knee to the balls put them in line again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-seven. I like music. I live for coffee and good bagels. I believe in fairy tales, but not fairy godmothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat list sounds well-practiced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met my fair share of potentials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nobody was interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s interesting in their way.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut a relationship needs more than interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spark,\u201d he said, looking out his window. \u201cIt needs the spark.\u201d</p><p>I had the sense from his tone that he\u2019d had the spark before. Since he was in the car with me, I presumed he hadn\u2019t managed to capture it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m the outdoorsy type. I like to fish. Hike. Chop wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lumberjack.\u201d</p><p>He laughed heartily. \u201cYeah. I guess you could say that.\u201d He flexed an impressive bicep. \u201cKeeps a man in shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs this\u2014is this what you really want? I mean, this whole potential thing?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window, watched farmland pass as Tom took the road at a leisurely pace. \u201cI want my family to be safe. And I want the Pack to be solid. Healthy. Having a mate the family approves of goes a long way.\u201d</p><p>For the four-hundredth time, I wished Jeff was a different kind of animal. But he couldn\u2019t change who he was any more than I could change myself, put myself into a different family, or make the Keenes average.</p><p>Jeff was not the point, I reminded myself, and made myself focus on Patrick. I\u2019d made a commitment to see this through, so it deserved my full attention.</p><p>I looked back at Patrick. \u201cWhat about you? Do you want this whole potential thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a connection. I want my family to be happy.\u201d He fidgeted with a gold signet ring on his right hand, which bore a complicate crest. \u201cMy father\u2019s getting older. He\u2019s not well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d Shifters were generally a healthy bunch; transforming into animal form cured most things that ailed our human forms. But animals became ill, too, and there was no easy cure for that.</p><p>\u201cI guess that adds to the pressure to find someone.\u201d</p><p>Patrick laughed mirthlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it. If I hear the word \u2018legacy\u2019 one more time, I\u2019ll probably punch someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with amusement. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I crossed one leg over the other, kicked the top one. It was a habit usually caused by too much caffeine. Today, I could blame old-fashioned nerves.</p><p>\u201cRobin Swift sent a friend of his family.\u201d Robin was Apex of the Western Pack. \u201cTook me to dinner at the most expensive restaurant in Chicago\u2014or so he told me. Six or seven times. And while we\u2019re there, gave me a lecture about respecting legacies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you punched him in the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cNo, I punched him when he told me my only purpose was to bear his children and then stuck a hand up my shirt.\u201d</p><p>Patrick grinned. \u201cYou land the punch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroke his nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>We slowed, and I looked up to see the familiar metal plaque on the side of the road. Tom turned the car into the short drive, which dead-ended at a chain link fence.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Patrick asked.</p><p>\u201cStill a surprise,\u201d I said, climbing out of the car when Tom opened the door. Patrick offered whispered instructions to Tom, then followed me through the open gate. We crunched through snow across the small field, where a vine-covered chimney stood sentinel, the only part of the building still standing.</p><p>Hands in his pockets, Patrick stared up at the chimney. \u201cWhat was this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Jesuit mission, then a church. Once upon a time, at least.\u201d</p><p>He ran fingers over the rough stone, something I\u2019d done a dozen times. \u201cHow\u2019d you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull moon,\u201d I confessed with a smile. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I ran until I couldn\u2019t run anymore. I ended up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history here,\u201d Patrick said, glancing around. \u201cA lot of power.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSometimes I wondered if I found it, or it found me. But this actually isn\u2019t what I wanted to show you. This way.\u201d</p><p>He fell into step behind me, and we walked in silence up the small rise on the other end of the field. By the time we reached the top, I was finally warm.</p><p>\u201cThis is why we\u2019re here,\u201d I said when he stepped beside me, and I heard the sharp intake of breath.</p><p>Chicago lay in front of us like a blanket of light, buildings rising across the horizon like a heartbeat had been charted across the sky.</p><p>Memphis would always be home to me, but I certainly understood the appeal of the Windy City. Architecture, food, politics. It was an important part of the building of America, even if it still bore the scars.</p><p>\u201cThis is an impressive view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I like it. And I like Chicago. It\u2019s not home\u2014not yet\u2014but I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLot of energy,\u201d Patrick said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThere is. You\u2019re from Wisconsin?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe family\u2019s from Wausau, middle of the state. Most of them still live there. I\u2019ve got a cabin on the lake north of Sheboygan. It\u2019s quiet, especially in winter. No tourists. Speaking of tourists, are many people coming in tomorrow for the initiation?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The abrupt change of conversation had me looking back at him, wondering about his motive. But if he was digging for details about Connor or the event, his body didn\u2019t give it away. His gaze was still on the horizon.</p><p>Still, I chose my words carefully. \u201cMostly close friends and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ceremony will be at a church?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSt. Bridget\u2019s.\u201d The location wasn\u2019t a secret, especially since Gabriel had already invited him. \u201cIt\u2019s in Ukrainian Village.\u201d We hadn\u2019t chosen the spot because of the religious affiliation, but because it was in the heart of our favorite neighborhood, and a common location for Pack meetings. We had a connection to it.</p><p>He nodded, but I could tell the answer hadn\u2019t satisfied him.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that he gets the crown? Instead of you, I mean?\u201d</p><p>I guess that\u2019s what had really been on his mind. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cShould it?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands again. \u201cNo offense meant. I just think, if it had been me, I\u2019d be pissed. My chance being taken away. You don\u2019t have to respond to that. And I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I\u2019m genuinely curious.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent for a moment, and when I looked back at him, found him frowning at the skyline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a completely different situation,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life, like yours, has been built around family, but the dynamics are different. You\u2019re part of the Apex\u2019s family. For the rest of us, that\u2019s a big deal. You\u2019re the big deal. So I just wonder if someone else being handed the crown feels like a big deal.\u201d</p><p>It was a big deal. But not the way he meant.</p><p>It was a big deal that Tanya and Gabriel, after several years and more mourning than I\u2019d have wished on anyone, had gotten pregnant. A big deal that Connor had been safely born after a difficult pregnancy. A big deal that I had a healthy and happy nephew.</p><p>\u201cFamily is family,\u201d I simply said. \u201cAnd Pack is Pack.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the SUV pulled up to the house again.</p> <p>Patrick looked at me. \u201cI enjoyed meeting you, Fallon. I\u2019ll be staying at the Hotel Meridian. They\u2019ve got a fantastic bar, and I\u2019d love to invite you for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for that tonight, with the initiation tomorrow. But thank you for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t change your mind?\u201d Without waiting for a response, Patrick moved in, pressed his mouth to mine, made his best argument. His lips were soft, and the hand he lifted to my face undeniably strong. He cupped my jaw as he deepened the kiss.</p><p>Magic, comfortably animal, pulsed across my body, lifting goose bumps on my arms. My magic lifted, rose to meet it, and filled the car with energy when Patrick deepened the kiss.</p><p>Our magic was clearly compatible. But that\u2019s as far as it went. There was no angelic choir. No sudden music. Not a single tingle or twitch of the nonmagical variety.</p><p>The part of me that wanted to keep hanging out with Jeff was thrilled. Another potential met, put away.</p><p>But the part that was obliged to family and Pack felt guilty. Was I not trying hard enough? Sabotaging any chance these guys might have had to win me over?</p><p>Patrick pulled back and looked at me. \u201cI get the sense your heart\u2019s not in this.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have the words to respond, but he was absolutely right. My heart was elsewhere, mostly thinking about a tiger probably pacing the halls of his apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>He smiled. It was such a great smile. It just did absolutely nothing for me.</p><p>\u201cNo hard feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d</p><p>I slid toward the door, and when Tom opened it, stepped outside again.</p><p>\u201cI hope you find him,\u201d Patrick said.</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>The house was quiet and dark. For the first few potentials, the entire family had waited in the parlor for me to come home and report. After ten, they\u2019d stopped waiting up.</p><p>We\u2019d long since passed ten.</p><p>I took off my boots and hung up my coat, then headed upstairs to my second-floor bedroom. The world may have been chaotic, but my bedroom was not. It was simple, clean, and organized\u2014my respite from Pack life. Like my clothes, the room was decorated in shades of black, white, and gray. A white four-poster bed was the focal point, near a bureau I\u2019d painted a black and white chevron pattern.</p><p>I pulled open the top drawer of the bureau and perused the contents. T-shirts and pajama bottoms for winter, skimpier nighties for hot nights or special occasions. Unfortunately, they still bore the tags.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d I grumbled, pushing them aside and pulling out a heather-gray T-shirt, the lingering scent of Jeff\u2019s cologne filling the room. The shirt was one of his, with a chartreuse \u201cJakob\u2019s Quest\u201d logo across the front. He\u2019d let me borrow it after I\u2019d been soaked in a downpour, and I\u2019d forgotten to give it back.</p><p>Or I\u2019d decided not to.</p><p>I tugged it over my head, pausing while I was cocooned in cotton and Jeff, savoring the scent of him, wondering what it would be like if he\u2019d been there with me.</p><p>I\u2019d imagined the scene a thousand times before: turning off the light, lying down on cool sheets, his body beside mine, arms ready to wrap around me.</p><p>But that was just a fantasy. Tonight, again, the bed was empty\u2014Jeff replaced, as always, by the cold weight of tradition.</p><p>I dreamed I straddled the crux of the farmhouse roof, one leg on each side, a hammer in hand. The shingles, gray with age, were falling away from the roof like scales, floating to the ground like feathers. I used the hammer to beat them back down, but the work was useless. They lifted and rose away, leaving the bones of the house bare beneath them.</p><p>\u201cFallon!\u201d</p><p>My eyes opened. I wasn\u2019t on the roof. I was in my own room, sprawled on my stomach, an arm and leg hanging over the side of the bed. There was no hammer, but someone was pounding fiercely on the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I said, flipping off the sheet and sitting up, squeezing my eyes shut until my head stopped spinning. I\u2019d slept like the dead, and my head throbbed like I was hung over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I said when the beatings continued, and stumbled to the door.</p><p>I yanked it open and found Gabriel in the doorway, a haggard expression on his face. There were shadows beneath his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, like, six in the morning,\u201d I said, squinting in the sunlight. We didn\u2019t sleep much, although we tended to sleep those hours in the early light of day. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ass downstairs. The coronet is gone.\u201d</p><p>I pulled on enough clothing to turn the T-shirt into loungewear and headed downstairs in sweatpants and bare feet.</p><p>Adrenaline pumped, making my blood run and brain race. But I was still groggy, and the sensations mixing together made me feel like a college freshman after an all-nighter.</p><p>Christopher, Derek, and Ben were already in the living room, once again around the open box.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Eli?\u201d I asked, as I joined the circle.</p><p>\u201cKitchen,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>I peered inside in the box. It was empty. Even the purple cushion was gone.</p><p>Fear warred with exhaustion and irritation. \u201cI thought we were putting the crown in the safe,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe did. The box was down there,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cEmpty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least there weren\u2019t spiders in their place,\u201d Ben lightly said.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s slanted look actually seemed to chill the air in the room. \u201cThe safe was open. Someone managed to pick the lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho figured out it was gone? And why the hell were they in the basement at six o\u2019clock in the damn morning?\u201d I was not a morning person. And I was real damn grouchy before coffee.</p><p>\u201cNobody figured it out.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the doorway. Jeff stood there, hair tousled, a leather jacket over a T-shirt and jeans. He looked pissed, and magic spilled across the room like a horde of angry insects. He walked toward us, but didn\u2019t even spare me a glance.</p><p>I assumed he was mad because I\u2019d ditched him the night before. But I\u2019d done what I had to do, and I\u2019d explained that to him. He knew the deal. I didn\u2019t have time for a tantrum, especially not right now. We were in crisis mode.</p><p>Ben glanced between us, settled his gaze on me, the question in his eyes obvious. But I shook my head. The coronet was missing. Our focus was on the Pack.</p><p>Always on the Pack.</p><p>\u201cThe alarm on the safe went off. It\u2019s set to send me a message,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>Ben frowned. \u201cWhy did it alert you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had him install the security system,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a message the doors or windows were breached,\u201d Jeff said, glancing at him. \u201cI take it the alarms weren\u2019t turned on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re way the hell out here,\u201d Gabriel muttered. \u201cSince when do we need to live in a security state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the Apex of the Pack and you moved the crown up here,\u201d Jeff countered. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s magic spiked. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the importance of the goddamned crown. I don\u2019t need the reminder.\u201d</p><p>Wisely, Jeff bit back a response.</p><p>Eli walked into the room, two steaming cups of coffee in hand. I held out hope one of them was for me, and thanked my lucky stars when he handed it over.</p><p>The first sip was hot, full-bodied, intoxicating. I gave him an appreciative nod. Eli and I were closest in age, and we\u2019d spent more time together than probably anyone else in the family. He knew about my coffee obsession, and enabled it. Which made me love him more.</p><p>\u201cWhen was it taken?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Jeff checked his phone. \u201cForty-two minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Christopher rubbed his face. \u201cFive-thirty in the damn morning? Who wakes up to steal a crown at five-thirty in the damn morning?\u201d</p><p>Ben made a sarcastic sound. \u201cSomeone who wants a crown and doesn\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspect list?\u201d Eli asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone from Louisiana to Minnesota who wants the damn thing?\u201d Christopher suggested.</p><p>\u201cOnly one of those people was here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>We all looked back at Jeff, who stared back at me. Angry. Betrayed. I guess he\u2019d taken it personally after all.</p> <p>My stomach curled from the hurt in his eyes.</p><p>I tore my gaze away and looked at Gabriel. \u201cHe means Patrick.\u201d</p><p>Is that why Patrick had come here? Not to meet me, but to get closer to the crown? He wouldn\u2019t have been the first potential mate with an agenda.</p><p>\u201cHe was here to meet Fallon,\u201d Ben offered, stepping closer to me as if that could protect me from the pain.</p><p>Jeff looked at Gabriel. \u201cHe was here because he wants to get closer to the crown. And there are two ways to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Get the crown\u2014or get the girl?</p><p>Gabriel turned back to him, arms crossed and angry magic radiating from his body. \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to get off your mind, whelp?\u201d</p><p>Magic rose between them, furious and hot, spinning around the room like a dervish. Both of them angry, both of them worried. Neither of them about to admit it aloud.</p><p>The last thing we needed was an intra-Pack dispute. We had bigger things to worry about.</p><p>Eli stepped between them, beating me to it. \u201cLet\u2019s all take a breath. The Yorks are good people, quality people. Patrick didn\u2019t even want to look at the crown yesterday. He seemed plenty sincere about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he knows how to act,\u201d Christopher said. He looked at me. \u201cYou were with him. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>All eyes turned to me, including two blue ones that didn\u2019t look especially pleased about it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I pushed my hair behind my ears and caught Jeff\u2019s glance at the T-shirt I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d been wearing.</p><p>I felt his rush of magic\u2014possessive and pleased. He didn\u2019t comment; but he didn\u2019t need to. I\u2019d slept in his shirt. Didn\u2019t that say enough?</p><p>But this was not the time, so I pushed it back. \u201cHe seemed less interested in the crown than my feelings about it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d</p><p>Jeff pulled a tablet from his pocket, began typing on the screen. He always had a gadget in hand, and this small and sleek rectangle was his new baby. \u201cI\u2019m going to check the camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a camera?\u201d Eli asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my standard security package,\u201d Jeff said, eyes on the tablet.</p><p>We stood silently while he played with the camera interface. \u201cHere we go,\u201d Jeff said after a moment, and we circled around him.</p> <p>The image on the tablet was distorted by the fish-eye lens, which had been mounted above the door, but there was no mistaking the man on the screen: Patrick York walked to the front door and slipped inside. Twelve minutes later, he walked out again.</p><p>I felt sick. Nauseated at the betrayal, humiliated at the ruse. I wiped a hand across my lips, as if I could wipe away the kiss he\u2019d offered. He\u2019d kissed me, and then snuck back into our house and stolen the Pack\u2019s most precious item.</p><p>But it had all happened so quickly. I grabbed what remained of my pride, held tight. \u201cSurely he couldn\u2019t have gotten to the safe, unlocked it, and gotten out in twelve minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have if he\u2019s trained,\u201d Christopher said, shrugging when we looked at him. \u201cWhat? So I know how to work a lock.\u201d</p><p>Ben slanted his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t actually tell if he\u2019s taking anything with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would he be taking?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe had no reason to be back in the house. No reason other than the crown.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, I walked to the window and lifted the sash. The breeze was frigid, but a relief as hot tears of embarrassment slipped down my cheeks.</p><p>I wiped them away as sneakily as I could. God forbid any of them should see me cry.</p><p>\u201cI can call Catcher,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cOr Merit. Or the Chicago Police Department. But I\u2019m guessing you want to keep this in-house.\u201d Merit was Chuck Merit\u2019s granddaughter, a vampire of Chicago\u2019s Cadogan House. Much like her grandfather, she spent a lot of time solving supernatural problems.</p><p>\u201cIn-house,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the attention.\u201d His tone dropped, deepened, and was rough by worry. \u201cIs there a chance he knows how to use the crown?\u201d</p><p>Silently, Eli glanced at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cJeff knows,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Eli said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how he would. The information would be hard to come by, and Yorks have been out of the loop for a very long time. I doubt they\u2019re even friendly with anybody who knows. Did he mention anything to you, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>When I was sure my face was dry, I turned back, looked at my brothers. \u201cNo. Not a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>I knew he meant the theft, but I still felt responsible. All of this trouble, the drama, because of tradition. Danger to the Pack, Jeff pissed, my brothers worried. Our role in the Pack at risk. All of that because tradition had put a thief right under our nose. And because a man we\u2019d trusted with that tradition had betrayed us all.</p><p>Humiliation began to give way to anger. And there was only one healthy way to deal with anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I said, moving back to the group. \u201cI\u2019ll find him, I\u2019ll kick his ass, and I\u2019ll bring back the coronet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Ben said, but Gabe shook his head.</p><p>\u201cPeople will wonder why we\u2019re sending half the family on a crusade hours before the initiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with her.\u201d We all looked at Jeff. \u201cThey won\u2019t suspect us going together.\u201d</p><p>Because we were always together. And that said volumes.</p><p>Gabriel looked between us, considered. \u201cDo it. I\u2019ll call Richard in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Eli asked. \u201cIf he\u2019s in on it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick said his father was sick. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s up for plotting to take over the Pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe this is his last effort to become Apex,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling him,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cIf he\u2019s involved, there\u2019s no point in denying it now. If he has the crown because he wants the Pack, I doubt he\u2019ll hold that in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick\u2019s staying at the Hotel Meridian,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first place to go.\u201d</p><p>Gabe checked the grandfather clocked that ticked in one corner of the room. \u201cThe initiation\u2019s at six o\u2019clock. Find the coronet, bring it home. Or we hand the Pack over to someone else.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>I dressed and met Jeff downstairs, where he waited by the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d I said, and he didn\u2019t argue. My car was small\u2014a coupe that could be easily parked in Chicago, but had enough horsepower to zip around traffic. Or mow down a potential with a traitorous agenda. Not that I had violence on my mind.</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t respond or say anything else until we were in the car and ten minutes into the drive. And then he surprised me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI was an ass. You don\u2019t deserve that. Not when you\u2019re trying to do the right thing by your family. It\u2019s just . . . you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for me.\u201d</p><p>I goggled. I knew exactly what it was like\u2014because I was the one living under the weight of it. \u201cI know exactly what it\u2019s like for you. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me. Don\u2019t pull away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pull away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do pull away. You hide behind your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cYou do, Fal.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, feeling suddenly tired. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, not children. Sometimes adults don\u2019t get what they want. Even if it hurts,\u201d I added after a moment.</p><p>His voice was quiet. Hopeful. \u201cAnd what is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>I knew what he wanted me to say. What he needed me to say. But I couldn\u2019t. Because if I admitted it to him, to myself, that I wanted him, that I cared for him and needed him, then I\u2019d be admitting that everything else had been a lie. That every date with every potential had been a farce, that I wasn\u2019t really trying to find a match for the good of the Pack.</p><p>So I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Jeff made a low growl and ran his hands through his hair. \u201cI swear to god, Fallon. Sometimes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed hugely. \u201cSometimes life is not fair.\u201d He was quiet for a moment, then looked over and smiled at me. \u201cWill I get in trouble if I ask how the date went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much trouble,\u201d I said, but couldn\u2019t help smiling back. And when I did, the world seemed to right itself again. \u201cIt was dull until, you know, he broke into my house and stole my family\u2019s birthright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you probably won\u2019t be going out with him again. Which means I have a chance.\u201d</p><p>The hotel was located in Gold Coast, a swanky neighborhood just north of the bustling Loop. The building that housed it matched the area\u2019s ivy-covered townhouses, but the lobby was modern and sleek, decorated in shades of white and cream. The attendants at the front desk, both men with slicked back hair, wore buttoned shirts with rolled sleeves, suspenders, and bow ties. It was either very hip or very pretentious; I wasn\u2019t entirely sure which.</p><p>We walked to the counter. The attendant\u2014Cash, according to his name tag\u2014smiled at us.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Hotel Meridian. Are you checking in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a guest, actually. Patrick York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d He glanced down at his screen, typed a few characters on a slide-out keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. York has already checked out. Just a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a curse.</p><p>Cash looked up, apologetic. \u201cIs there anything else I can help you with?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeff and I looked at each other, and I opted for frankness. \u201cWe believe Mr. York may have inadvertently taken something that belonged to my family.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSince he\u2019s gone, would it be possible for us to take a look at his room? I know it\u2019s an inconvenience, but it would make my family feel a lot better.\u201d</p> <p>He grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly policy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guest has checked out,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cSo there\u2019s no breach of the policy. We just want to see if perhaps there\u2019s anything he might have left behind.\u201d</p><p>Jeff put his hand on the counter, a folded hundred-dollar bill tucked subtly between his fingers. \u201cWe\u2019d appreciate it very much.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s eyes stayed flat, but he took the money and handed us a keycard. \u201cSixteen twenty-eight,\u201d he said, gesturing with a bladed hand toward the elevators. \u201cHelp yourselves.\u201d</p><p>The elevator was empty, and it moved slowly and steadily up the side of the building, adding or subtracting a guest here or there. When we reached the sixteenth floor, we followed the arrows to the right, checking the room numbers until we reached 1628.</p> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, holding out my hand for the key card. Jeff handed it over, and I unlocked the door and pushed it open.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jeff said, stepping inside behind me. \u201cI think the Yorks have money.\u201d</p><p>If the suite was any indication, he was right. A central hallway led to a bathroom, a bedroom, and a sitting area with a view of the lake. The furniture was high-end, the linens fancy. Silk curtains in wide vertical stripes were tied back at the windows. The room hadn\u2019t yet been cleaned, which gave us better odds of finding some hint of what he\u2019d been up to.</p><p>\u201cProbably so. He had a driver yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bedroom. You look in here.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the small desk, opened the drawer, and rifled through complimentary stationary and Chicago-centric magazines. I found another guest\u2019s discarded receipt for the observation deck at the Hancock Tower, dated more than a month ago, and a cellophane-wrapped peppermint.</p> <p>Nothing had been lost between the couch cushions, nothing stuffed into the pillows. I found only dust bunnies under the couch, and the wastebasket was empty.</p><p>The sitting room checked, I walked to the door of the bedroom.</p><p>Jeff had pulled the sheets, pillow, and duvet from the bed and was methodically checking them.</p><p>\u201cNightstands?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, without looking up.</p><p>I walked to the far side of the bed, pulled open the drawer. The usual Bible was there, and a small notepad. Nothing else. Ditto the nightstand on the other side.</p><p>When I\u2019d checked both, I stood up, put my hands on my hips, and surveyed the room. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d expected to find; it wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d have forgotten to take the crown with him, or left crown crumbs in a Hansel and Gretel\u2013style trail.</p><p>\u201cFallon.\u201d</p> <p>I looked up. Jeff stood on the other side of the bed, motioned me to approach. The bed had four short posters. And in the corner of the poster at the foot of the bed, on the side closest to the door, was a scrap of dark fabric.</p><p>It was wedged tightly, caught on the end of a bedspring that had poked through the cover. I carefully lifted it, held it up.</p><p>It was purple velvet, the same fabric used on the cushion that protected the crown.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cI was hoping it was a coincidence. That really sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt really, really sucks.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the flickers of humiliation, sat down on the bed, pulled out my phone, and sent a picture of the fabric to Gabe and a status report. While we waited for a response, I tucked the fabric in my pocket, evidence of the crime.</p><p>Jeff sat down beside me. \u201cI can kick his ass if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>I smiled mirthlessly. \u201cI\u2019d like. But I still think it\u2019s weird. I mean, I know don\u2019t know him very well, but I wouldn\u2019t have suspected this. Breaking into the house? Stealing the crown?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cHe was so mild mannered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your date didn\u2019t go well, maybe he thought it was his only other option. Did he say anything that suggested he had a plan?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe asked about the initiation. Wondered if it bothered me that Connor gets the crown instead of me.\u201d</p><p>Jeff snorted. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t kick his ass for that. Or maybe you just gave him your \u2018most displeased\u2019 look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy \u2018most displeased\u2019 look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know.\u201d He adjusted to face me, dipped his chin, and gave me a good stiff stare.</p><p>\u201cI do not do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do,\u201d he assured. \u201cYou\u2019re very opinionated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opinionated. I\u2019m just right. Frequently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd most displeased when you\u2019re wrong. Especially if I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>A headache was beginning to throb behind my eyes, and his word games weren\u2019t helping. I closed my eyes and rubbed my temples. \u201cWhat a crappy day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyally,\u201d Jeff said, snickering at the pun. \u201cBut I can make it better.\u201d</p><p>I nearly laughed at the bravado in his voice, but Jeff moved too quickly. Before I could protest, his lips met mine, cutting off argument. He leaned forward, his mouth insistent, a hand against my cheek. He kissed me hungrily, greedily, like a man long denied.</p><p>I let him kiss me. I let him seduce me with bites and kisses, and the hand that caressed my cheek. And then I kissed him back, my fingers stealing into his hair, pulling him toward me.</p><p>His magic rushed forward. Where Patrick\u2019s magic had mingled with mine, Jeff\u2019s danced, teased, and enticed. It rose to envelope both of us, hinting at the fire we could so easily start . . .</p><p>Until I remembered where we were, and what we were doing there.</p><p>The spark banked.</p><p>I stood up, knees shaking, and moved away from him, my heart beating against my chest like a timpani drum. \u201cJeff, we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Jeff said, rubbing his hands over his face in obvious frustration. \u201cBut you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, grief in his eyes. \u201cNone of this is fair, Fallon. For either of us.\u201d</p><p>My phone rang.</p><p>We stared at each other until the third ring, when I forced myself to check the screen. It was Gabriel. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Richard. He knows nothing about the crown or the initiation. I think he was being honest. But he admitted he\u2019s been concerned about Patrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting you on speakerphone,\u201d I warned. \u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s concerned about Patrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure. I\u2019m also not sure how clearly he sees things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the illness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t have the strength he used to. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s got the memory, either. He knows he\u2019s fading, and he\u2019s worried how Patrick will handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right and he took the crown, he\u2019s not handling it well,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cWe need to figure out where he\u2019ll go next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard said he was coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, thinking of our conversation. \u201cHe\u2019s got two\u2014family place in Wausau, and a cabin near Sheboygan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re closer to Sheboygan,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cYou go there. I\u2019ll send Damien to Wausau.\u201d</p><p>Damien Garza was one of Gabriel\u2019s go-to Pack members, a quiet man with a penchant for solving messy Pack problems.</p><p>I looked at Jeff, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>Patrick hadn\u2019t given me his address, but I had Jeff for that. In addition to his gaming skills, he was a master of the Web. He could find a needle in a binary haystack and did, in this case, offering up Patrick\u2019s address and prepping the GPS.</p><p>Jeff and I didn\u2019t speak a word about the kiss, and didn\u2019t say much of anything for the drive north. But the tension in the air was unmistakable. I knew we were going to have to talk about it sooner or later, but not right now. Business first.</p><p>The cabin was part of a woodsy neighborhood beside the lake, a cluster of houses and cabins probably used by Chicagoans to escape the city in the summer. But this was winter and the lake was frozen; most of the houses looked empty, the snow still in drifts around their doors.</p><p>Patrick York\u2019s house, a log cabin A-frame, was easy to spot\u2014the drive was shoveled, and smoke rose from the chimney.</p><p>We parked a hundred feet down the road, got out of the car, and looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s got the crown, he\u2019ll want to keep it. We should be prepared for a fight.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cYou bring a weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the weapon.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a cutting look.</p><p>\u201cBlades,\u201d I said. \u201cJust in case, I have my blades.\u201d I had two daggers, engraved and gorgeous, tucked inside my boots. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d He zipped up his leather jacket, nodded, and we trekked back to the cabin in the woods. As we walked, snow began to fall, large and beautiful flakes that quickly covered the ground in a fluffy white quilt.</p><p>We reached the end of the driveway and paused at the mailbox.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a backdoor,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cEither he\u2019s going through a window, or he\u2019s coming with us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and turned to walk toward the door, but Jeff grabbed my hand before I could move. A bolt of lust and magic speared through me, followed immediately by a wave of regret.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he whispered, releasing my hand and falling into step beside me.</p><p>Patrick York opened the door in a T-shirt and jeans, a white kitchen towel in hand. The smell of breakfast\u2014bacon, eggs, cheese\u2014wafted through the room.</p><p>It took my brain a moment to catch up. What kind of thief started cooking after stealing a crown? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Patrick beamed at me, surprise in his eyes that faded to suspicion when he caught sight of Jeff.</p><p>\u201cFallon. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick, this is Jeff Christopher. He\u2019s a member of the NAC and a friend of the family\u2019s. Can we come in? We need to talk. It\u2019s Pack business.\u201d</p> <p>He looked confused, and rubbed his hands on his towel before moving aside to let us in. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We stepped inside, and Jeff closed the door behind us. The interior of the cabin was pretty, the hewn-wood walls exposed, the furniture made of logs and covered in plaid fabrics. Fishing equipment hung on the walls beside antique posters advertising vacations on the Great Lakes.</p><p>Patrick put the towel on a table and crossed his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to be subtle, so I\u2019m going to get to it. The crown is missing. The evidence suggests you took it.\u201d</p><p>The weight of the accusation seemed to actually push him, and he took a step backward, his gaze switching between me and Jeff. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014you think I stole the crown? The Pack\u2019s crown?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Jeff asked, with hostility he hadn\u2019t bothered to mask.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI told you I had no interest in the crown. And I sure as shit wouldn\u2019t steal something that didn\u2019t belong to me. Is this because we talked about the initiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we have video of you coming back to the house. Breaking in, and then leaving again.\u201d</p><p>Patrick closed his eyes and was quiet for a very long moment. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI knew that was going to cause trouble. Knew it, and ignored my instincts.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward a set of coats and jackets that hung on the opposite wall, and at my nod, walked to the black jacket he\u2019d worn last night. He reached into the pocket, and pulled out a pair of leather gloves.</p><p>The same leather gloves he\u2019d taken off when he\u2019d first arrived at the house.</p> <p>\u201cI must have dropped one, and didn\u2019t realize it until we\u2019d nearly gotten into the city. They were my father\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t just want to leave it there.\u201d He looked at me apologetically. \u201cI just thought it would be easier if I didn\u2019t wake anyone.\u201d</p><p>So he didn\u2019t have to see me again, he meant.</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t care about the reason; he wasn\u2019t buying the excuse. \u201cSo you maintain you came back to the house and broke in to retrieve a leather glove.\u201d</p><p>Patrick glared at Jeff. \u201cI don\u2019t maintain it. That\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our video, you\u2019re the only one who came into the house or left,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have cameras on every door and window?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jeff, who shook his head. \u201cJust the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. I may have been the only one in and out of the front door, but clearly someone else came in and out of the house. Look, I\u2019m sorry the crown\u2019s missing. I\u2019m sure that creates a political shit-storm for your family. But you\u2019ve got the wrong guy.\u201d He gestured to the room. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m getting ready to take over the Pack? Does this look like I\u2019m getting ready for a coup d\u2019etat? I\u2019ve got food in the oven, for god\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d I pulled the scrap of velvet from my pocket, held it in my outstretched palm.</p><p>He leaned forward to look at it. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the cushion that held the crown,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that\u2019s got to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in your hotel room at the Meridian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hotel\u201d\u2014he began, then trailed off. A flush darkened his cheeks. \u201cAh. This is . . . awkward.\u201d He cleared his throat, looked at me apologetically. \u201cWhen I got back to the hotel, I had a drink at the bar. I met someone. I didn\u2019t plan on meeting someone, but it happened.\u201d He paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t go back to my room, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I was going to start referring to the last twenty-four hours as the Night of a Thousand Humiliations.</p><p>Jeff, however, wasn\u2019t humiliated. He was pissed. \u201cYou reject Fallon Keene and then go off with some bar skank?\u201d</p><p>We both turned to stare at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cJeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s a York or Keene or Old McDonald. He needs to learn some damned chivalry.\u201d</p><p>Patrick had at least eighty pounds on Jeff, but that didn\u2019t stop Jeff from taking a menacing step forward.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Patrick said, lifting his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong idea. Fallon\u2019s the one who wasn\u2019t interested, not me.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s brows perked up. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, idiots, we have a missing crown,\u201d I reminded them, ignoring the sudden grin on Jeff\u2019s face. \u201cCan we get back to that?\u201d</p><p>Patrick looked at me. \u201cThe point is, I wasn\u2019t in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was booked under your name,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cThey knew you\u2019d checked in and out. If you didn\u2019t stay there, who did?\u201d</p><p>Emotions cycled across Patrick\u2019s face, from denial to confusion to anger. \u201cTom,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI gave the room to Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Tom?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cThe driver,\u201d I said, as the weight of truth settled around us.</p><p>Patrick shook his head. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that to the family. Put us in that kind of position. Create that kind of danger for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t doing it to the family,\u201d Jeff quietly said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s doing it for the family. To get the Yorks into power.\u201d</p><p>Patrick shook his head. \u201cMy father\u2019s sick. He doesn\u2019t have the energy, and he\u2019s not interested in the crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to be interested,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe Tom is interested enough for the both of you.\u201d</p><p>Patrick wanted to deny it; that was clear in his face. But he worked it out, considered, and ultimately nodded.</p><p>\u201cI told him he didn\u2019t need to go to the city with me. But he offered, wanted to come. It was a big deal, he said, for me to have an opportunity to meet Fallon Keene. I guess it was an opportunity for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went into town for supplies.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, a car door closed outside.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want to handle it?\u201d Patrick asked.</p><p>\u201cGet him into the house. We\u2019ll have an easier time handling him in here than if he\u2019s tramping around Wisconsin.\u201d</p><p>Patrick nodded. I slipped into the kitchen, and Jeff stayed in the living room, backing into a corner on the far side to block any effort for Tom to slip outside again.</p><p>The door opened and Tom stepped inside, a bag of groceries in hand, fresh snow on his cap and shoulders. \u201cGot the goods, boss.\u201d</p><p>He looked up like prey scenting predator, probably recognizing the foreign magic that permeated the cabin.</p><p>Patrick stepped into the room. Jeff moved to the front door, blocking it with his body.</p><p>Tom took one look at the room, and his eyes went cold.</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThey\u2019re here to talk to you. They say you have the crown.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes flattened. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into the room. \u201cLet\u2019s not make this more complicated than it should be.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me dismissively, then turned his gaze to Patrick again. \u201cThat crown should be yours. You deserve it. Should have it. Your family\u2019s older. Worked harder. Got more to show for it.\u201d</p><p>Patrick looked completely bewildered. I didn\u2019t think anyone could fake that kind of surprise, so I scratched him off as a potential accomplice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about treason,\u201d Patrick said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about what\u2019s right,\u201d Tom insisted, jabbing his index finger into the air like it punctuated his words. \u201cYou know who should be ruling the Pack? You. Not Gabriel fucking Keene.\u201d</p><p>I moved closer to him. \u201cWhere is it, Tom? Where did you put the crown?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, lip curled. \u201cWhat, Gabriel can\u2019t fight his own battles? Has to send his little whore to do it?\u201d</p><p>Light and magic burst through the room.</p><p>Jeff shifted, a tiger emerging from the cloud of magic where a man had stood, twelve feet of white and black fur and muscle. He opened his mouth and roared, ivory teeth bared, the sound vibrating the glass in the windows.</p><p>I took another step forward. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Tom. That\u2019s Jeff Christopher, one of Gabriel\u2019s favorite shifters. He\u2019s a good friend, and he doesn\u2019t really care for insults. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s eaten in a few hours.\u201d I glanced at Jeff. \u201cHungry much?\u201d</p><p>He growled ominously.</p><p>Tom glanced between us, then grabbed the nearest piece of furniture\u2014a tall shelf\u2014and pushed it over toward us. Glass and wood and knick-knacks hit the floor with a crack, as Patrick and I jumped back to avoid the fall.</p><p>Tom bolted, running back out the door and down the driveway. Another flash of light and he shifted into a lean, black wolf, then took off into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I told Jeff, who burst through the door after him.</p><p>I glanced back at Patrick. \u201cStay here in case he comes back. And call Gabriel\u2014tell him what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Patrick nodded and pulled out his phone, glancing carefully away when I yanked off my clothes and threw them into a pile. The magic of shifting, unfortunately, didn\u2019t do much for clothing. You wanted to keep it, you took it off first.</p><p>Naked in the doorway, snow biting at my skin, I jumped . . . and let the magic cover me. By the time I hit the ground, I was in my animal form. A gray wolf, eyes the same amber as my own. My mind stayed human, but my senses were animal. The world opened into smells and sounds that I couldn\u2019t have detected in my human form, including the trail of scent and magic that now led into the woods in front of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dashed forward, snow crunching beneath my paws, and moved into the woods. There was no path but the one they\u2019d cut through the snowy underbrush, limbs snapped and bent from the force of their bodies. I pushed for speed, ears straining for the sound of them . . . and heard nothing until a feline roar</p><p>Jeff, I thought with panic, paws pounding faster and faster across snow, my heart tripping like snare drum. A few feet more and I found them on the ground in a tangle, white and black fur against the newly fallen snow. Blood spattered the ground beneath them as they rolled. Jeff was considerably larger, but Tom was smaller, more agile.</p><p>They rolled, Tom biting at Jeff\u2019s back haunch until Jeff shook him off. Tom bounced and rolled, while Jeff bared his teeth and screamed his frustration into the night.</p> <p>My turn, I thought. Head down, I paced forward, teeth bared. Tom rose, shook off the fall, and showed his teeth again, daring me to attack. His muzzle was bloodied, which only infuriated me more.</p><p>I jumped, landing on his back, clawing and biting to make him submit. He rolled, pressing me back into snow until he yipped again and jumped away, a hank of Tom\u2019s fur and skin hanging from Jeff\u2019s muzzle. You played with the big cats, you were bound to get hurt.</p><p>I rolled and rose as Jeff leapt for Tom again, sinking claws into the back of Tom\u2019s neck and tossing him forward like a stuffed animal. But Tom still didn\u2019t stop. He climbed stiffly to his feet again, eyes narrowed and lips curled back in a chilling imitation of a smile. Facing me, he padded forward, one slow step at a time, violent intent in his eyes.</p><p>He bounded forward, and I braced myself for the impact. But the weight came from a different direction. Jeff had rushed forward, pushing me out of the way, so their bodies, so large and powerful, met with a thunderclap of sound, front legs in the air, scraping at fur and flesh.</p><p>They scuffled, several hundred pounds of battling animals, and hit the ground with the impact of an earthquake, pitching across the ground with the force of a tank. I tried to scramble out of their way, but wasn\u2019t fast enough. Tom bucked and I caught the force of his back feet, which spun me backward.</p> <p>I hit a tree, head slamming into the bark, and the entire world flipped upside down. My vision tripled, and sound became a raging tide.</p><p>Minutes passed while I lay in the snow, only dimly aware of shuffling, running, roaring. And then, finally, soft nudges against my haunch.</p><p>I lifted my head. Jeff rubbed his massive head against me like a house cat. He looked up at me with the face of a tiger, but the concern in his eyes was very Jeff Christopher.</p><p>He made a grumbly sound, nudged my hip again. I rolled and tried to climb to my feet. It took two attempts before I managed to stand, all four paws on the ground.</p><p>The woods were quiet and still, snow still falling in large, heavy flakes. Tom was gone. Jeff had let him go in order to ensure sure I was alright.</p><p>He nudged me again, more gently, a hacker in the body of a big cat who\u2019d come to my rescue, who stood no insult where I was concerned, who wanted me despite everything else.</p> <p>When the sound in my head quieted to a dull roar, we padded back through the forest.</p><p>We merged again on the main road, the air white with snow. The black SUV Tom had driven was gone, any tracks covered by snowfall.</p><p>We returned to the house and changed back into human forms and clothing.</p><p>Patrick sat on the plaid couch, hands clasped in front of him. He stared at the floor, shock still clear on his face.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Gabriel,\u201d he said, looking up when we walked back into the room. \u201cHe said he\u2019d talked to my father. He\u2019s going to send Damien to check on him.\u201d He looked up at me, fear in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want my father hurt.\u201d</p><p>Damien Garza had a reputation for ruthlessness. \u201cHe won\u2019t be, if there\u2019s no reason for it. But if this is treason . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t need to finish the statement. All shifters knew the cost of treason. Some families, like mine, better than others.</p><p>I sat down on the couch across from him, and Jeff followed. \u201cTom said he wanted the crown for your father. Do you think your father would have sent him here? Condoned what he\u2019d done? Helped plan it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way. He doesn\u2019t care about politics, and even if he did, he respects Gabriel. If he\u2019d had something to say, he wouldn\u2019t say it like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis illness?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>Patrick glanced at him. \u201cHis health is deteriorating. But not his mind. And not his sense of loyalty.\u201d</p><p>And I appreciated Patrick\u2019s loyalty to his family, but we\u2019d need more than words and assurances.</p><p>Holding the crown meant holding the power to control the Pack. The risk was too high to trust a hunch. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what Damien has to say.\u201d I glanced around the house. \u201cYou checked here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh and low,\u201d Patrick said, \u201cwhile you were out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been in the vehicle,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>Patrick nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t even hear him leave. The snow, I guess. Where do you think he\u2019ll go next?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jeff, who nodded back at me. We were both thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cHe wants your family in charge of the Pack, not mine. And we\u2019re about to welcome the Apex-in-waiting into the Pack. If I was him,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d hit the initiation.\u201d</p><p>Time ticked down. We returned to the house and found the family in the front parlor already dressed for the ceremony, which was less than two hours away.</p><p>\u201cDamien\u2019s got an eye on the house in Wausau,\u201d Gabe said, rolling his shoulders uncomfortably in a black suit jacket that barely contained his muscular bulk. \u201cRichard\u2019s there, and the rest of the family. They were shocked and appalled by what Tom\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they suspect anything?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot according to Richard. Tom\u2019s always been loyal, but never crazy. Damien believed them.\u201d</p><p>And we had no other idea where Tom might be. \u201cDamn it,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Gabriel looked at me with swirling amber eyes. \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to say, Fallon?\u201d</p><p>I caught Jeff\u2019s gaze and found sympathy there. Somehow it made me feel worse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still got the crown, and that\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is his treason your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to bring him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you steal the crown? Hand it to him? Step aside in the battle because you were afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cOkay, then. You fought a battle, and you lost it. It happens. We\u2019re shifters; not superheroes. The point is stepping up after the loss, preparing for the next one. Berating yourself because you didn\u2019t win is a waste of time and energy. He\u2019s gone underground. But he\u2019ll show tonight.\u201d</p><p>I intended to ensure that was true. \u201cWe can walk the perimeter,\u201d I suggested. \u201cScout the church for weak spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll need extra guards in the sanctuary,\u201d Eli said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think that\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>We all looked at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cYou think guards are a bad idea?\u201d Gabe asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they might scare him off. Look, he\u2019s got the crown. He\u2019ll be planning to make a stand\u2014otherwise, what\u2019s the point of going to all that trouble? And, yeah, the ceremony makes obvious sense.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cWe know when and where he\u2019ll try to use the crown to claim control of the Pack. That gives us home field advantage. Let him come. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at him, eyes glowing like sunlit amber. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>5</p><p>St. Bridget\u2019s was gorgeous, a church of fairy tale proportions and fantastical architecture. The building, also located in Ukrainian Village, was constructed of pink-peach stone with turquoise turrets, and the interior was just as colorful, with lots of wood, marble, and inset stone.</p><p>Right now, it was the site of vampire-worthy scheming. We\u2019d guessed Tom would take a stand. Instead of trying to keep him out, we\u2019d let him come in, crown in hand. And then we\u2019d take him out.</p><p>At Jeff\u2019s suggestion, a small corps of trustworthy shifters took positions outside in the dark, hidden from view but keeping an eye on the church and its access points. If\u2014or when\u2014Tom tried anything, we\u2019d have eyes on him.</p><p>The interior of the church would have the same setup. A few friends of the family, all shifters, sat in the pews as if preparing to witness Connor\u2019s initiation. But they were armed and prewarned\u2014and they were as excited as shifters could be about the possibility of a good, solid brawl.</p><p>Jeff and I, both dressed in respectful black, stood on the church\u2019s front steps, peering into the darkness. The snow still fell, powdering the neighborhood in white.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nervous,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day I use my family as bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can handle themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it was your good plan.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and we stood in silence, so much unspoken between us.</p><p>\u201cWe should go inside,\u201d Jeff said. I turned to walk into the church, but he took my hand and pulled me against his body. Before I could object, his lips were on mine, mouth insistent.</p><p>He kissed me there on the steps of the church, with snow falling like tears around us. When he pulled away a moment later, my breath was short.</p><p>\u201cJeff,\u201d I said, but he shook his head, leaned his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I breathe, I breathe for you. Every time I speak, I speak for you. And every time I howl, I howl for you.\u201d He pressed his lips to mine, so softly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said, and walked inside.</p><p>My hands and knees shaking, I followed him.</p><p>Gabriel stood in the back of the church with Eli. The rest of my brothers had taken their seats, dressed in suits as if we\u2019d planned to proceed as normal. But Tanya and Connor were secure in an anteroom with Berna and a few of her minions. She didn\u2019t look like much of a threat\u2014squat figure, bleached hair\u2014but she was, as Gabriel liked to say, a wolverine when it came to her family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny sign?\u201d Gabriel asked us.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cBut I have to think he\u2019ll be along soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be along,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cIf he\u2019s brassy enough to walk away with the crown, he\u2019s brassy enough to try and make the initiation his. Take your positions.\u201d</p> <p>Jeff nodded and took his place on the other side of the aisle. I walked to the second pew and slid across slick wood to join Ben and Christopher.</p><p>Gabriel stepped up to the dais in front of the church and looked out over the shifters who\u2019d come to witness history.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack exists only because its members allow it. The Keenes rule only because the Pack allows it. My father kept this Pack safe, and we have tried to do the same, to enforce the Pack\u2019s will. We are lucky enough to have given birth to a new generation. To the twelfth generation of Keenes to hold the Pack.\u201d His gaze went cold. \u201cAnd one way or the other, he will be brought into the Pack in his rightful place.\u201d</p><p>The doors burst open, magic rushing inside like water. The crown\u2019s magic was unmistakable. But when I looked back, it wasn\u2019t Tom who wore the coronet.</p><p>It was Patrick.</p> <p>I was too stunned to move, to speak. He\u2019d played me. Played all of us. He\u2019d feigned innocence, pretended shock at Tom\u2019s reaction, and faked interest in me. Fury rose, hot and needle sharp.</p><p>\u201cPatrick,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Patrick swaggered forward, the coronet glinting atop his dark hair. \u201cWhy? Because someone outsmarted you? Because you\u2019re not the only one who thinks he can run the Pack?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s expression stayed flat, but his magic had surged forward, filling the air with heat and power. \u201cBecause you used people. Because you betrayed your father and your Pack. And because you think any of those things qualify you to be Apex.\u201d</p><p>Patrick smiled thinly. \u201cI\u2019m wearing the crown. That\u2019s the only qualification I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunately short-sighted view. A leader needs soldiers. Where\u2019s Tom? Or the rest of your family?\u201d</p> <p>Patrick\u2019s eyes narrowed, but just for a moment. \u201cTom did his part. He\u2019s done. And my family is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily is never irrelevant,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cFamily is Pack, and Pack is family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Patrick said, \u201cwhere\u2019s yours? No wife? No kid? I guess you can\u2019t have an initiation without a crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Gabriel said, his tone deceptively smooth, \u201cdon\u2019t worry yourself, whelp. There will be an initiation yet.\u201d He let out an ear-splitting whistle, and we fell into place. The shifters emerged from the foyer, the balcony, the sanctuary\u2019s hidden wings, surrounding Patrick and the crown.</p><p>Patrick\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. If anything, he looked excited by the challenge. \u201cTwenty to one odds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to grab five or ten more shifters for yourself to make it even?\u201d</p><p>His arrogance was staggering. Is that what he thought made a good Apex? Exaggeration and brute force?</p><p>But Gabriel didn\u2019t move. It was Jeff who stepped forward to face down Patrick.</p><p>Gabriel smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to get in line. Mr. Christopher has dibs on you, my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFallon\u2019s tiger pet? This should be fun.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s eyes were cold and hard. \u201cNot fun so much as incredibly satisfying.\u201d He flexed his fingers menacingly, rolled his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fight like humans?\u201d Patrick asked, mild amusement on his face. He thought he\u2019d lucked out. Thought fighting Jeff\u2019s lean human form would be an easier victory than fighting the tiger.</p><p>As if the man was somehow less tenacious, I thought with the smallest hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t want you to lose that crown by shifting,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cI think we can take care of this the old fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Patrick said, motioning him forward.</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t waste any time. Patrick braced himself, turning his body to the side to prepare for Jeff\u2019s onslaught.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a twenty on Jeff,\u201d Ben murmured to Christopher, both of whom sat on the pew in front of me.</p><p>\u201cNo deal,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cI\u2019m not betting against the house.\u201d</p><p>A wise decision. I\u2019d seen Jeff fight before, knew he was a capable soldier. But this battle was about emotion. It was about Gabriel, the Pack, the crown . . . and me.</p><p>They began like boxers, circling each other, fists clenched and ready to go. Patrick opted for brute force, tried to land three punches before he realized Jeff was faster. Patrick tried an uppercut, and Jeff used the shot against him, landing a sidekick in on unprotected right.</p><p>Patrick spat out a curse, but stayed up. \u201cYou\u2019re a tenacious little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour words,\u201d Jeff said, dodging to avoid another jab. \u201cNot mine.\u201d He nailed Patrick with a punch to the stomach that sent him shuffling backward.</p><p>But it only incited Patrick\u2019s rage. He balanced himself, surged forward, pulled Jeff to the ground. They grappled, bowled down the aisle, knocking flower stands and hymnals to the ground.</p><p>Patrick belted him, a shot across the face that split his lip, sending the scent of blood into the air.</p><p>Suddenly struck by fear, I started to rise, but Ben put a hand on mine, shook his head. \u201cLet Jeff handle this.\u201d</p><p>Jeff shifted his body weight, rolled Patrick again, ended up on top of him . . . and then punched him square in the face.</p><p>Patrick\u2019s eyes fluttered back, and his head bounced on the marble floor with a sick thud.</p><p>Chest heaving, Jeff stood up and ripped the coronet from Patrick\u2019s forehead. \u201cI believe that belongs to someone else, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>After Patrick was taken away and Jeff got cleaned up, Berna escorted Tanya and Connor into the sanctuary. With Gabriel, they stepped to the front of the church together.</p><p>While Tanya held Connor, Gabriel held the coronet, in both palms, as if gauging its weight. The church was utterly silent, all of us waiting for word from our alpha.</p><p>After a moment, he looked up at us. \u201cI had a plan of things to say. Things I\u2019ve considered for a very long time. Things I figured I\u2019d eventually say to my sister, or perhaps a daughter. Now, my son. This is just a piece of metal,\u201d he said, holding it up, light glinting off the engravings. \u201cBut it is also so much more than that. It\u2019s a reminder of who we are, of the promises we\u2019ve made to each other.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel reached out, placed the crown carefully on Connor\u2019s head. It was much too big, but canted backward just managed to stay on.</p><p>Connor\u2019s eyes went huge, and he went still, as if stunned by the weight of the crown on his head. Probably a good lesson.</p><p>\u201cI hereby initiate Connor Devereaux Keene into the Pack. May he live long, fight fiercely, love well.\u201d</p><p>The shifters whooped and yelled their joy, clapping fiercely at the child who stood before them, eyes wide and grinning at the commotion made on his behalf.</p><p>Gabriel put an arm around Tanya, pulling her close as the crowd celebrated their family. They were happy, a unit bound by love and magic.</p><p>And I felt only sadness. Why couldn\u2019t I have that? A chance at happiness? A chance at love and family? Why did prejudice have to figure into it?</p><p>I looked at Jeff, found his gaze on me, eyes wide in understanding.</p><p>And there in the pew, in the church of our Pack, he reached for my hand, and I let him take it.</p><p>Jeff rose, and when the first wave of shifters who\u2019d offered their congratulations had stepped aside, moved to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d His voice was quiet, but earnest.</p><p>Gabe looked at Jeff, then me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we step into the hallway?\u201d</p><p>As we moved from the sanctuary to the classrooms and offices, the grandness of the chapel gave way to utility and function. The hallway smelled of crayons, rubber toys, and fruit punch, the walls dotted with posters, children\u2019s art, and the occasional smudge of finger paint.</p><p>We walked into a classroom, and Gabriel closed the door behind us.</p><p>The room filled quickly with magic\u2014tense, angry, and ready to boil over.</p><p>Jeff swallowed, took a step toward Gabriel. \u201cI love your sister.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. I hadn\u2019t expected him to lead with love.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Gabriel asked. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do. The whole damn family probably knows I do. Hell, there probably aren\u2019t any supernaturals in the city who don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes stayed cool. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what you expect me to do about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I expect? I expect you to stop this potential bullshit so she can be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a member of my family, and second in line for the Pack. You both know what that means.\u201d He slid his dangerous gaze toward me. \u201cYou know the price.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my brother, fury rising for the second time tonight at an arrogant wolf. \u201cJeff, can you please give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze on me, but paused.</p><p>I nodded again, offering reassurance, and he left the room and closed the door behind him. A scream building in my chest, I slowly looked back at my oldest brother.</p><p>\u201cI am sick of you trying to control me and my life.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cAre you of the misguided opinion that you\u2019ve somehow meekly followed orders?\u201d</p><p>The snark in his voice rankled, and I had to fist my hands to keep from pummeling him. \u201cThe sarcasm isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it probably isn\u2019t. So how about the truth: You have a role to play, and you know it. Sure, you like spending time with Jeff. He\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s loyal to the Pack. Always ready to serve. But he\u2019s not a potential. He can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, mustered my courage. \u201cThen I\u2019m done with potentials.\u201d</p><p>Magic spilled into the room, angry and biting like insects. I worked not to flinch.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Gabriel asked, very slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would have been easy to back down. To tuck my tail and slink out of the room, and let things be the way they\u2019d been before. But that left me lonely and dishonest to myself, to Jeff, and to the potentials. So I gathered up my courage, and put it out there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with potentials. I\u2019m not going to meet any more of them. I\u2019m going to date who I want to date, regardless of the type of shifter he is. And I\u2019ll give up my place in the line of succession if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, jaw clenched and twitching. \u201cIs this your way of rebelling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d It was, of course, but not in the way he meant. It was a rebellion against what we\u2019d been taught, about who I\u2019d been taught to be. But it wasn\u2019t a rebellion for the sake of rebellion. It was about, for the first time, being true to myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done my part to protect the Pack, the crown. But it\u2019s time to think about my future. I love him.\u201d Tears rose to my eyes at the power of the admission. \u201cHe\u2019s the other half of me, and I\u2019ve known that for a long time. But I haven\u2019t admitted it, and that\u2019s not fair to him or me or anyone else.\u201d I paused, looked up at my big brother, and the leader of my Pack. \u201cI\u2019ll give up the Pack for him. Because he\u2019s worth the price. I\u2019ll abdicate.\u201d</p><p>Of course Jeff was worth the price. He was the one who\u2019d loved me regardless. The one who\u2019d fought by my side despite the humiliation of potentials and dates. The one who made me laugh at myself, who understood me better than anyone in the world.</p><p>It felt like a weight had lifted from my shoulders. My body felt lighter. My soul felt lighter. For the first time in my life, I felt like Fallon. Just Fallon, because he\u2019d given me permission to be myself.</p><p>For a long time, he just looked at me. And then one corner of his lip lifted. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him. \u201cOkay? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were entertaining other answers.\u201d He tilted up my chin, searched my eyes. \u201cI love you, Fallon. And so do your other brothers. And so did Mom, and so did Pop. You are exactly who you\u2019re supposed to be. No more, no less. And you always will be, whether the coronet is yours or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pack is the Pack.\u201d Gabe gestured toward the door. \u201cYou were in that chapel. They know love. They know respect. That\u2019s the foundation of the Pack. And if you can\u2019t love\u2014if you can\u2019t be brave enough to put love first, even if you have to sacrifice to do it\u2014you do the Pack no service. Cowards do the Pack no service.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but put a hand on his arm. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell them now, are you? This is Connor\u2019s night. This can wait.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cConnor won\u2019t remember a single damn thing about tonight. But you\u2019ll remember the look of sheer panic on Eli\u2019s face when we tell him he\u2019s next in line.\u201d</p> <p>The gleam in my eyes probably wasn\u2019t especially graceful. But he was right. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said. \u201cTonight is the night.\u201d</p><p>We walked back into the room, every shifter in the sanctuary turning to face us. Gabriel put a hand at my back, rubbed supportively.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s news to share,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cOur favorite Keene has made a decision about her future.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the words out in a rush, lest I lose the nerve. \u201cI hereby abdicate. Give up my position in the line of succession.\u201d I let my gaze find Jeff, whose eyes had gone fierce. \u201cFor love.\u201d</p><p>Noise erupted around me. I must have expected anger or disappointment, because their congratulations completely floored me.</p><p>Ben picked me up, swung me around the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this, sister.\u201d</p><p>I looked for Eli, searched his gaze for anger. As the shifter next in line, the decision would affect him most of all. But if I\u2019d added pressure, he certainly didn\u2019t look it.</p><p>When Ben released me, I walked to him. \u201cI should have talked to you first\u2014\u201d I began, but he shook his head, put a hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to have a life, Fal. You don\u2019t have to ask me for permission to do that. Or any other yahoo in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d he said, and for the first time, I saw in his eyes that same golden swirl of knowledge that I\u2019d often seen in Gabriel\u2019s. He may never lay claim to the Pack, but if he did, he\u2019d be prepared.</p><p>Eli embraced me, kissed the top of my head. \u201cI believe someone\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He released me, and I looked in the direction of his gaze.</p><p>Jeff stood apart from everyone else, eyes shining with love and face beaming with happiness. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen him that happy.</p><p>He grinned, held out a hand.</p><p>I walked to him, biting my lip to hold back a grin that felt like it would have split my face. But he was impatient. He stepped forward, met me in the middle, and cupped my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Fallon Keene. I\u2019ve loved you since the moment I saw you. And I will love you every day and night for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Tears blossomed. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>With my family cheering and applauding around us, Jeff Christopher kissed me.</p><p>And for the first time, all was right with the world.</p><p>He\u2019d made me wait in the living room, and I stood in front of the giant fish tank that stood opposite the picture window, watching clown fish dart back and forth across the water.</p><p>When the bedroom door opened, I glanced back. Jeff stood in the doorway in a pair of silk boxers. I\u2019d only seen him naked when we\u2019d shifted, but that meant I wasn\u2019t exactly paying attention to his nakedness.</p><p>Jeff may have been lean, but he was well-hewn. He had the body of an endurance athlete, every inch and plane smoothed with muscle.</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are up here, Fallon.\u201d</p><p>I took the admonishment, looked up at him with a grin, and found him smiling back with me.</p><p>He held out a hand and beckoned me forward. And I followed him. In the doorway, he kissed me softly, then gestured toward the room.</p><p>\u201cMadam, your palace.\u201d</p><p>The bed was covered in pink rose petals, and a bottle of champagne was cooling in a sterling silver stand. A woman\u2019s throaty voice crooned softly in the background.</p><p>\u201cThis is . . . impressive,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJust wait.\u201d He turned off the lights, and two dozen candles sprang to life around the room, which now glowed softly.</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cLEDs. I connected them to a circuit\u201d\u2014he began, but waved off the thought. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, we\u2019re here. And I wanted this to be romantic. Just for us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but the intimacy in his eyes made me feel suddenly shy.</p><p>He took my hand. Squeezed it. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, and looked away to avoid the intimacy in his eyes. But he tipped my chin back to meet him again.</p><p>\u201cHonesty between us,\u201d he said. \u201cJust me and you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, remembered the trust I\u2019d already put him, and nodded. \u201cJust nervous. It\u2019s me and you\u2014and we\u2019re\u2014well, you know.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. But it\u2019s me and you. And we don\u2019t have a timetable.\u201d</p><p>He led me to the bed and tugged the belt on the robe he\u2019d let me borrow. It fell to the ground, revealing the long, black negligee I\u2019d worn beneath it, a slick fall of bias-cut silk.</p><p>\u201cYou look . . . absolutely amazing.\u201d The adoration in his eyes left little doubt of his sincerity.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You look pretty delectable yourself.\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around me, drew me forward against the long line of his body, and kissed me. And this time, there was no restraint, no fear, no caution. His kiss was possessive\u2014and also victorious.</p><p>We tumbled onto the bed, Jeff apologizing when he tangled in the silk that fell to my ankles. He rolled me atop him, plucked a rose petal from my hair, then pulled my mouth to his and kissed me again.</p><p>His lips were so soft, the kiss so tender. But somehow, missing something.</p><p>He drew back, pushed the hair away from my face. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>I propped my arms on either side of his head. \u201cHonestly, I still feel a little ungainly right now.\u201d</p><p>He squinted, scratched at his temple. \u201cI kind of know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, surveyed the room. \u201cI think maybe this isn\u2019t us. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I like romance as well as the next guy.\u201d He picked up a handful of rose petals, and let them fall like water from his hand. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure this is our kind of romance.\u201d</p><p>I looked around at the scene he\u2019d prepared. It was all perfect, and right out of the romance playbook. But maybe not our particular romance playbook. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. What do we do?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me. \u201cDo you think you can juggle?\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, I could juggle. With some instruction.</p><p>He\u2019d stuck to boxers, but I\u2019d switched out the negligee for another \u201cJakob\u2019s Quest\u201d T-shirt for the lesson, and we\u2019d reassembled in the living room, where we had plenty of space to maneuver.</p><p>Jeff was a marvel. Having seen him in full gaming frenzy, I didn\u2019t doubt he had great hand-eye coordination. But watching him whip beanbags through the air in smooth and fluid arcs was seriously impressive.</p><p>He taught me to toss one, then two, and I was feeling optimistic. But tossing the beanbags he\u2019d pulled from a drawer with syncopation just wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>I smiled at the pile of beanbags on the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d he assured me, standing behind, hands at my waist to ensure I was standing up right and kept my elbows at my side.</p><p>The beanbags hit the floor again . . . and then again . . . and then again.</p><p>And then, by some miracle of gravity and inertia, I had it. The bags moved like competing waves, slipping by each other\u2014and somehow landing in hand, where I tossed them into the air again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got it,\u201d I said through clenched teeth, afraid to move. \u201cI think I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said behind me, his excitement a buzz of magic at my back.</p><p>And then . . . I didn\u2019t have it.</p> <p>One of the bags bounced awkwardly off my hand, and when I instinctively reached for it, I tossed another off course. It plopped into the fish tank with a gurgle, the fish darting to their corners like boxers at the bell.</p><p>Jeff punched both arms into the air. \u201cTouchdown!\u201d he screamed out, like I\u2019d just made the winning throw at the Super Bowl.</p><p>I burst out laughing . . . and couldn\u2019t stop. I laughed until tears flowed from the corner of my eyes, until I was on my knees on the carpeted floor, until my stomach was aching from it.</p><p>\u201cThe crowd goes wild!\u201d Jeff shouted, running around the living room in a victory lap, pumping his arms in the air. He spiraled back to me, and held out his hand, fisted to hold an imaginary microphone.</p><p>\u201cMs. Keene, you\u2019ve just scored your fourteenth winning touchdown in this record-setting game. How are you going to celebrate?\u201d</p> <p>Still hiccupping with laughs, I mopped at my cheeks and looked up at him, grinning foolishly. Grinning adorably.</p><p>This, I realized, was us. Not playing at a kind of movie and magazine romance that didn\u2019t really interest us.</p><p>But laughing together. Learning together. Loving together. That was our particular romance. And it was a heady brew.</p><p>He was still crouched in front of me when I saw the sudden intensity in his eyes, that shift from humor to seduction. This time, I didn\u2019t shy away.</p><p>I reached out, put a hand to his cheek, and swooned when he closed his eyes, lips curving with pleasure. I leaned forward, pressed my lips to his and kissed him softly. Just a small kiss, a small enticement.</p><p>He opened his eyes, surprise on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve never kissed me like that.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you needed to do it.\u201d</p><p>Love swamped me, ferocious in its desire to make him see what I\u2019d known for a very long time. That he\u2019d always been the only one, even if I\u2019d denied it.</p><p>I put my hands on his face, met his gaze. \u201cI need you. I\u2019ve always needed you. I just didn\u2019t allow myself to admit it.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat, and his mouth was on mine before I\u2019d even processed the sound. It was less a kiss than a battle, and we both intended to win.</p><p>We pulled clothing with animal ferocity, tearing at them like they were burning us alive. I found his elastic waistband and released him, and he fell, heavy and hard, into my hand.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Fallon,\u201d he said against my mouth, as I handled him well and thoroughly, his body fairly vibrating with pleasure. \u201cI need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>He stripped me of the clothing that remained and stared down at me.</p> <p>\u201cJeff?\u201d</p><p>He held up a finger. \u201cUn momento. I\u2019m savoring this moment. Committing it to memory.\u201d He slid the flat of his hand down the middle of my body, then lifted it again to cup my breast.</p><p>My body sang with pleasure, eyes drifting shut from the sensations that I\u2019d imagined for so long, finally real.</p><p>His mouth clamped on mine again, and he pressed me down to the thick carpet beneath us, his arousal between our bodies, eager for action. With hands and fingers he teased and entreated, his kisses brutal. I dug fingers into his back, pulling him closer.</p><p>\u201cJeff. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He growled, low in his throat, and without argument or delay, spread his body over mine and thrust powerfully. He made a noise that sounded like relief, but relief wasn\u2019t on his mind, not for me.</p><p>Sweet and geeky Jeff, lover of games, knew how to move. Each nearly brutal motion rode the line between pain and pleasure as his mouth tortured mine. Our magicks rose again, keeping pace as pleasure swamped us, and exploding through the room when we cried out the other\u2019s name.</p><p>It was twenty minutes before I could feel my legs again. I glanced at him beside me, smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to improve on this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pause. \u201cI have several very specific ideas.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and had the sense he\u2019d been saving that response for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I turned to my side to face him, propping myself on an elbow. \u201cAnd what ideas are those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCostumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess Leia. Wonder Woman. Silk Spectre. Mystique. Hit Girl. So many options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting on a costume to satiate your prurient fantasies,\u201d I said, lying back on the floor again.</p><p>And then I thought about who he was, and who I was, and our kind of romance. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to play Bruce Wayne, I might reconsider.\u201d</p><p>He was. So I did. </p> </body></html>"]
