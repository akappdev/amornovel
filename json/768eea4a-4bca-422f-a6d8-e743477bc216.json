With their hurrying and their worrying and their wanting all the answers now. They wear me out, the poor, harried things.</p><p>Don\u2019t come back, I always tell them. Don\u2019t come back.</p> <p>Youth is still where you left it, and that\u2019s where it should stay. Anything that was worth taking on life\u2019s journey, you\u2019ll already have taken with you.</p><p>Twenty years I\u2019ve been saying this, but do they listen? Do they, hell. Here comes another of them now. Panting and puffing as he reaches the top of the cliff. Late thirties, I\u2019d guess. Attractive enough, against the blue sky. Looks a bit like a politician. Do I mean that? Maybe a movie star.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember his face from the old days. Not that that means anything. These days I barely even recall my own face when I glimpse it in the mirror. I can see this chap\u2019s gaze raking the surroundings, taking in me sitting in my chair under my favorite olive tree.</p><p>\u201cAre you Arthur?\u201d he says abruptly.</p><p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d</p> <p>I scan him adroitly. Looks well off. Wearing one of those expensive-logo polo shirts. Probably good for a few double Scotches.</p><p>\u201cYou must want a drink,\u201d I say pleasantly. Always useful to steer the conversation in the direction of the bar early on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a drink,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help stifling a yawn. So predictable. He wants to know what happened. Another merchant banker having a midlife crisis, returning to the scene of his youth. The scene of the crime. Leave it where it was, I want to answer. Turn round. Return to your adult, problematic life, because you won\u2019t solve it here.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t believe me. They never do.</p><p>\u201cDear boy,\u201d I say gently. \u201cYou grew up. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says impatiently, and rubs his sweaty brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m here for a reason. Listen to me.\u201d He comes forward a few paces, an impressive height and figure against the sun, intentness of purpose on his handsome face. \u201cI\u2019m here for a reason,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to get involved\u2014but I can\u2019t help it. I have to do this. I want to know what exactly happened....\u201d</p><p>Twenty Days Earlier</p><p>1</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I\u2019ve bought him an engagement ring. Was that a mistake?</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s not a girly ring. It\u2019s a plain band with a tiny diamond in it, which the guy in the shop talked me into. If Richard doesn\u2019t like the diamond, he can always turn it round.</p><p>Or not wear it at all. Keep it on his nightstand or in a box or whatever.</p><p>Or I could take it back and never mention it. Actually, I\u2019m losing confidence in this ring by the minute, but I just felt bad that he wouldn\u2019t have anything. Men don\u2019t get the greatest deal out of a proposal. They have to set up the occasion, they have to get down on one knee, they have to ask the question, and they have to buy a ring. And what do we have to do? Say \u201cyes.\u201d</p> <p>Or \u201cno,\u201d obviously.</p><p>I wonder what proportion of marriage proposals end in a \u201cyes\u201d and what proportion end in a \u201cno\u201d? I open my mouth automatically to share this thought with Richard\u2014then hastily close it again. Idiot.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Richard glances up.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I beam. \u201cJust ... great menu!\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s bought a ring already. I don\u2019t mind, either way. On the one hand, it\u2019s fabulously romantic if he has. On the other hand, it\u2019s fabulously romantic to choose one together.</p><p>It\u2019s a win-win.</p><p>I sip my water and smile lovingly at Richard. We\u2019re sitting at a corner table overlooking the river. It\u2019s a new restaurant on the Strand, just up from the Savoy. All black-and-white marble and vintage chandeliers and button-back chairs in pale gray. It\u2019s elegant but not showy. The perfect place for a lunchtime proposal. I\u2019m wearing an understated bride-to-be white shirt, a print skirt, and have splashed out on stay-up stockings, just in case we decide to cement the engagement later on. I\u2019ve never worn stay-up stockings before. But, then, I\u2019ve never been proposed to before.</p><p>Ooh, maybe he\u2019s booked a room at the Savoy.</p><p>No. Richard\u2019s not flash like that. He\u2019d never make a ridiculous, out-of-proportion gesture. Nice lunch, yes; overpriced hotel room, no. Which I respect.</p><p>He\u2019s looking nervous. He\u2019s fiddling with his cuffs and checking his phone and swirling the water round in his glass. As he sees me watching him, he smiles too.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as though we\u2019re speaking in code, skirting around the real issue. I fiddle with my napkin and adjust my chair. This waiting is unbearable. Why doesn\u2019t he get it over with? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, I don\u2019t mean \u201cget it over with.\u201d Of course I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not a vaccination. It\u2019s ... Well, what is it? It\u2019s a beginning. A first step. The pair of us embarking on a great adventure together. Because we want to take on life as a team. Because we can\u2019t think of anyone else we\u2019d rather share that journey with. Because I love him and he loves me.</p><p>I\u2019m getting misty-eyed already. This is hopeless. I\u2019ve been like this for days, ever since I realized what he was driving at.</p><p>He\u2019s quite heavy-handed, Richard. I mean, in a good, lovable way. He\u2019s direct and to the point and doesn\u2019t play games. (Thank God.) Nor does he land massive surprises on you out of the blue. On my last birthday, he hinted for ages that his present was going to be a surprise trip, which was ideal because I knew to get down my overnight bag and pack a few things.</p><p>Although, in the end, he did catch me out, because it wasn\u2019t a weekend away, as I\u2019d predicted. It was a train ticket to Stroud, which he had biked to my desk with no warning, on my midweek birthday. It turned out he\u2019d secretly arranged with my boss for me to have two days off, and when I finally arrived at Stroud, a car whisked me to the most adorable Cotswold cottage, where he was waiting with a fire burning and a sheepskin rug laid out in front of the flames. (Mmm. Let\u2019s just say that sex in front of a roaring fire is the best thing ever. Except when that stupid spark flew out and burned my thigh. But never mind. Tiny detail.)</p> <p>So this time, when he began dropping hints, again they weren\u2019t exactly subtle indications. They were more like massive signposts plonked in the road: I will be proposing to you soon. First he set up this date and called it a \u201cspecial lunch.\u201d Then he referred to a \u201cbig question\u201d he had to ask me and half-winked (to which I feigned ignorance, of course). Then he started teasing me by asking if I like his surname, Finch. (As it happens, I do like it. I don\u2019t mean I won\u2019t miss being Lottie Graveney, but I\u2019ll be very happy to be Mrs. Lottie Finch.)</p><p>I almost wish he\u2019d been more roundabout and this was going to be more of a surprise. But, there again, at least I knew to get a manicure.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lottie, have you decided yet?\u201d Richard looks up at me with that warm smile of his, and my stomach swoops. Just for an instant I thought he was being super-clever and that was his proposal.</p><p>\u201cUm ...\u201d I look down to hide my confusion.</p><p>Of course the answer will be \u201cyes.\u201d A big, joyful \u201cyes.\u201d I can still hardly believe we\u2019ve arrived at this place. Marriage. I mean, marriage! In the three years Richard and I have been together, I\u2019ve deliberately avoided the question of marriage, commitment, and all associated subjects (children, houses, sofas, herbs in pots). We sort of live together at his place, but I still have my own flat. We\u2019re a couple, but at Christmas we go home to our own families. We\u2019re in that place.</p> <p>After about a year, I knew we were good together. I knew I loved him. I\u2019d seen him at his best (the surprise birthday trip, tied with the time I drove over his foot by mistake and he didn\u2019t shout at me) and his worst (obstinately refusing to ask for directions, all the way to Norfolk, with broken sat nav. It took six hours). And I still wanted to be with him. I got him. He\u2019s not the show-offy kind, Richard. He\u2019s measured and deliberate. Sometimes you think he\u2019s not even listening\u2014but then he\u2019ll come to life so suddenly, you realize he was alert the whole time. Like a lion, half asleep under the tree but ready for the kill. Whereas I\u2019m a bit more of a gazelle, leaping around. We complement each other. It\u2019s Nature.</p><p>(Not in a food-chain sense, obviously. In a metaphorical sense.)</p><p>So I knew, after a year, he was The One. But I also knew what would happen if I put a foot wrong. In my experience, the word \u201cmarriage\u201d is like an enzyme. It causes all kinds of reactions in a relationship, mostly of the breaking-down kind.</p><p>Look at what happened with Jamie, my first long-term boyfriend. We\u2019d been happily together for four years and I just happened to mention that my parents got married at the same age we were (twenty-six and twenty-three). That was it. One mention. Whereupon he freaked out and said we had to take \u201ca break.\u201d A break from what? Until that moment we\u2019d been fine. So clearly what he needed a break from was the risk of hearing the word \u201cmarriage\u201d again. Clearly this was such a major worry that he couldn\u2019t even face seeing me, for fear that my mouth might start to form the word again.</p><p>Before the \u201cbreak\u201d was over, he was with that red-haired girl. I didn\u2019t mind, because by then I\u2019d met Seamus. Seamus, with his sexy Irish lilting voice. And I don\u2019t even know what went wrong with him. We were besotted for about a year\u2014crazy all-night-sex nothing-else-in-life-matters besotted\u2014until all of a sudden we were arguing every night instead. We went from exhilarating to exhausting in about twenty-four hours. It was toxic. Too many state-of-the-nation summits about \u201cWhere are we heading?\u201d and \u201cWhat do we want from this relationship?\u201d and it wore us both out. We limped on for another year, and when I look back, it\u2019s as though that second year is a big black miserable blot in my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then there was Julian. That lasted two years too, but it never really took. It was like a skeleton of a relationship. I suppose both of us were working far too hard. I\u2019d recently moved to Blay Pharmaceuticals and was traveling all over the country. He was trying to get partnership at his accountancy firm. I\u2019m not sure we ever even broke up properly\u2014we just drifted apart. We meet up occasionally, as friends, and it\u2019s the same for both of us\u2014we\u2019re not quite sure where it all went wrong. He even asked me out on a date a year or so ago, but I had to tell him I was with someone now and really happy. And that was Richard. The guy I really do love. The guy sitting opposite me with a ring in his pocket (maybe).</p><p>Richard is definitely better-looking than any of my other boyfriends. (Maybe I\u2019m biased, but I think he\u2019s gorgeous.) He works hard as a media analyst, but he\u2019s not obsessed. He\u2019s not as rich as Julian, but who cares? He\u2019s energetic and funny and has an uproarious laugh that makes my spirits lift, whatever mood I\u2019m in. He calls me \u201cDaisy,\u201d ever since we went on a picnic where I made him a daisy chain. He can lose his temper with people\u2014but that\u2019s OK. No one\u2019s perfect. When I look back over our relationship, I don\u2019t see a black blot, like with Seamus, or a blank space, like with Julian. I see a cheesy music video. A montage, with blue skies and smiles. Happy times. Closeness. Laughter.</p><p>And now we\u2019re getting to the climax of the montage. The bit where he kneels down, takes a deep breath ...</p><p>I\u2019m feeling so nervous for him. I want this to go beautifully. I want to be able to tell our children that I fell in love with their father all over again, the day he proposed.</p> <p>Our children. Our home. Our life.</p><p>As I let my mind roll around the images, I feel a release inside me. I\u2019m ready for this. I\u2019m thirty-three years old and I\u2019m ready. All my grown-up life, I\u2019ve steered away from the subject of marriage. My friends are the same. It\u2019s as though there\u2019s been a crime-scene cordon around the whole area: NO ENTRY. You just don\u2019t go there, because if you do, you\u2019ve jinxed it and your boyfriend chucks you.</p><p>But now there\u2019s nothing to jinx. I can feel the love flowing between us, over the table. I want to grab Richard\u2019s hands. I want to envelop him in my arms. He is such a wonderful, wonderful man. I\u2019m so lucky. In forty years when we\u2019re both wrinkled and gray, perhaps we\u2019ll walk up the Strand hand in hand and remember today and thank God we found each other. I mean, what were the chances, in this teeming world of strangers? Love is so random. So random. It\u2019s a miracle, really....</p><p>Oh God, I\u2019m blinking....</p><p>\u201cLottie?\u201d Richard has noticed my damp eyes. \u201cHey, Daisy-doo. Are you OK? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>Even though I\u2019ve been more honest with Richard than I have with any other boyfriend, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to reveal my entire thought process to him. Fliss, my big sister, says I think in Hollywood Technicolor and I have to remember that other people can\u2019t hear the swooping violins.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I dab at my eyes. \u201cNothing. I just wish you didn\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>Richard is flying off tonight to an assignment in San Francisco. It\u2019s three months\u2014could be worse\u2014but I\u2019ll miss him terribly. In fact, it\u2019s only the thought that I\u2019ll have a wedding to plan which is distracting me.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t cry. I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d He reaches out to take my hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll Skype every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I squeeze his hands back. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough you might want to remember that, if I\u2019m in my office, everyone can hear what you\u2019re saying. Including my boss.\u201d</p> <p>Only a tiny flicker of his eyes gives away the fact that he\u2019s teasing me. The last time he was away and we Skyped, I started giving him advice on how to manage his nightmare boss, forgetting that Richard was in an open-plan office and the nightmare boss was liable to walk past at any minute. (Luckily, he didn\u2019t.)</p><p>\u201cThanks for that tip.\u201d I shrug, equally deadpan.</p><p>\u201cAlso, they can see you. So you might not want to be totally naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot totally,\u201d I agree. \u201cMaybe just a transparent bra and panties. Keep it simple.\u201d</p><p>Richard grins and grasps my hands more tightly. \u201cI love you.\u201d His voice is low and warm and melting. I will never, ever get sick of him saying that.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, Lottie ...\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cI have something to ask you....\u201d</p><p>My insides feel as if they\u2019re going to explode. My face is a rictus of anticipation while my thoughts are spinning wildly. Oh God ... he\u2019s doing it.... My whole life changes here.... Concentrate, Lottie ... savor the moment.... Shit! What\u2019s wrong with my leg?</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare down at it in horror.</p><p>Whoever made these \u201cstay-up stockings\u201d is a liar and will go to hell, because one of them hasn\u2019t bloody well stayed up. It\u2019s collapsed around my knee and there\u2019s a really gross plastic \u201cadhesive\u201d strip flapping around my calf. This is hideous.</p><p>I can\u2019t be proposed to like this. I can\u2019t spend the rest of my life looking back and thinking, It was such a romantic moment; shame about the stocking.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Richard.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cJust wait a sec....\u201d</p> <p>Surreptitiously, I reach down and yank the stocking up\u2014but the flimsy fabric tears in my hand. Great. Now I have both flapping plastic and shreds of nylon decorating my leg. I cannot believe my marriage proposal is being wrecked by hosiery. I should have gone for bare legs.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d Richard looks a little baffled as I emerge from under the table.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the Ladies\u2019,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sorry. Can we put things on pause? Just for a nanosecond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I\u2019m red with embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019ve had a ... a garment mishap. I don\u2019t want you to see. Will you look away?\u201d</p> <p>Obediently, Richard averts his head. I push my chair back and walk swiftly across the room, ignoring the looks of other lunchtime diners. There\u2019s no point trying to mask it. It\u2019s a flappy stocking.</p><p>I bang through the door of the Ladies\u2019, wrench off my shoe and the stupid stocking, then stare at myself in the mirror, my heart pounding. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve just put my proposal on pause.</p><p>I feel as though time is on hold. As though we\u2019re in a sci-fi movie and Richard is in suspended animation and I\u2019ve got all the time in the world to think about whether I want to marry him.</p><p>Which, obviously, I don\u2019t need, because the answer is: I do.</p><p>A blond girl with a beaded headband turns to peer at me, lip liner in hand. I guess I do look a bit odd, standing motionless with a shoe and stocking in my hand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bin over there.\u201d She nods. \u201cDo you feel OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Thanks.\u201d I suddenly have the urge to share the momentousness of this occasion. \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s in the middle of proposing to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d All the women at the mirrors turn to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018in the middle of\u2019?\u201d demands a thin redheaded girl in pink, her eyebrows narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s he said, \u2018Will you ...\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe started, but I had a stocking catastrophe.\u201d I wave the holdup. \u201cSo he\u2019s on pause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn pause?\u201d says someone incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d get back out there quick,\u201d says the redhead. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give him a chance to change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exciting!\u201d says the blond girl. \u201cCan we watch? Can I film you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could put it on YouTube!\u201d says her friend. \u201cHas he hired a flash mob or anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does this work?\u201d An old woman with metal-gray hair cuts across our discussion imperiously. She\u2019s waving her hands angrily underneath the automatic hand-wash dispenser. \u201cWhy do they invent these machines? What\u2019s wrong with a bar of soap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, like this, Aunt Dee,\u201d says the redheaded girl soothingly. \u201cYour hands are too high.\u201d</p><p>I pull off my other shoe and stocking, and, since I\u2019m here, reach for the hand lotion to slather on my bare legs. I don\u2019t want to look back and think, It was such a romantic moment; shame about the scaly shins. Then I get out my phone. I have to text Fliss. I quickly type:</p><p>He\u2019s doing it!!!</p><p>A moment later, her reply appears on my screen:</p><p>Don\u2019t tell me u r texting me in the middle of a proposal!!!</p><p>In Ladies\u2019. Taking a moment.</p><p>V exciting!!! You make a great couple. Give him a kiss from me. xxx</p><p>Will do! Talk later xxx</p><p>\u201cWhich one is he?\u201d says the blond girl as I put away my phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a look!\u201d She darts out of the Ladies\u2019, then returns a few seconds later. \u201cOoh, I saw him. The dark guy in the corner? He\u2019s fab. Hey, your mascara\u2019s smudged.\u201d She passes me a makeup eraser pen. \u201cWant to do a quick fix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile companionably at her and start to erase the tiny black marks below my eyes. My wavy chestnut hair is swept up in a chignon, and I suddenly wonder whether to let it down so it tumbles over my shoulders for the big moment.</p><p>No. Too cheesy. Instead, I pull some tendrils out and twist them around my face while I assess everything else. Lipstick: nice coral color. Eye shadow: shimmery gray to bring out my blue eyes. Blusher: hopefully will not need touch-up as will be flushed with excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish my boyfriend would propose,\u201d says a long-haired girl in black, watching me wistfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d I reply, wishing I could be more helpful. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve been together awhile, we know we\u2019re compatible, we love each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut so do my boyfriend and I! We\u2019ve been living together, the sex is great, it\u2019s all great....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pressure him,\u201d says the blond girl wisely.</p> <p>\u201cI mention it, like, once a year.\u201d The long-haired girl looks thoroughly miserable. \u201cAnd he gets twitchy and we drop it. What am I supposed to do? Move out? It\u2019s been six years now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix years?\u201d The old woman looks up from drying her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>The girl with the long hair flushes. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was having a private conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate, pfft.\u201d The old woman gestures briskly around the Ladies\u2019 room. \u201cEveryone\u2019s listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Dee!\u201d The redhead looks embarrassed. \u201cShush!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you shush me, Amy!\u201d The old woman regards the long-haired girl beadily. \u201cMen are like jungle creatures. The minute they\u2019ve found their kill, they eat it and fall asleep. Well, you\u2019ve handed him his kill on a plate, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that,\u201d says the long-haired girl resentfully.</p><p>\u201cIn my day, the men got married because they wanted sex. That was motivation all right!\u201d The old woman gives a brisk laugh. \u201cAll you girls with your sleeping together and living together and then you want an engagement ring. It\u2019s all back to front.\u201d She picks up her bag. \u201cCome along, Amy! What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Amy shoots us desperate looks of apology, then disappears out of the Ladies\u2019 with her aunt. We all exchange raised eyebrows. What a nutter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say reassuringly, and squeeze the girl\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure things will work out for you.\u201d I want to spread the joy. I want everyone to have the good luck that Richard and I have had: finding the perfect person and knowing it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She makes an obvious effort to gather herself. \u201cLet\u2019s hope. Well, I wish you a very happy life together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I hand the eraser pen back to the blond girl. \u201cHere I go! Wish me luck!\u201d</p><p>I push my way out of the Ladies\u2019 and survey the bustling restaurant, feeling as though I\u2019ve just pressed play. There\u2019s Richard, sitting in exactly the same position as when I left him. He\u2019s not even checking his phone. He must be as focused on this moment as I am. The most special moment of our lives.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d I slide into my chair and give him my most loving, receptive smile. \u201cShall we pick up where we left off?\u201d</p><p>Richard smiles back, but I can tell he\u2019s lost a bit of momentum. We might need to work back into things gradually. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special day,\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cThis place is so lovely.\u201d I gesture around. \u201cThe perfect place for a ... a big talk.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve left my hands casually on the table, and, as I intended, Richard takes them between his. He takes a deep breath and frowns.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that, Lottie, there\u2019s something I wanted to ask.\u201d As we meet eyes, his crinkle a little. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will come as a massive surprise....\u201d</p> <p>Oh God, oh God, here it comes.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d My voice is a nervous squawk.</p><p>\u201cBread for the table?\u201d</p><p>Richard starts in shock and my head jerks up. A waiter has approached so quietly, neither of us noticed him. Almost before I know it, Richard has dropped my hand and is talking about brown soda bread. I want to whack the whole basket away in frustration. Couldn\u2019t the waiter tell? Don\u2019t they train them in imminent-proposal spotting?</p><p>I can tell Richard\u2019s been thrown off track too. Stupid, stupid waiter. How dare he spoil my boyfriend\u2019s big moment?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say encouragingly, as soon as the waiter\u2019s gone. \u201cYou had a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Yes.\u201d He focuses on me and takes a deep breath\u2014then his face changes shape again. I turn round in surprise, to see that another bloody waiter has loomed up. Well, to be fair, I suppose it\u2019s what you expect in a restaurant.</p><p>We both order some food\u2014I\u2019m barely aware of what I\u2019m choosing\u2014and the waiter melts away. But another one will be back, any minute. I feel more sorry for Richard than ever. How\u2019s he supposed to propose in these circumstances? How do men do it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t help grinning at him wryly. \u201cNot your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wine waiter will be along in a minute,\u201d I point out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like Piccadilly Circus here.\u201d He rolls his eyes ruefully, and I feel a warm sense of collusion. We\u2019re in this together. Who cares when he proposes? Who cares if it\u2019s not some perfect, staged moment? \u201cShall we get some champagne?\u201d he adds.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help giving him a knowing smile. \u201cWould that be a little ... premature, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that depends.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>The subtext is so obvious, I don\u2019t know whether I want to laugh or hug him.</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case ...\u201d I pause a delicious length of time, eking it out for both of us. \u201cYes. My answer would be yes.\u201d</p><p>His brow relaxes and I can see the tension flood out of him. Did he really think I might say no? He\u2019s so unassuming. He\u2019s such a darling man. Oh God. We\u2019re getting married!</p> <p>\u201cWith all my heart, Richard, yes,\u201d I add for emphasis, my voice suddenly wobbling. \u201cYou have to know how much this means to me. It\u2019s ... I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>His fingers squeeze mine, and it\u2019s as though we have our own private code. I almost feel sorry for other couples, who have to spell things out. They don\u2019t have the connection we do.</p><p>For a moment we\u2019re just silent. I can feel a cloud of happiness surrounding us. I want that cloud to stay there forever. I can see us now in the future, painting a house, wheeling a pram, decorating a Christmas tree with our little toddlers.... His parents might want to come and stay for Christmas, and that\u2019s fine, because I love his parents. In fact, the first thing I\u2019ll do when this is all announced is go and see his mother in Sussex. She\u2019ll adore helping with the wedding, and it\u2019s not as though I\u2019ve got a mother of my own to do it.</p><p>So many possibilities. So many plans. So much glorious life to live together.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say at last, gently rubbing his fingers. \u201cPleased? Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be more happy.\u201d He caresses my hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this for ages.\u201d I sigh contentedly. \u201cBut I never thought ... You just don\u2019t, do you? It\u2019s like ... what will it be like? What will it feel like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always remember this room. I\u2019ll always remember the way you\u2019re looking right now.\u201d I squeeze his hand even harder.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he says simply.</p><p>What I love about Richard is, he can convey so much with simply a sidelong look or a tilt of his head. He doesn\u2019t need to say much, because I can read him so easily.</p><p>I can see the long-haired girl watching us from across the room, and I can\u2019t help smiling at her. (Not a triumphant smile, because that would be insensitive. A humble, grateful smile.)</p><p>\u201cSome wine for the table, sir? Mademoiselle?\u201d The sommelier approaches and I beam up at him.</p><p>\u201cI think we need some champagne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolument.\u201d He smiles back at me. \u201cThe house champagne? Or we have a very nice Ruinart for a special occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the Ruinart.\u201d I can\u2019t resist sharing our joy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special day! We\u2019ve just got engaged!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle!\u201d The sommelier\u2019s face creases into a smile. \u201cF\u00e9licitations! Sir! Many congratulations!\u201d We both turn to Richard\u2014but to my surprise he\u2019s not entering into the spirit of the moment. He\u2019s staring at me as though I\u2019m some sort of specter. Why does he look so spooked? What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d His voice is strangled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I suddenly realize why he\u2019s upset. Of course. Trust me to spoil everything by jumping in.</p><p>\u201cRichard, I\u2019m so sorry. Did you want to tell your parents first?\u201d I squeeze his hand. \u201cI completely understand. We won\u2019t tell anyone else, promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them what?\u201d He\u2019s wide-eyed and starey. \u201cLottie, we\u2019re not engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d I look at him uncertainly. \u201cYou just proposed to me. And I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d He yanks his hand out of mine.</p><p>OK, one of us is going mad here. The sommelier has retreated tactfully, and I can see him shooing away the waiter with the bread basket, who was approaching again.</p><p>\u201cLottie, I\u2019m sorry, but I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Richard thrusts his hands through his hair. \u201cI haven\u2019t mentioned marriage or engagement, or anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut ... but that\u2019s what you meant!

It was beautiful!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m gazing at him, longing for him to agree, longing for him to feel what I feel. But he just looks baffled, and I feel a sudden pang of dread.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ... not what you meant?\u201d My throat is so tight I can barely speak. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie, I didn\u2019t propose!\u201d he says forcefully. \u201cFull stop!\u201d</p> <p>Does he have to exclaim so loudly? Heads are popping up with interest everywhere.</p><p>\u201cOK! I get it!\u201d I rub my nose with my napkin. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell the whole restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Waves of humiliation are washing over me. I\u2019m rigid with misery. How can I have got this so wrong?</p><p>And if he wasn\u2019t proposing, then why wasn\u2019t he proposing?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Richard is talking almost to himself. \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything, we\u2019ve never discussed it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said plenty!\u201d Hurt and indignation are erupting out of me. \u201cYou said you were organizing a \u2018special lunch.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is special!\u201d he says defensively. \u201cI\u2019m going to San Francisco tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you asked me if I liked your surname! Your surname, Richard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were doing a jokey straw poll at the office!\u201d Richard looks bewildered. \u201cIt was chitchat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said you had to ask me a \u2018big question.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big question.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cA question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard \u2018big question.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a wretched silence between us. The cloud of happiness has gone. The Hollywood Technicolor and swooping violins have gone. The sommelier tactfully slides a wine list onto the corner of the table and retreats quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I say at last. \u201cThis really important, medium-size question?\u201d</p><p>Richard looks trapped. \u201cIt\u2019s not important. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI was going to ask you what I should do with my air miles. I thought maybe we could plan a trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAir miles?\u201d I can\u2019t help lashing out. \u201cYou booked a special table and ordered champagne to talk about air miles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean ...\u201d Richard winces. \u201cLottie, I feel terrible about all this. I had absolutely zero idea\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we just had a whole bloody conversation about being engaged!\u201d I can feel tears rising. \u201cI was stroking your hand and saying how happy I was and how I\u2019d thought about this moment for ages. And you were agreeing with me! What did you think I was talking about?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes are swiveling as though searching for an escape. \u201cI thought you were ... you know. Going on about stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Going on about stuff\u2019?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Going on about stuff\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Richard looks even more desperate. \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t always know what you\u2019re on about,\u201d he says in a sudden confessional rush. \u201cSo sometimes I just ... nod along.\u201d</p><p>Nod along?</p><p>I stare back at him, stricken. I thought we had a special, unique silent bond of understanding. I thought we had a private code. And all the time he was just nodding along.</p><p>Two waiters put our salads in front of us and quickly move away, as though sensing we\u2019re not in any mood to talk. I pick up my fork and put it down again. Richard doesn\u2019t even seem to have noticed his plate.</p><p>\u201cI bought you an engagement ring,\u201d I say, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d He buries his head in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie ...\u201d He looks tortured. \u201cDo we have to ... I\u2019m going away tomorrow. Couldn\u2019t we just move away from the whole subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you ever want to get married?\u201d As I ask the question, I feel a deep anguish inside. A minute ago I thought I was engaged. I\u2019d run the marathon. I was bursting through the finishing tape, arms up in elation. Now I\u2019m back at the starting line, lacing up my shoes, wondering if the race is even on.</p><p>\u201cI ... God, Lottie ... I dunno.\u201d He sounds beleaguered. \u201cI mean, yes. I suppose so.\u201d His eyes are swiveling more and more wildly. \u201cMaybe. You know. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>Well. You couldn\u2019t get a much clearer signal. Maybe he wants to get married to someone else, one day. But not to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And suddenly a bleak despair comes over me. I believed with all my heart that he was The One. How could I have got it so wrong? I feel as though I can\u2019t trust myself on anything anymore.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I stare down at my salad for a few moments, running my eyes over leaves and slices of avocado and pomegranate seeds, trying to get my thoughts together. \u201cThe thing is, Richard, I do want to get married. I want marriage, kids, a house\u2014the whole bit. And I wanted them with you. But marriage is kind of a two-way thing.\u201d I pause, breathing hard but determined to keep my composure. \u201cSo I guess it\u2019s good that I know the truth sooner rather than later. Thanks for that, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie!\u201d says Richard in alarm. \u201cWait! This doesn\u2019t change anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything. I\u2019m too old to be on a waiting list. If it\u2019s not going to happen with us, then I\u2019d rather know now and move on. You know?\u201d I try to smile, but my happy muscles have stopped working. \u201cHave fun in San Francisco. I think I\u2019d better go.\u201d Tears are edging past my lashes. I need to leave, quickly. I\u2019ll go back to work and check on my presentation for tomorrow. I\u2019d taken the afternoon off, but what\u2019s the point? I won\u2019t be phoning all my friends with the joyful news after all.</p> <p>As I\u2019m making my way out, I feel a hand grabbing my arm. I turn in shock to see the blond girl with the beaded headband looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demands excitedly. \u201cDid he give you a ring?\u201d</p><p>Her question is like a knife stabbing in my heart. He didn\u2019t give me a ring and he isn\u2019t even my boyfriend anymore. But I\u2019d rather die than admit it.</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d I lift my chin proudly. \u201cActually, he proposed but I said \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her hand shoots to her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I catch the eye of the long-haired girl, who\u2019s eavesdropping blatantly at the next table. \u201cI said \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018No\u2019?\u201d She looks so incredulous that I feel a pang of indignation.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I glare at her defiantly. \u201cI said \u2018No.\u2019 We weren\u2019t right for each other after all, so I made the decision to end it. Even though he really wanted to marry me and have kids and a dog and everything ...\u201d</p><p>I can feel curious eyes on my back, and I swivel round to face yet more people listening agog. Is the whole bloody restaurant in on this now?</p><p>\u201cI said \u2018No\u2019!\u201d My voice is rising in distress. \u201cI said \u2018No.\u2019 No!\u201d I call over loudly to Richard, who is still sitting at the table, looking dumbfounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Richard. I know you\u2019re in love with me and I know I\u2019m breaking your heart right now. But the answer\u2019s no!\u201d</p><p>And, feeling a tiny bit better, I stride out of the restaurant.</p> <p>I get back to work to find my desk littered with new Post-its. The phone must have been busy while I was out. I slump down at my desk and heave a long, shuddering sigh. Then I hear a cough. Kayla, my intern, is hovering at the door of my tiny office. Kayla hovers round my door a lot. She\u2019s the keenest intern I\u2019ve ever met. She wrote me a two-sided Christmas card about how inspiring I was as a role model and how she would never have come to intern at Blay Pharmaceuticals if it wasn\u2019t for the talk I gave at Bristol University. (It was a pretty good talk, I must admit. As recruitment speeches for pharmaceutical companies go.)</p><p>\u201cHow was lunch?\u201d Her eyes are sparkling.</p><p>My heart plummets. Why did I tell her Richard was going to propose? I was just so confident. It gave me a kick, seeing her excitement. I felt like an all-round superwoman.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine. Fine. Nice restaurant.\u201d I start to riffle through the papers on my desk, as though searching for some vital piece of information.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you engaged?\u201d</p><p>Her words are like lemon juice sprinkled on sore skin. Has she no finesse? You don\u2019t ask your boss straight out, \u201cAre you engaged?\u201d Especially if she\u2019s not wearing a huge, brand-new ring, which clearly I\u2019m not. I might refer to this in my appraisal of her. Kayla has some trouble working within appropriate boundaries.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I brush down my jacket, playing for time, and swallowing the lump in my throat. \u201cActually, no. Actually, I decided against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She sounds confused.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod several times. \u201cAbsolutely. I concluded that for me at my time of life, at my career point, this wasn\u2019t a smart move.\u201d</p><p>Kayla looks poleaxed. \u201cBut ... you guys were so great together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, these things aren\u2019t as simple as they appear, Kayla.\u201d I riffle the papers more quickly.</p><p>\u201cHe must have been devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cYup. Pretty crushed. In fact ... he cried.\u201d</p><p>I can say what I like. She\u2019ll never see Richard again. I\u2019ll probably never see him again. And like a bludgeon to the stomach, the enormity of the truth hits me again. It\u2019s all over. Gone. All of it. I\u2019ll never have sex with him again. I\u2019ll never wake up with him again. I\u2019ll never hug him again. Somehow that fact, above all others, makes me want to bawl.</p> <p>\u201cGod, Lottie, you\u2019re so inspiring.\u201d Kayla\u2019s eyes are shining. \u201cTo know that something is wrong for your career, and to have the courage to make that stand, to say, \u2018No! I won\u2019t do what everyone expects.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I nod desperately. \u201cI was making a stand for women everywhere.\u201d</p><p>My jaw is trembling. I have to conclude this conversation right now, before things go horribly wrong in the bursting-into-tears-in-front-of-your-intern department.</p><p>\u201cSo, any vital messages?\u201d I scan the Post-its without seeing them.</p><p>\u201cOne from Steve about the presentation tomorrow, and some guy named Ben called.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Ben. He said you\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>No one calls himself \u201cJust Ben.\u201d It\u2019ll be some cheeky student I met at a recruiting seminar, trying to get a foot in the door. I\u2019m really not in the mood for it.</p><p>\u201cOK. Well. I\u2019m going to go over my presentation. So.\u201d I click busily and randomly at my mouse till she leaves. Deep breath. Firm jaw. Move on. Move on, move on, move on.</p><p>The phone rings and I pick it up with a sweeping, authoritative gesture.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Graveney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLottie! It\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>I fight an instinct to put the receiver straight back down again.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Fliss.\u201d I swallow. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... how are you?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the teasing note in her voice and curse myself bitterly. I should never have texted her from the restaurant.</p><p>It\u2019s pressure. All hideous pressure. Why did I ever share my love life with my sister? Why did I ever even tell her I was dating Richard? Let alone introduce them. Let alone start talking about proposals.</p><p>Next time I meet a man, I\u2019m saying nothing to anybody. Nada. Zip. Not until we\u2019ve been blissfully married for a decade and have three kids and have just renewed our wedding vows. Then, and only then, will I send a text to Fliss saying: Guess what? I met someone! He seems nice!</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I muster a breezy, matter-of-fact tone. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll good this end. So ...?\u201d</p><p>She leaves the question dangling. I know exactly what she means. She means, So, are you wearing a massive diamond ring and toasting yourself with Bollinger as Richard sucks your toes in some amazing hotel suite?</p><p>I feel a fresh, raw pang. I can\u2019t bear to talk about it. I can\u2019t bear her sympathy gushing over me. Find another topic. Any topic. Quick.</p><p>\u201cSo. Anyway.\u201d I try to sound bright and nonchalant. \u201cAnyway. Um. I was just thinking, actually. I really should get round to doing that master\u2019s on business theory. You know I\u2019ve always meant to do it. I mean, what am I waiting for? I could apply to Birkbeck, do it in my spare time.... What do you think?\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>FLISS</p><p>Oh God. I want to weep. It went wrong. I don\u2019t know how, but it went wrong.</p><p>Every time one of Lottie\u2019s relationships ends, she immediately talks about doing a master\u2019s degree. It\u2019s like a Pavlovian reaction.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could even go on to do a PhD, you know?\u201d she\u2019s saying, with only the tiniest shake in her voice. \u201cMaybe do some research abroad?\u201d</p><p>She might fool the average person\u2014but not me. Not her sister. She\u2019s in a bad way.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cYes. A PhD abroad. Good idea!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point in pressing her for details or asking bluntly what happened. Lottie has her own distinct process for dealing with breakups. You can\u2019t hurry her and you must not express any sympathy. I\u2019ve learned this the hard way.</p><p>There was the time she split up from Seamus. She arrived on my doorstep with a carton of Phish Food and bloodshot eyes and I made the elementary error of asking, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Whereupon she exploded like a grenade: \u201cJesus, Fliss! Can\u2019t I just come and share ice cream with my sister without getting the third bloody degree? Maybe I just want to hang out with my own sister. Maybe life isn\u2019t just about boyfriends. Maybe I just want to ... reassess my life. Do a master\u2019s degree.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then there was the time Jamie dumped her and I made the mistake of saying, \u201cOh God, Lottie, poor you.\u201d</p><p>She eviscerated me. \u201cPoor me? What do you mean, poor me? What, Fliss, you\u2019re pitying me because I don\u2019t have a man? I thought you were a feminist.\u201d She vented all her hurt on me in one long tirade, and by the end I practically needed an ear transplant.</p><p>So now I listen in silence as she talks about how she\u2019s been meaning to explore the more academic side of herself for ages, and a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate how cerebral she is, and her tutor entered her for a university prize, did I know that? (Yes, I did: she mentioned it straight after she broke up with Jamie.)</p><p>At last she tapers off into silence. I don\u2019t breathe. I think we might be getting to the nub of things.</p> <p>\u201cSo, by the way, Richard and I aren\u2019t together anymore,\u201d she says in a careless, dropping-something-from-the-tips-of-her-fingers manner.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I match her tone. We could be talking about a minor subplot in EastEnders.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. Well. That\u2019s a real ...\u201d I\u2019m running out of anodyne one-syllable words. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIn one way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, was he ...\u201d I\u2019m treading on eggshells here. \u201cI mean, weren\u2019t you ...\u201d</p><p>What the fuck went wrong when an hour ago he was in the middle of a bloody proposal? is what I want to demand.</p><p>I don\u2019t always trust Lottie\u2019s version of events. She can be a little starry-eyed. She can see what she wants to see. But, hand on heart, I believed as firmly as she did that Richard was planning to propose to her.</p><p>And now not only are they not engaged but they\u2019re over? I can\u2019t help feeling profoundly shocked. I\u2019ve got to know Richard pretty well, and he\u2019s a good\u2019un. The best she\u2019s ever dated, if you ask me. (Which she has, many times, often at midnight when she\u2019s drunk and interrupts before I\u2019ve finished to announce she loves him whatever I think.) He\u2019s sturdy, kind, successful. No chippiness, no baggage. Handsome but not vain. And in love with her. That\u2019s the main point. In fact, the only point. They\u2019ve got that vibe of successful couples. They\u2019ve got that connection. The way they talk, the way they joke, the way they sit together, always with his arm hooked gently around her shoulders, his fingers playing with her hair. The way they seem to be heading for the same things\u2014whether it\u2019s take-out sushi or a holiday in Canada. They have togetherness. You can just see it. At least, I can.</p> <p>Correction: I could. So why couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Bastard, stupid man. What exactly is he hoping to find in a partner? What exactly is wrong with my sister? Does he think she\u2019s holding him back from some great romance with a six-foot supermodel?</p><p>I let off steam by chucking a balled-up piece of paper aggressively into my bin. A moment later I realize I actually need that paper. Bugger.</p><p>The phone is still silent. I can feel Lottie\u2019s misery emanating down the line. Oh God, I can\u2019t bear this. I don\u2019t care how prickly she is, I have to know a bit more. It\u2019s insane. One minute they\u2019re getting married, the next we\u2019re on Stage One of Lottie\u2019s Breakup Process, do not pass Go.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said he had a \u2018big question\u2019?\u201d I say as tactfully as I can.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. He changed his story,\u201d she says in a determinedly nonchalant voice. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t a \u2018big question.\u2019 It was a \u2018question.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I wince. That\u2019s bad. A \u201cbig question\u201d isn\u2019t a variety of \u201cquestion.\u201d It\u2019s not even a subset.</p><p>\u201cSo what was the question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was about air miles, as it happens,\u201d she says, her voice flat.</p><p>Air miles? Ouch. I can imagine how that went down. Ian Aylward is at my office window, I suddenly notice. He\u2019s gesticulating energetically. I know what he wants. It\u2019s the speech for the awards ceremony tonight.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d I mouth, in a blatant lie, and point at my computer, trying to imply that mere technology is holding up its arrival. \u201cI\u2019ll email it. Email. It.\u201d</p><p>At last he walks away. I glance at my watch, and my heart ups its pace a little. I have precisely ten minutes to listen supportively to Lottie, write the rest of my speech, and touch up my makeup.</p><p>No, nine and a half minutes.</p><p>I feel yet another stab of resentment, directed straight at Richard. If he really had to break my sister\u2019s heart, could he have chosen a day which wasn\u2019t my most insanely busy of the whole year? I hurriedly pull up the speech document on my screen and start typing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In conclusion, I would like to thank everyone here tonight. Both those who have won awards and those who are gnashing their teeth furiously. I can see you! (Pause for laughter.)</p><p>\u201cLottie, you know it\u2019s our big awards event tonight,\u201d I say guiltily. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go in five. If I could come round, you know I would in a heartbeat....\u201d</p><p>Too late, I realize I\u2019ve made a heinous error. I\u2019ve expressed sympathy. Sure enough, she turns on me.</p><p>\u201cCome round?\u201d she spits scathingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come round! What, you think I\u2019m upset about Richard? You think my whole life revolves around one man? I wasn\u2019t even thinking about him. I only called to tell you about my plans for a master\u2019s degree. That was the only reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I backtrack. \u201cOf course it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s an exchange program in the States. Maybe I\u2019ll look at Stanford....\u201d</p><p>She carries on talking, and I type faster and faster. I\u2019ve given this speech six times before. It\u2019s just the same old words, every year, in a different order.</p><p>The hotel industry continues to innovate and inspire. I am awed at the accomplishments and innovations that we see in our industry.</p><p>No. Crap. I press delete and try again.</p> <p>I am awed at the accomplishments and advances that my team of reviewers and I have witnessed around the world.</p><p>Yes. \u201cWitnessed\u201d adds a nice touch of gravitas to the occasion. One could almost think we\u2019ve spent the year engaging with a series of holy prophets rather than with tanned PR girls in stilettos showing us the latest technology in poolside towel-chilling.</p><p>My thanks are due to Bradley Rose, as ever....</p><p>Do I thank Brad first? Or Megan? Or Michael?</p><p>I\u2019ll leave someone out. I know it. This is the law of the thank-you speech. You miss some vital person, then grab the microphone again and call out their name in a shrill voice, but no one\u2019s listening. Then you have to find them and spend a hideous half hour thanking them personally while you both smile but above their head in a thought bubble are floating the words: You forgot I exist.</p><p>My thanks are due to everyone who put this awards ceremony together, everyone who didn\u2019t put this awards ceremony together, my entire staff, all your staffs, all our families, all seven billion people on this planet, God/Allah/Other....</p> <p>\u201c... I actually see this as a positive. I really do, Fliss. This is my chance to reconfigure my life, you know? I mean, I needed this.\u201d</p><p>I drag my attention back to the phone. Lottie\u2019s refusal to admit that anything is wrong is one of her most endearing qualities. Her resolute bravery is so heartbreaking, it makes me want to hug her.</p><p>But it also slightly makes me want to tear my hair out. It makes me want to yell, Stop talking about bloody master\u2019s degrees! Just admit you\u2019re hurt!</p><p>Because I know how this goes. I\u2019ve been here before. Every breakup is the same. She starts off all brave and positive. She refuses to admit anything is wrong. She goes days, maybe weeks, without cracking, a smile lodged on her face, and people who don\u2019t know her say, \u201cWow, Lottie coped with the breakup really well.\u201d</p><p>Until the delayed reaction happens. Which it does, every time. In the form of some impulsive, outrageous, total fuckwit gesture which makes her feel euphoric for about five minutes. Each time, it\u2019s something different. A tattoo on her ankle; an extreme haircut; an overpriced flat in Borough that she then had to sell at a loss. Membership of a cult. An \u201cintimate\u201d piercing which went septic. That was the worst.</p><p>No, I take it back, the cult was the worst. They got six hundred pounds of her money and she was still talking about \u201cenlightenment.\u201d Evil, preying bastards. I think they circle London, sniffing out the newly dumped.</p><p>It\u2019s only after the euphoric period that Lottie finally, properly cracks. And then it\u2019s into the weeping and the days off work and \u201cFliss, why didn\u2019t you stop me?\u201d And \u201cFliss, I hate this tattoo!\u201d And \u201cFliss, how can I go to my GP? I\u2019m so embarrassed! What will I dooooo?\u201d</p><p>I privately call these post-breakup fuckwit actions her Unfortunate Choices, which is a phrase our mother used a lot while she was alive. It covered anything from a dodgy pair of shoes worn by a dinner-party guest to my father\u2019s eventual decision to shack up with a South African beauty queen. \u201cUnfortunate choice,\u201d she would murmur, with that glacial stare, and we children would shiver, thanking our lucky stars it wasn\u2019t us who had made Unfortunate Choices.</p> <p>I don\u2019t often miss my mother. But sometimes I wish there was another family member I could call on to help pick up the pieces of Lottie\u2019s life. My dad doesn\u2019t count. First of all, he lives in Johannesburg. And, second, if it\u2019s not a horse, or offering him a glass of whiskey, he\u2019s not interested in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, listening to Lottie babble on about sabbatical programs, my heart is sinking. I can sense another Unfortunate Choice looming. It\u2019s out there somewhere. I feel as though I\u2019m scanning the horizon, my hand shading my eyes, wondering where the shark will surface and grab her foot.</p><p>I wish she would just curse and rant and throw things. Then I could relax; the madness would be out of her system. When I broke up with Daniel, I swore obscenely for two solid weeks. It wasn\u2019t pretty. But at least I didn\u2019t join a cult.</p><p>\u201cLottie ...\u201d I rub my head. \u201cYou know I\u2019m off on holiday tomorrow for two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Her scathing tone returns. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a pizza and a nice bottle of wine tonight. I\u2019ve been meaning to do that for ages, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have a good one. Just don\u2019t drown the pain.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s another of our mother\u2019s sayings. I have a sudden memory of her in her pencil-slim white trouser suit and green glittery eye shadow. \u201cDrowning the pain, darlings.\u201d She\u2019d be sitting at the bar in that house we had in Hong Kong, cradling a martini while Lottie and I watched, in our matching pink dressing gowns flown out from England.</p><p>After she\u2019d gone out, we would intone the phrase to each other like some kind of religion. I thought it was a general toast like \u201cDown the hatch,\u201d and shocked a school friend many years later, at a family lunch, by raising my glass and saying, \u201cWell, drown the pain, everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Now we use it as a shorthand for \u201cgetting totally trashed in an embarrassing manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be drowning the pain, thank you,\u201d retorts Lottie, sounding offended. \u201cAnd, anyway, you should talk, Fliss.\u201d</p><p>I may have drunk a few too many vodkas after Daniel and I split up, and I may have made a long speech to an audience of curry-house diners. It\u2019s a fair point.</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d I sigh. \u201cTalk soon.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down, close my eyes, and give my brain about ten seconds to reboot and focus. I have to forget Lottie\u2019s love life. I have to concentrate on the awards ceremony. I have to finish my speech. Now. Go.</p><p>I open my eyes and swiftly type a list of people to thank. It goes on for ten lines, but better safe than sorry. I email it to Ian, headlined Speech! Urgent! and leap up from my desk.</p> <p>\u201cFliss!\u201d As I leave my office, Celia pounces on me. She\u2019s one of our most prolific freelancers and has the trademark crow\u2019s feet of the professional spa reviewer. You\u2019d think that the spa treatments would cancel out the sun damage, but I find it tends to be the other way around. They really should stop putting spas in Thailand. They should situate them in northern wintry countries with no daylight at all.</p><p>Hmm. Is there a piece in that?</p><p>I quickly type into my BlackBerry: Zero-daylight spa? then look up. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gruffalo is here. He looks livid.\u201d She swallows. \u201cMaybe I should leave.\u201d</p><p>The Gruffalo is the industry nickname for Gunter Bachmeier. He owns a chain of ten luxury hotels and lives in Switzerland and has a forty-inch waist. I knew he was invited tonight, but I assumed he wouldn\u2019t turn up. Not after our review of his new spa\u2013hotel in Dubai, the Palm Stellar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him it was me.\u201d Celia\u2019s voice is actually trembling.</p><p>\u201cCelia.\u201d I grip her by both shoulders. \u201cYou stand by your review, yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d I\u2019m willing some strength into her, but she looks terrified. It\u2019s amazing how someone who writes such savage, excoriating, witty prose can be so gentle and sensitive in the flesh.</p><p>Hmm. Is there a piece in that?</p><p>I type: Meet our reviewers in the flesh?? Profiles??</p><p>Then I delete it. Our readers don\u2019t want to meet the reviewers. They don\u2019t want to know that \u201cCBD\u201d lives in Hackney and is an accomplished poet on the side. They simply want to know that their massive slice of cash is going to buy them all the sunshine/snow, white beach/mountains, solitude/beautiful people, Egyptian cotton/hammocks, haute cuisine/expensive club sandwiches that they require of a five-star holiday.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows who \u2018CBD\u2019 is. You\u2019re safe.\u201d I pat her arm. \u201cI have to run.\u201d I\u2019m already striding down the corridor again. I head into the central atrium and look around. It\u2019s a large, airy, double-height hall\u2014the only impressive space at Pincher International\u2014and every year our overcrowded sub-editors suggest that it\u2019s converted into office space. But it comes into its own for the awards party. I scan the space, ticking off items in my head. Massive iced cake in shape of magazine cover, which no one will eat: check. Caterers setting out glasses: check. Table of trophies: check. Ian from IT is crouching by the podium, fiddling with the auto reader. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll OK?\u201d I hurry over.</p><p>\u201cGrand.\u201d He jumps up. \u201cI\u2019ve loaded the speech.

And what a year it\u2019s been.\u201d</p> <p>I can see from Ian\u2019s sardonic eyebrow that I\u2019m going to have to sound a bit more excited than that.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I say, and he grins. \u201cI have eighteen awards to present....\u201d</p><p>Which is far too many. Every year we have a stand-up battle over which ones to get rid of, and then we get rid of none.</p><p>\u201cBlah, blah ... OK, fine.\u201d I switch off the mike. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>As I hurry back down the corridor, I see Gavin, our publisher, at the far end. He\u2019s ushering an unmistakable forty-inch waist into the lift. As I\u2019m watching, the Gruffalo turns and flashes a menacing anti-smile at me. He holds up four stubby fingers and is still doing so as the doors close.</p> <p>I know what that means, and I\u2019m not going to be intimidated. So his new hotel got four stars from us instead of five. He should have created a better hotel. He should have invested in slightly more sand to lay on the concrete base of his \u201caward-winning, man-created beach\u201d and tried hiring slightly less pretentious staff.</p><p>I head into the Ladies\u2019, survey my reflection, and wince. Sometimes I\u2019m genuinely shocked at the version of me in the mirror. Do I look so unlike Angelina Jolie? When did those shadows appear under my eyes? Everything about me is too dark, I abruptly decide. My hair, my brows, my sallow skin. I need to get something bleached. Or maybe everything, all at once. There must surely be a spa somewhere that has an all-in-one bleaching tank. One quick dip; keep your mouth open for the teeth-whitening option.</p><p>Hmm. Is there a piece in that? I type Bleach? into my BlackBerry, then attack everything I can with brushes. Finally I apply a generous amount of Nars Red Lizard. One thing: I can damn well wear lipstick. Perhaps they\u2019ll put it on my grave. FELICITY GRAVENEY LIES HERE. SHE COULD DAMN WELL WEAR LIPSTICK.</p><p>I head out, glance at my watch, and press Daniel on speed dial as I walk. He\u2019ll know I\u2019m phoning now, we discussed the timing, he\u2019ll pick up, he has to pick up.... Go on, Daniel, pick up.... Where are you ...?</p><p>Voicemail.</p><p>Bastard.</p> <p>With Daniel, I am quite capable of going from calm to seething in 0\u201360.</p><p>The beep sounds and I draw breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there,\u201d I say with elaborate calmness, walking toward my office. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, because I have to be at this event soon, which you knew, because we discussed it. Several times.\u201d</p><p>My voice is shaking. I cannot allow him to get to me. Let it go, Fliss. Divorce is a process and this is a process and we\u2019re all part of the Tao. Or the Zen. Whatever. The thing in all those books I was given with the word \u201cDivorce\u201d on the cover above a circle or a picture of a tree.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cMaybe you can let Noah listen to this message? Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes briefly and remind myself I\u2019m not talking to Daniel anymore. I have to shift his repulsive face out of my mind. I\u2019m talking to the little face that lights up my life. The face that\u2014against pretty tall odds\u2014keeps the world making sense. I picture his shaggy fringe, his huge gray eyes, his school socks wrinkled around his ankles. Curled up on the sofa at Daniel\u2019s place, with Monkey under his arm.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I hope you\u2019re having a lovely time with Daddy. I\u2019ll see you soon, OK? I\u2019ll try calling later, but if I don\u2019t manage it, then night night and I love you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nearly at my office door now. I have stuff to do. But I can\u2019t help talking for as long as possible, till the beep tells me to go and get a life.</p> <p>\u201cNight night, sweetheart.\u201d I press the phone up against my cheek. \u201cHave lovely dreams, OK? Night night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight night,\u201d answers a familiar little voice, and I nearly trip over my party Manolos.</p><p>What was that? Am I hallucinating? Has he overridden the voicemail? I peer at my phone to make sure, give it a quick bash against my palm, and listen again.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHello! Hello-hello-hello ...\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. That voice isn\u2019t coming from the phone. It\u2019s coming from\u2014</p><p>I hurry round the corner into my office and there he is. My seven-year-old son. Sitting on the armchair I give to visitors.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d he yells in delight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I\u2019m almost speechless. \u201cNoah. You\u2019re here. At my office. That\u2019s just ... Daniel?\u201d I turn to my ex-husband, who is standing by the window, flicking through a past issue of the magazine. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I thought Noah would be having tea by now? At your place?\u201d I add with bright emphasis. \u201cAs we planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not,\u201d puts in Noah triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYes! I can see that, darling! So ... Daniel?\u201d My smile has spread right across my face. Generally the rule is: the more I smile at Daniel, the more I\u2019m feeling like stabbing him.</p><p>I can\u2019t help surveying his features with a critical eye, even though he has nothing to do with me anymore. He\u2019s gained a couple of pounds. New fine-stripe shirt. No hair product. That\u2019s a mistake; his hair looks too floppy and wispy now. Maybe Trudy likes it that way.</p> <p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d I try again.</p><p>Daniel says nothing, just shrugs easily, as though everything is obvious and words are superfluous. That shrug of his is new. It\u2019s a post-me shrug. When we were together, his shoulders were permanently hunched. Now he shrugs. He wears a Kabbalah bracelet under his suit. He bounces confrontation back like he\u2019s made of rubber. His sense of humor has been replaced by a sense of righteousness. He doesn\u2019t joke anymore: he pronounces.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe we used to have sex. I can\u2019t believe we produced Noah together. Maybe I\u2019m in The Matrix and I\u2019ll wake up to something which makes far more sense, like all this time I\u2019ve been lying in a tank attached to electrodes.</p><p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d My smile is fixed.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed Noah would spend tonight with you.\u201d He shrugs again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him, dumbfounded. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s your night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Frankfurt tonight. I sent you an email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t! You did not send me any email.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed I\u2019d drop Noah here.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s totally calm, as only Daniel can be. I, on the other hand, am about to have a nervous breakdown.</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d My voice is trembling with the effort of not smashing his head in. \u201cWhy would I have agreed to have Noah here tonight when I\u2019m hosting an awards ceremony? Why would I have done that?\u201d</p><p>Daniel shrugs again. \u201cI\u2019m about to go to the airport. He\u2019s had something to eat. Here\u2019s his overnight bag.\u201d He dumps Noah\u2019s rucksack on the floor. \u201cAll right, Noah? Mummy\u2019s going to have you tonight, lucky thing.\u201d</p><p>There is no way out of this.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I smile at Noah, who is eyeing the two of us anxiously. It breaks my heart to see worry in his huge eyes. No child of his age should ever worry about anything. \u201cWhat a treat for me!\u201d I ruffle his hair reassuringly. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019ll just be a moment....\u201d</p><p>I walk along the corridor to the Ladies\u2019. It\u2019s empty, which is a good thing, because I cannot contain myself any longer.</p><p>\u201cHE DID NOT SEND ME A FUCKING EMAIL!\u201d My voice rockets round the cubicles. I\u2019m panting as I meet my own eyes in the mirror. I feel about ten percent better. Enough to get through the evening.</p><p>I walk calmly back to the office, to see Daniel shrugging on his coat.</p> <p>\u201cWell, have a good trip or whatever.\u201d I sit down, unscrew my fountain pen, and write Congratulations! on the card for the bouquet which will be presented to the overall winner (that new spa\u2013resort in Marrakesh). With best wishes from Felicity Graveney and all the team.</p><p>Daniel is still in my office. I can sense him lurking. He has something to say.</p><p>\u201cYou still here?\u201d I lift my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust one other thing.\u201d He surveys me with that righteous expression again. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple more points to raise over the settlement.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m so stunned I can\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cWha-at?\u201d I manage to utter at last.</p><p>He cannot raise more points. We\u2019ve finished raising points. We\u2019re about to sign off. It\u2019s done. After a court case and two appeals and a million lawyers\u2019 letters. It\u2019s finished.</p><p>\u201cI was talking it over with Trudy.\u201d He does his hand-spreading again. \u201cShe raised some interesting issues.\u201d</p><p>No way. I want to thwack him. He does not get to talk about our divorce with Trudy. It\u2019s ours. If Trudy wants a divorce, she can marry him first. See how she likes that.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of points.\u201d He puts a wad of papers down on the desk. \u201cHave a read.\u201d</p><p>Have a read. As though he\u2019s recommending a good whodunit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d I feel like a kettle coming to the boil. \u201cYou can\u2019t start laying new stuff on me now. The divorce is done. We\u2019ve thrashed everything out already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely it\u2019s more important to get it right?\u201d</p><p>He sounds reproving, as though I\u2019m suggesting we go for a shoddy, ill-prepared divorce. One with no workmanship in it. Botched together with a glue gun instead of hand-sewn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with what we\u2019ve agreed,\u201d I say tightly, although \u201chappy\u201d is hardly the right word. \u201cHappy\u201d would have been not finding his draft love letters to another woman stuffed in his briefcase, where anyone searching for chewing gum might stumble on them.</p> <p>Love letters. I mean, love letters! I still can\u2019t believe he wrote love letters to another woman and not to his own wife. I can\u2019t believe he wrote explicit sexual poetry, illustrated by cartoons. I was genuinely shocked. If he\u2019d written those poems to me, maybe everything would have been different. Maybe I would have realized what a self-obsessed weirdo he was before we got married.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cPerhaps I have more of a long-term view. Maybe you\u2019re too close.\u201d</p><p>Too close? How can I be too close to my own divorce? Who is this rubber-faced, emotionally stunted idiot, and how did he get into my life? I\u2019m breathing so fast with frustration, I feel like if I rose from my desk now, I could give Usain Bolt a run for his money.</p><p>And then it happens. I don\u2019t exactly mean for it to happen. My wrist moves sharply and it\u2019s done, and there are six little ink spots in a trail on his shirt and a bubble of happiness inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Daniel looks down at his shirt and then up, his face aghast. \u201cIs that ink? Did you just flick your pen at me?\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Noah to see if he witnessed his mother\u2019s descent into infantile behavior. But he\u2019s lost in the far more mature world of Captain Underpants.</p><p>\u201cIt slipped,\u201d I say innocently.</p><p>\u201cIt slipped. Are you five years old?\u201d His face crumples into a scowl and he dabs at his shirt, smearing one of the ink spots. \u201cI could call my lawyer about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could discuss parental responsibility, your favorite subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d My mood suddenly sobers. I\u2019m tired of playing tit for tat. \u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d I look at our son, who is bent over his book, shaking with laughter at something. His shorts are rucked up, and on his knee is a face drawn in ballpoint pen with an arrow pointing to it and I AM A SUPERHERO printed in wobbly letters. How can Daniel bail out on him like this? He hasn\u2019t seen him for a fortnight; he never calls to chat with him. It\u2019s as if Noah is a hobby that he bought all the equipment for and reached an elementary level\u2014but then decided he\u2019s just not that into after all and maybe he should have gone for wall-climbing instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not,\u201d I repeat. \u201cI think you should go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even look up as he departs. I draw his stupid pile of papers to me, flick through them, too angry to read a word, then open a document on my computer and type furiously:</p><p>D arrives at office, leaving N with me with no notice, contravening agreement. Unhelpful manner. Wishes to raise more points regarding divorce settlement. Refuses to discuss reasonably.</p><p>I unclip my memory stick from its place on a chain round my neck and save the updated file to it. My memory stick is my comfort blanket. The whole dossier is on there: the whole sorry Daniel story. I replace it round my neck, then speed-dial Barnaby, my lawyer.</p><p>\u201cBarnaby, you won\u2019t believe it,\u201d I say as soon as his voicemail answers. \u201cDaniel wants to revisit the settlement again. Can you call me back?\u201d</p><p>Then I glance anxiously at Noah to see if he heard me. But he\u2019s chortling over something in his book. I\u2019ll have to hand him over to my PA; she\u2019s helped me out with emergency child-care before.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I stand up and ruffle his hair. \u201cLet\u2019s find Elise.\u201d</p><p>The thing about avoiding people at parties is, it\u2019s quite easy if you\u2019re hosting. You always have an excuse to move away from the conversation just as you see a forty-inch pink-striped shirt bearing down on you. (So sorry, I must greet the marketing manager of the Mandarin Oriental, back in a moment....)</p> <p>The party has been going for half an hour and I\u2019ve managed to avoid the Gruffalo completely. It helps that he\u2019s so massive and the atrium is so crowded. I\u2019ve made it appear totally natural that every time he gets within three feet I\u2019m striding away in the opposite direction, or out of the room completely, or, in desperation, into the Ladies\u2019.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. As I emerge from the Ladies\u2019, he\u2019s waiting for me. Gunter Bachmeier is actually standing in the corridor, staking out the door of the Ladies\u2019.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello, Gunter,\u201d I say smoothly. \u201cHow delightful to see you. I\u2019ve been meaning to catch up with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hef been avoiding me,\u201d he says in severe guttural tones.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Are you enjoying the party?\u201d I force myself to put a hand on his meaty forearm.</p> <p>\u201cYou hef traduced my new hotel.\u201d</p><p>He pronounces \u201ctraduced\u201d with a rich, rolling sound. \u201cTrrrraduced.\u201d I\u2019m quite impressed that he knows the word. I certainly wouldn\u2019t know the equivalent for \u201ctraduced\u201d in German. My German extends to \u201cTaxi, bitte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunter, you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d I smile pleasantly. \u201cA four-star review is hardly ... traducement.\u201d Traduction? Traducedom? \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my reviewer found herself unable to allot you five stars\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hef not reviewed my hotel yourself.\u201d He\u2019s bristling with anger. \u201cYou hef sent an amateur. You hef treated me with disrrrrespect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I hef not!\u201d I retort before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean hev. Have.\u201d My face is flaming. \u201cHave not.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t mean to do that; I just have a terrible parrot habit. I mimic voices and accents without intending to. Now Gunter is glaring at me even more viciously.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, Felicity?\u201d Gavin, our publisher, comes bustling up. I can see his radar twitching and I know why. Last year, the Gruffalo shelled out for twenty-four double-page spreads. The Gruffalo is keeping us in business. But I can\u2019t give his hotel a five-star review simply because he bought some ads. A five-star review in Pincher Travel Review is a very big deal.</p><p>\u201cI was just explaining to Gunter that I sent one of our top freelancers to review his hotel,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he wasn\u2019t happy, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should hef gone yourrrself.\u201d Gunter spits the words dismissively. \u201cWherrrre is your crrrredibility, Felicity? Wherrre is your rrrreputation?\u201d</p><p>As he stalks off, I secretly feel a bit shaken. As I lift my eyes to Gavin, my heart is pumping.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d I try to sound lighthearted. \u201cWhat an overreaction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you cover the Palm Stellar?\u201d Gavin is frowning. \u201cYou review all major launches. That\u2019s always been the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to send Celia Davidson,\u201d I say brightly, avoiding the question. \u201cShe\u2019s a great writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you cover the Palm Stellar?\u201d he repeats, as though he hasn\u2019t heard me.</p><p>\u201cI had some stuff going on with ... with ...\u201d I clear my throat, unwilling to say the word. \u201cSome personal stuff.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Gavin suddenly comprehends. \u201cYour divorce?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to answer. I twist my watch round my wrist, as though suddenly interested in the mechanism.</p><p>\u201cYour divorce?\u201d His voice sharpens ominously. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks are burning with embarrassment. I know my divorce has taken on epic, Lord of the Rings\u2013style proportions. I know it\u2019s taken up more of my working time than it should have. I know I keep promising Gavin that it\u2019s all done and dusted.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not like I have a choice. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s fun.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to a specialist barrister based in Edinburgh,\u201d I admit at last. \u201cI had to fly up there; his schedule was really busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicity.\u201d Gavin beckons me to one side of the corridor, and at the sight of his tight-lipped smile, my stomach turns over. That\u2019s the smile he wears to cut salaries and budgets and tell people their magazine is unfortunately being axed, could they please leave the building? \u201cFelicity, no one could be more sympathetic to your plight than me. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s such a liar. What does he know about divorce? He has a wife and a mistress, and neither of them seems to mind about the other.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gavin,\u201d I feel obliged to say.</p><p>\u201cBut you cannot let your divorce get in the way of your job or the reputation of Pincher International,\u201d he raps out. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, for the first time, I feel genuinely nervous. I know from experience that Gavin starts invoking the \u201creputation of Pincher International\u201d when he\u2019s thinking of firing someone. It\u2019s a warning.</p><p>I also know from experience, the only way to deal with him is to refuse to admit anything.</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d I draw myself up as tall as possible and affect a dignified air. \u201cLet me make one thing quite clear.\u201d I pause, as though I\u2019m David Cameron at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. \u201cQuite clear. If there\u2019s one thing I never, ever do, it\u2019s let my personal life compromise my job.

Argh!\u201d</p><p>In my agitation, I\u2019ve pressed some button on the Nerf gun, and it\u2019s spraying more bullets out, like something out of Reservoir Dogs, hitting Gavin in the chest. I\u2019m massacring my boss with an automatic weapon flashes through my mind. This won\u2019t look good in my appraisal. The stream of bullets rises to his face and he splutters in horror.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I drop the gun on the floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shoot....\u201d</p><p>With a shudder, I notice Gunter, ten feet away. There are three orange Nerf bullets lodged in his tufty white hair and one in his drink.</p><p>\u201cGavin.\u201d I swallow. \u201cGavin. I don\u2019t know what to say\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Elise interrupts me hastily. \u201cI was looking after Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he shouldn\u2019t have been at the office,\u201d I point out. \u201cSo it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>We turn to Gavin as though waiting for his verdict. He\u2019s just staring at the scene, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cPersonal life. Job.\u201d He meshes his hands together. \u201cFliss, you need to sort yourself out.\u201d</p><p>My face is hot with mortification as I frog-march a protesting Noah to my office.</p><p>\u201cBut I was winning!\u201d he keeps complaining.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Elise is clutching her head. \u201cHe said it was his favorite game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I shoot her a smile. \u201cNoah, we don\u2019t play with Nerf guns at Mummy\u2019s office. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and find him something to eat,\u201d says Elise. \u201cFliss, you need to get back to the party, quick. Go. Now. It\u2019ll be fine. C\u2019mon, Noah.\u201d</p><p>She hustles Noah out of the room and I feel every cell of my body sag.</p><p>She\u2019s right. I need to hurry back, sweep in, gather up the Nerf bullets, apologize, charm, and turn this evening back into the slick professional affair it always is.</p><p>But I\u2019m so tired. I feel like I could go to sleep right now. The carpet under my desk looks like the perfect place for me to curl up.</p><p>I sink down on my chair, just as the phone rings. I\u2019ll take this one call. Maybe it will be some uplifting piece of news.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFelicity? Barnaby here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Barnaby.\u201d I sit up, feeling freshly galvanized. \u201cThanks for ringing back. You won\u2019t believe what Daniel just did. He\u2019d agreed to have Noah tonight, but then he left me in the lurch. And now he says he wants to revisit the settlement! We might end up back in court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, calm down. Chill out.\u201d Barnaby\u2019s unhurried Mancunian tones greet me. I do often wish Barnaby spoke a bit more quickly. Especially as I\u2019m paying him by the hour. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you. But you mustn\u2019t stress. Try to forget about it.\u201d</p><p>Is he kidding?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve written the incident up. I can email it to you.\u201d I finger my memory stick on its chain. \u201cShall I do that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, I\u2019ve told you, you don\u2019t need to keep a dossier of every single incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to! I mean, talk about \u2018unreasonable behavior.\u2019 If we put all this into the case, if the judge knew what he was like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge does know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, you\u2019re having the Divorce Fantasy,\u201d says Barnaby tranquilly. \u201cWhat have I told you about the Divorce Fantasy?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I hate the way Barnaby can read my mind. I\u2019ve known him since college, and although he costs a bomb even on mates\u2019 rates, I never considered going to anyone else. Now he\u2019s waiting for me to answer, like a teacher in class.</p><p>\u201cThe Divorce Fantasy will never happen,\u201d I mumble finally, staring at my fingernails.</p><p>\u201cThe Divorce Fantasy will never happen,\u201d he repeats with emphasis. \u201cThe judge will never read a two-hundred-page dossier on Daniel\u2019s shortcomings aloud in court, while a crowd jeers at your ex-husband. He will never start his summing up, \u2018Ms. Graveney, you are a saint to have put up with such an evil scumbag and I thus award you everything you want.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t help coloring.

Or are you still expecting him to wake up one day and realize all the bad things he\u2019s done? Because you have to understand, Daniel will never realize anything. He\u2019ll never confess to being a terrible human being. I could spend a thousand hours on this case, it would still never happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so unfair.\u201d I can feel a ball of frustration. \u201cHe is a terrible human being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s a shit. So don\u2019t dwell on him. Flush him out of your life. Gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as that,\u201d I mutter after a pause. \u201cHe is the father of my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Barnaby more gently. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was easy.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while. I stare at my office clock, watching the crappy plastic hand tick round. At last I slump right down, resting my head in the crook of my elbow.</p> <p>\u201cGod, divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce, eh,\u201d says Barnaby. \u201cMan\u2019s greatest invention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could just ... I dunno.\u201d I sigh heavily. \u201cWave a magic wand and our marriage never happened. Except Noah. I\u2019d keep Noah and the rest would all be a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an annulment, that\u2019s what you want,\u201d says Barnaby cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cAn annulment?\u201d I stare at the phone suspiciously. \u201cIs that a real thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal enough. It means the contract is null and void. The marriage never existed. You\u2019d be amazed how many clients ask for one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould I get one?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m seized by this idea. Maybe there\u2019s some cheap, easy way round this I haven\u2019t seen before. \u201cAnnulment.\u201d Null and void. I like the sound of that a lot. Why didn\u2019t Barnaby mention this before?</p><p>\u201cNot unless Daniel was a bigamist,\u201d says Barnaby. \u201cOr forced you into marriage. Or you never consummated it. Or one of you was mentally unfit at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d I say at once. \u201cI was crazy to even think of marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWon\u2019t wash, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>My spark of hope slowly dies away. Damn. I wish Daniel had been a bigamist now. I wish some original wife in a Mormon bonnet would pop up and say, I got there first! and save me all this trouble.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to stick with the divorce,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThanks, Barnaby. I\u2019d better go before you charge me another thirty thousand pounds just for saying hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right.\u201d Barnaby never sounds remotely offended, whatever I say. \u201cBut before you do, you\u2019re still going to France, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Noah and I are heading off for two weeks to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s our Easter holiday. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m reviewing three hotels, six restaurants, and a theme park. I\u2019ll be working on my laptop every night till late, but I can\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cI contacted my old mate Nathan Forrester. The one I told you about? Based in Antibes? You two should meet up while you\u2019re there, have a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel my spirits lift. \u201cOK. That sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll email you the details. He\u2019s a nice guy. Plays too much poker, but don\u2019t hold that against him.\u201d</p><p>A poker-playing resident of the South of France. Sounds intriguing. \u201cI won\u2019t. Thanks, Barnaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Bye, Fliss.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down and it immediately rings again. Barnaby must have forgotten some point or other.</p><p>\u201cHi, Barnaby?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, except for some rather fast, rather heavy breathing. Hmm. Has Barnaby inadvertently pressed redial while snogging his secretary? But even as I\u2019m thinking this, I know who it is really. I recognize that breathing. And I can hear Macy Gray\u2019s \u201cI Try\u201d faintly in the background: a classic Lottie breakup soundtrack.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I try again. \u201cLottie?

She bought him a ring?</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of ring?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking. I imagine her presenting Richard with some sparkly sapphire in a box.</p><p>Please don\u2019t say she presented him with a sparkly sapphire in a box.</p> <p>\u201cJust, you know.\u201d She sniffs defensively. \u201cA ring. A manly engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>A manly engagement ring? No. Uh-uh. Doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cLotts,\u201d I begin tactfully. \u201cAre you sure Richard is the engagement-ring type? I mean, could that have put him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing to do with the ring!\u201d She erupts into sobs again. \u201cHe never even saw the ring!

I don\u2019t mean to have a meltdown....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. What else am I here for?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s awful to hear her so upset. Of course it is. Ghastly.

This is progress.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve decided what to do, and I feel so much better. It\u2019s all fallen into place, Fliss.\u201d She blows her nose noisily. \u201cI feel like I have a purpose. A plan. A goal.\u201d</p><p>My ears twitch. Uh-oh. A \u201cgoal.\u201d That\u2019s one of my post-breakup alarm-bell terms.

So ... um ... what\u2019s your goal?\u201d</p><p>My mind is already scurrying around the possibilities. Please not another piercing. Or another crazy property purchase. I\u2019ve talked her out of quitting her job so many times, it can\u2019t be that again, surely?</p><p>Please not move to Australia.</p><p>Please not \u201close a stone.\u201d Because 1) she\u2019s skinny already, and 2) last time she went on a diet, she made me be her \u201cbuddy\u201d and instructed me to phone up every half hour and say, \u201cKeep to the plan, you fat bitch,\u201d then complained when I refused.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what is it?\u201d I press her as lightly as I can, my entire body screwed up with dread.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fly to San Francisco on the first flight I can get and surprise Richard and propose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I nearly drop the phone. \u201cNo! Bad idea!\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s she planning to do, burst into his office? Wait on his doorstep? Kneel down and present him with the so-called \u201cmanly\u201d engagement ring? I can\u2019t let this happen. She\u2019ll be utterly humiliated and devastated and I\u2019ll have to pick up the pieces afterward.</p><p>\u201cBut I love him!\u201d She sounds totally hyper. \u201cI love him so much! And if he can\u2019t see that we\u2019re meant to be together, then surely I have to show him! Surely it has to be me who makes the move! I\u2019m on the Virgin Atlantic website right now. Should I get premium economy? Can you get me a discount?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!

I can practically see her hearts-and-flowers image of proposing to Richard on the Golden Gate Bridge melting away.</p><p>\u201cThink about it first, at least,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t jump in. A few weeks won\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m holding my breath, crossing my fingers.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Lottie at last, sounding forlorn. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>I blink in astonishment. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve actually done it! For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve headed off one of Lottie\u2019s Unfortunate Choices before it even happened. I\u2019ve stamped out the infection before it could take hold.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s getting more rational in her old age.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out to lunch,\u201d I suggest, to cheer her up. \u201cMy treat.

No, not all men. Maybe all men except various honorable exceptions, viz: Barnaby; my lovely milkman, Neville; the Dalai Lama, obviously\u2014</p><p>My eyes suddenly focus on my reflection in my computer screen and I lean forward in horror. I have a Nerf bullet stuck in my hair.</p><p>Great.</p><p>3</p> <p>LOTTIE</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep all night.</p><p>People say that, and what they mean is: I woke up a few times, made a cup of tea, and went back to bed. But I really didn\u2019t sleep all night. I counted every hour going past.</p><p>By one A.M. I\u2019d decided that Fliss is totally, utterly wrong. By one-thirty I\u2019d found myself a flight to San Francisco. By two A.M. I\u2019d written the perfect, loving, and passionate proposal speech, including lines by Shakespeare, Richard Curtis, and Take That. By three A.M. I\u2019d filmed myself making it (eleven takes). By four A.M. I\u2019d watched myself and realized the horrible truth: Fliss is right. Richard will never say yes. He\u2019ll just get freaked out. Especially if I make that speech. By five A.M. I\u2019d eaten all the Pralines &amp; Cream. By six A.M. I\u2019d eaten all the Phish Food. And now I\u2019m slumped on a plastic chair, feeling nauseous and regretting the lot of it.</p><p>A tiny part of me still wonders if by walking out on Richard I made the biggest mistake of my life. If I\u2019d hung on, bitten my tongue and never mentioned marriage, might our relationship have worked out? Somehow?</p><p>But the rest of me is more rational. People say that women work on intuition and men on logic, but they\u2019re talking rubbish. I studied logic at university, thank you very much. I know how it goes. A=B, B=C, therefore A=C. And what could be more logical than the following detached and succinct argument?</p><p>Premise one: Richard has no intention of proposing to me; he made that fairly clear.</p><p>Premise two: I want marriage and commitment and, hopefully, one day, a baby.</p> <p>Conclusion: Therefore I am not destined to be with Richard. Therefore I need to be with someone else.</p><p>Other conclusion: Therefore I did the right thing, breaking up with him.</p><p>Further conclusion: Therefore I need to find another man, who does want to make a life with me and doesn\u2019t get that wide-eyed, starey look at the very mention of marriage, like it\u2019s such a terrifying idea. Someone who realizes that if someone spends three years with you, maybe they are thinking of commitment and kids and a dog, and ... and ... decorating a Christmas tree together ... and why is that such a bad thing? Why is it so totally and utterly off the agenda and unmentionable? When everyone says we\u2019re such a great couple and we\u2019ve been so happy together, and even your own mother was hinting that we might end up living near them, Richard?</p><p>OK, so maybe not that succinct. Or detached.</p><p>I take a sip of coffee, trying to soothe my nerves. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m being as calm and logical as one could expect in the circumstances, which are that I had to catch the 7:09 to Birmingham on no sleep and all the Metros had already gone.

And I reassure them that they\u2019ll get looked after and their career will be an exciting one and they\u2019re not selling out.</p><p>\u201cBiscuit?\u201d Steve offers me a chocolate bourbon.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I shudder. I\u2019ve already crammed enough trans fats and food additives into my body.</p><p>Maybe I should go to some hard-core boot camp. Everyone says running changes their life and gives them a new outlook. I should go to some retreat where all you do is run and drink isotonic drinks. In the mountains. Or the desert. Something really tough and challenging.</p> <p>Or do Iron Woman. Yes.</p><p>I reach for my BlackBerry and am about to Google hard-core running camp iron woman when the careers officer appears round the door. We haven\u2019t been to this particular college before, so I hadn\u2019t met Deborah before today. Quite frankly, she\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never met anyone so tense and jumpy.</p><p>\u201cAll OK? We\u2019ll start in about ten minutes. Keep it quite brief, I would.\u201d She\u2019s nodding nervously. \u201cQuite brief. Nice and brief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to chat to the students afterward,\u201d I say, hefting a pile of \u201cWhy Work at Blay Pharmaceuticals?\u201d brochures out of my canvas bag.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Her eyes are darting about. \u201cWell ... as I say, I\u2019d keep it nice and brief.\u201d</p> <p>I feel tempted to snap at her, We\u2019ve come all the way from London for this! For God\u2019s sake. Most careers officers are delighted we\u2019ll take questions.</p><p>\u201cSo, normal pattern?\u201d I say to Steve. \u201cMe, you, clip one, me, you, clip two, questions?\u201d He nods, and I hand the DVD to Deborah. \u201cI\u2019ll cue you. It\u2019ll be pretty obvious.\u201d</p><p>The recruitment DVD is the worst bit about our presentation. It was shot like a 1980s music video, with bad lighting and bad electronic music and people with bad haircuts looking awkward as they pretend to have a meeting. But it cost a hundred grand, so we have to use it.</p><p>Deborah disappears to set up the DVD and I lean back in my chair, trying to relax. But my hands keep twisting together. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Everything feels so crap. Where am I going in life? Where am I heading? What am I doing?</p><p>And this is not about Richard, by the way. It\u2019s absolutely unrelated. It\u2019s simply my life. I need ... I don\u2019t know. A new direction. A different energy.</p><p>There\u2019s a book lying on a nearby chair and I reach for it. It\u2019s called The Reverse Principle: Change Your Business Strategy Forever, and 10 million copies sold!! is stamped across the cover.</p> <p>I feel a stab of frustration at myself. Why don\u2019t I read more business books? This is where my life has gone wrong. I haven\u2019t put enough effort into my career. I flip through, trying to absorb the information as quickly as I can. There are lots of diagrams with arrows traveling one way, then flipping over and going the opposite way. Clearly the message is: reverse the arrow. Well, I got that in about two seconds. I must be a natural.</p><p>Maybe I should read all these books and become an expert. Maybe I should go to Harvard Business School. I have a sudden image of myself in a library, cramming my brain full of business principles. Coming back to England to run a FTSE 100 company. My world would be one of ideas and strategy. Cerebral, high-level thought.</p><p>I\u2019m just Googling Harvard overseas students when Deborah reappears.</p><p>\u201cSo, the students should be assembled by now,\u201d she gulps, sounding desperate.</p><p>\u201cOh, OK.\u201d I drag my attention back to her. What on earth is her problem? Maybe she\u2019s new. Maybe this is her first-ever recruitment presentation and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so twitchy.</p><p>I refresh my lip gloss, trying to avoid the sight of my bloodshot eyes. Looking suicidal, Deborah disappears through the double doors onto the stage. I can hear her indistinct voice rising above the hubbub. After a few moments there\u2019s a round of applause, and I nudge Steve, who\u2019s just bitten into a croissant. Typical.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019re on!\u201d</p><p>As I stride onto the little stage and see our audience, I can\u2019t help doing a double take.</p> <p>Recruiting for a science company, you get used to students who shamble in, hair unwashed, unshaved, with bags under their eyes. But this lot are stunning. There\u2019s a whole cluster of immaculate girls at the front, with long shiny hair, manicured nails, and full makeup. Behind them is a group of super-fit guys, their T-shirts bulging with muscles. I can\u2019t speak for astonishment. What kind of labs do they have here? Ones with treadmills incorporated? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey look great!\u201d I murmur encouragingly to Deborah. \u201cTop marks for presentation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... we do advise them to make an effort,\u201d she says, reddening before she hurries off. I glance over at Steve, who is peering at the beautiful girls as if he can hardly believe his luck.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, everyone!\u201d I head to the front of the stage. \u201cThanks for coming today. My name is Lottie Graveney, and I\u2019m here to talk to you about choosing a career at Blay Pharmaceuticals. You\u2019ll know us best for the range of global brands we sell at the pharmacy, from our Placidus range of painkillers to our bestselling Sincero baby cream. But a career with us is so much more than that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting career.\u201d Steve practically elbows me out of the way. \u201cYes, it\u2019ll challenge you, but it\u2019ll thrill you. We\u2019re working right at the edge of pioneering research and we want to take you on that roller coaster with us.\u201d</p> <p>I glare at him. He\u2019s tragic. First of all, that\u2019s not the script. Second, where has that fake \u201csexy\u201d voice come from? Third, he\u2019s now rolling up his sleeves, as though he\u2019s some sort of rugged, pharmaceutical-research version of Indiana Jones. He really shouldn\u2019t. His forearms are all white and veiny.</p><p>\u201cIf you want an adventure in life ...\u201d He pauses for effect and practically growls, \u201cThen this is the place to start.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s homed in on a girl in the front row, whose white shirt is unbuttoned to reveal a deep, tanned cleavage. She has long blond hair and big blue eyes and seems to be scribbling down every word he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s show the DVD, Steve,\u201d I say brightly, dragging him away before he actually drools over her. The lights dim and our first DVD clip starts rolling on the screen behind us.</p><p>\u201cBright lot,\u201d whispers Steve as he sits down beside me. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p> <p>Impressed by what? Her bra size?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know if they\u2019re bright yet,\u201d I point out. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see it in the eyes,\u201d Steve says airily. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this game long enough to know potential when I see it. That fair-haired girl in the front row looks very promising. Very promising. We should talk to her about the scholarship program. Scoop her up before any of the other pharmaceutical companies get to her.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. He\u2019ll be offering her a six-figure contract next.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give them all information about the scholarship program,\u201d I say severely. \u201cAnd maybe you could try not to address every remark to her boobs?\u201d</p><p>The lights come up and Steve strides center stage, pushing his sleeves up still farther, as though he\u2019s about to split some lumber and single-handedly construct a cabin with it.</p> <p>\u201cLet me share with you a few of the newest advances we\u2019ve made and those we hope to make in the future. Maybe with your help.\u201d He twinkles at the blond girl, and she smiles back politely.</p><p>Onto the screen comes a picture of a complicated molecule.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll all be familiar with onium-poly hydrogen fluorides....\u201d Steve gestures at the screen with a pointer, then stops. \u201cBefore I continue, it would be useful to know what you\u2019re studying.\u201d He looks around. \u201cThere\u2019ll be biochemists here, obviously\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they study!\u201d Deborah cuts him off sharply before anyone can answer. To my surprise, she\u2019s leapt up out of her seat and is heading toward the stage. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they study, surely?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s as tense as a spring. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a useful guide,\u201d explains Steve. \u201cIf all the biochemists could raise their hands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you take students from all subjects.\u201d She cuts him off. \u201cYou say so in your materials. So it\u2019s irrelevant, surely?\u201d</p><p>She looks panicky. I knew something was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cAny biochemists at all?\u201d Steve is looking at the silent room, baffled. Normally, at least half our audience is biochemists.</p><p>Deborah is ashen. \u201cCould we have a word?\u201d she says at last, and beckons us desperately to one side. \u201cI\u2019m afraid ...\u201d Her voice trembles. \u201cThere was an error. I sent the email to the wrong set of students.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s it. She\u2019s left out the biochemists. What an idiot. But she looks so upset, I decide to be kind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very open-minded,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cWe\u2019re not only interested in biochemists. We also recruit graduates in physics, biology, business studies.... What are these students studying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s silence. Deborah is furiously chewing her lips.</p><p>\u201cBeauty,\u201d she mutters at last. \u201cMost are trainee makeup artists. And some are dancers.\u201d</p><p>Makeup artists and dancers?</p><p>I\u2019m so flummoxed I can\u2019t reply. No wonder they\u2019re all so stunning and fit. I catch a glimpse of Steve\u2014and he looks so gutted I suddenly want to giggle.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d I say innocently. \u201cSteve thought this seemed a very promising bunch. He wanted to offer them all scientific research scholarships. Didn\u2019t you, Steve?\u201d</p><p>Steve scowls evilly at me and rounds on Deborah. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on? Why are we giving a lecture on a career in pharmaceutical research to a room full of bloody makeup artists and dancers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Deborah looks like she wants to weep. \u201cBy the time I realized what I\u2019d done, it was too late. I\u2019ve been set a target of attracting more blue-chip companies, and you\u2019re such a prestigious firm, I couldn\u2019t bear to cancel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone here want to work in pharmaceutical research?\u201d Steve addresses the room.</p><p>No one raises their hand. I don\u2019t know if I want to laugh or cry. I got up at six A.M. to be here. Not that I\u2019d been asleep, but still.</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d Steve sounds like he\u2019s going to explode.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go to ten career seminars to get our career-search credit,\u201d says a girl with a bobbing ponytail.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Steve picks up his jacket from his chair. \u201cI do not have time for this.\u201d As he stalks out of the auditorium, I feel like doing the same thing myself. I\u2019ve never met anyone as incompetent as Deborah in my life.</p><p>But, on the other hand, there\u2019s still a roomful of students watching me. They all still need a career, even if it\u2019s not in pharmaceutical research. And I\u2019ve come all the way from London. I\u2019m not just turning round and going home.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I take the remote from Deborah, flip off the DVD, and walk center stage. \u201cLet\u2019s start again. I don\u2019t work in the beauty industry or the dance industry. So there\u2019s not much point me advising you on that. But I do employ people. So, how about I try to give some general advice? Do you have any questions for me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Then a girl in a leather jacket hesitantly lifts her hand.</p> <p>\u201cCould you look at my CV and tell me if it\u2019s any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Good idea. Anyone else want me to look at theirs?\u201d</p><p>A forest of arms shoots up. I\u2019ve never seen such a well-manicured selection of hands in my life.</p><p>\u201cOK. Form a line. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, I\u2019ve scanned the CVs of about thirty students. (If Deborah is their CV adviser, then Deborah should be fired. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.) I\u2019ve done a Q and A session on pensions and tax returns and self-employment law. I\u2019ve shared all the advice I think might help these guys. And in return I\u2019ve learned a lot about many areas I was totally ignorant of, such as: 1) How you make someone look wounded in a movie; 2) which actress currently filming in London seems really sweet but is actually a total bitch to her makeup artist; and 3) how you do a grand jet\u00e9 (I failed on that one).</p><p>Now I\u2019ve opened the floor to any subject at all, and a pale girl with pink streaky hair is speaking about the cost of shellac and how difficult it is to make the margins work if you want to open your own salon. I\u2019m listening and trying to make helpful comments, but my attention keeps being drawn to another girl, sitting in the second row. Her eyes are red-rimmed and she hasn\u2019t said a word, but she keeps fingering her phone and blowing her nose and dabbing her tissue to her eyes.</p><p>There was one moment during the Q and A when I could have done with a tissue myself. I was talking about vacation benefits, and it brought all my anguish back in a whoosh. I\u2019d been saving up vacation myself. Three weeks\u2019 worth. I thought I\u2019d be needing it for a honeymoon. I\u2019d even found this amazing place in St. Lucia\u2014</p><p>No, Lottie. Don\u2019t go there. Move on. Move on, move on. I blink hard and refocus on the girl with pink hair.</p> <p>\u201c... do you think I should focus on brows?\u201d she\u2019s saying, looking anxious.</p><p>Oh God, I wasn\u2019t listening properly. How did we get on to brows? I\u2019m about to ask her to recap her main points for the benefit of the room (always a good way out) when the girl in the second row gives a massive sob. I can\u2019t ignore her anymore.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say gently, waving to attract her attention. \u201cExcuse me. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy\u2019s had a breakup.\u201d Her friend puts a protective arm round her. \u201cCan she be excused?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I say. \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will she still get the credit?\u201d chimes in another friend anxiously. \u201cBecause she\u2019s already failed one module.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all his fault,\u201d says the first friend viciously, and about ten girls nod in agreement, murmuring things like \u201cIt so is\u201d and \u201cTosser\u201d and \u201cHe can\u2019t do a smoky eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were together for two years.\u201d The pale girl gives another sob. \u201cTwo whole years. I did half his coursework for him. And now he\u2019s all like, \u2018I need to focus on my career.\u2019 I thought he wanted to be with meeee....\u201d She dissolves into prolonged weeping and I stare at her, tears starting to my eyes. I know her pain. I know it.</p> <p>\u201cOf course you\u2019ll get the credit,\u201d I say warmly. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll give you a special mention for turning up when you\u2019re clearly in mental distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Cindy gives me a watery smile. \u201cWill you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to listen to me, OK? You have to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a gathering urge to speak off-topic. To convey a universal truth, not about pensions, not about tax breaks, but about love. Or not-love. Or whatever limbo place we\u2019re both in. I know it\u2019s not in my remit, but this girl needs to know. She needs to know. My heart is beating strongly. I feel noble and inspirational, like Helen Mirren or Michelle Obama.</p><p>\u201cLet me say one thing to you,\u201d I begin. \u201cWoman to woman. Professional to professional. Human being to human being.\u201d My eyes fix on hers intently. \u201cDon\u2019t let a breakup ruin your life.\u201d I feel so galvanized. I feel so sure of myself. I\u2019m burning with my message. \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d I tick off on my fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re independent. You have your own life, and you don\u2019t need him. OK?\u201d</p> <p>I wait until she whispers, \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had breakups.\u201d I raise my voice to take in the whole room. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t to cry. The answer isn\u2019t to eat chocolate or plot revenge. You need to move on. Every time I\u2019ve had a breakup, do you know what I\u2019ve done? I\u2019ve taken my life in a new direction. I\u2019ve found myself an exciting new project. I\u2019ve changed my look. I\u2019ve moved house. Because I\u2019m in charge of my life, thank you.\u201d I pound my fist in my palm. \u201cNot some guy who can\u2019t even do a smoky eye.\u201d</p><p>A couple of girls break into applause, and Cindy\u2019s friend whoops supportively. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said! He\u2019s a waste of space!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more crying,\u201d I say for emphasis. \u201cNo more tissues. No more checking your phone to see if he\u2019s called. No more stuffing your face with chocolate. Move your life on. Fresh horizons. If I can do it, you can.\u201d</p><p>Cindy is gawping at me as though I\u2019m a mind reader.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re strong,\u201d she gulps at last. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. I\u2019m not like you. I never will be, even when I\u2019m your age.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s looking at me with such wonder, I can\u2019t help feeling touched, even though she doesn\u2019t have to behave as though I\u2019m such a dinosaur. I mean, I\u2019m only thirty-three, not a hundred.</p><p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cYou know, I was like you once. I was quite timid. I had no idea what I would do in life or what my potential was. I was an eighteen-year-old kid, floundering around.\u201d I can feel my All-Purpose Motivational Speech coming on. Do I have time to give it? I glance at my watch. Just about. The short version. \u201cI was lost. Exactly like you feel now. But then I went on my gap year.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve told this story many, many times. At student events, at team-building seminars, at preparation sessions for personnel going on sabbaticals. I never get bored of telling it, and it always gives me a tingle.</p><p>\u201cI went on my gap year,\u201d I repeat, \u201cand my whole life changed. I changed as a person. One pivotal night transformed me.\u201d I take a few steps forward and look directly at Cindy. \u201cYou know my theory of life? We all have special defining moments which set us on a path. I had my biggest defining moment on my gap year. You just need to have your own big moment. And you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She\u2019s agog, and so are all the others. I can even see someone switching off their iPod.</p><p>\u201cI was staying at a guest house on Ikonos,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s a Greek island. It was packed full of gap-year travelers, and I was there all summer. It was a magical place.\u201d</p><p>Every time I tell this story, it brings back the same memories. Waking every morning to the Greek sun dazzling my eyelids. The feel of seawater on sunburned skin. Bikinis hung over peeling wooden shutters to dry. Sand in my trodden-down espadrilles. Fresh sardines grilled on the beach. Music and dancing every night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway. One night there was a fire.\u201d I force myself back to the present. \u201cIt was terrible. The guest house was packed with people. I mean, it was a death trap. Everyone came out onto the upstairs veranda, but no one could get down; everyone was screaming; there weren\u2019t even any fire extinguishers....\u201d</p><p>Every time I remember that night, it\u2019s the same flashback: the moment the roof fell in. I can hear the thunderous sound and the screams. I can smell the smoke.</p><p>The room is utterly silent as I carry on.</p><p>\u201cI had a vantage point. I was up in the tree house. I could see where people should be heading. You could jump off the side of the veranda onto the top of a nearby goat shed, only no one had realized. Everyone was panicking. So I took charge. I started directing people. I had to yell to be heard, and wave my arms, and jump up and down like a mad thing, but finally someone noticed me, and then they all listened. They followed my instructions. They all jumped off the veranda onto the shed one by one, and they were all OK. It was the first time in my life that I realized I could be a leader. I could make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>The room is absolutely still.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Cindy exhales at last. \u201cHow many people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d I shrug. \u201cTwelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved twelve lives?\u201d She sounds awestruck.</p><p>\u201cWell, who knows?\u201d I try to lighten the atmosphere. \u201cI\u2019m sure they would have been saved anyway. The point is, I realized something about myself.\u201d I clasp my hands to my chest. \u201cFrom that moment on, I had the confidence to go for what I wanted. I changed course, changed all my ideas. I can honestly say, it all dates from that point. That was my big defining moment. That was when I became the person I am. And you\u2019ll all have your defining moments. I know you will.\u201d</p> <p>I always relive the moment and feel a little overcome when I tell that story. It was so terrifying. That\u2019s the bit I never put in: how scared and panicky I was, shrieking through the breeze, desperate to be heard, knowing it was all down to me. I blow my nose and smile around at the silent faces. I made a difference. That mantra has stayed with me all these years. I made a difference. Whatever else I do that\u2019s crap and stupid, I made a difference.</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the room. Then the blond girl in the front row stands up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best careers adviser we\u2019ve ever had. Isn\u2019t she?\u201d To my astonishment, she leads a round of applause. A couple of girls even cheer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not,\u201d I say hastily.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d she insists. \u201cYou\u2019re ace. Can we say thank you properly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely welcome.\u201d I smile politely. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to be here, and good luck with your careers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d She approaches the platform, brandishing a massive black roll of brushes at me. \u201cI\u2019m Jo. Fancy a makeover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hesitate and glance at my watch. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I mean, that\u2019s very kind of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this personally,\u201d says Jo kindly. \u201cBut you need it. Your eyes are dead puffy. Did you get enough sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stiffen. \u201cYes. Yes, I did, thanks. Plenty of sleep. Loads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you need some different eye cream, then. Whatever you\u2019re using really isn\u2019t working.\u201d She\u2019s peering closely at my face now. \u201cAnd your nose is red. You haven\u2019t been ... crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrying?\u201d I try not to sound too defensive. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>Jo has ushered me into a plastic chair and is gently patting the skin round my eyes. She sucks in breath, like a builder assessing someone else\u2019s dodgy plastering job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your skin\u2019s in a terrible state.\u201d She beckons over a couple of friends, who pull equally dismayed faces at the sight of my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are all pink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve no idea why that is.\u201d I aim for an easy smile. \u201cNone. None at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have an allergy to something!\u201d says Jo in sudden inspiration.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I seize on this idea. \u201cThat\u2019ll be it. An allergy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makeup do you use? Can you show me?\u201d</p><p>I reach for my bag and pull the zip open, but it\u2019s stuck.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d says Jo, and reaches for it before I can stop her. Shit. I don\u2019t particularly want anyone seeing the massive Galaxy bar I bought in WHSmith this morning and half consumed while waiting for Steve (moment of weakness). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say, grabbing it back. But her hand is already wrenching open the zip, and somehow the whole thing gets jostled and jerked, and before I know it the half-Galaxy has been tossed out of the bag, together with a mostly drunk miniature bottle of white wine (further moment of weakness). And the shreds of a ripped-up photo of Richard (even further moment of weakness).</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Jo says in horror, gathering the shreds. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! What\u2019s\u2014\u201d She looks more closely. \u201cIs that a photo? What happened to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your chocolate,\u201d volunteers another girl, holding out the Galaxy.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think this might be an old Valentine?\u201d says her friend, gingerly picking up a charred piece of glittery card. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s been ... burned?\u201d</p> <p>I did it with a match in a coffee cup in Costa before they told me to stop. (Ultimate moment of weakness.)</p><p>Richard\u2019s eye is staring at me out of a fragment of photo, and I feel my insides heave with sudden grief. I can detect a few meaningful looks passing between the girls, but I don\u2019t have any words. I can\u2019t find a noble and inspirational way out of this one. Jo turns and surveys my bloodshot eyes again. Then she springs into life and starts stuffing all the things back into my bag.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she says briskly, \u201cthe most important thing is making you look totally fabulous. That\u2019ll show ... whoever.\u201d She winks at me. \u201cOr whatever. It might take a bit of time. Are you up for it?\u201d</p><p>This is the answer. I don\u2019t know what the question is, but this is the answer. I\u2019m sitting in a chair with my eyes closed, in a state of near bliss as my face is brushed and penciled by my new best friend Jo and her fellow students. They\u2019ve sprayed my face with foundation and put rollers in my hair and they keep changing their mind about which eye look to give me, but I\u2019m barely listening. I\u2019m in a trance. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019ll be late back to the office. I\u2019m zoned out. I keep drifting off to sleep and half waking up and my mind is a swirl of dream and color and thought.</p><p>Every time I find myself thinking of Richard, I wrench my mind away. Move on. Move on, move on. I\u2019m going to be OK, I\u2019m going to be fine. I just need to take my own advice. Find a new mission. A new track. Something to focus on.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019ll redecorate my flat. Or maybe I should take up martial arts. I could start a course of intensive training and get super-fit. Cut all my hair off and get amazing biceps like Hilary Swank.</p><p>Or pierce my belly button. Richard hates pierced belly buttons. That\u2019s what I should do.</p><p>Or maybe I should travel. Why have I not traveled more?</p><p>My thoughts keep drifting back to Ikonos. It was an amazing summer, until the fire happened and the police arrived and everything disbanded in chaos. I was so young. I was so thin. I lived in cutoff shorts and a string-bikini top. I had beads in my hair. And of course there was Ben, my first proper boyfriend. My first relationship. Dark hair and crinkly blue eyes and the smell of sweat and salt and Aramis. God, how much sex did we have? Three times a day, at least. And when we weren\u2019t having sex we were thinking about sex. It was insane. It was like a drug. He was the first guy I ever felt so hot for that I wanted to ...</p><p>Wait. Wait a minute.</p><p>Ben?</p> <p>My eyes pop open and Jo cries out in dismay. \u201cKeep still!\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. Surely.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I blink, trying to stay composed. \u201cActually ... can we pause a moment? I need to make a call.\u201d</p><p>I turn away, rummage for my phone, and press Kayla\u2019s speed dial, telling myself not to be stupid. It can\u2019t be him. It\u2019s not him.</p><p>Obviously it\u2019s not him.</p><p>\u201cLottie, hi,\u201d comes Kayla\u2019s voice. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d</p><p>Why would he be phoning me after all this time? It\u2019s been fifteen years, for God\u2019s sake. We haven\u2019t been in touch since ... Well. Since then.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kayla. I just wanted the number of that guy Ben.\u201d I try to sound relaxed. \u201cThe one who called yesterday while I was out, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Why am I clenching my fingers together?</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Hold on ... Here we are.\u201d She dictates a mobile number. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... not sure. You\u2019re positive he didn\u2019t give a surname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just Ben.\u201d</p><p>I ring off and stare at the number. Just Ben. Just Ben.</p><p>It\u2019s a cheeky student candidate, I tell myself firmly. It\u2019s a careers officer who thinks we\u2019re on first-name terms. It\u2019s Ben Jones, my neighbor, ringing me at work for some reason. How many people are there in the world called Ben? About five zillion. Precisely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just Ben.</p><p>But that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s why my breath is coming just a little short and I\u2019m instinctively sitting up straight in a more attractive manner. Who would call himself that except my old boyfriend?</p><p>I punch in the number, close my eyes tight, and wait. The ringing tone sounds. And again. And again.</p><p>\u201cBenedict Parr.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cHello? It\u2019s Benedict Parr here. Is anyone there?\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t talk. My stomach is doing a little dance.</p><p>It\u2019s him.</p><p>4</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>The first thing to say is that I look fabulous.</p> <p>The second thing is, I am not going to sleep with him.</p><p>No. No, sirree. No, I am not.</p><p>Even though I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day. Even though I\u2019ve been gently fizzing just at the memory. Him. How it was. How we were. I feel surreal and a bit light-headed. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to see him. After all this time. Ben. I mean, Ben.</p><p>Hearing his voice was like some sort of time-travel trigger. At once I was sitting opposite him at that rickety little table we used to commandeer in the evening. Olive trees all around. My bare feet resting in his lap. A can of ice-cold Sprite. I\u2019d forgotten about my Sprite addiction till that very instant.</p><p>Since then, memories and images have been resurfacing all day, some vague and some fully composed. His eyes. His scent. He was always so intense. That\u2019s what I remember most. His intensity. He made me feel as though we were starring in our own movie, as though nothing mattered except him and me and now. It was all about sensation. The sensation of him. Of sun and sweat. Sea and sand. Skin and skin. Everything was hot and heightened and ... incredible.</p><p>And this, fifteen years later, this is\u2014well. Bizarre. I glance at my watch and feel a little shiver of anticipation. Enough loitering in shop entrances. Time to go.</p> <p>We\u2019re meeting at a new fish restaurant in Clerkenwell which has had good reviews. Apparently Ben works nearby, doing something or other\u2014I didn\u2019t ask, which was stupid, so I had to resort to a hasty Google when I finally got back to the office. I couldn\u2019t track him down on Facebook, but there was some website about a paper company, which apparently he\u2019s a director of. I\u2019m kind of surprised\u2014he wanted to be an actor when we were together, but I guess it didn\u2019t work out. Or maybe he changed his mind. We didn\u2019t talk too much about careers or jobs back then. We were pretty much just interested in sex and how we were going to change the world.</p><p>I do remember lots of late-night discussions on Brecht, who he was reading, and Chekhov, who I was reading. And global warming. And philanthropy. And politics. And euthanasia. We were a bit sixth-form debate-y, now that I look back. A bit earnest. But, then, fair enough. We\u2019d only just left the sixth form.</p><p>I approach the restaurant, teetering a bit on my new high heels, feeling my hair bounce around my shoulders and admiring my immaculate manicure. As soon as Jo and her friends heard I was going on a date with an ex-boyfriend, they launched into a whole new level of activity. They did my nails. They dyed my brows. They even offered me a bikini wax.</p><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t need that. I\u2019d already been to the salon three days ago, to get prepared for hot, joyous, post-proposal sex with Richard, much good it did me. Total waste of money.</p><p>I feel a painful, humiliated pang. I should invoice him for the salon bill. I should send it to him in San Francisco, together with a dignified letter saying simply, Dear Richard. When you get this letter\u2014</p><p>No. Stop, Lottie. Do not think about Richard. Do not compose a dignified letter. Move on. Move on, move on.</p><p>I grip my clutch bag more tightly, willing strength into myself. Everything is meant. It all has a pattern. One minute I\u2019m at my lowest ebb\u2014the next, Ben is contacting me. It\u2019s kismet. It\u2019s fate.</p><p>Although I am not going to sleep with him.</p> <p>No. I\u2019m not.</p><p>As I reach the entrance to the restaurant, I whip out my handbag mirror and check my reflection one last time. Bloody hell. I keep forgetting how amazing I look. My skin looks radiant. I have stunning new cheekbones, which Jo somehow invented with blusher and highlighter. My lips look fresh and luscious. To sum up: I\u2019m gorgeous.</p><p>It\u2019s the opposite of that nightmare scenario where you bump into your ex-boyfriend, wearing only pajamas and a hangover. It\u2019s the dream scenario. I\u2019ve never looked better in my life, and I\u2019m fairly sure I never will again, not unless I hire ten makeup artists. This is my pinnacle, looks-wise.</p><p>With a sudden little burst of confidence, I push open the restaurant door, to be greeted by a warm, inviting smell of garlic and seafood. There are leather booths and a massive chandelier and the right kind of hubbub. Not show-offy and obnoxious but civilized and friendly. A mixologist is shaking a cocktail at the bar and I have an instant, Pavlovian desire for a mojito. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not going to get drunk, I hastily resolve. I\u2019m not going to sleep with him and I\u2019m not going to get drunk.</p><p>The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 is approaching me. Here goes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to meet a ... a friend. He reserved a table. Benedict Parr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 leads me a winding route through the restaurant, past about ten tables at which possible men are sitting with their faces averted. Each time, my stomach heaves with apprehension. Is that him? Is that him? Please not that one\u2014</p> <p>Oh God! I almost squeak. Here he is, rising from his chair. Stay cool. Smile. This is so, so, so surreal.</p><p>My eyes are running over him, registering details at top speed, as though I\u2019m in the Assess Your Ex Olympics. Slightly odd patterned shirt; what\u2019s that about? He\u2019s taller than I remember. Thinner. His face is definitely thinner, and his dark wavy hair is short now. You\u2019d never know that he once had Greek-god locks. There\u2019s a hole in his ear where his earring used to be.</p><p>\u201cWell ... hi there,\u201d I greet him.</p><p>I\u2019m satisfied at the way I sound so understated. Especially since a bubble of excitement is growing inside me now that I\u2019ve had a proper view. Look at him! He\u2019s gorgeous! Just like he always was, but better. More grown-up. Less gawky.</p><p>He leans in for a kiss. A grown-up, civilized double kiss. Then he draws back and surveys me.</p> <p>\u201cLottie. You look ... incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty good yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t aged a day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re beaming at each other in a kind of amazed joy, like someone who\u2019s won a raffle and come up to collect a dodgy box of chocolates as a prize and found it\u2019s actually a thousand pounds in cash. We can\u2019t believe our luck.</p><p>I mean, let\u2019s face it, a lot can change in a man\u2019s twenties. Ben could have turned up looking like anything. He could have been bald. He could have been paunchy and stooped. He could have developed some kind of irritating tic.</p> <p>And he\u2019s probably looking at me, thinking, Thank God she hasn\u2019t had a trout pout put in/gone gray/gained sixty pounds.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He gestures charmingly at my chair and I sit down. \u201cHow have the last fifteen years been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks.\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain.\u201d He meets my eye with the same mischievous grin he always had. \u201cOK, that\u2019s the catch-up done. You want a drink? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re teetotal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I open the cocktail menu, feeling a sizzle of anticipation. This is going to be a great evening. I already know it. \u201cLet\u2019s see what they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later I\u2019m buzzing all over. I\u2019m exhilarated. I feel like a sportsman in the zone. I feel like a convert who\u2019s found religion. This is it. This is it. Ben and I are amazing together.</p><p>OK, so I haven\u2019t stuck to my resolution regarding alcohol. But that was a ridiculous, shortsighted, stupid resolution. Dinner with an ex-boyfriend is potentially quite a tense, sticky situation. This could have been awkward. As it is, with a few cocktails down me, I\u2019m having the best evening of my life.</p><p>What\u2019s amazing is how connected Ben and I are. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve picked up exactly where we left off, as if the last decade and a half never happened. We\u2019re eighteen again. We\u2019re young and big-eyed. Sharing wild ideas and silly jokes and wanting to explore everything the world has to offer. Ben immediately started telling me about a play he\u2019d seen the week before, and I countered with an art exhibition in Paris (I didn\u2019t mention that Richard took me), and our conversation has been flying since then. There\u2019s so much to say. There are so many memories.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t done the tedious list of who-what-when. We haven\u2019t exchanged job details, previous relationships, any of that boring crap. It\u2019s so refreshing not to hear the words \u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d or \u201cIs your flat a conversion or purpose built?\u201d or \u201cDo you get a pension?\u201d It\u2019s so liberating.</p><p>I know he\u2019s single. He knows I\u2019m single. That\u2019s the only update we needed.</p><p>Ben has drunk quite a lot more than I have. He also remembers much more than I do about our time in Greece. He keeps sparking old memories which I\u2019d buried. I\u2019d forgotten about the poker tournament. I\u2019d forgotten about that fishing boat sinking. I\u2019d forgotten about the night we played table tennis with those two Australian guys. But the moment Ben reminds me, there it all is in my head again, in a vivid flash.</p><p>\u201cGuy and ...\u201d I\u2019m crinkling up my nose, trying to remember. \u201cGuy and ... what was his name ... oh yes, Bill!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBill!\u201d Ben chuckles and high-fives me. \u201cOf course. Big Bill.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t given Big Bill a thought, all these years. He was like a bear. He used to sit in the corner of the terrace, drinking beers and sunning himself. He had more piercings than I\u2019d ever seen in my life. Apparently he\u2019d done them all himself, with a needle. He had a really cool girlfriend called Pinky, and we all watched and cheered while he pierced her navel.</p><p>\u201cThe calamari.\u201d I close my eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had calamari like that in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sunsets,\u201d chimes in Ben. \u201cRemember the sunsets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Arthur.\u201d He grins reminiscently. \u201cWhat a character.\u201d</p><p>Arthur was the guest house owner. We all worshipped him and hung on his every word. He was the most mellow guy I\u2019ve ever met, fiftyish or maybe older, who\u2019d done everything from attending Harvard to founding his own company and going bust to sailing round the world and ending up on Ikonos, where he married a local girl. He would sit every night in the olive grove, getting gently stoned and telling people about the time he had lunch with Bill Clinton and turned down his job offer. He\u2019d had so many adventures. He was so wise. I can remember getting drunk one night and weeping on his shoulder and him stroking me and saying some really amazing stuff. (I can\u2019t remember exactly what now\u2014but it was amazing.)</p><p>\u201cRemember the steps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe steps!\u201d I groan. \u201cHow did we do it?\u201d</p> <p>The guest house was set on top of a cliff. To get down to or up from the beach, it was 113 steps, set into the cliff. We used to spring up and down them several times a day. No wonder I was so thin.</p><p>\u201cRemember Sarah? Whatever happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah? What did she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunning. Amazing body. Silky skin.\u201d He seems to inhale the memory. \u201cShe was Arthur\u2019s daughter. You must remember her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d I\u2019m not wild about hearing descriptions of other girls\u2019 silky skin. \u201cNot sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she went off traveling before you came.\u201d He shrugs, moving on. \u201cD\u2019you remember those old videos of Dirk and Sally? How many times did we watch those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDirk and Sally!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartners at the altar, partners on the block,\u201d begins Ben, in that corny voice-over voice.</p><p>\u201cPartners to the death!\u201d I join in, doing the Dirk and Sally arm salute.</p><p>Ben and I watched every single Dirk and Sally episode about five thousand times, mostly because it was the only box set of videos at the guest house, and you had to have something on apart from Greek news while you were eating your breakfast in the mornings. It\u2019s a 1970s detective show about a couple who meet while they\u2019re at police school and decide to keep their marriage secret while fighting crime as partners. Nobody knows except one serial killer, who keeps threatening to expose them. It\u2019s genius.</p><p>I have a sudden memory of sitting with Ben on that ancient sofa in the dining room, our tanned legs tangled up, both wearing espadrilles, eating toast, and watching Dirk and Sally while everyone else was out on the terrace.</p><p>\u201cThe episode where Sally is kidnapped by the neighbor,\u201d I say. \u201cThat was the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, when Dirk\u2019s brother comes to live with them, and he\u2019s become a chef for the Mafia, and Dirk keeps asking him where he learned to cook, and then the drugs are in the peach cobbler\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d</p> <p>We both pause a moment, lost in memories.</p><p>\u201cNo one I\u2019ve ever met has seen Dirk and Sally,\u201d says Ben. \u201cOr even heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I agree, though the truth is, I\u2019d pretty much forgotten about Dirk and Sally till he mentioned it just now.</p><p>\u201cThe cove.\u201d His thoughts have moved restlessly on again.</p><p>\u201cThe cove. Oh my God.\u201d I meet his eyes and it all comes flooding back. I\u2019m almost transfixed again with hot, teenage-level desire. The secret cove was where we first got it together. And then again. Every day. It was a little tiny sheltered stretch of sand round the bay. You had to get there by boat, and no one else could be bothered. Ben would sail us there, saying nothing but occasionally flicking me a meaningful look. And I would sit there, my feet up on the side of the boat, almost panting with anticipation.</p><p>I look at him now, across the table. Ben\u2019s thinking exactly the same as me, I can tell. He\u2019s back there. He looks as intoxicated as I feel.</p><p>\u201cThe way you nursed me through the flu,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flu? I don\u2019t remember nursing him through the flu. But, then, my memories are so fuzzy. I\u2019m sure I did, if he says I did. And I don\u2019t want to interrupt or contradict him, because it would ruin the mood. So I just nod gently.</p><p>\u201cYou cradled my head. You sang me to sleep. I was delirious, but I could hear your voice, getting me through the night.\u201d He takes another swig of wine. \u201cYou were my guardian angel, Lottie. Maybe I went off the rails because I didn\u2019t have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>His guardian angel. That\u2019s so romantic. I\u2019m quite interested to know how he went off the rails\u2014but to ask him would spoil the moment. And who cares? Everyone goes off the rails. Then they come back on the rails. It doesn\u2019t matter what they were doing meanwhile.</p><p>Now he glances at my left hand. \u201cHow come you haven\u2019t been snapped up, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t met the right guy,\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cA gorgeous girl like you? Should be fighting them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I have been.\u201d I laugh, but for the first time this evening my composure slips a little. And all of a sudden\u2014I can\u2019t help it\u2014I have a flashback to the first time I met Richard. It was at the opera, which is weird, because I never go to the opera normally, and nor does he. We were both there as a favor to friends. It was a charity gala of Tosca and he was in black tie, looking tall and distinguished, and the moment I saw him with some blond woman on his arm I felt a pang of jealousy. I hadn\u2019t even met him and I was thinking, Lucky her. He was laughing and handing out champagne, and then he turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we haven\u2019t been introduced,\u201d and I nearly fell into his gorgeous dark eyes.</p><p>And that was it. It felt magical. He wasn\u2019t with the blond woman after all, and after the intermission he switched seats to be next to me. We went back to the opera on our first anniversary, and I thought we\u2019d do it every year for the rest of our lives.</p><p>So much for that. So much for telling the story at the wedding reception and everybody saying, Ahh ...</p> <p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Ben is peering at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve said something. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I smile hastily and blink. \u201cJust ... everything. You know. Life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Exactly.\u201d He nods fervently as though I\u2019ve solved some massive problem he was wrestling with. \u201cLotts, do you feel as fucked up by life as I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I take a deep slug of wine. \u201cYes, I do. Even more so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was eighteen, when we were out there, I knew what I was about.\u201d Ben is staring moodily into space. \u201cI had clarity. But you start out in life and somehow it all gets ... corroded. Corrupted. Everything closes in on you, you know what I mean? There\u2019s no escape. There\u2019s no way to say, \u2018Just stop a fucking moment. Let me work out what I want.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d I nod earnestly.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the highest point of my life. Greece. You. The whole deal.\u201d He looks gripped by the memory. \u201cJust the two of us, together. Everything was simple. There was no shit. Is it the same for you? Was that the best time of your life?\u201d</p><p>My mind does a hazy rewind over the last fifteen years. OK, there have been a few high points here and there, but in general I have to agree. We were eighteen. We were hot. We could drink all night with no hangover. When has life ever been that good?</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cBest time ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we stay together, Lottie? Why didn\u2019t we keep in touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdinburgh\u2013Bath.\u201d I shrug. \u201cBath\u2013Edinburgh. Impossible geography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But that was a crap reason.\u201d He looks angry. \u201cWe were idiots.\u201d</p><p>We had the \u201cimpossible geography\u201d conversation many, many times on the island. He was going to Edinburgh University. I was going to Bath. It was only a matter of time before it ended. There was no point trying to keep things going beyond the summer.</p><p>The days after the fire were weird, anyway. Everything started to fall apart. We were all billeted in different guest houses, all over the island. People\u2019s parents swooped in. Some actually arrived on the next boat, with money and clothes and replacement passports. I remember seeing Pinky sitting disconsolately at the taverna with two very smart-looking parents. It felt like the party was over.</p> <p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we planning to meet once in London?\u201d It comes back to me in a flash. \u201cBut then you had to go to Normandy with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He exhales sharply. \u201cI should have bailed out on them. I should have switched to Bath.\u201d His eyes suddenly focus on me. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you, Lottie. Sometimes I think, what an idiot I was to let you go. What a fucking stupid idiot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach turns an almighty somersault and I almost choke on my wine. At the back of my mind, I was kind of hoping he might say something along these lines. But not so soon. His blue eyes are boring into me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say at last, and take a forkful of halibut.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve ever had a relationship better than ours. Because I sure as hell haven\u2019t.\u201d Ben bangs the table with his fist. \u201cMaybe we got our priorities screwed up. Maybe we should have said, Fuck university, we\u2019re staying together. Who knows what might have happened? We were good together, Lottie. Maybe we\u2019ve wasted the last fifteen years not being together. Don\u2019t you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>His speed is taking my breath away. I don\u2019t quite know how to react, so I stuff some more halibut into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWe might be married by now. We might have kids. My life might make sense.\u201d He\u2019s almost talking to himself, popping with a kind of suppressed emotion I can\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cDo you want kids?\u201d I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just asked a guy on a first date if he wants kids. I should be struck off. Except ... it\u2019s not a first date. If it\u2019s anything, it\u2019s a zillionth date. And he mentioned them first. And, anyway, it\u2019s not a date at all. So.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want kids.\u201d His intent gaze lands on me again. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a family, prams, going to the park, all that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I feel tears spring to my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a family too.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. Richard has popped into my head yet again. I didn\u2019t want him to, but he has. I\u2019m remembering that fantasy I used to have of Richard and me making a tree house for our twins called Arthur and Edie. Almost savagely, I open my evening bag and reach for a tissue. Crying was not the plan. Thinking about Richard was not the plan.</p><p>Thankfully, Ben doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed. He refills my glass, then his own, with wine. We\u2019ve already finished the bottle, I notice with a slight shock. How did we manage that?</p><p>\u201cRemember the pact?\u201d His voice takes me by surprise.</p><p>No way.</p><p>Adrenaline has flooded my body. My lungs are squeezed so tight, I can\u2019t breathe. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d remember the pact. I wasn\u2019t going to bring it up. It was a teeny, tiny, jokey promise we made once. It was nothing. It was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cShould we exercise it?\u201d He\u2019s looking at me frankly. I think he might be half serious. Or serious. No. He can\u2019t be serious\u2014</p> <p>\u201cBit late,\u201d I manage, my throat tight. \u201cWe said if we were unmarried at thirty. I\u2019m thirty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter late than never.\u201d I feel a fresh jolt. His foot has found mine under the table and he\u2019s edging off my shoe. \u201cMy flat\u2019s nearby,\u201d he murmurs. Now his hand is taking mine. My skin starts tingling all over. It\u2019s like muscle memory. Sex memory. I know where we\u2019re heading.</p><p>But ... but ... is that where I want to head? What\u2019s going on here? Think, Lottie.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to see the dessert menu?\u201d The waiter\u2019s voice snaps me out of my trance. My head jerks up and I take the chance to whip my hand away from Ben.</p><p>\u201cEr ... thanks.\u201d</p><p>I scan the dessert menu, my cheeks beating with blood, my mind circling furiously. What do I do now? What? What?</p><p>A little voice is telling me to rein in. I\u2019m playing this wrong. I\u2019m making a mistake. I have a terrible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, of things following the same old pattern.</p><p>All my long-term relationships have started like this. Hand-holding over a table. Pulses racing all over my body. Nice underwear, and everything waxed, and hot, inventive, fabulous sex. (Or terrible sex, that one time with the doctor bloke. Yikes. You\u2019d think a medic would be a bit more up on the way a body works. But I ditched him fairly swiftly.)</p> <p>The point is: the beginning is never the problem. It\u2019s afterward.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a strange conviction I\u2019ve never felt before. I need to change everything I\u2019m doing. Break the pattern. But how? What?</p><p>Ben has taken my hand again and is kissing the inside of my wrist, but I ignore him. I want to marshal my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looks up, his mouth against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re tense. Lottie, don\u2019t fight it. This is meant to happen. You and me. You know it is.\u201d</p><p>His eyes have that languorous, drunken sexy look I remember. I\u2019m already feeling turned on. I could surrender and have a sizzling, delicious night to cheer myself up. I deserve it, after all.</p><p>But what if there\u2019s a chance of more than a great night? How should I play this? What do I do? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would really help if my head wasn\u2019t spinning.</p><p>\u201cBen, you have to understand.\u201d I pull my arm away again. \u201cIt\u2019s not like when we were eighteen, OK? I don\u2019t just want a shag. I want ... other things. I want marriage. I want commitment. I want to plan a life together with someone. Kids, the whole lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d he says impatiently. \u201cWeren\u2019t you listening? It should have been you all along.\u201d His eyes are burning into mine. \u201cLottie. I never stopped loving you.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, he loves me. I feel a rush of tears again. And, looking at him, it comes to me that I never stopped loving him either. Maybe I just didn\u2019t realize it, because it was a kind of low-level, steady love. Like a background hum. And now it\u2019s swelling back up into full-blown passion.</p> <p>\u201cNor did I,\u201d I say, my voice trembling with sudden conviction. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you for fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen years.\u201d He\u2019s clinging to my hand. \u201cWe were insane to let each other go.\u201d</p><p>The romance of it all is overwhelming me. Talk about a story to tell at a wedding reception. Talk about oohs and aahs. We were apart for fifteen years, but then we found each other again.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make up for lost time.\u201d He crushes my fingers to his mouth. \u201cDarling Lottie. My love.\u201d His words are like balm. The feel of his lips on my skin is almost unbearably delicious. For an instant I close my eyes. But, no. Alarm bells are ringing. I can\u2019t bear this one to go wrong like all the others.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I whip my hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t! Ben, I know how this will play out, and I can\u2019t bear it. Not again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He stares at me, baffled. \u201cAll I did was kiss your fingers.\u201d</p><p>His voice is a bit slurred. Kish your fingersh. But, then, so probably is mine.</p><p>I wait until the waiter has brushed away the crumbs from our table, then launch in again, my voice lowered and trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here before. I know what happens. You kiss my fingers. I kiss your fingers. We have sex. It\u2019s great. We have more sex. We\u2019re besotted. We go on a mini-break to the Cotswolds. Maybe we buy a sofa together, or a bookshelf from Ikea. And then suddenly it\u2019s two years later and we should be getting married ... but somehow we don\u2019t. We\u2019ve gone off the boil. We argue and we break up. And it\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>My throat is tight with misery at our fate. It\u2019s so inevitable and it\u2019s so sad.</p><p>Ben looks bewildered by the scenario I\u2019ve painted.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says at last, eyeing me warily. \u201cWell ... what if we don\u2019t go off the boil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do! It\u2019s the law! It always happens!\u201d I gaze at him, my eyes full of tears. \u201cI\u2019ve gone off the boil with too many guys. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we don\u2019t buy a bookshelf from Ikea?\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s trying to be funny, but I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve spent fifteen years of my life dating, I suddenly realize. Dating is not the solution to anything. Dating gave me Richard. Dating is the problem.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good reason you went off the boil with those other guys.\u201d Ben tries again. \u201cThey weren\u2019t the right guys. But I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says you\u2019re the right guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... because ... Jesus! What will it take?\u201d He thrusts his fingers through his hair, looking exasperated. \u201cOK! You win. We\u2019ll do it the old-fashioned way. Lottie, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I scowl. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make fun of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean it. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I take a slug of wine.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d Now he\u2019s speaking more loudly. A couple at the next table look over and smile.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d I say irritably. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>To my utter shock, he gets out of his seat, kneels down, and clasps his hands. I can see other diners turning to watch.</p><p>My heart is pounding. No way. No way.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Graveney,\u201d he begins, swaying slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve spent fifteen years chasing pale imitations of you, and now I\u2019m back here with the original I should never have let go. My life has been darkness without you and now I want to switch on the light. Will you do me the honor of marrying me? Please?\u201d</p><p>A weird sensation is stealing over me. I feel as if I\u2019m turning into cotton wool. He\u2019s proposing. He\u2019s actually proposing. For real.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d I parry.</p><p>\u201cNot that drunk.

It\u2019s still Ben.\u201d His eyes crinkle in the way they always did. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, breathing hard, my head ringing. But I can\u2019t quite tell if it\u2019s bells of joy or an alarm siren.</p><p>I mean, I did think there was a chance he was still interested in me. But this is beyond all my fantasies. He\u2019s held a torch for me, all these years! He wants to get married! He wants kids! A noise is playing at the back of my mind. I think it could be violin music. Maybe this is it. MAYBE THIS IS IT! Richard wasn\u2019t it; Ben is it!</p> <p>I take a swig of water and try to fight a way through my swirling thoughts. Let\u2019s be sensible. Let\u2019s just think this through carefully. Did we ever argue? No. Was he good company? Yes. Do I fancy him? Hell, yeah. Is there anything else I need to know about a potential husband?</p><p>\u201cDo you have any nipples pierced?\u201d I ask with sudden foreboding. Pierced nipples really aren\u2019t my thing.</p><p>\u201cNot one.\u201d He rips open his shirt in a theatrical gesture, scattering buttons, and I can\u2019t help staring. Mmm. Brown. Taut. He\u2019s as tasty as he ever was.</p><p>\u201cAll you need to do is say \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d Ben spreads his arms with a drunken emphasis. \u201cAll you need to do, Lottie, is say \u2018Yes.\u2019 We spend most of our lives messing things up because we think too much. Let\u2019s not overthink this one. Fuck it, we\u2019ve wasted enough time. We love each other. Let\u2019s just jump.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. We do love each other. And he wants to make babies who have my eyes. No one\u2019s ever said anything so beautiful to me. Not even Richard.</p> <p>My head is whirling. I\u2019m trying to stay rational, but I\u2019m losing my footing. Is this real? Is he just talking me into bed? Is this the most romantic moment of my life or am I an idiot?</p><p>\u201cI ... I think so,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ... give me a moment.\u201d</p><p>I grab my bag and head to the Ladies\u2019; I have to think. Clearly. Or at least as clearly as I can, bearing in mind that the room is spinning and my face in the mirror looks like it has three eyes.</p><p>It could work. I\u2019m sure it could work. But how can I make it work? How can I not fall into the same predictable pattern as all my other dead-end, fizzle-out relationships?</p> <p>As I comb my hair, my mind starts ranging over other first dates with other boyfriends. Other beginnings. I\u2019ve stood in so many Ladies\u2019 rooms over the years, refreshing my lipstick, thinking, Is this The One? Each time I\u2019ve felt equally hopeful, equally fizzy. So where did I go wrong? What can I do differently? What can I not do that I normally do?</p><p>Suddenly I recall that book I was looking at this morning. The Reverse Principle. Flip the arrow. Change direction. That sounds good. Yes. But how do I change direction? And now the words of that mad old woman in the Ladies\u2019 yesterday are ringing in my head. What did she say again? Men are like jungle creatures. The minute they\u2019ve found their kill, they eat it and fall asleep. Maybe she wasn\u2019t so mad after all. Maybe she had something.</p><p>Abruptly, I stop combing my hair. In a flash of inspiration, it has come to me. The answer. The left-field solution. I, Lottie Graveney, am going to reverse the pattern. I\u2019m going to do the opposite of what I\u2019ve done with all previous boyfriends.</p><p>I meet my eyes in the mirror. I look a little wild, but, then, is that any surprise? If I was exhilarated before, I\u2019m euphoric now. I feel like a scientist who\u2019s discovered a new, game-changing subatomic particle. I\u2019m right. I know I\u2019m right. I\u2019m right!</p><p>I stride back into the restaurant, staggering a little in my heels, and approach the table.</p><p>\u201cNo sex,\u201d I say firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTill we\u2019re married. No sex.\u201d I sit down. \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben looks flabbergasted, but I just smile serenely back. I\u2019m brilliant. If he really loves me, he\u2019ll wait. And there\u2019ll be no chance of anyone going off the boil. None. And the best part is, we\u2019ll have the hottest honeymoon ever. We\u2019ll be connected and united and blissed out. Exactly like honeymooners should be.</p><p>His shirt is still hanging open. I picture him naked, in some gorgeous hotel bed, surrounded by rose petals. Just the idea makes me quiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d His face has completely dropped. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want things to be different.

We want to make a life together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fifteen years I\u2019ve loved you.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cFifteen fucking years, we wasted, Lottie\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s going to start another drunken speech.</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cWe wait a bit longer. And then we can have a wedding night. A proper wedding night. Think about it. We\u2019ll both be gagging for it by then. Absolutely ... gagging.\u201d I reach under the table with my bare foot and slowly walk it up the inside of his leg. His face is transfixed. Never fails, this one.</p><p>For a moment, neither of us talks. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re communicating in a different way.</p><p>\u201cActually ...,\u201d he says at last, his voice thick, \u201cthat could be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of fun.\u201d Casually, I unbutton my top a couple of notches and lean forward, giving him maximum view of my uplift bra. My other foot is moving up to his crotch now. Ben seems unable to speak. \u201cRemember the night of your birthday?\u201d I say huskily. \u201cOn the beach? We could reprise that.\u201d</p><p>If we reprise that, I am wearing protective knee guards. I had scabs for a week. As if he\u2019s reading my mind, Ben closes his eyes and moans faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d I have a sudden memory of us as teenagers, lying entwined in my room at the guest house, lit only by the flickering of all my scented candles.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hot you are? Do you realize how badly I want to get under this table now?\u201d He grabs my hand and starts nibbling at the tip of my thumb. But this time I don\u2019t move it away. My entire body seems wired to the feel of his lips and teeth on my skin. I want them everywhere. I remember this. I remember him. How could I have forgotten?</p><p>\u201cWedding night, huh?\u201d he says at last. My toes are still doing their stuff, and there\u2019s pretty firm evidence that he\u2019s enjoying it. All still in working order, then.</p><p>\u201cWedding night.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019ll die of frustration meanwhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. And then I\u2019ll explode.\u201d He takes my thumb right inside his mouth, and I gasp inwardly as the sensation rockets through my body. We need to leave soon or the waiter will be telling us to get a room.</p> <p>And when Richard hears about this\u2014</p><p>No. Don\u2019t go there. This has nothing to do with Richard. It\u2019s fate. It\u2019s part of a bigger picture. A huge, sweeping romantic story starring Ben and me, with Richard only a bit part along the way.</p><p>I know I\u2019m drunk. I know this is rushed. But it feels so right. And if there\u2019s still a soreness deep in my heart, then this is like some magical soothing lotion. I was meant to break up with Richard. I was meant to be miserable. The karma for my suffering is that now I get a wedding ring and the hottest sex of my life.</p><p>I feel like my raffle prize wasn\u2019t a thousand pounds. It was a million pounds.</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes are glazed. I\u2019m breathing more and more heavily. I\u2019m not sure I can stand this.</p><p>\u201cWhen shall we get married?\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d He sounds desperate. \u201cReally, really soon.\u201d</p><p>5</p> <p>FLISS</p><p>I hope Lottie\u2019s OK, I really do. I\u2019ve been away for two weeks and I haven\u2019t heard one word from her. She hasn\u2019t answered any of my friendly texts, and the last phone call we had was when she was planning to fly to San Francisco and surprise Richard. As Unfortunate Choices go, that one took the biscuit. Thank God I headed it off.</p><p>But since then: nothing. I\u2019ve tried leaving voicemails as well as texting, but no response. I did manage to get through to her intern, who assured me that she was coming in to work every day\u2014so at least I know she\u2019s alive and well. But it\u2019s not like Lottie to be incommunicado. It troubles me. I\u2019ll go round and see her tonight, make sure she\u2019s OK.</p><p>I pull out my phone and send her yet another text: Hi, how\u2019s it going??? Then I put it away and survey the school playground. It\u2019s thronging with parents, children, nannies, dogs, and toddlers on scooters. It\u2019s the first day of term, so there are lots of tanned faces and shiny shoes and new haircuts. And that\u2019s just the mothers.</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d A voice greets me as we get out of the car. It\u2019s Anna, another mother. She\u2019s clutching a Tupperware container in one hand and a dog lead in the other, at the end of which her Labrador is itching to get away. \u201cHow are you? Hi, Noah! Been meaning to have that coffee ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLove to.\u201d I nod.</p><p>Anna and I talk about having coffee every time we see each other\u2014which would be getting on for two years now\u2014and it hasn\u2019t yet happened. But somehow that doesn\u2019t matter. Somehow that\u2019s not the point.</p><p>\u201cThat bloody travel project,\u201d Anna is saying as we walk toward the school entrance. \u201cI was up at five a.m. finishing that off. Up your street, I suppose, travel!\u201d She gives a cheerful laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat travel project?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, the art thing?\u201d She gestures to her container. \u201cWe did a plane. Utterly lame. We covered a toy with silver foil. Hardly homemade, but I said to Charlie, \u2018Sweetie, Mrs. Hocking won\u2019t know there\u2019s a toy underneath.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat travel project?\u201d I say again.</p><p>\u201cYou know. Make a vehicle or whatever. They\u2019re showing them all off at assembly.... Charlie, come on! The bell\u2019s rung!\u201d</p><p>What bloody travel project?</p><p>As I approach Mrs. Hocking, I can see another mother, Jane Langridge, standing in front of her, holding out a model of a cruise ship. It\u2019s made out of balsa wood and paper. It has three funnels and rows of little portholes cut out perfectly and teeny clay figures on top, sunbathing round the blue-painted swimming pool. I stare at it, speechless in awe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mrs. Hocking,\u201d Jane is saying. \u201cSome of the paint is still wet. We\u2019ve had such fun making it, haven\u2019t we, Joshua?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Phipps,\u201d calls out Mrs. Hocking cheerfully. \u201cNice holiday?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Phipps. It sets my teeth on edge every time I\u2019m addressed this way. I haven\u2019t got round to becoming \u201cMs. Graveney\u201d for school purposes. Truth is, I\u2019m unsure what to do. I don\u2019t want to unsettle Noah. I don\u2019t want to make a big deal of rejecting his surname. I like having the same name as Noah. It feels homey and right.</p><p>I should have chosen a brand-new surname when he was born. Just for us. Divorce-proof.</p><p>\u201cMummy, did you bring the hot-air balloon?\u201d Noah is peering up at me anxiously. \u201cHave we got the hot-air balloon?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about.</p> <p>\u201cNoah told us he was making a hot-air balloon. Super idea.\u201d Mrs. Hocking descends on us, beaming. She\u2019s a woman in her sixties who lives in tapered trousers. She\u2019s so cool and unhurried, I inevitably feel like a gabbling lunatic next to her. Now her eyes rest on my empty hands. \u201cDo you have it?\u201d</p><p>Do I look like I have a hot-air balloon about my person?</p><p>\u201cNot on me,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cNot exactly on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her smile fades. \u201cWell, if there\u2019s any chance you could get it to us this morning, Mrs. Phipps, we\u2019re setting up the display for assembly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Of course!\u201d I flash her a confident smile. \u201cI just need to\u2014 One tiny detail\u2014 Let me just talk to Noah a moment.\u201d I draw him away and bend down. \u201cWhich hot-air balloon, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hot-air balloon for the travel project,\u201d says Noah, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cWe have to bring them in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d It\u2019s nearly killing me, staying bright and breezy. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a project. You never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot.\u201d He nods. \u201cBut remember we had a letter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy put it in his fruit bowl.\u201d</p><p>I feel a volcanic surge of fury. I knew it. I bloody knew it.</p><p>\u201cRight. I see.\u201d I grind my fingernails into my palms. \u201cDaddy didn\u2019t tell me there was a project. What a pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we talked about what to make, and Daddy said, \u2018What about a hot-air balloon?\u2019 \u201d Noah\u2019s eyes start to gleam. \u201cDaddy said we would get a balloon and cover it with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and make a basket and people. And ropes. And paint it. And the people could be Batman.\u201d His little cheeks are glowing with excitement. \u201cHas he made it?\u201d He looks at me expectantly. \u201cHave you got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just ... check.\u201d My smile feels glued into place. \u201cPlay on the climbing frame a moment.\u201d</p><p>I step away and speed-dial Daniel.</p><p>\u201cDaniel Phi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fliss.\u201d I cut him off evenly. \u201cAre you by any chance speeding toward the school holding a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hot-air balloon with Batman in the basket?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s quite a long pause.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Daniel says at last. \u201cShit. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound remotely concerned. I want to kill him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!

I\u2019m feeling a red heat of determination. I am not going to let Noah down. He\u2019s going to have his hot-air balloon. I can do this. Come on.</p> <p>I bleep open the car and snap up the lid of my briefcase. I\u2019ve got a tiny cardboard gift bag in there, from some fancy lunch. That can be the basket. Shoelaces out of my gym crosstrainers will be the ropes. I grab a sheet of paper and pen from my briefcase and beckon Noah over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to finish off our hot-air balloon,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you draw Batman to put in the basket?\u201d</p><p>As Noah starts drawing, leaning on the car seat, I swiftly take out my shoelaces. They\u2019re brown and speckled. They\u2019ll make perfect ropes. I\u2019ve got some Scotch tape in the glove compartment. And for the balloon itself ...</p><p>Bloody hell. What can I use? It\u2019s not like I travel around with packets of balloons, on the off chance that\u2014</p><p>A ridiculous, unspeakable idea grabs me. I could always\u2014</p> <p>No. No way. I can\u2019t....</p><p>Five minutes later, I approach Mrs. Hocking, nonchalantly holding Noah\u2019s project. The mothers standing around gradually fall silent. In fact, it feels as though the whole playground has fallen silent.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Batman!\u201d Noah is pointing to the basket proudly. \u201cI drew him.\u201d</p><p>All the children are looking at Batman. All the mothers are looking at the balloon. It\u2019s a blown-up Durex Fetherlite Ultra. It inflated to quite an impressive size, and the teat on the end is bobbing in the breeze.</p><p>I hear a sudden snort from Anna, but when I look around sharply, all I can see are innocent expressions.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, Noah,\u201d says Mrs. Hocking faintly. \u201cWhat a ... big balloon!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s obscene,\u201d snaps Jane, clutching her boat to her as though for protection. \u201cThis is a school, in case you\u2019d forgotten. There are children here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as far as they\u2019re concerned, this is a perfectly innocent balloon,\u201d I retort. \u201cMy husband let me down.\u201d I turn apologetically to Mrs. Hocking. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good, Mrs. Phipps!\u201d Mrs. Hocking rallies herself. \u201cWhat a creative use of ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it bursts?\u201d says Jane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got spares,\u201d I shoot back triumphantly, and proffer the rest of my Durex variety pack, splayed out like a pack of cards.</p><p>A moment too late, I realize how this looks. My cheeks flaming, I surreptitiously adjust my hand to cover up the words Ribbed for extra pleasure. And lube. And stimulation. My fingers are doing a starfish impression, trying to censor the condom packets.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to find a balloon for Noah in the classroom, Mrs. Phipps,\u201d Mrs. Hocking says at last. \u201cI\u2019d keep those yourself, for ...\u201d She hesitates, clearly searching for a way to finish her sentence.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I hastily head her off. \u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll use them for ... exactly. That. I mean, not.\u201d I laugh shrilly. \u201cActually, I probably won\u2019t use them at all. Or at least ... I am responsible, obviously....\u201d</p> <p>I trail away into silence. I\u2019ve just shared details of my condom use with my son\u2019s teacher. I\u2019m not sure how that happened.</p><p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d I add in bright desperation. \u201cSo. I\u2019ll take those away now. And use them. For ... some purpose or other.\u201d</p><p>Hastily, I stuff the condoms back in my bag, dropping a Pleasuremax and diving for it before any of the seven-year-olds can reach it. All the other mothers are staring, jaw-dropped, as though they\u2019ve witnessed a car crash.</p><p>\u201cI hope the assembly goes well. Have a lovely day, Noah.\u201d I hand him the hot-air balloon with a kiss, then swivel on my heel and march away, breathing hard. I wait until I\u2019m on the road, then dial Barnaby from the car phone.</p><p>\u201cBarnaby.\u201d I launch in. \u201cYou will not believe what Daniel just did.

Not open up your laptop and read out your entire divorce dossier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read out the entire thing!\u201d I finger my memory stick defensively. \u201cWe were just talking, and I happened to mention it, and he seemed interested\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested! He was being polite. Apparently you ranted for five solid minutes about Daniel\u2019s underwear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a total exaggeration,\u201d I retort hotly.</p><p>But my face has flamed. Maybe it was five minutes. I\u2019d had a bit to drink by that stage.

I\u2019m breathing fast. My hands feel sweaty around the steering wheel. I\u2019m flashing back to my date with Nathan. I thought I was talking about Daniel in an amusing, detached, ironic way. Nathan never said a word to indicate he wasn\u2019t having a good time. Is that what everyone\u2019s been doing? Humoring me?</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWell, now I know.

It\u2019s all very well.</p><p>When I get to work, I can see my in-box is full, but I sit at my desk, staring blindly at my computer. Barnaby\u2019s words have stung me more than I want to admit to myself. I\u2019m turning into a bitter, twisted hag. I\u2019m going to end up a gnarled old crone in a black hood who scowls at the world and battles her way along the street, hitting people with her stick and refusing to smile at the neighborhood children, who run away, terrified.</p><p>Worst-case scenario.</p><p>After a bit, I reach for the phone and call Lottie\u2019s office number. Maybe we can buoy each other up.</p><p>The girl who answers is Dolly, Lottie\u2019s junior.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi, Dolly,\u201d I say. \u201cIs Lottie about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out. Shopping. Don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Shopping? I blink at the phone in surprise. I know Lottie sometimes gets frustrated with her job, but to go out shopping and blatantly tell your junior is really not the way to go in this economic climate.</p><p>\u201cAny idea when she\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. She\u2019s buying stuff for her honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. Did I hear that right? Honeymoon? As in ... honeymoon?</p><p>\u201cDid you just say ...\u201d I swallow. \u201cDolly, is Lottie getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been away! This is ... I\u2019ve been ...\u201d I can hardly speak. \u201cOh my God! Please say I rang and congratulations!\u201d</p><p>I put down the phone and beam elatedly around the empty office. My gloomy mood has vanished. I want to dance. Lottie\u2019s engaged! It goes to show, some things in the world do go right in the end.</p><p>But, how?</p><p>How, how, how, how, how?</p><p>What happened? Did she fly out to San Francisco after all? Or did he fly back? Or did they call each other? What? I text her:</p><p>You\u2019re engaged????????</p><p>I\u2019m expecting radio silence again, but a moment later she replies.</p><p>Yes!!!! Was waiting to tell u all about it! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OMG! What happened???</p><p>All very fast. Still can\u2019t believe it. He came back into my life out of nowhere, asked me in a restaurant, had no idea he would, absolute whirlwind!!!!</p><p>I have to talk to her. I call her mobile number, but it\u2019s engaged. Damn. I\u2019ll get myself a coffee, then try again. As I head to our in-house Costa outlet, I can\u2019t stop beaming. In fact, I\u2019m so happy I really want to cry, but editors at Pincher International don\u2019t cry at work, so I\u2019ll settle for hugging myself.</p><p>Richard is perfect. He\u2019s everything I could ever have wanted for Lottie. Which sounds motherly\u2014but, then, I do feel motherly toward her. Always have. Our own parents both kind of gave up on the job, what with the divorce and the alcohol and the affairs with loaded businessmen and South African beauty queens.... Put it this way: we were left alone a lot. Lottie is five years younger than me, and, well before our mother died, she started turning to me when things went wrong.</p> <p>And as mother figure/sister/possible chief bridesmaid (?), I could not be more thrilled that Richard\u2019s joining our strange little family unit. For a start, he\u2019s good-looking but not to-die-for. This is important, I think. You want your sister to land a sex god in her own eyes, but you don\u2019t want to be lusting after him yourself. I mean, how would I feel if Lottie brought Johnny Depp home?</p><p>I try to examine my thoughts honestly, in the privacy of my own head. Yes, I would be unable to stay sisterly. I would probably try to steal him. I would feel like all bets were off.</p><p>But Richard isn\u2019t Johnny Depp. He\u2019s handsome, don\u2019t get me wrong, but not overly handsome. Not gay handsome, which that awful Jamie was, always preening and competing over carbs. Richard\u2019s a man. To my eye, he sometimes looks like a younger Pierce Brosnan and sometimes like a younger Gordon Brown. (Although I think I\u2019m the only one who can see the Gordon Brown thing. I mentioned the resemblance to Lottie once, and she got quite offended.)</p><p>I know he\u2019s good at his job. (Obviously, when he first started dating Lottie I asked around all my City contacts for the lowdown on him.) I also know he can have a short fuse and once bawled out his team so hugely, he had to take them all out to lunch to apologize. But he\u2019s also good-natured. The first time I ever saw him, he was holding an armchair, which Lottie wanted moved in her flat. She was wandering round the sitting room, saying, \u201cThere ... no, there! Ooh, what about there?\u201d And he just held that big heavy chair patiently while she dithered around, and I caught his eye and he grinned and I knew. This is the right guy for Lottie.</p><p>I want to jump up and down, I\u2019m so happy. After all the shit of my divorce, we needed something good to come our way. So, how did it happen? What did he say? I want to know everything. As I head back to my desk, I impatiently dial her number again\u2014and this time she answers.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Fliss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie!\u201d I erupt with excitement. \u201cCongratulations! Amazing news! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I know!\u201d She sounds even more euphoric than I was expecting. Richard must have swept her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cSo ... when?\u201d I sit down at my desk and sip my coffee.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago. It still hasn\u2019t really sunk in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he just contacted me out of the blue.\u201d Lottie gives an exhilarated laugh. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought I\u2019d never see him again. Let alone this!\u201d</p><p>If he proposed two weeks ago, that means he\u2019d been gone for a day, max. He must have landed at San Francisco and turned right around. Good work, Richard!</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he say? Did he get down on one knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! He said he\u2019d always loved me and he wanted to be with me and then he asked me to marry him about ten times, and at last ... I said yes!\u201d Her elation bubbles over again. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p><p>I sigh happily and take another sip of coffee. It\u2019s so romantic. It\u2019s so dreamy. I wonder if I could skive my British Airways press conference and take Lottie out for a celebratory lunch.</p><p>\u201cSo ... what else?\u201d I probe for more details. \u201cDid you give him the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d Lottie sounds drawn up short. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Thank God for that. I was never into the ring idea.</p> <p>\u201cYou just decided not to in the end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t even occur to me!\u201d To my surprise, she sounds pained. \u201cI mean, the ring was for Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I blink at the phone, not following.</p><p>\u201cWell, I bought the ring for Richard.\u201d She sounds quite put out. \u201cIt would be weird, giving it to someone else. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to answer, but my thoughts have jammed, as though a pencil\u2019s fallen into a smoothly whirring machine.

Is she using some figure of speech?</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d I proceed warily, feeling as though I\u2019m speaking a foreign language. \u201cYou bought the ring for Richard ... but you didn\u2019t give it to him?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m only trying to work out what she meant.

God, you could be a bit more sensitive!\u201d Her voice rises shrilly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to start afresh here! I\u2019m trying to embark on a whole new life with Ben! You don\u2019t have to bring up Richard!\u201d</p> <p>Ben?</p><p>I\u2019m completely confused. I think I\u2019m going mad. Who\u2019s Ben and what does he have to do with this?</p><p>\u201cLook, Lottie. Don\u2019t get upset, but I really don\u2019t understand....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you just now in my text! Can\u2019t you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were engaged!\u201d A terrible feeling grips me. Is this all some massive misunderstanding? \u201cAre you not engaged?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! Of course I\u2019m engaged! To Ben!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is Ben?\u201d I yell, more loudly than I meant to. Elise looks in at the door curiously, and I shoot her an apologetic smile, mouthing, \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence at the end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Lottie at last. \u201cSorry. I just looked back at my text. I thought I\u2019d told you. I\u2019m not marrying Richard; I\u2019m marrying Ben. Remember Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not remember Ben!\u201d I say, feeling increasingly frazzled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you never met him. Well, he was my gap-year boyfriend in Greece, and he\u2019s come back into my life and we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p> <p>I feel as though the ceiling has caved in. She was marrying Richard. It all made sense. Now she\u2019s running off with some guy called Ben? I don\u2019t even know where to start.</p><p>\u201cLotts ... But, Lotts, I mean ... How can you be getting married to him?\u201d A thought suddenly comes to me. \u201cIs this a visa thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a visa thing!\u201d She sounds indignant. \u201cIt\u2019s love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love this guy Ben enough to marry him?\u201d I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having this conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen exactly did he come back into your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago,\u201d I repeat calmly, although I want to burst into hysterical laughter. \u201cAfter how long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen years.\u201d She sounds defiant. \u201cAnd before you ask me, yes, I have thought it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK! Well, congratulations. I\u2019m sure Ben\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ll love him. He\u2019s good-looking, and he\u2019s fun, and we\u2019re totally connected\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Look, let\u2019s meet up for lunch, OK? And we can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m overreacting, I tell myself. I simply have to adjust to this new situation. Maybe this guy Ben is perfect for Lottie and it will all work out brilliantly. As long as they have a nice long engagement and don\u2019t rush into anything\u2014</p><p>\u201cShall we meet at Selfridges?\u201d Lottie says. \u201cI\u2019m there now, actually. I\u2019m buying honeymoon underwear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard. So, when were you planning to get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she says happily. \u201cWe wanted to do it as soon as possible. Can you take the day off?\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow? She\u2019s gone mad.</p><p>\u201cLotts, stay there.\u201d I can hardly get the words out. \u201cI\u2019ll come and meet you. I think we should have a talk.\u201d</p><p>I should never have relaxed. I should never have gone on holiday. I should have realized Lottie wouldn\u2019t rest till she\u2019d found something to channel all her hurt energy into. And it\u2019s this. A marriage.</p><p>By the time I get to Selfridges, my heart is thumping and I have a head full of questions. Lottie, on the other hand, has a basket full of underwear. No, not underwear, sex kit. She\u2019s standing looking at a transparent basque as I hurtle toward her, almost knocking over a rail of Princesse Tam Tam teddies. As she sees me, she holds it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I eye the stuff in her basket. She\u2019s clearly been at the Agent Provocateur concession. There\u2019s lots of black see-through lace. And is that an eye mask?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she says impatiently, and jiggles the basque at me. \u201cIt\u2019s quite expensive. Shall I try it on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isn\u2019t there a slightly bigger question we should be discussing? I want to yell. Like: who is this Ben and why are you marrying him? But if I know one thing about Lottie, it\u2019s that I need to play things carefully. I need to talk her down.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say as brightly as I can. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married. To someone I\u2019ve never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him at the wedding. You\u2019ll love him, Fliss.\u201d Her eyes are shiny as she tosses the transparent basque into her basket and adds a teeny thong. \u201cI can\u2019t believe everything\u2019s worked out so perfectly. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Wonderful! Me too!\u201d I leave a tiny pause before adding, \u201cAlthough\u2014just a thought\u2014do you need to get married so soon? Couldn\u2019t you have a long engagement and plan everything properly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to plan! It\u2019s all going to be so easy. Chelsea Register Office. Lunch at some lovely place. Simple and romantic. You\u2019re going to be bridesmaid, I hope.\u201d She squeezes my arm, then reaches for another basque.</p><p>There\u2019s something extra-weird about her. I survey her, trying to work out what\u2019s different. She\u2019s got that post-breakup manic air about her\u2014but even more than usual. Her eyes are overbright. She\u2019s hyper. Is Ben a dealer? Is she on something?</p><p>\u201cSo, Ben just contacted you out of the blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got in touch and we had dinner. And it was as though we\u2019d never been apart. We were so in tune with each other.\u201d She sighs blissfully. \u201cHe\u2019d been in love with me for fifteen years. Fifteen years. And I\u2019d been in love with him too. That\u2019s why we want to get married quickly. We\u2019ve wasted enough time already, Fliss.\u201d Her voice throbs dramatically, as though she\u2019s in a TV true-life movie. \u201cWe want to get on with the rest of our life.\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>OK, this is bollocks. Lottie has not been in love with someone called Ben for the last fifteen years. I think I might know if she had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in love with him the last fifteen years?\u201d I can\u2019t help challenging her. \u201cFunny that you never mentioned him. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him inside.\u201d She clasps a hand to her side. \u201cHere. Maybe I didn\u2019t tell you about it. Maybe I don\u2019t tell you everything.\u201d She defiantly throws a garter belt into her basket.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a photo of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on me. But he\u2019s gorgeous. I want you to give a speech, by the way,\u201d she adds blithely. \u201cYou\u2019re chief-bridesmaid-slash-best-woman. And Ben\u2019s best man is his friend Lorcan. It\u2019ll just be the four of us at the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in exasperation. I was planning to be tactful and go softly, softly, but I can\u2019t. This is all too crazy.</p> <p>\u201cLottie.\u201d I plant a hand on the packet of stockings she was about to pick up. \u201cStop. And listen a moment. I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but you have to.\u201d I wait until she reluctantly turns her eyes toward me. \u201cYou split up from Richard about five minutes ago. You were about to commit to him. You\u2019d bought him an engagement ring. You said you loved him. Now you\u2019re rushing off with some guy you barely know? Is this really a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing I did split up from Richard! A very good thing!\u201d Lottie is suddenly bristling like a cat. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of thinking, Fliss. And I\u2019ve realized Richard was all wrong for me. All wrong! I need someone romantic. Someone who can feel. Someone who\u2019ll put himself out there for me, you know? Richard\u2019s a nice guy and I thought I loved him. But now I realize the truth: he\u2019s limited.\u201d</p><p>She spits out \u201climited\u201d as though it\u2019s the worst insult she can come up with.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018limited\u2019?\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling a bit defensive on Richard\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s narrow. He has no style. He\u2019d never make some huge, reckless, wonderful gesture. He\u2019d never come and find a girl after fifteen years and tell her that life was darkness without her and now he wants to turn on the switch.\u201d Her chin juts defiantly and I give an inward grimace. Was that Ben\u2019s line? He wanted to turn on the switch?</p><p>I mean, I do sympathize. I had a couple of terrible, misjudged rebound flings after Daniel and I separated. But I didn\u2019t marry one of them.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lottie.\u201d I try a different tack. \u201cI do understand. I know what it\u2019s like. You\u2019re hurt. You\u2019re confused. An old boyfriend comes along out of the blue\u2014of course you\u2019re going to fall into bed with him. It\u2019s natural. But why do you have to get married?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she retorts with a triumphant look. \u201cYou are so, so wrong, Fliss. I didn\u2019t fall into bed with him. And I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m saving myself for the honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She ...</p><p>What?</p><p>Of all the things I was expecting to hear, it wasn\u2019t this. I stare at Lottie blankly, unable to find an answer. Where is my sister and what has this man done with her?</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re saving yourself?\u201d I echo at last. \u201cBut.... why? Is he Amish?\u201d I suddenly fear the worst. \u201cIs he from some kind of cult? Did he promise you enlightenment?\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s handed over all her money. Not again.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll have the hottest sex ever on my honeymoon night.\u201d She grabs the stockings. \u201cWe know we\u2019re good together, so why not save up for the moment? It\u2019s our wedding night. It should be special. As special as it can possibly be.\u201d She gives a sudden wriggle, as though she can\u2019t contain herself. \u201cAnd believe me, it will be. God, Fliss, he\u2019s so hot. We can hardly keep our hands off each other. It\u2019s like we\u2019re eighteen again.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her, all the pieces falling into place. Her shiny eyes make sense. The basket of underwear makes sense. She\u2019s raring to go. This engagement is one great big session of fore-play. Why didn\u2019t I realize this straightaway? She is drugged up\u2014on lust. And not only lust, teenage lust. She has the same look about her as teenagers snogging at the bus stop, as though the rest of the world doesn\u2019t exist. For a moment I feel a stab of envy. I wouldn\u2019t mind disappearing into a bubble of teenage lust, quite frankly. But I have to stay rational here. I have to be the voice of reason.</p><p>\u201cLottie, listen.\u201d I\u2019m trying to speak slowly and clearly, to penetrate her trance. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get married. You could just take a hotel suite somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get married!\u201d Humming to herself, she chucks another expensive negligee into her basket, and I suppress a desire to scream. It\u2019s all very well. But if she took off the lust goggles for one bloody moment, maybe she\u2019d see how much this escapade is potentially going to end up costing her. A shed-load of underwear. A marriage. A honeymoon. A divorce. All for one epic night of shagging? Which she could have for free?</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d She looks up at me resentfully. \u201cYou could be happy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be, I really am.\u201d I rub my head. \u201cBut it makes no sense. You\u2019re doing everything the wrong way round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d She turns on me. \u201cWho says so? Isn\u2019t this the traditional way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLottie, you\u2019re being ludicrous.\u201d I\u2019m starting to feel angry. \u201cThis is no way to start a marriage, OK? A marriage is a serious, legal thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d She cuts me off. \u201cAnd I want to make it work, and this is the way. I\u2019m not stupid, Fliss.\u201d She folds her arms. \u201cI have thought about this, you know. My love life has been a disaster. It\u2019s followed the same old pattern, with man after man. Sex. Love. No marriage. Over and over. Well, now I have a chance to do it differently! I\u2019m reversing the strategy! Love. Marriage. Sex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s nuts!\u201d I can\u2019t help erupting. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s nuts! You must see that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d she retorts hotly. \u201cI see a brilliant answer to the whole problem. It\u2019s retro! It\u2019s tried and tested! Did Queen Victoria have sex before she married Albert? And was their marriage a huge success? Did she love him desperately and build a great big memorial to him in Hyde Park? Exactly. Did Romeo and Juliet have sex before they got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have sex before they got married?\u201d Her eyes flash at me as though this proves everything.</p><p>Oh, please. If she\u2019s going to use Mr. Darcy to prop up her arguments, I give up.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou got me there. Mr. Darcy.\u201d</p> <p>I need to back off for now and come up with a different angle.</p><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s this Lorcan?\u201d A new idea has come to me. \u201cWho\u2019s this best man of Ben\u2019s you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>Presumably Ben\u2019s best friend won\u2019t be any wilder than I am about this sudden, out-of-the-blue marriage. Maybe we can join forces.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d She waves vaguely. \u201cSome old friend. Works with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company\u2019s called something like ... Decree.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what does Ben do, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d She holds up a pair of knickers that untie at the back. \u201cSomething or other.\u201d</p><p>I resist an urge to yell, You\u2019re getting married to him and you don\u2019t even know what he does?</p><p>I get out my BlackBerry and type in Ben\u2014Lorcan\u2014Decree?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Ben\u2019s surname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParr. I\u2019ll be Lottie Parr. Isn\u2019t that lovely?\u201d</p><p>Ben Parr.</p><p>I tap at my BlackBerry, peer at the screen, and do a fake gasp. \u201cOh goodness. I forgot all about that. Actually, Lottie, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve got time for lunch, after all. I\u2019d better go. Have fun shopping.\u201d I give her a hug. \u201cTalk to you later. And ... congratulations!\u201d</p><p>My bright smile lasts all the way out of the underwear department. Before I\u2019ve even got to the lifts, I\u2019m on Google, typing Ben Parr. Ben Parr, my potential new brother-in-law. Who the hell is he?</p> <p>By the time I get back to my office, I\u2019ve Googled Ben Parr as extensively as I can manage on my phone, but I haven\u2019t found any company called Decree, only a bunch of entries about a Ben Parr who does stand-up comedy. Badly, according to the reviews. Is that him?</p><p>Great. A failed stand-up. My favorite kind of brother-in-law.</p><p>At last I find an entry which mentions a Ben Parr in a news item about a paper company called Dupree Sanders. He has some made-up title like Strategic Overview Consultant. I type in Ben Parr Dupree Sanders, and a million new entries appear. Dupree Sanders is clearly a thing. A big company. Here\u2019s the home page ... and sure enough, a page pops up with his picture and a little bio, which I scan. Having worked with his father as a young man, Ben Parr was delighted to rejoin Dupree Sanders in 2011, in a strategic role ... genuine passion for the business ... Since his father\u2019s death, he is even more dedicated to the future of the company.</p><p>I lean toward the screen and scan the photo intently, trying to get a sense of this man who is zooming like a torpedo toward being related to me. He\u2019s good-looking, I\u2019ll have to agree. Boyish-looking. Slim. Affable. Not sure about his mouth. It looks kind of weak.</p><p>After a bit, the pixels start to dance in front of my eyes, so I sit back and type in Lorcan Dupree Sanders.</p><p>A moment later another page pops up, with a photo of a very different-looking man. Dark, thrusting hair, black eyebrows, and a frown. Strong, slightly beaky nose. He looks fairly forbidding. Underneath the picture it says, Lorcan Adamson. Extension 310. Lorcan Adamson practiced law in London before joining Dupree Sanders in 2008 ... responsible for many initiatives ... developed the luxury stationery brand Papermaker ... worked with the National Trust to expand the visitor center ... committed to sustainable, responsible industry ...</p> <p>A lawyer. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s the rational, reasonable type, not the arrogant asshole type. I dial the number, simultaneously clicking on my emails.</p><p>\u201cLorcan Adamson.\u201d The voice that answers is so deep and gravelly, I drop my mouse in surprise. Surely that\u2019s not a real voice. It sounds made up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he says again, and I stifle a giggle. This guy has a film-trailer voice. It\u2019s that deep-down rumbly, subwoofer voice you hear as you\u2019re scarfing down popcorn, waiting for your movie to begin.</p><p>We thought the world was safe. We thought the universe was ours. Till THEY came.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The gravelly voice comes again.</p><p>In a desperate fight against time, one girl must break the code\u2014</p><p>\u201cHi. Er ... hi.\u201d I try to assemble my thoughts. \u201cIs this Lorcan Adamson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s he.\u201d</p> <p>From Academy Award\u2013winning director\u2014</p><p>No. Stop, Fliss. Concentrate.</p><p>\u201cRight. Right. Yes.\u201d I hastily compose myself. \u201cWell, I think we need to speak. My name is Felicity Graveney. My sister is called Lottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d There\u2019s a sudden animation to his voice. \u201cWell, excuse my French, but what the fuck is going on here? Ben just called me. Apparently he and your sister are getting married?\u201d</p><p>Two things I pick up straightaway. First: he has a faint Scottish accent. Second: he\u2019s not keen on the whole marriage idea either. Thank God. Another voice of reason.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you\u2019re best man? I have no idea how this came about, but I was thinking maybe we could get together and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? Plan the table decorations?\u201d He talks right over me. \u201cI have no idea how your sister talked Ben into this ridiculous plan, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to do everything I can to stop it, whether you and your sister like it or not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at the phone. What did he say?</p><p>\u201cI work with Ben, and this is a crucial time for him,\u201d Lorcan presses on. \u201cHe can\u2019t just zoom off on some ludicrous, spur-of-the-moment honeymoon. He has responsibilities. He has commitments. Now, I don\u2019t know your sister\u2019s motivation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m so outraged, I don\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d He sounds puzzled that I\u2019ve dared to interrupt. Oh, he\u2019s one of those.</p> <p>\u201cOK, mister.\u201d Instantly I feel stupid for saying \u201cmister.\u201d But too late now. Better plow on. \u201cFirst of all, my sister didn\u2019t talk anybody into anything. I think you\u2019ll find your friend arrived out of the blue and bamboozled her into getting married. And, second, if you think I phoned you up to \u2018plan the table decorations,\u2019 you\u2019re very much mistaken. I\u2019m intending to put a stop to this marriage myself. With or without your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He sounds skeptical.</p><p>\u201cIs Ben saying that Lottie talked him into it?\u201d I demand. \u201cBecause if so, he\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as such,\u201d says Lorcan after a pause. \u201cBut Ben can be ... what shall we say? Easily swayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasily swayed?\u201d I retort furiously. \u201cIf anyone was doing any swaying, he was. My sister is at a low point, she\u2019s very vulnerable, and she doesn\u2019t need some chancer coming along.\u201d I\u2019m still half-expecting this Ben character to belong to some weirdo cult or time-share pyramid scheme. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s his job? I don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know his background.\u201d Again he sounds skeptical. God, this guy is pissing me off.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing except he met my sister on her gap year and they had a teenage shag-fest and now he says he\u2019s always loved her and they\u2019re planning to get married tomorrow and resume the teenage shag-fest. And he works for Dupree Sanders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns Dupree Sanders,\u201d Lorcan corrects me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say stupidly.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what Dupree Sanders is, exactly. I didn\u2019t stop to check it out.</p><p>\u201cAs of his father\u2019s death a year ago, Ben is the major shareholder in Dupree Sanders, a paper-manufacturing company worth thirty million pounds. And, for what it\u2019s worth, his life has been complicated and he\u2019s also pretty vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>As I digest his words, a boiling hot fury starts to rise within me.</p><p>\u201cYou think my sister\u2019s a gold digger?\u201d I erupt. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>I have never been so insulted in all my life. The arrogant ... conceited ... shit. I\u2019m breathing faster and faster, staring daggers at his screen face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he counters calmly.</p><p>\u201cJust listen to me, Mr. Adamson,\u201d I say in my iciest tones. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the facts, shall we? Your precious friend talked my sister into a ridiculous, rushed marriage. Not the other way round. How do you know she isn\u2019t an heiress worth even more? How do you know we\u2019re not related to the ... the Gettys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d says Lorcan after a pause. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re not,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cThe point is, you jumped to conclusions. Surprising, for a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence. I get the feeling I\u2019ve needled him. Well, good.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything about your sister. Maybe she and Ben are a match made in heaven. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that we have some very big stuff happening at the company. Ben needs to be available in the UK now. If he wants to go on honeymoon, he\u2019ll have to do it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr never,\u201d I put in.</p><p>\u201cOr never. Indeed.\u201d Lorcan sounds amused. \u201cYou\u2019re not a fan of Ben, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even met him. But this has been a useful chat. It\u2019s all I needed to know. Leave it with me. I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he contradicts me. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Ben.\u201d</p><p>God, this guy is winding me up. Who says he should be in charge?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lottie,\u201d I counter as authoritatively as I can. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d He talks straight across me. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Ben. The whole thing will be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lottie,\u201d I repeat, ignoring him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019ve sorted everything out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Neither of us is going to concede, I can tell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Lorcan at last. \u201cWell, goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>I put down the receiver, then grab my mobile and dial Lottie\u2019s mobile. No more Ms. Nice Sister. I am stopping this marriage. Right here, right now.</p><p>6</p> <p>FLISS</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s ignored me for a full twenty-four hours. She\u2019s got some nerve.</p><p>It\u2019s the following afternoon, the wedding is due to start in an hour, and I still haven\u2019t spoken to Lottie. She\u2019s sidestepped my every call (approximately one hundred of them). But at the same time she\u2019s managed to leave a whole series of messages on my phone, about the registry office and the restaurant and meeting for pre-wedding drinks at Bluebird. A purple satin bridesmaid\u2019s dress arrived at my office at lunchtime by bike. A poem arrived by email, along with a request for me to read it aloud during the ceremony: It will make our day so special!</p><p>She doesn\u2019t fool me. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s not been taking my calls: she feels defensive. Which means I\u2019m in with a chance. I know I can talk her out of this nonsense. I just need to work out exactly where her vulnerability is and exploit it.</p><p>As I arrive at Bluebird, I can see her already sitting at the bar in a cream lace minidress, with roses in her hair and adorable vintage-style shoes with button straps. She looks radiantly beautiful, and for a moment I feel bad, coming in to derail her.</p> <p>But, no. Someone has to stay sane around here. She won\u2019t be looking so radiant when she\u2019s being billed for her decree nisi.</p><p>Noah\u2019s not with me. He\u2019s having a sleepover with his friend Sebastian. I fibbed to Lottie, saying it was really special and he would be \u201cso sorry to miss the wedding.\u201d The real reason is that I\u2019m not intending for there to be any wedding.</p><p>Lottie has spotted me and waves to get my attention. I wave back and approach with an innocent smile. I\u2019m walking into the paddock quietly, unthreateningly, the halter hidden behind my back. I\u2019m the Bride Whisperer.</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous!\u201d As I reach Lottie, I give her a huge hug. \u201cHow exciting. What a happy day!\u201d</p><p>Lottie scans my face without replying, which proves I\u2019m right: she\u2019s on the defensive. But I keep my smile steady, as though I haven\u2019t noticed a thing.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t keen on the idea,\u201d she says at last.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I act shocked. \u201cOf course I\u2019m keen on the idea! I was just surprised. But I\u2019m sure Ben is absolutely wonderful and you\u2019ll be happy for many, many years.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath. She\u2019s visibly relaxing. Her guard is coming down.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, we will. Well, sit down. Have some champagne! Here\u2019s your bouquet.\u201d She hands me a little cluster of roses.</p><p>\u201cWow! Fabulous.\u201d</p><p>She pours me a glass and I raise it in a toast. Then I glance at my watch. Fifty-five minutes to go. I need to get cracking on the derailment strategy.</p><p>\u201cSo, any honeymoon plans?\u201d I say casually. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t manage to book anywhere at such short notice. What a shame. A honeymoon is such a special time, you want it to be perfect. If you\u2019d held on a few weeks, I could have helped you arrange something amazing. In fact ... shall we do that?\u201d I put down my glass as though seized by a brilliant new idea. \u201cLottie, let\u2019s put off the wedding just a teeny bit and have fun planning the perfect honeymoon for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d says Lottie happily. \u201cWe already have the perfect honeymoon arranged! One night at the Savoy and then off tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I get ready to trump it. \u201cWhere are you going, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to Ikonos. Back to where we met. Isn\u2019t it perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a backpackers\u2019 guest house?\u201d I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cNo, silly! To that amazing hotel! The Amba. The one with the waterfall. Didn\u2019t you review it?\u201d</p><p>Damn. The Amba is pretty untrumpable. It opened three years ago and we\u2019ve reviewed it twice since then\u2014five stars each time. It\u2019s the most spectacular place in the Cyclades and was voted Top Honeymoon Destination two years running.</p><p>Since then, it\u2019s already become just a touch tacky, truth be told. It\u2019s been flooded with celebrity couples and Hello! magazine photo shoots, and it plays to the \u201choneymoon\u201d market too strongly if you ask me. Still, it remains an amazing, world-class hotel. I\u2019ll need to work hard to talk her out of it.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing about the Amba is, you have to be on the best side.\u201d I shake my head gloomily. \u201cAt such short notice, they\u2019ve probably shoved you in that awful side wing. There\u2019s no sun, and it smells. You\u2019ll be miserable.\u201d I suddenly brighten. \u201cI know! Wait a few weeks, and let me call in a favor. I can get you the Oyster Suite, I\u2019m sure. Honestly, Lotts, the bed alone is worth waiting for. It\u2019s massive, with a glass dome above so you can see the stars. You have to have it.\u201d I proffer my phone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call Ben and say you want to put things off, only for a few weeks\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve got the Oyster Suite!\u201d Lottie interrupts me joyfully. \u201cIt\u2019s all booked! We\u2019re having a bespoke honeymoon, with our own private butler and treatments every day and a day on the hotel yacht!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her, my phone dangling limply in my hand. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a cancelation!\u201d She beams. \u201cBen uses some special concierge service and they fixed it up. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cSuper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIkonos is so special to us.\u201d She\u2019s bubbling over. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been totally ruined, I\u2019m sure. When we were there, they didn\u2019t even have an airport, let alone any big hotels. We had to get there by boat. But, still, it\u2019ll be like going back in time. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point pushing this one any further. I sip my champagne, thinking hard.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a vintage Rolls-Royce today?\u201d I try a different tack. \u201cYou always wanted a vintage Rolls-Royce for your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what a shame!\u201d I put on a stricken expression. \u201cIt was your dream to have a vintage Rolls-Royce. If you just waited a bit, you could have one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFliss.\u201d Lottie gives me a gently chiding smile. \u201cAren\u2019t you being rather shallow? The important thing is love. Finding a life partner. Not some random car. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I smile back tightly. OK, leave the car. Try another approach.</p><p>Dress? No. She\u2019s wearing a lovely dress.</p><p>Wedding-gifts list? No. She\u2019s not that materialistic.</p><p>\u201cSo ... will there be any hymns at the wedding?\u201d I ask at last. There\u2019s silence. Quite a long silence. I stare at Lottie in sudden hope. Her face has tightened.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed hymns,\u201d she says at last, and looks down into her drink. \u201cYou can\u2019t have them at a registry-office wedding.\u201d</p> <p>Yes! Bingo!</p><p>\u201cNo hymns?\u201d I raise a hand to my mouth in horror, as though I hadn\u2019t known this all along. \u201cBut how can you have a wedding without hymns? What about \u2018I Vow to Thee, My Country\u2019? You were always going to have that at your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Lottie was in the choir at our boarding school. She used to sing solos. Music was a big deal to her. I should have started with this tack first.</p><p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s not important.\u201d She smiles briefly\u2014but her whole demeanor has changed.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Ben think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s not really into hymns,\u201d she says after a pause.</p><p>Ben\u2019s not really into hymns.</p><p>I want to whoop. This is it. Her Achilles\u2019 heel. I have her like putty in my hands.</p> <p>\u201cI vow to thee, my country,\u201d I start singing very quietly. \u201cAll earthly things above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she says, almost snapping.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I raise an apologetic hand. \u201cJust ... thinking aloud. For me, a wedding is all about the music. The beautiful, wonderful music.\u201d</p><p>This is untrue. I couldn\u2019t care less about music, and if Lottie were sharper, she\u2019d instantly realize I\u2019m winding her up. But she\u2019s looking away, lost in her own world. Are her eyes a little glassy?</p><p>\u201cI always imagined you kneeling at the altar in a country church with the organ playing,\u201d I muse, rubbing it in. \u201cNot at a registry office. Funny, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even turn her head.</p><p>\u201cDa-da-daah-da-da-da-da-ah-da ...\u201d I\u2019m still humming the tune of \u201cI Vow to Thee, My Country.\u201d Obviously I don\u2019t know all the words, but the tune is enough. That\u2019s what\u2019ll get her.</p><p>Her eyes are glassy. OK, time to go in for the kill.</p><p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d I break off from singing. \u201cThe important thing is that this is your special day. And it\u2019s going to be perfect. Nice and quick. No stupid fussing about with music, or choirboys, or bells pealing from a country steeple ... Just in and out. Sign a paper, say a couple of words, and you\u2019re done. For life,\u201d I add. \u201cFinito.\u201d</p><p>I feel almost cruel. I can see her bottom lip quivering very slightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the bridal scene in The Sound of Music?\u201d I add casually. \u201cWhen Maria walks up the aisle to the nuns\u2019 singing and her big long veil floating everywhere ...\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t overdo it, Fliss.</p><p>I lapse into silence and sip my champagne, waiting. I can see Lottie\u2019s eyes flickering with thoughts. I can sense her inner battle between romance and lust. I think romance is just getting the edge. I think the violins are playing louder than the jungle drums. She looks as if she\u2019s coming to a decision. Please go the right way, go on.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFliss ...\u201d She looks up. \u201cFliss ...\u201d</p><p>Just call me the World Champion Bride Whisperer.</p><p>There was no argument. No confrontation. Lottie thinks it was her idea to postpone. I was the one saying, \u201cAre you sure, Lottie? Are you positive you want to call things off? Really?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve totally sold her on the idea of a country wedding with music and a choir and bells. She\u2019s already looked up the name of the chaplain at our old school. She\u2019s off on a new dream of satin and posies and \u201cI Vow to Thee, My Country.\u201d</p> <p>Which is fine. A wedding is lovely. Marriage is lovely. Maybe Ben is destined to be her life partner and I\u2019ll kick myself as she has her tenth grandchild and think, What was my problem? But at least this way gives her some breathing space. At least it gives her time to look at Ben and think, Hmm. Sixty more years with you. Is this a good idea?</p><p>Lottie\u2019s gone off to the registry office, to tell Ben the news. My work is done. The only task remaining is to buy her Brides magazine. We\u2019re going to meet up for coffee tomorrow and have a cozy chat about veils, and then, in the evening, finally I\u2019ll get to meet Ben.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting to cross the King\u2019s Road, mentally congratulating myself for being so brilliant, when I see a face I recognize. Beaky nose. Windswept dark hair. Rose in his buttonhole. He\u2019s about ten feet tall and is striding along the pavement on the other side, with the kind of thunderous frown that you wear when your rich best friend has been grabbed by an evil gold digger and you\u2019ve got to be best man. As he\u2019s walking, his rose suddenly falls out, and he stops to pick it up. He\u2019s looking at it with such a murderous expression, I almost want to laugh.</p><p>Ha. Well, wait till I tell him. What\u2019s his name again? Oh yes, Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I wave frantically as he moves off. \u201cLorcan! Stop!\u201d</p> <p>His stride is so fast, I\u2019ll never catch up with him. He pauses and swivels round suspiciously, and I wave again to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cOver here! Me! I need to speak to you!\u201d I wait for him to cross, then approach him, brandishing my bouquet. \u201cI\u2019m Fliss Graveney. We spoke yesterday? Lottie\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His face clears briefly, then it\u2019s back to the cheery, wedding-day scowl. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re heading there now?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten about the ridiculous movie-trailer voice. Although somehow it sounds less ridiculous when it\u2019s not a disembodied voice coming down a phone line. It matches his face. Dark and kind of intense.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually ...\u201d I can\u2019t help sounding complacent. \u201cI\u2019m not heading there, because it\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me in shock. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s off. For now,\u201d I add. \u201cLottie\u2019s gone to postpone the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he demands. He\u2019s so bloody suspicious.</p><p>\u201cSo she can make sure Ben\u2019s fortune is invested in a way that makes it easy to plunder,\u201d I say with a shrug. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s face flickers with amusement. \u201cOK. I deserved that. What\u2019s going on? Why is she postponing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked her out of it,\u201d I say proudly. \u201cI know my sister, and I know the power of suggestion. After our little chat, she wants a romantic wedding in a small stone church in the country. That\u2019s why she\u2019s postponing. My reasoning is: if they delay, at least it gives them a chance to see if they\u2019re right for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank God for that.\u201d Lorcan breathes out and runs a hand through his hair. Finally his hackles are coming down; finally his brow is starting to relax. \u201cBen is in no place to be getting married right now. It was nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cInsane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStupidest idea ever. No, I take that back.\u201d I glance down at myself. \u201cPutting me in a purple bridesmaid\u2019s dress was the stupidest idea ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you look very nice.\u201d Another flicker of amusement passes across his face. He glances at his watch. \u201cWhat should I do? I\u2019m supposed to be meeting Ben at the registry office by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. This is weird, standing on a street corner, all dressed up with no wedding to go to. I finger my bouquet awkwardly and wonder if I should throw it in the bin. It seems wrong somehow.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like a drink?\u201d says Lorcan abruptly. \u201cI feel like a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like about six drinks,\u201d I counter. \u201cIt takes it out of you, talking someone out of a wedding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>A man of swift decisions. I like that. He\u2019s already ushering me down a side street, toward a bar with a striped canopy and French-looking tables and chairs.</p><p>\u201cHey, I assume your sister did call it off?\u201d Lorcan stops dead in the doorway. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get an irate text saying, Where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing from Lottie.\u201d I check my phone. \u201cShe was pretty determined to cancel. I\u2019m sure she did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing from Ben either.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s looking at his BlackBerry. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d He ushers me to a corner table and opens the drinks menu. \u201cYou want a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a large gin and tonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou earned it.\u201d He gives that flicker of a smile again. \u201cI\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>He orders the drinks, switches off his phone, and slips it into his pocket. A man who puts away his phone. I like that too.</p><p>\u201cSo, why is it a bad time for Ben to be getting married?\u201d I ask. \u201cIn fact, who is this Ben? Fill me in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBen.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s face twists wryly as though he doesn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cBen, Ben, Ben.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause. Has he forgotten what his best friend is like? \u201cHe\u2019s ... bright. Inventive. He has a lot going for him.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so strained and unconvincing, I stare at him. \u201cDo you realize you sounded as if you were saying, \u2018He\u2019s an ax murderer.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d Lorcan looks caught out.</p><p>\u201cYou did. I\u2019ve never seen anyone look so negative while they\u2019re trying to big up their friend.\u201d I put on a funereal voice. \u201c \u2018He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s inventive. He kills people in their sleep. In inventive ways.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus! Are you always this\u2014\u201d Lorcan breaks off and sighs. \u201cOK. I suppose I\u2019m trying to protect him. He\u2019s in a difficult place, Ben. His father died. The company has an uncertain future, and he needs to decide which direction it\u2019s going in. He\u2019s a natural gambler but he lacks judgment. It\u2019s difficult for him. He\u2019s having a bit of an early midlife crisis, I guess.\u201d</p><p>An early midlife crisis? Oh, perfect. Just what Lottie needs.</p> <p>\u201cNot husband material, then?\u201d I say, and Lorcan snorts.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day. When he\u2019s got his shit together. Last month he was buying a cabin in Montana. Then he was going to buy a boat, sail in races. Before that, he was all about investing in vintage motorbikes. Next week it\u2019ll be some other craze. My guess is he won\u2019t stay married five minutes. I\u2019m afraid your sister will be the casualty.\u201d</p><p>My heart is sinking, fast. \u201cWell, thank God it\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a good thing.\u201d He nods. \u201cNot least because we need Ben around. He can\u2019t go AWOL again.\u201d</p><p>I screw up my eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018AWOL again\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan sighs. \u201cHe did it once before. When his father became ill. Disappeared for ten days. There was a hell of a fuss. We got the police involved, everything. Then he reappeared. No apologies, no explanations. To this day I don\u2019t know where he got to.\u201d</p><p>The drinks arrive and Lorcan raises his glass. \u201cCheers. To canceled weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCanceled weddings.\u201d I lift my own glass and take a delicious gulp of gin and tonic, then return to the subject of Ben. \u201cSo, why is he having a midlife crisis?\u201d</p> <p>Lorcan hesitates, as though he doesn\u2019t want to break his friend\u2019s confidence.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I prod. \u201cI\u2019m nearly related to him, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve known Ben since I was thirteen. We were at school together. My own parents are expats in Singapore and I don\u2019t have any other family. I went to stay with Ben a couple of times in the holidays and I became close to the whole family. Ben\u2019s dad and I share a love of hiking. Shared, I should say.\u201d He pauses, fingers clasped gently round his glass. \u201cBen never came hiking with us. Not interested. And he never wanted to know about the family firm either. He saw it as this massive pressure. Everyone expected he\u2019d join his father as soon as he left school, but it was the last thing he wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come you work for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI joined a few years ago.\u201d Lorcan gives an odd little half smile. \u201cI was going through some ... personal stuff. I wanted to get out of London, so I went to stay with Ben\u2019s dad, up in Staffordshire. At first I was just planning to spend a few days there, go on some hikes, clear my head. But I started getting involved with the company. Never left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStaffordshire?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cBut don\u2019t you live in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have offices in London, of course.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI commute between the two, but I prefer being up there. It\u2019s a beautiful setting. The paper mills are set in a country estate. The offices are in the main house, the family home. It\u2019s Grade One listed. Did you see that BBC series Highton Hall?\u201d he adds. \u201cWell, that\u2019s us. They shot there for eight weeks. Little money-spinner for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighton Hall?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cWow. That place is beautiful. And massive!\u201d</p><p>Lorcan nods. \u201cLots of workers live in cottages on the estate. We do guided tours of the house, the mills, the woodland, we have local conservation projects.... It\u2019s kind of special.\u201d His eyes have lit up.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I\u2019m digesting all this. \u201cSo you started working for the company\u2014but Ben wasn\u2019t interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until his dad became ill and he had to face the fact he was going to inherit this thing,\u201d says Lorcan bluntly. \u201cBefore that, he did everything he could to avoid it. He trained as an actor, he tried out stand-up comedy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was him!\u201d I put my gin and tonic glass down with a tiny crash. \u201cI Googled him and all I could find were stand-up comedy reviews. Terrible ones. Was he that bad?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan stirs his glass, his attention fixed on the remaining ice cubes.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cBetween us. Was he embarrassing?\u201d</p> <p>Lorcan isn\u2019t answering. Well, of course he isn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t want to dis his best friend. I respect that.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say after a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cJust answer me one thing. When I meet him, is he going to tell me jokes and I have to pretend they\u2019re funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out if he starts a riff on jeans.\u201d At last Lorcan looks up, his mouth twitching. \u201cAnd laugh. He\u2019ll be upset if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeans.\u201d I make a mental note. \u201cOK. Thanks for the warning. Is there anything positive to say about this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lorcan seems shocked. \u201cOf course! When Ben\u2019s on form, believe me, there\u2019s no one you\u2019d rather spend the evening with. He\u2019s charming. He\u2019s funny. I can understand why your sister would have fallen for him. When you meet him, you\u2019ll understand too.\u201d</p><p>I take another gulp of my drink. I\u2019m slowly starting to relax. \u201cWell, maybe he\u2019ll become my brother-in-law. But at least it won\u2019t happen today. Job done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Ben later.\u201d Lorcan nods. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t get any stupid ideas.\u201d</p><p>At once I feel a tweak of irritation. I just said \u201cJob done,\u201d didn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to Ben,\u201d I say politely. \u201cI\u2019ve already sorted it. There\u2019s no way Lottie will get married in a hurry now. I\u2019d leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt.\u201d He looks unmoved. \u201cJust to hammer the point home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it can!\u201d I plonk my drink down. \u201cDon\u2019t do any hammering! I\u2019ve spent half an hour making Lottie think that pulling out of the wedding was her idea. I was subtle. I was careful. I didn\u2019t go rushing in like a ... a hammerer.\u201d</p><p>His face doesn\u2019t shift a millimeter. He\u2019s clearly a control freak. But so am I. And this is my sister.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to Ben,\u201d I command him. \u201cLeave it. Less is more.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause\u2014then Lorcan shrugs and drains his drink, without answering. I\u2019m guessing he knows I\u2019m right but doesn\u2019t want to admit it. I finish my gin and tonic too, then wait a beat, almost holding my breath. I\u2019m hoping he suggests another drink, I realize. I only have an empty house to go to. No work. No plans. And the truth is, I like sitting here, sparring with this slightly too intense, slightly bad-tempered man.</p> <p>\u201cAnother?\u201d He looks up and meets my eye, and I feel things shift between us a little. The first drink was like a coda to the whole affair. It was resolution. It was just being polite.</p><p>This is more than polite.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame again?\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch as he summons the waiter and orders. Nice hands. Good strong jaw. Unhurried, laconic mannerisms. He\u2019s a lot more appealing than his webpage gives away.</p><p>\u201cYour website photo is terrible,\u201d I say abruptly, as the waiter disappears. \u201cReally bad. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Lorcan raises his eyebrows, looking taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019re direct.

I don\u2019t even know the guy and I\u2019m critiquing his photo.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I backpedal. \u201cI can be ... blunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeel free to be blunt back.\u201d I meet his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t be offended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d says Lorcan without missing a beat. \u201cThat bridesmaid\u2019s dress is terrible on you.\u201d</p><p>In spite of myself, I feel a flicker of hurt. I didn\u2019t think it was that bad.</p><p>\u201cEarlier on, you said it looked very nice,\u201d I retaliate.</p><p>\u201cI was lying. You look like a fruit pastille.\u201d</p><p>I guess I asked for it.</p> <p>\u201cWell, OK. Maybe I do look like a fruit pastille.\u201d I can\u2019t resist making a little extra dig. \u201cBut at least I don\u2019t have a picture of myself looking like a fruit pastille on my website.\u201d</p><p>The waiter puts down two more gin and tonics, and I pick mine up, feeling a bit fired up after our exchange. I\u2019m also wondering how we\u2019ve got so far off topic. Maybe we should get back to the subject in hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about Lottie and Ben\u2019s no-sex policy, by the way?\u201d I say. \u201cHow ridiculous is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen mentioned something. I thought he was joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no joke. They\u2019re waiting till the wedding night.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIf you want my opinion, it\u2019s irresponsible to get married to someone without sleeping with them. It\u2019s asking for trouble!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting idea.\u201d Lorcan shrugs. \u201cOld-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep gulp. I\u2019m feeling a need to off-load my thoughts on the subject, and I can\u2019t exactly sound off to Noah.</p><p>\u201cIf you want my theory\u201d\u2014I lean forward\u2014\u201cit\u2019s skewed their judgment. The whole thing is about sex. Lottie\u2019s lost in a cloud of lust. The longer she waits, the less she can think straight. I mean, I get it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very hot and she\u2019s longing to roll around with him. But does she have to marry him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cockeyed.\u201d Lorcan nods.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said! They should just go to bed. Spend a week in bed. A month if they want to! Have a good time. Then see if they still want to marry each other.\u201d I take another massive gulp of my drink. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t need to sign your life away just to have sex\u2014\u201d I break off as a thought suddenly occurs to me. \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Divorced. So. We know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d I realize that came out wrong. \u201cMarriage,\u201d I amend.</p><p>Lorcan thinks for a moment, sipping his drink. \u201cThe more I think back over the last few years,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cthe less I feel I know about marriage. Sex, on the other hand, I would hope I\u2019ve nailed.\u201d</p><p>The gin has gone straight to my head. I can feel it buzzing around, loosening my tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>The air seems to thicken in the silence. A little too late, I realize I\u2019ve just told a total stranger that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s good in bed. Do I backtrack? Qualify in some way?</p><p>No. Move on. I cast around for something anodyne, but it\u2019s Lorcan who speaks next.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re speaking frankly\u2014how\u2019ve you found it? Your divorce? Total nightmare?\u201d</p><p>Have I found my divorce a total nightmare?</p><p>I open my mouth and draw in a deep, long breath, automatically reaching for the memory stick round my neck. Then I stop.</p><p>Not bitter, Fliss. Not bitter. Sweet. I need to think spun sugar, candy, flowers, fluffy lambs, Julie Andrews....</p><p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d I give him a saccharine smile. \u201cThese things happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long ago was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill happening.\u201d My smile broadens. \u201cShould be sorted soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re smiling?\u201d He sounds incredulous.</p><p>\u201cI like to be Zen about it.\u201d I nod several times. \u201cStay calm, move on. Look on the bright side. Don\u2019t dwell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s eyes have widened. \u201cI\u2019m impressed. Mine was four years ago. Still hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real pity,\u201d I manage. \u201cPoor you.\u201d</p><p>My fake smile is nearly killing me. I want to ask him how it still hurts and what happened and shall we compare ways in which our exes are total louses? I\u2019m desperate to spill out all the details and talk incessantly about it until I hear from him what I need to hear, i.e., that I\u2019m in the right about everything and Daniel is in the wrong.</p><p>Which, no doubt, is why Barnaby gave me a talking-to.</p><p>He\u2019s always right. Bastard.</p> <p>\u201cSo. Um. Shall I get some more drinks?\u201d I reach for my bag and hurriedly pull out my purse.</p><p>Argh. No.</p><p>The purse flipped up as I tugged it out and with it came the contents of my Durex variety pack. Ribbed for Extra Pleasure falls on the table, and a Pleasuremax lands in Lorcan\u2019s drink, splashing him in the face. A Fetherlite has fallen on top of our bowl of peanuts.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I quickly start grabbing them. \u201cThose aren\u2019t\u2014They were for my son\u2019s school project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lorcan nods, politely retrieving the Pleasuremax from his drink and handing it to me. \u201cHow old\u2019s your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeven?\u201d He looks scandalized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... Long story.\u201d I wince as he hands me the dripping condom. \u201cLet me get you another drink. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Automatically I\u2019ve started drying the Pleasuremax with a paper napkin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d probably chuck that one,\u201d says Lorcan. \u201cUnless you\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p><p>I glance up sharply. He looks deadpan but there\u2019s something about his voice that makes me want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I counter. \u201cWaste not, want not.\u201d I stuff it back into my bag. \u201cAnother gin? Without the contraceptive garnish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d He leans back, tilting his chair to signal at the waiter, and I find my eyes running over his long, lean body. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the gin or the frisson of having told him he\u2019s good in bed or this whole weird situation, but I\u2019m becoming a little fixated. I\u2019m mapping myself onto him in my head. Bit by bit. What would those hands feel like on my skin? What would his hair feel like between my fingers? His jaw is faintly stubbled, which is good. I like friction. I like spark. That\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling between us. The right kind of spark.</p><p>I predict he\u2019s slow and determined in bed. Focused. Takes sex as seriously as he takes fixing his friend\u2019s love life.</p><p>Did I just say predict? What exactly am I thinking myself into here?</p> <p>As Lorcan lets the chair rest back on the ground, he looks at me and his eyelids flicker. He\u2019s thinking something too. His eyes keep skimming over my legs and I casually shift in my seat so that my skirt rucks a little higher.</p><p>I bet he leaves teeth marks. No idea why. I just feel it instinctively.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say. I can\u2019t find any breezy conversational gambits in my head. I want to drink two more gins, I decide. Two gins should do it. And then ...</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I break the silence.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Lorcan nods, then adds casually, \u201cDo you have to get back for your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. He\u2019s sleeping over at a friend\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>And now he looks directly at me and my throat is suddenly tight with longing. It\u2019s been too long. Far too long. Not that I\u2019ll admit that to him. If he asks, I\u2019ll say casually, Oh, I had a recent short-term relationship that didn\u2019t work out. Easy. Normal. Not: I\u2019ve been so alone, so stressed, I\u2019m totally gagging for it, not just the sex but the touching and the intimacy and the feeling of another human being beside me, holding me, even if it\u2019s only for a night or half a night or some portion of a night.</p><p>That\u2019s what I won\u2019t say.</p><p>A waitress comes up with our fresh drinks. She sets them down and then eyes my bouquet, followed by Lorcan\u2019s buttonhole. \u201cOh! Are you two getting married?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help bursting into laughter. Of all the questions.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Lorcan affirms.</p><p>\u201cOnly we have a special champagne deal for wedding parties,\u201d she persists. \u201cWe get so many, what with the registry office down the road. Are you being joined by the bride and groom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, we\u2019re anti-marriage,\u201d I say. \u201cOur motto is: make love, not vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to that.\u201d Lorcan lifts his glass, his eyes glinting.</p><p>The waitress looks from Lorcan to me, laughs uncertainly, then retreats. I down about half my glass. My head is gently spinning and I feel another surge of longing. I\u2019m imagining his lips on mine, his hands ripping off my dress....</p><p>Oh God. Get a grip, Fliss. He\u2019s probably imagining his bus home.</p> <p>I look away again and stir my drink, playing for time. I can never stand this uncertain stage of meeting a man, when you have no idea how things are going. You\u2019re chugging up the slow-climb roller coaster of a date. You know how far up you are, but you don\u2019t know how far he is, or even if he\u2019s really with you. Maybe he\u2019s mentally heading in the other direction. Here I am, already midway through sexual fantasy number 53, but he could be about to wrap up politely and head home.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go somewhere else?\u201d Lorcan says abruptly, and my stomach lurches in anticipation. Somewhere else. Where?</p><p>\u201cThat would be great, yes.\u201d I force myself to sound low key and chilled. \u201cWhat kind of place?\u201d</p><p>He frowns deeply, attacking his ice cubes with his stirrer, as though he has no idea where to start tackling this profound and complex question.</p><p>\u201cWe could eat,\u201d he says finally, with no enthusiasm. \u201cSushi, maybe. Or ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr we could not eat.\u201d</p><p>He looks up, his guard finally down, and I feel a delicious shiver. He\u2019s like a mirror image of me. He has a hungry look in his eye. A desperate longing. He wants to devour something, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sushi.</p><p>\u201cThat could work,\u201d he says, his eyes flicking to my legs again. Leg man, clearly.</p><p>\u201cSo ... where do you live?\u201d I ask lightly, as though it\u2019s a totally unrelated question.</p><p>\u201cNot too far.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are now locked on mine. OK, we\u2019ve reached the top. Together. I can see the view stretching ahead. I can\u2019t help an exhilarated little smile. I think we\u2019re in for a good time.</p> <p>7</p><p>FLISS</p><p>I\u2019m half awake. I think. Oh God. My head hurts.</p><p>So many thoughts. Where do I start? Remembered sensations are crowding out my brain in a blur. And sudden flashes: intense, astonishing memories like squeezes of lemon. Him. Me. Under. Over ... Suddenly I realize I\u2019m mentally intoning Noah\u2019s old picture book, Opposites Are Fun! Inside. Outside. This way. That way.</p><p>But now the fun\u2019s over. It must be morning, if the light dazzling my eyelids is a clue. I\u2019m lying, one leg thrown over the duvet, not quite daring to open my eyes. You. Me. Then. Now. Oh God, now.</p><p>I open one eye a chink and get an eyeful of beige duvet. Ah yes. I remember the beige duvet from last night. Clearly the ex-wife took all the White Company Egyptian cotton and he went to the nearest Linen for Divorced Men store. My head is throbbing, and after a moment the beige starts to shimmer in front of my eyes. So I close them and roll onto my back. I haven\u2019t had a one-night stand in a long time. A looooong time. I\u2019ve forgotten how they go. Awkward kiss? Exchange numbers? Coffee?</p><p>Coffee. I could do with the coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d The sound of his rumbly voice finally brings me into reality. He\u2019s here. In the room.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Um.\u201d I raise myself onto an elbow, playing for time, hastily rubbing sleep from my eyes. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Hello. Goodbye.</p><p>Pulling the duvet around me, I sit up, trying to smile, although my face feels creaky. Lorcan is fully dressed in a suit and tie, holding out a mug. I blink at him for a moment, trying to reconcile the today-him with the last-night-him. Did I dream some of that stuff?</p><p>\u201cCup of tea?\u201d The mug he\u2019s proffering is cheap and striped. From Crockery for Divorced Men, I\u2019m guessing.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I grimace. \u201cSorry. Don\u2019t do tea. Water\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a coffee. And a shower?\u201d</p><p>And a change of clothes. And those documents I left at home and the Molton Brown gift set for Elise\u2019s birthday ... My brain is slowly starting to crank into gear. This was really not a sensible move. I\u2019ll have to whiz back home, postpone my nine a.m. phone interview.... I\u2019m already searching around for my phone. I need to call Sebastian\u2019s house, too, and say good morning to Noah.</p><p>My eye falls on the purple bridesmaid\u2019s dress. Double shit.</p><p>\u201cBathroom\u2019s this way.\u201d Lorcan gestures out the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I gather up the duvet and try to wrap it around myself elegantly, like an actress in a sitcom bedroom scene, but it\u2019s so heavy it\u2019s like trying to wear a polar bear. With an almighty effort I drag it off the bed, take one step, and immediately trip over, bumping into a bureau and hitting my elbow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDressing gown?\u201d He holds out a rather swanky paisley number.

A bit Let me put on your great big manly shirt and allow the sleeves to flap endearingly around my fingers. But I have no choice.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>He averts his eyes politely, like a massage therapist in a spa\u2014i.e., completely pointlessly, since he\u2019s seen it all\u2014and I slip into the gown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sensing you\u2019re a coffee snob.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cWould I be right?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say, \u201cOh no, anything\u2019s fine!\u201d Then I stop. I am a coffee snob. And I\u2019m a tad hungover. And, truth is, I\u2019d rather have no coffee than some depressing cup of dishwater.</p><p>\u201cKind of. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have a two-second shower and get out of here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take two seconds. Same as your shower.\u201d</p><p>He disappears, and I start to look around for my handbag. I\u2019ve got a hairbrush in there. And some hand cream, which could double up as moisturizer. As my gaze rakes around the room, I find myself wondering if I like him. Whether I might see him again. Whether this might even become ... a thing?</p><p>Not a serious thing. I\u2019m mid-divorce; it would be nuts to leap into a relationship. But it was good last night. Even if I\u2019m only remembering half of it accurately, that half was enough to want to reprise it. Maybe we could have some kind of regular arrangement, I find myself thinking. Every month, like a book club.</p><p>Where is my bag? I wander farther into the room and see a fencing mask hanging on a hook. There\u2019s a sword too, or whatever they call them. I\u2019ve always liked the idea of fencing. Oh, I can\u2019t resist. Gingerly, I take the thing off its hook and put it on. There\u2019s a mirror hung on the wall, and I head over to it, brandishing the sword.</p><p>\u201cArise, Sir Thingummy,\u201d I say to my reflection. \u201cHaaa-yah!\u201d I do a kung fu action at myself, and the paisley dressing gown flaps round my ankles.</p> <p>Now I\u2019ve got the giggles. And suddenly I want to share this ridiculous moment with Lottie. I pull out my phone and speed-dial her.</p><p>\u201cHi, Fliss!\u201d she answers at once. \u201cOK, I\u2019m on the Brides website. Veil or no veil? I think veil. What about a train?\u201d</p><p>I blink at the phone, wanting to laugh. She\u2019s become a bridezilla. Naturally. The great thing about Lottie is she doesn\u2019t bear grudges or dwell when she\u2019s thwarted in life. She just changes direction and charges off, eyes on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cVeil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeil.\u201d I realize my voice is muffled in the helmet and shove it up to the top of my head. \u201cVeil. So, you called the wedding off OK? Ben didn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to talk him into it, but he was OK in the end. He said he only wanted what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take your honeymoon night at the Savoy anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She sounds shocked. \u201cI told you, we\u2019re waiting till we\u2019re married!\u201d</p><p>Damn. She\u2019s still on that crazy plan. I was hoping the lust goggles might have slipped a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ben\u2019s happy with that?\u201d I can\u2019t help sounding skeptical.</p><p>\u201cBen wants me to be happy.\u201d Lottie\u2019s voice takes on a familiar, syrupy tone. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m so glad we talked, Fliss. The wedding\u2019s going to be so much nicer. And the plus is: you and Ben can meet each other first!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, introduce him to your family before you walk up the aisle and commit your life to him forever? Are you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think she gets my tone. I think the bridal happy haze is acting as a protective atmosphere. Sarcasm gets burned up before it even reaches her ears.</p><p>\u201cActually, I met his friend Lorcan last night,\u201d I add. \u201cHe\u2019s already filled me in a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She sounds excited. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Lorcan? Wow! What did he say about Ben?\u201d</p><p>What did he say about Ben? Let\u2019s think, now. Ben is in no place to be getting married right now.... He\u2019s having a bit of an early midlife crisis ... your sister will be the casualty....</p><p>\u201cJust the basics,\u201d I prevaricate. \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t wait to meet Ben. Let\u2019s do it very soon. Tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s all have drinks or something. Fliss, you\u2019ll love him. He\u2019s so funny. He used to be a comedian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA comedian.\u201d I adopt an amazed and delighted tone. \u201cWow. I can\u2019t wait. So ... uh ... anyway. Guess where I am right now?

I remember it as quite a big occasion.\u201d</p><p>She was five at the time. Of course she remembers it as big.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, tiny. The whole night was such an ordeal. I had to pretend I was having a good time, and all along ...\u201d I pull a revolted face. I still remember the too-tight bridesmaid\u2019s dress they made me wear. And dancing with Aunt Diana\u2019s beery grown-up friends.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She sounds puzzled. \u201cBut the ceremony was nice, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Terrible.

Joking about things. Like you do.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I remember I\u2019m wearing his fencing helmet. My stomach clenches with fresh embarrassment. Let\u2019s see this through his eyes: I\u2019m standing in his house in his dressing gown, wearing his helmet, and talking about a double wedding. Hastily, I grab the helmet and lift it off my head.</p><p>\u201cThis is ... nice,\u201d I say inanely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you wanted it black or not,\u201d he says after what seems like an eternity.</p><p>\u201cOh. The coffee.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s some other vibe going on here. What? My own voice runs through my head: I had to pretend I was having a good time....</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear that, surely? He didn\u2019t think I was talking about\u2014</p><p>Seriously, tiny. The whole night was such an ordeal.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have thought I meant\u2014</p><p>My stomach drops in horror and I clap a hand over my mouth, quelling a shocked laugh. No. No.</p><p>Should I say\u2014 Should I apologize\u2014</p><p>NO.</p><p>But shouldn\u2019t I at least explain\u2014</p><p>I raise my eyes warily to his. His face is blank. He might not have heard anything. Or he might have.</p><p>There is simply no way to bring up this subject that will not backfire horrendously and make us both want to die. What I need to do is go. Move my feet. Now. Go.</p><p>\u201cSo ... Thanks for the ... um.\u201d I replace the helmet on the hook. Exit, Fliss. Now.</p><p>All morning, I feel aftershocks of embarrassment.</p><p>At least I managed to streak from the taxi to my front door with no neighbors seeing me. I ripped off the purple dress, had the quickest shower known to mankind, then called Noah on speakerphone while I was trying to do speedy makeup. (There is no point in rushing mascara application. I know this. So why do I always fall into the same trap and end up wiping blobs of it off my cheeks and forehead and mirror?) Evidently Noah\u2019s sleepover was a 100 percent rip-roaring, triumphant success. Wish I could say the same about mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to call Lottie back, and anyway I didn\u2019t have time. Instead, I texted her, suggesting drinks at seven P.M.</p><p>Now I\u2019m back at the office, speed-reading a review of a new luxury safari lodge in Kenya, which has just come in, about two thousand words over the limit. Clearly this journalist thinks he\u2019s writing the next Out of Africa. He hasn\u2019t mentioned the pool or the room service or the spa, only the hazy gathering light over the savannah, and the noble bearing of the zebras drinking at dawn, and the shimmering grasslands whose ancient stories beat on in the sound of the Masai drum.</p><p>I scribble Room Service??? in the margin and make a note to email him. Then I look at my phone. It\u2019s surprising that Lottie hasn\u2019t confirmed. I would have thought she\u2019d be dying to tell me how many bridal magazines she\u2019s consumed today.</p><p>I glance at my watch. I\u2019ve got some time now. I can make a little sisterly call. I lean back in my chair and speed-dial her, making a \u201cCup of coffee?\u201d request to Elise through my office window. Elise and I have a pretty good sign-language system going on. I can communicate, \u201cCup of coffee?\u201d \u201cTell them I\u2019m out!!\u201d and \u201cGo home, it\u2019s late!\u201d She can communicate, \u201cCup of coffee?\u201d \u201cI think this one\u2019s important,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m off for a sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFliss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Lottie.\u201d I kick off my shoes and take a swig from my Evian bottle. \u201cSo, are you on for drinks later? Do I get to meet Ben?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence at the other end. Why is there silence? Lottie doesn\u2019t do silence.</p><p>\u201cLottie? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what!\u201d Her voice throbs importantly. \u201cGuess what!\u201d</p> <p>She sounds so pleased with herself, I can tell she\u2019s pulled off something special.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married in the school chapel and the choir is singing \u2018I Vow to Thee, My Country\u2019 while bells peal throughout the land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found a wedding cake made of profiteroles and cupcakes, all covered in sparkly icing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly! We\u2019re married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at the phone blankly.</p> <p>\u201cYes! We\u2019ve done it! Ben and I are married! Just now! Chelsea Register Office!\u201d</p><p>I clench the Evian bottle so hard, a stream of water soars into the air and lands in splotches all over my desk.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say \u2018congratulations\u2019?\u201d she adds, a bit petulantly.</p><p>I can\u2019t say \u201ccongratulations,\u201d because I can\u2019t say anything. My mouth has seized up. I\u2019m hot. No, I\u2019m cold. I\u2019m panicking. How did this happen?</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I manage at last, trying to keep calm. \u201cThat\u2019s ... How come? You were going to delay. I thought you were going to delay. That\u2019s what we agreed. That you would delay.\u201d</p><p>You were meant to DELAY.</p><p>As Elise comes in with a cup of coffee, she looks at me in alarm and makes the \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d sign. But I don\u2019t have a sign for \u201cMy bloody sister has gone and wrecked her life,\u201d so I just nod with a rictus smile and take the cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Lottie\u2019s saying happily. \u201cBen couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought you persuaded him?\u201d I close my eyes and massage my brow, trying to get my head round this. \u201cWhat happened to Brides? What happened to a little country church?\u201d</p><p>What happened to Bridezilla? I want to moan faintly, Bring back Bridezilla.</p><p>\u201cBen was totally on for the church and everything,\u201d says Lottie. \u201cHe\u2019s actually got this sweet, traditional side to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d I try to control my impatience. \u201cWhy did he change his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My eyes open sharply. \u201cWhat do you mean, it was Lorcan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorcan came to see him first thing this morning. He told Ben he mustn\u2019t marry me and it was all a huge mistake. Well, Ben went nuts! He came storming round to my office and said he wanted to be married to me now and everyone else could fuck off, including Lorcan.\u201d Lottie sighs blissfully. \u201cIt was really romantic. Everyone in the office was staring. And then he picked me up and carried me out, just like An Officer and a Gentleman, and everyone cheered. It was amazing, Fliss.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m breathing hard, trying to keep control of myself. That idiot. That stupid, arrogant, fucking ... idiot. I\u2019d solved the problem. It was all sorted. I\u2019d played the diplomatic card to perfection. And now what\u2019s Lorcan done? Blundered in. Stirred up this Ben into the most ludicrous, overblown gesture. No wonder Lottie fell for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuckily there was a cancelation at the registry office, so they could squeeze us in.

Or maybe I want to tip it over my own head. There\u2019s a nasty heaving feeling in my stomach. This is my fault too. I could have stopped this. If I\u2019d told her everything Lorcan said.</p><p>He\u2019s having a bit of an early midlife crisis.... Your sister will be the casualty....</p><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPacking! We\u2019re off to Ikonos! It\u2019s so exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet it is,\u201d I say feebly.</p><p>What do I do? There\u2019s nothing I can do. They\u2019re married.

Frantically, I speed-dial her again, but it goes to voicemail.</p><p>Baby? Baby?</p><p>I want to whimper. Is she insane? Does she have any idea what strain a baby will bring to the party?</p><p>My love life has been such a clusterfuck. I can\u2019t bear it if Lottie\u2019s is too. I wanted her to crack it the way I didn\u2019t. I wanted her fantasy to come true. Happy ever after. Picket fence. Strong, lasting happiness. Not a honeymoon baby with some flake-head who\u2019s on a brief domesticity craze before taking up motorbikes. Not sitting in Barnaby Rees\u2019s office with red eyes and hair that needs washing and a toddler trying to eat all the law books.</p><p>On impulse, I Google the Amba Hotel. At once, a series of holiday-porn images greets my eyes. Blue skies and sunsets. The famous grotto swimming pool, with its thirty-foot tumbling waterfall. Beautiful couples strolling by the sea. Massive beds, scattered with rose petals. Let\u2019s face it, they\u2019ll have made a honeymoon baby before the wedding night is over. Lottie\u2019s ovaries will twang into action and she\u2019ll be vomiting all the way home.</p> <p>Then if he does turn out to be a flake ... if he does let her down ... I close my eyes and bury my face in my hands. I can\u2019t bear it. I need to talk to Lottie. Face-to-face. Properly. With her brain engaged, not in fantasyland. At least make sure she\u2019s thought through all the consequences of what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting utterly still, my mind skittering back and forth like a mouse trapped in a maze. I\u2019m trying to find a solution, I\u2019m trying to find a way out, I keep coming up against dead ends....</p><p>Until suddenly I lift my head and take a deep breath. I\u2019ve come to a decision. It\u2019s huge and extreme, but I have no choice. I\u2019m going to gate-crash her honeymoon.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a heinous thing to do. I don\u2019t care if she never forgives me: I\u2019ll never forgive myself if I don\u2019t. Marriage was one thing. Unprotected sex is another. I need to get out there. I need to save my sister from herself.</p><p>Abruptly, I pick up the phone and dial Travel.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say as Clarissa, our travel booker, answers. \u201cBit of an emergency, Clarissa. I need to get out to Ikonos asap. The Greek island. First available flight. And I need to stay in the Amba. They know me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I can hear her tapping at the computer. \u201cThere\u2019s only one flight direct to Ikonos a day, you know. Otherwise it\u2019s a change at Athens, which ends up taking forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Get me on the next direct flight you can. Thanks, Clarissa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you just reviewed the Amba?\u201d She sounds surprised. \u201cA few months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing a follow-up,\u201d I lie smoothly. \u201cSudden decision. It\u2019s a new feature idea we\u2019ve had,\u201d I add, to cement my story. \u201cSpot checks on hotels.\u201d</p><p>This is the plus of being editor. No one questions me. Also: that is a good idea. I open my BlackBerry and type in: Spot checks??</p><p>\u201cOK! Well, I\u2019ll let you know. Hopefully we can get you on the flight tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I ring off and drum my fingers, still tense. Even at my quickest, I won\u2019t get out there for a good twenty-four hours. Lottie is already on her way to the airport. She\u2019ll be on today\u2019s afternoon flight. She\u2019ll get to the hotel by this evening. The Oyster Suite will be there, waiting, with its super-king bed and sunken Jacuzzi and champagne.</p><p>How many people conceive a baby on their wedding night? Could I find this out from Google? I type in conceive baby first night honeymoon, then restlessly cancel it. Google isn\u2019t the point. Lottie\u2019s the point. If only I could stop them. If only I could get in there before they ...

Consummate it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cConsummate.\u201d The word provokes a vague memory.

The marriage never existed.</p><p>The marriage never existed!</p><p>This is it. This is the answer. Annulment! The loveliest word in the English language. The solution to everything. No divorce. No legal tussle. Just blink and it\u2019s over. It never happened.</p><p>I need to do this for Lottie. I need to get her an opt-out. But how on earth can I achieve it?

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s with trepidation or determination.</p> <p>\u201cAmba Hotel, VIP Services, how may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, my voice a bit jumpy. \u201cCould I please speak to Nico Demetriou? Tell him it\u2019s Fliss Graveney from Pincher Travel Review. Tell him ... it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m put on hold, I picture Nico, all five foot three of him, his suit straining against his stomach. I knew Nico at the Mandarin Oriental in Athens and before that at Sandals in Barbados. He\u2019s been in hotels all his life, working his way up from bellboy, and he\u2019s now VIP concierge at the Amba. I can see him now, bustling across the marble floor of the lobby in his patent shoes, his eyes always sharply darting around.</p><p>His specialty is \u201cGuest Experience.\u201d Whether it\u2019s a personalized cocktail, a helicopter trip, swimming with dolphins, or a troupe of belly dancers in your room, he\u2019ll fix it. If I could have any partner in crime, it would be Nico.</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d His voice booms happily down the phone. \u201cI have heard this very minute that you are planning to pay us a visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll arrive tomorrow night, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are honored to see you again so soon! Can I assist you with anything in particular? Or perhaps this is a personal visit?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the question in his voice. A hint of suspicion. Why am I coming back? What\u2019s up?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of personal.\u201d I pause, marshaling my words. \u201cNico, I have a favor to ask. My sister is heading out to the Amba today. She\u2019s just got married. She\u2019s on honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d His voice almost blasts me away. \u201cYour sister will have the holiday of her lifetime. I will appoint my most trusted butler for her benefit. We will meet her on arrival, and over a glass of champagne we will tailor-make her experience. Perhaps an upgrade, perhaps a special dinner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico, no. You don\u2019t understand. I mean, that sounds wonderful. But I have a different favor to ask you.\u201d I twist my fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s ... unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been in this job for many years,\u201d says Nico kindly. \u201cNothing is unusual for me, Nico. You wish to surprise her? You would like me to place a present in her room? You would like me to arrange a couples\u2019 massage on the beach in a private cabana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. How do I put this?</p> <p>Come on, Fliss. Just say it.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stop them from having sex,\u201d I say in a rush.</p><p>There\u2019s absolute silence down the line. I\u2019ve confounded even Nico.</p><p>\u201cFliss, repeat to me your request again,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI fear I have not understood.\u201d</p><p>I fear he has.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stop them from having sex,\u201d I repeat, enunciating as clearly as I can. \u201cNo sex. No wedding night. At least, not till I get out there. Do whatever you can. Put them in separate rooms. Distract them. Kidnap one of them. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they are on their honeymoon.\u201d He sounds utterly flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cI know. And that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are trying to disrupt your own sister\u2019s wedding night?\u201d His voice rises in shock. \u201cYou are trying to come between a man and his new wife? Who have been joined before God?\u201d</p><p>I should have explained this better.</p><p>\u201cNico, she\u2019s rushed into this marriage. And it wasn\u2019t before God! It\u2019s a big, stupid mistake. I need to talk to her. I\u2019m flying out as soon as I can, but in the meantime, if we can just keep them apart ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes she not like the fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes him very much.\u201d I wince. \u201cIn fact, she\u2019s kind of desperate to leap into bed with him. So it\u2019s going to be a challenge to stop them.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence. I can only imagine Nico\u2019s perplexed expression.</p><p>\u201cFliss, I\u2019m afraid I cannot agree to this strange request,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI can, however, offer your sister a complimentary dinner at the chef\u2019s table at our five-star seafood restaurant\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNico, please. Please listen,\u201d I cut across him desperately. \u201cThis is my little sister, OK? She was dumped by the man she loves and she rushed into marriage like a kind of revenge. She barely knows this guy. Now she\u2019s talking about getting pregnant. I\u2019ve never even met him, but apparently he\u2019s a flake. Imagine if your daughter was letting her life be ruined by the wrong guy. You\u2019d do everything you could to stop it, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve met Nico\u2019s daughter, Maya. She\u2019s an adorable ten-year-old with ribbons in her hair. Surely that will get to him?</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t have sex, the marriage can be annulled.\u201d I spell it out for him. \u201cIt won\u2019t be legally consummated. But if they do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do, it is their business!\u201d Nico sounds at the end of his tether. \u201cThis is a hotel, Fliss, not a prison! I cannot constantly supervise my guests\u2019 whereabouts! I cannot monitor their ... activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you couldn\u2019t do it?\u201d I throw down the challenge. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stop them from getting it on for twenty-four hours?\u201d</p> <p>The thing about Nico is, he prides himself on being able to solve any problem. Any problem. I bet he\u2019s already imagining how he\u2019d do it.</p><p>\u201cIf you can do this for me, I\u2019ll be eternally grateful.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019ll express my gratitude by reviewing the hotel again. Five stars. Guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have already had the privilege of a five-star review in your magazine,\u201d he bats me back.</p><p>\u201cSix stars, then,\u201d I improvise. \u201cI\u2019ll invent a new category, just for you. \u2018The new world-class super-luxe.\u2019 And I\u2019ll flag the hotel on the front cover. Do you know how much that\u2019s worth? Do you know how pleased your directors would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, I understand your dilemma,\u201d Nico shoots back. \u201cHowever, you must realize that I cannot possibly interfere with guests\u2019 private lives, especially when they are here to enjoy their honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>He sounds fairly resolute. I\u2019m going to have to pull something pretty massive out of the bag.</p> <p>\u201cOK!\u201d I drop my voice still lower. \u201cListen. If you help me out with this, I\u2019ll publish a profile of you in the magazine. You personally, Nico Demetriou. I\u2019ll call you ... the secret of the Amba\u2019s success. The most prized asset of the hotel. The go-to VIP manager. Everyone in the industry will see it. Everyone.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need to spell out the rest. The magazine is distributed in sixty-five countries. Every CEO of every hotel at least glances through it. A profile like that would be his ticket to any job he wanted in the world.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve always dreamed about the Four Seasons, New York,\u201d I add softly.</p><p>My heart is pounding a little. I\u2019ve never abused my power before, and it\u2019s giving me a rush. Partly good, partly bad. This is how corruption starts, I reflect. Next thing, I\u2019ll be exchanging reviews for suitcases of cash and Trident missiles.</p><p>It\u2019s a one-off, I tell myself firmly. A one-off with extenuating circumstances.</p><p>Nico is quiet. I can feel his conscience rubbing against professional ambition, and I feel bad for putting him in this position. But it\u2019s not me who began this whole charade, is it?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a master, Nico.\u201d I add some flattery. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius at making things happen. If anyone in the world can do this, you can.\u201d</p><p>Is he persuaded? Am I nuts? Is he even now sending an email to Gavin?</p> <p>I\u2019m on the point of giving up, when his voice suddenly comes low down the phone: \u201cFliss, I do not promise anything.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden bubble of hope.</p><p>\u201cI understand completely,\u201d I reply, matching his tone. \u201cBut ... you\u2019ll try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try. Just for twenty-four hours. What is your sister\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Yes!</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Graveney.\u201d I\u2019m almost gabbling with relief. \u201cAlthough I guess she\u2019ll be under Mrs. Parr. Her husband\u2019s Ben Parr. They\u2019re booked into the Oyster Suite. And I don\u2019t mind what they do, as long as they don\u2019t have sex. With each other,\u201d I add as an afterthought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a long silence, then Nico says simply:</p><p>\u201cThis will be a very strange honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>LOTTIE</p> <p>I\u2019m married! My mouth is fixed in a permanent, gleeful smile. I\u2019m so euphoric, I feel like I might float away. Today has been the best, most magical, most extraordinary day of my life. I\u2019m married!! I\u2019m married!!!</p><p>I still keep replaying the moment when I looked up from my desk to see Ben marching into the office, holding a bouquet of roses. His jaw was set and his eyes were flashing, and you could see he meant business. Even my boss, Martin, came out of his office to watch. The whole place was hushed as Ben stood at my office door and proclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you, Lottie Graveney, and I\u2019m going to do it today.\u201d</p><p>Then he lifted me up\u2014lifted me up\u2014and everyone cheered, and Kayla came running after me with my bag and phone, and Ben handed me the bouquet and that was it. I was a bride.</p><p>I barely remember the marriage ceremony. I was in a state of shock. Ben practically jumped on each answer; I do remember that. He didn\u2019t pause for a moment\u2014in fact he sounded almost aggressive as he said, \u201cI do.\u201d He\u2019d brought along some environmental confetti, which we sprinkled on ourselves, and he opened a bottle of champagne and then it was time to pack and leave for the airport. I haven\u2019t even got changed; I\u2019m still in my work suit. I got married in my work suit and I don\u2019t care!</p><p>I catch sight of myself in the mirror above the drinks bar and want to giggle. I look as flushed and giddy as I feel. We\u2019re in the business-class lounge at Heathrow, waiting for the Ikonos flight. I haven\u2019t eaten anything since breakfast, but I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019m hyped up. My hands won\u2019t stop trembling.</p> <p>I take a few slices of fruit and a sliver of Emmental, just for the sake of it, then jump as I feel a hand on my leg.</p><p>\u201cFueling up?\u201d comes Ben\u2019s voice in my ear, and I feel a delicious shiver. I turn to face him and he nuzzles my neck, his hand traveling up discreetly under my skirt. That\u2019s good. Oh, that\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he murmurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I murmur back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot.\u201d His breath is warm against my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hotter.\u201d</p> <p>Yet again I work out how long we have to wait. Our flight to Ikonos is three and a half hours. It can\u2019t take more than two hours to go through customs and get to the hotel. Ten minutes for them to take our luggage up ... five minutes to show us how the light switches work ... thirty seconds to put up the DO NOT DISTURB sign ...</p><p>Nearly six hours. I\u2019m not sure I can wait nearly six hours. Ben seems the same way too. He\u2019s actually panting. Both his hands are roaming between my thighs. I can hardly concentrate on the fig compote.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d An elderly man pushes his way between us and starts forking Emmental slices onto his plate. He eyes Ben and me with disfavor. \u201cAs they say,\u201d he adds ponderously, \u201cget a room.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself flush. We weren\u2019t that obvious.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our honeymoon,\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d The old man looks unimpressed. \u201cI hope your young man will wash his hands before serving himself any food.\u201d</p><p>Spoilsport.</p><p>I glance at Ben and we both move away, to a set of plushy chairs. I\u2019m pulsating all over. I want his hands back where they were, doing what they were doing.</p> <p>\u201cSo. Um. Cheese?\u201d I proffer the plate to Ben.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d He frowns moodily.</p><p>This is torture. I look at my watch. Only two minutes have passed. We\u2019re going to have to fill the time somehow. Conversation. That\u2019s what we need. Conversation.</p><p>\u201cI love Emmental,\u201d I begin. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I log this new fact about him. \u201cWow. I had no idea you hated Emmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went totally off it the year I lived in Prague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lived in Prague?\u201d I say with interest.</p><p>I\u2019m intrigued. I had no idea Ben had lived abroad. Or hated Emmental. This is the great advantage of marrying someone without spending years living together first. You still have stuff to find out. We\u2019re on an adventure of discovery together. We\u2019ll spend our whole lives exploring one another. Unwrapping each other\u2019s secrets. We\u2019ll never be that couple sitting in dead silence because they know everything and have said everything and are just waiting for the bill.</p><p>\u201cSo ... Prague! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember now.\u201d Ben shrugs. \u201cThat was the year I learned circus skills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Circus skills? I wasn\u2019t expecting that one. I\u2019m about to ask what else he\u2019s done, when his phone bleeps with a text and he pulls it out of his pocket. As he reads it, his brow creases angrily and I look at him in concern.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Lorcan. He can fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan again. I\u2019m dying to meet this Lorcan. I\u2019m actually feeling quite grateful to him. If he hadn\u2019t said whatever he did to Ben, Ben would never have rushed to my office and I would never have had the most romantic experience of my life.</p> <p>I rub Ben\u2019s arm sympathetically. \u201cIsn\u2019t he, like, your oldest friend? Shouldn\u2019t you make up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was once.\u201d Ben scowls.</p><p>I glance over his shoulder at the screen and catch a bit of the text.</p><p>You can\u2019t run away from these decisions, Ben.</p><p>You know how hard everyone has worked, and to go AWOL now is simply</p> <p>Ben moves the phone out of sight and I don\u2019t like to ask if I can read the rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat decisions?\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just some tedious, boring piece of crap.\u201d Ben glowers at the phone. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not running away. Jesus. The thing with Lorcan is, he wants me to do everything his way. He got used to running the show with my dad. Well, things have changed.\u201d</p><p>He types something short, his thumbs stabbing at the phone. Almost at once a reply arrives, and he curses under his breath.</p><p>\u201cPriorities. He\u2019s talking to me about priorities. I\u2019m having a life. I\u2019m doing what I should have done fifteen years ago. I should have married you then. We\u2019d have ten kids.\u201d</p><p>I feel a swell of love for him. He wants a big family! We\u2019ve never talked about it before, but I was really hoping he wanted lots of kids too. Maybe four. Maybe six!</p> <p>\u201cWe can make up for that now.\u201d I lean in and nuzzle his neck. After a few seconds, Ben lets his phone drop onto the seat.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he says. \u201cNothing matters except us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cI remember the moment I fell for you. It was that day you did cartwheels on the beach. You were sunbathing on that rock in the middle of the sea. You dived off the rock and swam to the beach, and then, instead of walking back, you did cartwheels all the way along. I don\u2019t think you knew anyone was watching you.\u201d</p><p>I remember that too. I remember the feel of the flat sand beneath my palms. My hair swinging. I was lithe and athletic. I had abs like a washboard.</p><p>And of course I knew he was watching me.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me wild, Lottie.\u201d His hands are edging up my skirt again. \u201cYou always did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, we can\u2019t.\u201d I glance over at the elderly gentleman, who catches my eye over the top of his newspaper. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I.\u201d My body is pulsating all over again. \u201cBut we have to.\u201d I check my watch yet again. Barely ten minutes have passed now. How are we going to last?</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Ben meets my eyes, lowering his voice. \u201cHave you been to the loos here? They\u2019re big.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAnd unisex.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a giggle. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His eyes glint. \u201cYou up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Still twenty minutes till boarding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I hesitate, feeling torn. It\u2019s not exactly the way I pictured my honeymoon night\u2014a quick encounter in a Heathrow loo. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be so desperate. \u201cWhat about our wedding night?\u201d I can\u2019t help clinging to my plan. \u201cWhat about making it special and romantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill will be.\u201d His fingers are gently playing with my earlobe, sending starbursts of sensation down my neck. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the main event. This is the preview.\u201d His fingers have found my bra strap. \u201cAnd, quite frankly, if we don\u2019t soon, I\u2019ll burst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll burst too.\u201d I quell a gasp. \u201cOK, you go first. Find us somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text.\u201d</p><p>He gets up and walks swiftly toward the unisex washrooms. I lean back on my seat and try not to giggle. This place is so quiet and stuffy, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll pull it off.</p><p>I get out my phone to wait for his text and, on impulse, pull up Fliss\u2019s number. She and I have always joked about the Mile-High Club. I can\u2019t resist telling her. I send a quick text:</p><p>Have u ever wondered what it\u2019s like doing it in an airport lounge loo? I\u2019ll let you know.</p><p>I\u2019m not really expecting her to reply. It\u2019s only a silly, jokey text.

I fire off another text:</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re married.</p><p>I take a sip of water, then hear another ping. This time it\u2019s a text from Ben.</p> <p>3rd cubicle on left. Knock twice.</p><p>I feel a delicious shiver and text back:</p><p>Coming.</p><p>As I pick up my bag, I see that Fliss has texted again:</p><p>Really, really think you should wait!!!! Save till hotel!!!!</p> <p>This is getting annoying. I only texted her for fun, not to get some stupid lecture. What\u2019s she worried about, that we\u2019ll get caught and somehow people will link her to me and her precious magazine will be brought into disrepute? I send a cross reply:</p><p>None of your business.</p><p>As I cross the lounge toward the washrooms, I\u2019m actually trembling with anticipation. I knock twice on the third cubicle door, and as Ben sweeps me in, he\u2019s already half undressed.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Oh God ...\u201d</p><p>His mouth is immediately on mine, his hand is in my hair, now he\u2019s unhooking my bra and I\u2019m wriggling out of my knickers. I\u2019ve never moved so fast. I\u2019ve never wanted it so fast. I\u2019ve never needed it so badly in my life.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d we keep whispering to each other as we bump against the cubicle walls. Thank God they\u2019re sturdy.

We might make a baby!</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He suddenly pauses. \u201cHave you got into any kinky stuff since we last did it? Anything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d I say breathlessly, hoicking my skirt up farther. \u201cTell you later. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK! Give me a chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rap-rap-rap-rap!</p><p>The knocking at the cubicle door nearly gives me a heart attack, and I bash my knee on the cistern. What? What?</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d a female voice is calling from the other side of the door. \u201cThis is the lounge manager speaking. Is there someone in there?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I can\u2019t answer. I can\u2019t move. Ben and I eye each other in panic.</p><p>\u201cCould you please open the door?\u201d</p><p>My leg is still wrapped round Ben\u2019s back. The other foot is on the loo seat. I have no idea where my underwear is. Worst of all, my entire body is still throbbing with need.</p><p>Could we just ignore this lounge manager? Keep going? I mean, what can they do?</p><p>\u201cCarry on?\u201d I mouth at Ben. \u201cReally quietly?\u201d I gesture to make myself clear, and the loo seat creaks. Shit.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019m afraid I will have to use a passkey to gain access,\u201d the voice is saying.</p><p>They have a passkey to the loos? What is this, a fascist state?</p><p>I\u2019m still breathing as hard as ever. But now it\u2019s with miserable frustration. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t consummate my marriage with a lounge manager listening six inches away, the other side of the door, poised with a passkey.</p><p>There\u2019s more knocking at the door. In fact, it\u2019s becoming more like a pounding.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d the woman is demanding. \u201cCan anyone hear me in there?\u201d</p><p>I meet Ben\u2019s eyes ruefully. We\u2019re going to have to answer, before she bursts in with a SWAT team.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi there!\u201d I call back, hastily hooking my bra up. \u201cSorry! I was just ... fixing my ... head.\u201d</p><p>My head? Where did that come from?</p><p>\u201cMy husband was helping me,\u201d I add, searching around for my knickers. Ben is pulling up his trousers. It\u2019s over.</p><p>Dammit. I can\u2019t find my knickers. I\u2019ll have to leave them. I quickly brush back my hair, glance at Ben, pick up my handbag, then unlock the door and smile at the gray-haired woman standing outside the door, together with a younger brunette sidekick.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d I say smoothly. \u201cI have a medical complaint. My husband has to help me administer a serum. We prefer privacy for the application.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes run over me suspiciously. \u201cDo you need me to call a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m fine now. Thank you, darling,\u201d I add to Ben, for good measure.</p><p>Her eyes drop to the floor. \u201cAre those yours?\u201d I follow her gaze and curse inwardly. My knickers. That\u2019s where they were.</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re not mine,\u201d I say with cutting dignity.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She turns to the sidekick. \u201cLesley, please tell a cleaner to come and refresh this cubicle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh God.

What with your job and ... everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both staring at the ceiling, as though to expunge the memory of that time Daniel had just brought in his new set of big-gun lawyers and I burst into tears at pickup time and practically sobbed on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She sighs. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say humbly.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s having his extra lesson at the moment, but if you come in, I\u2019ll give you his bag.\u201d</p><p>I follow her into the empty classroom, which smells of wood and paint and Play-Doh. The assistant teacher, Ellen, is tidying away some plastic counters and she beams up at me. Ellen has a high-salaried husband in banking and is a great fan of five-star hotels. She reads the magazine every month and is always questioning me about the latest spa treatments and whether Dubai is over.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Phipps is taking Noah on an educational trip to a Greek island,\u201d says Mrs. Hocking, in deadpan tones that clearly mean, This irresponsible parent is going on a drugs-and-booze mini-break and is dragging her poor son along to get high on the fumes; what can I do? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLovely!\u201d Ellen says. \u201cBut what about your new puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d I stare at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cNoah was telling us about your new puppy. The cocker spaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocker spaniel?\u201d I laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s got that idea from. We don\u2019t have a puppy, nor are we getting a puppy\u2014\u201d I break off. Mrs. Hocking and Ellen are exchanging looks. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence\u2014then Mrs. Hocking sighs. \u201cWe did wonder. Tell me, has Noah\u2019s grandfather died recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t have an operation on his hand during the holidays?\u201d chimes in Ellen. \u201cAt Great Ormond Street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I look from face to face. \u201cIs that what he\u2019s been saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry,\u201d says Mrs. Hocking hurriedly. \u201cWe noticed last term that Noah seemed to have ... quite an imagination. He\u2019s been coming out with all sorts of stories, some of which are obviously untrue.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her in dismay. \u201cWhat other stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal for children to live in a fantasyland at his age.\u201d She\u2019s deflecting me. \u201cAnd, of course, he has had an unsettling time at home. He\u2019ll grow out of it, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other stories?\u201d I persist.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Again Mrs. Hocking exchanges looks with Ellen. \u201cHe said he\u2019d had a heart transplant. Obviously we knew that wasn\u2019t the case. He mentioned a surrogate baby sister, which again we thought probably wasn\u2019t true....\u201d</p><p>A heart transplant? A surrogate baby sister? How does Noah even know about things like that?</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have a word with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTread lightly.\u201d Mrs. Hocking smiles. \u201cAs I say, it\u2019s a perfectly normal phase. He may be attention-seeking or he may not even realize he\u2019s doing it. Either way, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll grow out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe even said you once threw all your husband\u2019s clothes onto the street and invited the neighbors to help themselves!\u201d says Ellen with a bright laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s got such an imagination!\u201d</p><p>My face flames. Damn. I thought he was asleep when I did that.</p><p>\u201cWhat an imagination!\u201d I try to sound natural. \u201cWho on earth would do a thing like that?\u201d</p><p>My face is still hot as I arrive at the special-educational-needs department. Noah has special after-school lessons every Wednesday, because his handwriting is terrible. (The official reason has \u201cspatial coordination\u201d in the title, and costs sixty pounds per session.)</p><p>There\u2019s a waiting area outside the door, and I sit down on the miniature sofa. Opposite me is a shelf full of pencils with special grips and odd-shaped scissors and beanbags. There\u2019s a rack of books with titles like How Do I Feel Today? On the wall, a TV is softly burbling away with some special kids\u2019 program.</p><p>They could do with a department like this at the office, I find myself thinking. I wouldn\u2019t mind escaping for half an hour a week to play with beanbags and point to the flash card reading Today I\u2019m Sad Because My Boss Is a Git.</p><p>\u201c... I had an operation at Great Ormond Street.\u201d A voice from the TV attracts my attention. \u201cMy hand was sore afterward and I couldn\u2019t write anymore.\u201d I look up to see a small Asian-looking girl talking to the camera. \u201cBut Marie helped me learn to write again.\u201d Music starts playing, and there\u2019s a scene of the little girl struggling with a pencil while a woman guides her. The final shot is of the girl beaming proudly while holding up a picture she\u2019s drawn. The image fades and I blink at the TV, puzzled.</p> <p>Great Ormond Street. Is that coincidence?</p><p>\u201cMy mummy is having a surrogate baby.\u201d A freckled boy appears on-screen as the music changes. \u201cAt first I felt left out. But now I\u2019m really excited.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I grab the remote and turn up the volume as Charlie introduces his surrogate baby sister. The piece ends with them all sitting in the garden together. Next up is Romy, who has had a cochlear implant, and then Sara, whose mummy has had plastic surgery and looks different now (but that\u2019s OK), and then David with his new heart.</p><p>The DVD doesn\u2019t have a point to it, I swiftly appreciate. It\u2019s a promotional freebie for other DVDs. And it\u2019s just running on a loop. One inspirational, heart-churning story after another.</p><p>I\u2019m almost blinking with tears as each kid tells his or her poignant tale. But I\u2019m seething with frustration too. Did no one think to watch this DVD? Has no one linked Noah\u2019s stories to what he\u2019s been watching? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow I can run and play,\u201d David is saying joyfully to the camera. \u201cI can play with Lucy, my new puppy.\u201d</p><p>Lucy is a cocker spaniel. Of course.</p><p>The door suddenly opens, and Noah is ushered out by the SEN teacher, Mrs. Gregory.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mrs. Phipps,\u201d she says as she does every week. \u201cNoah\u2019s making very good progress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I smile pleasantly back. \u201cNoah, sweetheart, put on your coat.\u201d As he heads to the pegs, I turn back to Mrs. Gregory and lower my voice. \u201cMrs. Gregory, I was just watching your interesting DVD. Noah has quite an imagination, and I think he may be identifying with the kids shown in it a little too much. Could you possibly turn it off when he\u2019s sitting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdentifying?\u201d She looks puzzled. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Mrs. Hocking he\u2019d had a heart transplant,\u201d I say bluntly. \u201cAnd an operation on his hand in Great Ormond Street. It all came from that DVD.\u201d I gesture at the TV.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her face falls. \u201cOh goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm done, but maybe you could put on a different DVD? Or just turn it off?\u201d I smile sweetly. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p> <p>Some children think they\u2019re Harry Potter. Trust mine to think he\u2019s the star of a self-help DVD. As I walk out with Noah, I squeeze his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, darling, I was watching your teacher\u2019s DVD. It\u2019s fun to watch stories, isn\u2019t it? Stories about other people,\u201d I add for emphasis.</p><p>Noah considers this for a long, thoughtful moment.</p><p>\u201cIf your mummy has plastic surgery,\u201d he says at last, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter. Even if she looks different. Because she\u2019s probably happier now.\u201d</p><p>My smile freezes. Please don\u2019t say he\u2019s told the teachers I\u2019ve had plastic surgery and am happier now.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I try to sound relaxed. \u201cUm, Noah. You do know that Mummy hasn\u2019t had plastic surgery, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s avoiding my gaze. Oh God. What\u2019s he said?</p><p>I\u2019m about to reiterate to him my complete lack of plastic surgery (one Botox session doesn\u2019t count) when my phone bleeps. It\u2019s a text from Lottie. Oh God. Please don\u2019t say they\u2019ve somehow managed it.</p><p>We\u2019re boarding. What do u think of the Mile-High Club? Could call baby Miles Or Miley xxx</p><p>Swiftly I text back:</p><p>Don\u2019t be gross! Have a good one xxx</p><p>I stare at my phone for a few seconds after I\u2019ve pressed send. They won\u2019t try to do it on the plane. Surely not. Anyway, the airport staff will have put in a discreet call to the cabin crew, warning them about the frisky couple in business. They\u2019ll be on the case; I can relax.</p><p>Still, my heart\u2019s thudding. I glance at my watch and feel a renewed frustration at the totally crap travel options. One direct flight to Ikonos a day? It\u2019s insane. I want to be there now.</p><p>But since I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going to do a bit of research.</p> <p>I find it exactly where I expected to: in the box under her bed, stacked with all the others. Lottie started keeping a diary when she was fifteen, and it was a pretty big deal. She used to read bits out to me and talk about getting them published one day. She would say portentously, \u201cAs I wrote in my diary yesterday ...\u201d as though somehow that made her thoughts far more significant than mine (unrecorded, lost to the mists of time. History will weep, obviously).</p><p>I\u2019ve never read Lottie\u2019s diaries before. I\u2019m a moral person. Also: I can\u2019t be bothered. But I have to know a little about this Ben guy, and this is the only source I can think of. No one will ever know what I did.</p><p>Noah\u2019s safely watching Ben 10 in the kitchen. I sit down on her bed, and Lottie-scent wafts up from the duvet cover: floral, sweet, and clean. When she was eighteen she wore Eternity, and I can catch a whiff of that too, coming from the pages of the diary.</p><p>Right. Let\u2019s dive in, quick. I feel very tense and guilty sitting here, even though I\u2019m Lottie\u2019s key holder and have a perfect right to be in her flat and she\u2019s on a plane, miles away, and, anyway, if someone did walk in I would thrust the diary very quickly under a pillow and say, Just here for security reasons.</p><p>I open the diary at random.</p><p>Fliss is such a bitch.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d I automatically respond.</p><p>OK, that was needless and immature. I shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions. There\u2019ll be some explanation. I look more closely at the entry. Apparently I wouldn\u2019t lend her my denim jacket to take on her gap-year trip.</p><p>Oh, really? I\u2019m a bitch because I wouldn\u2019t just hand over my jacket which I paid for? I\u2019m so outraged I feel like phoning her up right now and having this out. And, by the way, where has she written about how I did give her about six pairs of flip-flops and never saw them back and my Chanel sunglasses because she begged and begged? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at the diary, seething gently, then force myself to turn over a few pages. I can\u2019t wallow in some fifteen-year-old argument. I need to skip ahead. I need to get to Ben. As I turn the pages, skimming the text, I almost feel like I\u2019m on her gap-year journey with her: first to Paris and then to the South of France, then Italy, all in bite-size snippets. It\u2019s kind of addictive.</p><p>... think I might move to Paris when I\u2019m older ... ate too many croissants, urgh, God, I\u2019m fat, I\u2019m hideous ... this guy called Ted who\u2019s at university and REALLY COOL ... he\u2019s really into existentialism ... I should get into that, he said I was a natural ...</p><p>... AMAZING sunset ... drank too many rum-and-Cokes ... really REALLY sunburned ... slept with this guy called Pete, shouldn\u2019t have ... made this plan to move to the South of France when we\u2019re all like thirty ...</p><p>... I WISH I spoke Italian better. This is where I want to live, forever. It\u2019s AMAZING ... ate too many gelati, urgh, my legs are hideous ... leaving for Greece tomorrow ...</p> <p>... this place is INCREDIBLE ... amazing party atmosphere, like we all just GET each other ... I could LIVE on feta ... diving in these underwater caves ... this guy called Ben ... picnic with some of the guys and Ben ... slept with Ben ... AMAZING ...</p><p>\u201cLottie?\u201d A male voice interrupts my concentration, and I start so violently the diary flies up into the air. I make an instinctive grab for it, then realize that\u2019s incriminating, so I draw my hand away sharply and it falls on the floor, where I kick it away, then finally lift my head.</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s standing in the doorway in a raincoat, his hair disheveled and a suitcase in his hand. His face is agitated, and he\u2019s definitely looking more young Gordon Brown than young Pierce Brosnan.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lottie?\u201d he demands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here for security,\u201d I mumble hurriedly, my face blazing with shame and my eyes darting to the diary. \u201cSecurity.\u201d</p><p>Richard looks at me as though I\u2019m making no sense at all. Which, to be fair, I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lottie?\u201d he demands again, more forcefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I go to her work, no one will tell me where she is. I come here, you\u2019re sitting on her bed. Just tell me.\u201d He drops his suitcase. \u201cIs she ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIll?\u201d I almost want to laugh hysterically. \u201cNo, not ill. Richard, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>His case has an airline tag on it. He must have come straight from the airport in a dashing, romantic manner. I feel quite sad that Lottie isn\u2019t here to see it.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake. A bad mistake.\u201d He strides to the window and stares out a moment, then darts me a look. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much she tells you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fair amount,\u201d I say diplomatically.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll want to hear that she\u2019s told me absolutely everything, including his penchant for doing it blindfolded and her penchant for sexy toys, which she\u2019s terrified the cleaner will find.</p><p>\u201cWell, we split up,\u201d he says heavily. \u201cA few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>No kidding.</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard that.\u201d I nod. \u201cShe was very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so was I!\u201d He wheels round, breathing hard. \u201cIt came out of nowhere! I thought we were happy together. I thought she was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was happy! But she couldn\u2019t see where things were heading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean ...\u201d He hesitates for a long time. \u201cMarriage.\u201d</p> <p>I feel a flick of irritation. I\u2019m not such a huge fan of marriage myself, but he doesn\u2019t need to look quite so unenthusiastic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not such an outlandish idea,\u201d I point out. \u201cIt is what people do when they love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know, but ...\u201d He makes a face, as though we\u2019re talking about some freaky hobby pursued by people on freaky reality shows. Now I\u2019m starting to feel furious. If he\u2019d just manned up and bloody well proposed in the first place, none of this would have happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Richard?\u201d I ask abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI want Lottie. I want to talk to her. I want to get things back on track. She wouldn\u2019t return my calls or my emails. So I told my new boss I had to come back to England.\u201d There\u2019s a throb of pride in his voice. He clearly reckons he\u2019s made the supreme gesture.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we belong together,\u201d he says steadily. \u201cThat I love her. That we can work things out.

Definitely Gordon. He\u2019ll throw his laptop at me in a minute. \u201cHow can she be married? What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe split up with you, practically had a nervous breakdown, met up with an old flame, who proposed on the spot, and said yes because she was in shock and desperately miserable and fancies him rotten. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I glare at him. \u201cGet it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut ... but who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer gap-year boyfriend. She hadn\u2019t seen him for fifteen years. First love, all that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s gazing at me suspiciously. I can see the cogs of his brain working, the realization dawning: this isn\u2019t a windup. I\u2019m telling the truth. She\u2019s married.</p><p>\u201cFucking ... fuck.\u201d He bangs both fists to his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s how I feel about it too.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a dejected silence. A light flurry of rain patters against the window, and I wrap my arms around myself. Now that the exhilaration of punishing Richard has ebbed away, all I can feel is sore and miserable. What a mess.</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI guess that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d I shrug. I\u2019m not going to share my plans with him. The last thing I need is him interfering or offering stupid suggestions. My priority is to get Lottie off the hook with Ben, for her own sake. If Richard wants to make some fresh salvo afterward, that\u2019s up to him.</p><p>\u201cSo ... what do you know about this guy?\u201d Richard suddenly emerges from his trance. \u201cWhat\u2019s he called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d He repeats the word suspiciously. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard her talk about a Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I shrug again.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I know about her other old boyfriends. Jamie. And Seamus. And what\u2019s-his-name. The accountant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian,\u201d I can\u2019t help supplying.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. But she\u2019s never even mentioned a Ben.\u201d Richard\u2019s eyes rake the room, as though he\u2019s trying to find clues, then they fall on her diary, which is lying half open on the ground. He lifts his gaze to me incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWere you reading her diary?\u201d</p><p>Damn. I should have known Richard would pick up on that. He always notices more than you think he will. Lottie used to say he\u2019s like a lion half asleep under a tree, but I think he\u2019s more like a bull: one minute peacefully grazing; the next charging, head down.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly reading it.\u201d I try to stay poised. \u201cI was just doing a little research about this Ben.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes focus on me alertly. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I\u2019ve only just got to the bit where they met on Ikonos\u2014\u201d He makes a sudden grab for the diary. With a lightning reaction, I reach for it too and seize a corner. We\u2019re both gripping it, trying to pull it out of the other\u2019s grasp. He\u2019s far stronger than I am, but I\u2019m not letting him have her diary. There are limits.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d read your sister\u2019s diary,\u201d says Richard, trying to wrench it out of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d read your girlfriend\u2019s diary,\u201d I retort breathlessly. \u201cGive. Give.\u201d</p><p>At last I manage to yank it away from him and cradle it protectively in my arms.</p><p>\u201cI deserve to know.\u201d Richard is glowering at me. \u201cIf Lottie\u2019s chosen this guy over me, I deserve to know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I snap. \u201cI\u2019ll read you out a bit. Be patient.\u201d</p><p>I flip through the pages again, fast-forwarding through France and Italy to Ikonos. OK. Here we are. Pages and pages full of the word \u201cBen.\u201d Ben this. Ben that. Ben, Ben, Ben.</p><p>\u201cShe met him at this guest house they were all staying in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guest house on Ikonos?\u201d Richard\u2019s face jerks in recognition. \u201cBut she\u2019s told me about that place a million times. The place with the steps? Where they had the fire and she saved everyone? I mean, that place changed her life. She always says it\u2019s the place where she became the person she is today. She has a photo of it somewhere....\u201d He looks around the room, then jabs a finger. \u201cHere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We both survey the framed picture of Lottie in a swing seat, dressed in a tiny frilly white skirt and a bikini top, with a flower behind her ear.

Here goes.\u201d I draw a breath and choose a paragraph at random.</p> <p>Watched Ben waterskiing this morning. God, he\u2019s cool. He plays the harmonica and he\u2019s so brown. Had sex all afternoon on the boat, no tan lines, ha-ha. Bought more scented candles and massage oil for tonight. All I want is to be with Ben and have sex with Ben forever. I will never love anyone else like this. NEVER.</p><p>I fall into silence, feeling uncomfortable. \u201cShe\u2019d kill me if she knew I\u2019d read you that.\u201d</p><p>Richard doesn\u2019t reply. He looks stricken.</p><p>\u201cIt was fifteen years ago,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cShe was eighteen. That\u2019s what you write in your diary when you\u2019re eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think ...\u201d He pauses. \u201cD\u2019you think she\u2019s ever written anything like that about me?\u201d</p><p>Alarm bells start clanging in my head. Uh-oh. No way. Not going there.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea!\u201d I clap the book shut briskly. \u201cIt\u2019s different. Everything\u2019s different when you grow up. Sex is different, love is different, cellulite is very different.\u201d I\u2019m trying to lighten the atmosphere, but Richard doesn\u2019t even seem to hear. He\u2019s staring at the photo of Lottie, his brow furrowed so deeply I think it might cave in. The sudden sound of the doorbell makes us both start, and as we meet eyes I can tell we\u2019ve both had the same crazy thought: Lottie?</p><p>Richard strides into the narrow hall, and I follow, my heart pounding. He throws open the door and I peer in disappointment at a thin, elderly man.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Finch,\u201d he says in querulous tones. \u201cIs Charlotte at home? Because, despite her promises, she has done no work on the roof terrace at all. It\u2019s still an absolute mess.\u201d</p><p>The roof terrace. Even I know about the roof terrace. Lottie rang me up to tell me she was totally getting into gardening and had ordered loads of cute gardening accessories, and she was going to design an urban potager.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m a reasonable man,\u201d the man is saying, \u201cbut a promise is a promise, and we have all contributed to the plant fund, and I really feel this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll do it, OK?\u201d Richard pushes forward, his voice thundering so loudly that the light fittings practically tremble. \u201cShe\u2019s planning a great project. She\u2019s creative. These things take time. So back off!\u201d</p><p>The elderly man recoils in alarm, and I raise my eyebrows at Richard. Wow. I wouldn\u2019t mind someone fighting in my corner like that once in a while.</p><p>Also: I was right. He\u2019s definitely a bull, not a lion. If he were a lion, he would even now be stalking Ben with stealthy patience through the undergrowth. Richard\u2019s too straightforward to do that. He\u2019d rather charge furiously at the nearest target, even if it means a thousand teacups broken in the process. So to speak.</p> <p>The door closes and we look at each other uncertainly, as though the interruption has changed the air.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d says Richard abruptly, and buttons up his raincoat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back to San Francisco?\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Lottie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? She\u2019s married and I wish her every happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard ...\u201d I wince, not knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cThey were Romeo and Juliet and now they\u2019ve found each other again. Makes total sense. Good luck to them.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s upset, I realize. Really upset. His jaw is taut and his gaze is distant. Oh God, I feel terrible now. I shouldn\u2019t have read her diary out. I simply wanted to shock him out of his complacency.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t Romeo and Juliet,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cLook, Richard, if you really want to know, they\u2019re both having complete fuckwit meltdowns. Lottie hasn\u2019t been thinking straight since you and she split up, and apparently this Ben is having his own midlife crisis.... Richard, listen. Please.\u201d I put a hand on his arm and wait till he gives me his attention. \u201cThe marriage won\u2019t last. I\u2019m pretty sure of that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can you be pretty sure?\u201d He scowls as though he hates me for even raising his hopes.</p><p>\u201cI just have a feeling,\u201d I say mysteriously. \u201cCall it sisterly intuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a way down the line.\u201d He heads back into the bedroom and picks up his suitcase.</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t!\u201d I hurry after him and grab his shoulder to make him stop. \u201cI mean ... it might be sooner than you think. Much sooner. The point is, if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t give up.

If only he\u2019d arrived one day earlier ...</p><p>\u201cSo tonight\u2019s their\u2014\u201d He breaks off as though he can\u2019t bear to say it.</p><p>\u201cWedding night. Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.\u201d I pause and examine my nails, my face carefully blank, my demeanor innocent. \u201cWell. Who knows how that will go?\u201d</p><p>10</p> <p>LOTTIE</p><p>I can\u2019t stand it. I can\u2019t stand it any longer. I\u2019m going to be the first person who ever died from sexual frustration.</p><p>I can remember long, unbearable waits as a child. Waiting for pocket money. Waiting for my birthday. Waiting for Christmas. But I\u2019ve never had a wait as nightmarish as this. It\u2019s been absolute torture. Five hours, four hours, three hours to go ... All through the plane journey and the car ride from the airport, I\u2019ve been silently chanting, Soon ... soon ... soon ... It\u2019s the only way to keep sane. Ben keeps fondling my leg. He\u2019s staring straight ahead, breathing evenly. I can tell he\u2019s as pent up as I am.</p><p>And now it\u2019s just minutes to go. The hotel is half a kilometer away. The driver is turning off the main road. The closer we get, the less I can bear it. These last moments of delay are killing me. All I want is Ben.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to look around and show an interest in our surroundings, but it\u2019s only road and scrubby hills and garish billboards for Greek drinks with unfamiliar names. The airport is on the other side of the island from the guest house we stayed at all those years ago. I probably never even came here. So I\u2019m not having any reminiscences or recognizing anything. I\u2019m just feeling desperate.</p><p>Soon ... soon ... soon ... We\u2019ll be in our massive honeymoon suite bed, and our clothes will be lying on the floor, and we\u2019ll be facing each other, skin-to-skin, nothing to stop us, and finally, finally ...</p> <p>\u201cThe Amba Hotel,\u201d the driver announces with a proud flourish, and leaps out to open our doors.</p><p>As I get out of the car, the warm Greek air seems to bathe my shoulders. I look around, taking in a huge white-pillared entrance, four marble lions, and a series of fountains crashing into an ornamental pond. Bougainvillea is falling in vivid pink cascades from balconies to the left and right. Candles are flickering in massive hurricane lanterns. I can hear the chirp of evening crickets as well as the distant strains of a string quartet. This place is spectacular.</p><p>As we head up the shallow marble steps, I feel a sudden wave of euphoria. This is going to be perfect. The perfect, perfect honeymoon. I squeeze Ben\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunning.\u201d He slides a hand around my waist and up under my top to my bra catch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! This is a posh hotel!\u201d I jerk away, even though my whole body is longing for him to keep going. \u201cWe have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d His darkened eyes meet mine.</p><p>\u201cNor can I.\u201d I swallow. \u201cI\u2019m dying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dying more.\u201d His fingers move down to the waistband of my skirt. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re wearing anything under that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a stitch,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He makes a low, growling noise. \u201cOK, we\u2019re going to get our room key, and we\u2019re going to lock the door, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr?\u201d A voice interrupts us and I look up to see a short, dark man in a suit approaching us swiftly down the steps. His shoes are very shiny, and as he gets nearer I see a badge that reads NICO DEMETRIOU, VIP MANAGER. In one hand is a massive bouquet of flowers, which he proffers to me. \u201cMadame. Welcome to the Amba Hotel. We are delighted to welcome you. You are on honeymoon, I understand!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s ushering us through the large glass doors into a massive domed lobby. It has a marble floor and a sunken pool in which are floating little candles. Low music is playing and there\u2019s a wonderful musky scent in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMany congratulations.

I hesitate, then take one, glancing at Ben.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind,\u201d Ben says, not moving toward the sofa. \u201cBut we\u2019d like to get to our suite as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Of course.\u201d Nico twinkles understandingly. \u201cYour luggage is being taken up.

You will find it more comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Reluctantly, Ben sinks into the sofa and starts scrawling at top speed. Meanwhile, Nico hands me a printed sheet headed Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Parr, followed by a list of facilities and experiences. I run my eyes over the list, which is pretty awesome. Guided snorkeling and champagne picnic ... day trip on the hotel\u2019s sixty-foot yacht ... dinner cooked by a private chef on your terrace ... starlight aromatherapy couples\u2019 massage ...</p><p>\u201cWe are delighted to present our Superlative Honeymoon Experience.\u201d Nico beams at me. \u201cYou will be attended by a private twenty-four-hour butler. You will enjoy complimentary treatments within the private spa area in your suite. I, personally, will be at your service at all times. No request is too great or too small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I can\u2019t help smiling back, he\u2019s so charming.</p><p>\u201cYour honeymoon is a special, special time. I, Nico, will make it the experience of your lifetime.\u201d He clasps his hands together. \u201cNever to be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, done.\u201d Ben stamps a final full stop and hands the forms back. \u201cCan we get into our room? Where is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will escort you personally!\u201d exclaims Nico. \u201cCome this way, to your private penthouse lift.\u201d</p><p>We have our own lift? I flash a look at Ben. I can tell that\u2019s given him ideas. Me too.</p><p>As we stand in the lift, I\u2019m trying to appear composed, but I can see Ben eyeing up my skirt. He\u2019s not going to hang about. We\u2019re going to take all of thirty seconds, and then we\u2019ll have to do it again, and then maybe have dinner and then, really slowly, start all over again....</p><p>\u201cAnd here we are!\u201d The lift doors ping open and Nico leads us cheerfully into a lobby, with marble floor and dark-wood paneled walls. \u201cThe Oyster Suite. It was recently voted top honeymoon suite by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler. After you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe as he swings open the door. Fliss was right: this is incredible. The whole place is designed like a grotto, with Greek pillars and low daybeds and statues of Greek gods on pedestals. The only immediate downside is that the TV is blaring out Teletubbies. I\u2019ve loathed Teletubbies, ever since I had to watch about twenty episodes while babysitting Noah. Who on earth put that on?</p><p>\u201cCan we turn that off, please?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, madame. Let me first show you the amenities. As well as the lift entrance, there is a dedicated front door.\u201d Nico strides briskly through the marble-floored rooms. \u201cHere we have the bathroom, with a walk-in rain shower. Here is your private spa room, kitchen with staff entrance, small library, sitting room with cinema screen....\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to look interested as he demonstrates how to use the DVD player. But my head is fuzzy with desire. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re actually here. In our honeymoon suite. On our wedding night. And as soon as this guy finishes his spiel and leaves ... in a matter of seconds, maybe ... Ben will be ripping off my skirt and I\u2019ll be ripping off his shirt, and ... Oh God, I can\u2019t wait a moment longer....</p><p>\u201cThe minibar is situated within this cabinet and works by electronic sensor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I manage a polite nod, but my whole body is pulsing with lust. I don\u2019t care how the bloody minibar works. Just stop talking and leave us alone to have sex.</p><p>\u201cAnd through here is the bedroom.\u201d Nico swings open a door. I take an expectant step forward\u2014then stop in dismay.</p><p>\u201cWhaaat?\u201d I hear Ben exclaim beside me.</p><p>The room is large and grand, with a domed glass ceiling. And under the dome are two single beds.</p><p>\u201cI ... wh\u2014\u201d I\u2019m so wrong-footed I can barely get out a word. \u201cBeds.\u201d I turn to Ben and point. \u201cThe beds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, these are the beds, madame.\u201d Nico gestures at the singles with a proud beam. \u201cThis is the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know those are beds!\u201d I\u2019m gulping for air. \u201cBut why are they singles?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn the website, it shows a super-king bed,\u201d Ben takes over. \u201cI saw a picture of it. Where\u2019s that gone?\u201d</p><p>Nico looks baffled at the question. \u201cWe offer many different sleeping options for the suite. The previous occupants of the suite must have ordered two beds, such as you see. They are two very fine beds.\u201d He slaps one. \u201cFinest quality. Is this not satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not bloody satisfactory!\u201d snaps Ben. \u201cWe need a double bed. One bed. Super-king. Best you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Nico pulls a regretful face. \u201cA thousand apologies, sir. I am desolated. Since this was not ordered in advance\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to order it in advance! It\u2019s our honeymoon! This is the honeymoon suite!\u201d Ben\u2019s breathing hard. \u201cWhat kind of honeymoon suite has two single beds in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, sir. Do not alarm yourself,\u201d says Nico soothingly. \u201cI understand. I will order a double bed immediately.\u201d He takes out his phone and launches into a stream of Greek. At last he switches off and beams again. \u201cThe matter is in hand. Again, my apologies. While we are sorting out this problem, may I offer you a complimentary cocktail downstairs at the bar?\u201d</p><p>I quell a snappy reply. I don\u2019t want a cocktail at the bar. I want my wedding night. Now.</p><p>\u201cWell, how long is it going to take?\u201d Ben scowls. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, we will complete the substitution as quickly as possible. The removers will be with us as soon as\u2014 Ah!\u201d There\u2019s a knocking sound at the door, and Nico brightens. \u201cHere we are!\u201d</p> <p>Six guys in white overalls troop into the room, and Nico addresses them in Greek. One guy lifts up the end of a bed and looks at it doubtfully. He says something in Greek to another guy, who shrugs and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Ben in agitated tones, looking from one to the other. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d says Nico reassuringly. \u201cPerhaps I could recommend that you take a seat in your sitting room while we address this small matter?\u201d</p><p>He ushers us out and we find ourselves in the sitting room. The TV is still playing Teletubbies at full volume. I jab at it with the remote, but it doesn\u2019t switch off. Nor does the volume control work. Is the remote out of juice?</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cI can\u2019t stand this. Could you turn it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s cold in here,\u201d adds Ben. \u201cHow do we adjust the air-conditioning?\u201d</p> <p>It is pretty freezing in here. I\u2019d already noticed.</p><p>\u201cI will summon your butler,\u201d says Nico with a beam. \u201cHe will attend to you.\u201d</p><p>He disappears out the door and I look at Ben in disbelief. We should have been having sex by now. We should have been having the hottest time of our life. Not sitting on a sofa with \u201cTime for Tubby Bye-Bye\u201d blaring at us, in a subzero room with six workmen next door.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d says Ben suddenly. \u201cThe library. That\u2019s got a sofa.\u201d</p><p>He hustles me in there and shuts the door. There are shelves of fake-looking books and a desk with hotel writing paper and a chaise longue upholstered in heavy brown linen. Ben shuts the door and faces me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d he exhales incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I echo. \u201cInsane.\u201d We both draw breath. And then it\u2019s as if the starting pistol has been fired for the Most Erogenous Zones in a Minute contest. He\u2019s all over me. I\u2019m all over him. His hands are everywhere. My bra is unhooked, my top is ripped off, and I\u2019m unbuttoning his shirt.... His skin is so warm, so delicious, I want to savor him for a bit, but Ben\u2019s already looking purposefully around the room.</p><p>\u201cSofa?\u201d he pants. \u201cOr desk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hear.\u201d He\u2019s unhooking my skirt.

Mr. Parr?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d I whimper. \u201cNoooooo ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2014\u201d Ben looks livid. \u201cHello?\u201d he raises his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re busy. Come back in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gift from the management,\u201d comes a voice through the door. \u201cFresh cookies.

I present some fresh cookies, courtesy of the management.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d says Ben curtly. \u201cPut them anywhere.\u201d He scribbles on the pad that the butler is holding out.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Georgios places the silver salver on a coffee table. \u201cMy colleague will be here presently with the juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuice?\u201d Ben stares at him. \u201cWhat juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh juice, courtesy of the management,\u201d Georgios says. \u201cTo accompany the cookies. My assistant butler, Hermes, will bring it directly. If you need more ice, you call for me.\u201d He hands Ben a card. \u201cHere is my number. At your service.\u201d</p><p>Ben is breathing hard. \u201cListen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any juice. Cancel the juice. We want a little privacy. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d says Georgios at once. \u201cPrivacy. Of course.\u201d He nods solemnly. \u201cThis is your honeymoon and you wish for privacy. This is a special time for a man and a woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s voice is cut off as an almighty banging noise starts.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell ...\u201d We both hurry into the sitting room. A guy in white overalls is standing at the door to the bedroom, having an altercation with someone in the room. Nico comes hurrying over, wringing his hands anxiously.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr, my apologies for this dreadful noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes are wild and starey. \u201cWhat\u2019s that hammering sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a small problem with the removal of the beds,\u201d Nico replies placatingly. \u201cVery, very small.\u201d</p><p>Another man in white overalls appears round the side of the door, a massive hammer in his hand. He shakes his head ominously at Nico.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d demands Ben. \u201cWhat\u2019s he shaking his head for? Have you switched the beds yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd can you please do something about that TV?\u201d I chime in with a wince. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable.\u201d Every time there\u2019s a pause in the banging, the Teletubbies blare out. Is it my imagination, or are they even louder than before?</p><p>\u201cSir, madame, my humblest of apologies. We are working on the bed with all haste. And as for the TV ...\u201d Nico is holding a remote, which he jabs at the wall. Immediately the volume doubles.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I clap my hands to my ears. \u201cToo loud! Wrong way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies!\u201d shouts Nico over the racket. \u201cI try again!\u201d</p><p>He zaps the remote several times, but nothing happens. He bangs it against his head and shakes it. \u201cIt has jammed!\u201d he says in tones of astonishment. \u201cI call an engineer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Another man in a braided jacket has appeared out of nowhere. \u201cThe door was open. I have here some fresh juice courtesy of the management. Madame, where would you like me to place the juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I ...\u201d I\u2019m almost gibbering. I want to scream. I want to erupt. This is supposed to be our wedding night. Our wedding night. And we\u2019re standing in a hotel suite, surrounded by hammering workmen, butlers with salvers, and the noise of Teletubbies drilling into my brain.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d says Nico gently. \u201cI am mortified that we are inconveniencing you. Please may I offer you again a complimentary cocktail in the bar?\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>FLISS</p><p>I almost can\u2019t look at the texts. It\u2019s like spying. It\u2019s like rubbernecking a car crash. But I have to, even though they make me want to clap my hands over my eyes.</p><p>Lottie and Ben are having the worst wedding night known to man. No other way to put it. It\u2019s horrendous. It\u2019s ghastly. And it\u2019s all my fault. My stomach is one big guilty, acidy twinge. With every bulletin I feel worse. But it\u2019s all in a good cause, I tell myself sternly, already clicking on the new text. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another round of margaritas. This fellow can certainly hold his drink. N</p><p>Nico\u2019s been keeping me updated all evening with every development. His latest four texts have been reports on all the complimentary cocktails that Lottie and Ben have consumed. It\u2019s an eye-watering amount. They started drinking at ten, local time. It\u2019s midnight there now. Lottie has to be blotto.</p><p>But what about Ben? I pause a moment, tapping my phone thoughtfully against my palm. Something Lorcan said about Ben is coming back to me: He\u2019s a natural gambler but he lacks judgment.</p><p>A natural gambler. Hmm. I fire a text back to Nico:</p> <p>He likes to gamble....</p><p>I\u2019ll leave it at that. Nico will know what to do with the information.</p><p>I press send, then briskly shut my suitcase, trying to calm my unsettled mind. But conflicting thoughts are shooting back and forth like arrows, each landing with a piercing little stab:</p><p>I\u2019m sabotaging my sister\u2019s honeymoon. I\u2019m a horrible person.</p><p>But it\u2019s only because I care about her happiness.</p> <p>Exactly.</p><p>Exactly!</p><p>I mean, what if I decided not to interfere and she got pregnant and they split up and she regretted the whole thing? What then? Wouldn\u2019t I regret NOT doing something? Would I be like the people who kept their heads down and pretended not to see when the Nazis invaded?</p><p>Not that Ben is a Nazi. As far as I know.</p><p>I feel bad about the whole Teletubbies thing. That was cruel. Lottie\u2019s almost phobic about that program.</p><p>I wheel my suitcase out to the hall and put it next to Noah\u2019s. He\u2019s asleep in his room, clasping Monkey and breathing peacefully, and I pop in for a moment to watch him. He took the news of our trip with utter calmness and went straightaway to pack his little case, asking only how many pairs of pants he needed. He\u2019s going to run the world one day, Noah.</p> <p>I head into the bathroom and run a bath, sloshing in one of the many duty-free bath fragrances cluttering my bathroom. I shop almost exclusively at airports, I\u2019ve realized. I try on clothes before boarding and pick them up on my return. I pick up Clarins sets on the plane. I have enough cured Spanish sausage and hunks of Parmesan to last me a year. And Toblerones.</p><p>I hesitate. I have Toblerone on my mind now. A Toblerone in the bath, with a glass of wine ...</p><p>After only a millisecond\u2019s internal debate, I head to the treats cupboard in the kitchen. Six outsize Toblerones are nestling next to a ridiculously large duty-free box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates, which I give to Noah three at a time, every Saturday. He thinks they come in threes. It has never occurred to him that they might be available in quantities larger than three.</p><p>I\u2019m just cracking off a chunk of Toblerone when my phone rings and I pick it up, wondering if it might be Nico. But the display reads: Lottie.</p><p>Lottie? I\u2019m so shocked, I drop the Toblerone on the floor. I\u2019m staring at the phone, my heart suddenly thumping, my thumb hesitating over the answer button. I don\u2019t want to answer. Anyway, I\u2019ve left it too late: it\u2019s gone to voicemail. I put my phone down on the counter in relief, but almost at once it starts ringing again. Lottie.</p><p>I swallow hard. I\u2019m going to have to do this. Otherwise I\u2019ll only have to call her back, which might be worse. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and press answer.</p><p>\u201cLottie! You\u2019re supposed to be on honeymoon!\u201d I aim for a bright, innocent tone. \u201cWhat are you doing, ringing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliiissss?\u201d</p> <p>I perform an instant analysis on her voice. She\u2019s drunk. Well, I knew that. But she\u2019s tearful too. Most important, she has no idea I am involved in anything untoward, or it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cFliiissss?\u201d with a question mark.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I say lightly.</p><p>\u201cFliss, I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d she wails. \u201cBen\u2019s totally drunk. Like, almost passed out. How do I sober him up? What do I do? Haven\u2019t you got some magic cure?\u201d</p><p>I do in fact have a tried and tested formula, involving black coffee, ice cubes, and deodorant squirted in the nostrils. But I\u2019m not sharing that with her right now.</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d I say sympathetically. \u201cPoor you. I ... I don\u2019t know what to suggest. Maybe some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t even sit up! He drank all these stupid cocktails, and I had to help him up to our room, and then he just crashed out on the bed and it\u2019s supposed to be our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I try to sound shocked. \u201cSo haven\u2019t you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! We haven\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help exhaling with relief. I was worried they might have slipped in a quick one without anyone knowing.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Lottie wails in distress. \u201cAnd I know you recommended this hotel, Fliss, but, quite frankly, it\u2019s awful! I\u2019m going to complain! They\u2019ve ruined our honeymoon. We\u2019ve got single beds! They say they can\u2019t move them! I\u2019m sitting on a single bed right now!\u201d Her voice shrills higher. \u201cSingle beds!

Next thing, he\u2019s downed the whole thing and everyone in the bar is cheering and he\u2019s practically comatose! I mean, what was in it? Absinthe?\u201d</p><p>I dread to think what was in it.</p><p>\u201cWe were snogging in the lift on the way back up to the room,\u201d Lottie carries on agitatedly. \u201cAnd I thought, here we go, at last\u2014and suddenly there was this dead weight on my shoulder and Ben had fallen asleep!

Just get a good night\u2019s sleep and ... er ... enjoy the hotel facilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suing this place.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even seem to be listening. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it won an award for Best Honeymoon Suite. It\u2019s the worst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten? Why don\u2019t you have something from room service? They do really good sushi, or there\u2019s an Italian pizza place....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Maybe I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Her fury seems to subside and she gives a gusty sigh. \u201cSorry to lay all this on you, Fliss. I mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to answer.</p> <p>I\u2019m doing the right thing, I remind myself furiously.

Are you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYes. Look, try to get some sleep.

I\u2019ve already talked to Nico. Tomorrow won\u2019t be better.</p><p>12</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be negative. But if I could describe how I expected the morning after my wedding night to be, it would not be this.</p><p>It would not be this.</p><p>I always imagined my new husband and me nestled in a huge white cottony bed, like in a soap-powder ad. Birds singing outside. Sunlight gently passing over our faces as we turn to each other and kiss, remembering our fabulous time last night, and murmuring sweet nothings to each other before moving seamlessly into spectacular morning sex.</p><p>Not waking up on a single bed, with a cricked neck, un-brushed teeth, the smell of last night\u2019s room-service pizza, and the sound of Ben groaning on the opposite bed.</p> <p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I try to sound sympathetic, even though I want to kick him.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d He lifts his head with what appears to be a huge effort. He looks pretty green and he\u2019s still wearing his suit. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won a bet,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cWell done, you.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze is distant and his eyes are moving back and forth. He\u2019s clearly trying to piece it all together.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cJust a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He swings his legs round and gets to his feet, swaying theatrically for a moment. \u201cMrs. Parr, my greatest, humblest apologies. How will I make this up to you?\u201d He bows low, nearly falling over, and I stifle a smile. I can\u2019t stay cross. Ben always was a charmer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think.\u201d I pout at him.</p><p>\u201cAny room in that bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be ...\u201d</p><p>I shuffle up, pulling open the duvet invitingly for him to snuggle in. It\u2019s luxury goose down. We also have the choice of a pillow menu, with twenty different varieties. I read them all last night, over my pizza. But right now I couldn\u2019t care less whether the pillow is buckwheat, hypoallergenic, or silk-covered. My husband is in bed with me. Awake. This is what matters.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He buries his face in my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re all cozy. Yum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all hangover-y.\u201d I wrinkle my nose. \u201cGet your suit off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He pulls his jacket and shirt off together in one movement, over his head, then straddles me, bare-chested, and grins down. \u201cHello, wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, idiot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d He runs a finger down my cheek, down my neck, and under the duvet, fingering the top of my incredibly expensive cami. \u201cWe have all morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll day.\u201d I reach up to pull him down for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve earned this,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cOh God.

Which means\u2014</p><p>I sit bolt upright, clasping the duvet round me, my heart pumping.</p><p>The butler\u2019s in the suite?</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d I call in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cIs madame ready for breakfast?\u201d</p> <p>What the fuck?

Most highly recommended by all our VIP honeymoon guests. Our Champagne Breakfast with Music.\u201d</p> <p>I stare back at him, speechless. Music? What does he mean? What on earth\u2014</p><p>No way. I nearly convulse with shock as a girl appears at the door. She\u2019s got long blond hair and is wearing a white Grecian tunic, and she\u2019s wheeling along a massive harp.</p><p>I exchange looks wildly with Ben. How do we stop this? What do we do?</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr. Congratulations on your marriage! Today I will be playing for you a selection of love tunes, to accompany your breakfast,\u201d the girl says, and takes a seat on a fold-up stool. Next moment she\u2019s plucking away briskly at the harp and Georgios plus his assistant are bringing trays on stands to the bed and pouring out glasses of champagne and peeling fruit and offering us little finger bowls to refresh our hands in.</p><p>I haven\u2019t managed to utter a word. This is too surreal. I was about to have the hottest sex of my life. I was about to consummate my marriage. And instead I\u2019m having a kiwi fruit peeled for me by a sixty-year-old man in a braided jacket while a harpist twangs \u201cLove Changes Everything.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never really been one for the harp. But this one is making me want to hurl my basket of mini-croissants at it.</p><p>\u201cPlease. A loving-cup toast, to celebrate your marriage.\u201d Georgios gestures at our champagne flutes. Obediently, we link arms to sip our champagne, and with no warning Georgios throws a handful of pink confetti over us. I splutter in shock. Where did that come from? A moment later there\u2019s a flash in my face and I realize Georgios has taken a photo.</p><p>\u201cA commemorative photograph,\u201d he says gravely. \u201cWe will present it in a leather-bound album. Compliments of the management.\u201d</p> <p>What? I stare at him in horror. I don\u2019t want a commemorative photo of me looking hungover and disheveled with confetti stuck to my lip.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Ben whispers in my ear. \u201cQuick. Then they\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a point. I reach for the teapot, and Georgios leaps forward reprovingly.</p><p>\u201cMadame. Let me.\u201d He pours me a cup of tea and I take a couple of gulps. I swallow some kiwi fruit, then clutch my stomach.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Delicious! But I\u2019m stuffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Ben nods. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great breakfast, but maybe you could clear it away now?\u201d</p><p>Georgios hesitates, seeming reluctant.</p><p>\u201cSir, madame, I have for you a special egg dish. They are the finest, double-yolk eggs, prepared with saffron\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. No eggs. None.\u201d Ben stares Georgios down. \u201cNo. Eggs. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d says Georgios at last. He nods at the girl, who comes to a hasty final cadence, stands up, bows, then starts trundling her harp away. The two butlers pack the trays up and remove them to a trolley outside. Then Georgios appears back in the bedroom area.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr, I hope you have enjoyed the Champagne Breakfast with Music. Now I will await your command. I am at your disposal entirely. No request is too large or too small.\u201d He waits expectantly.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d says Ben off-puttingly. \u201cTell you what, we\u2019ll call you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI await your command,\u201d repeats Georgios, and withdraws, shutting the doors to the bedroom.</p><p>Ben and I just look at each other.

I\u2019m so sensitive to his touch I can\u2019t help moaning.</p><p>His eyes are huge and urgent. His breathing is raspy. Now I\u2019m pulling him toward me, and his lips are everywhere, and my mind is emptying as my body takes over. OK, here we go. Here we go. I\u2019m making sounds and so is he, and it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s really going to happen.... I\u2019m going to explode ... come on, come on....</p> <p>And then I freeze. I can hear a sound. A rustling sound. Just outside the bedroom door.</p><p>In reflex, I shove Ben away and sit up, every sense on alert.</p><p>\u201cStop! Stop it. Listen.\u201d I can barely frame the words properly. \u201cHe\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben\u2019s face is contorted with desire, and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s understanding anything I\u2019m saying.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here!\u201d I bat Ben\u2019s hand off my breast and gesture frantically at the door. \u201cThe butler! He hasn\u2019t left!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A murderous scowl comes over Ben\u2019s face. He swings his legs round and gets out of bed, totally naked.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go out like that!\u201d I squeak. \u201cPut on a robe.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s scowl becomes yet more murderous. He shrugs on a terry-cloth dressing gown and throws open the door to the bedroom. Sure enough, there\u2019s Georgios, arranging glasses neatly on the cocktail bar.</p><p>\u201cAh, Georgios,\u201d says Ben. \u201cI think you misunderstood. Thanks very much. That will be all for now. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir.\u201d Georgios makes a little bow. \u201cI await your command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I can sense Ben\u2019s temper starting to fray. \u201cWell, my command is for you to go. Leave the room. Go. Adi\u00f3s.\u201d He makes a shooing motion. \u201cLeave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d At last light dawns on Georgios\u2019s face. \u201cI see. Very good, sir. You call me if you need anything.\u201d He gives another bow, then heads toward the kitchen. Ben hesitates a moment, then follows him to make sure he actually exits.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I can hear him say firmly. \u201cYou go and put your feet up, Georgios. Don\u2019t worry about us. No, we can pour our own water, thank you. Bye, then. Bye ...\u201d His voice recedes as he enters the kitchen.</p><p>A few moments later, he appears at the door of the bedroom and pumps the air. \u201cGone! At last!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust doing his job, I suppose.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously got a really strong sense of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d says Ben incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d leap at the chance for some time off. But he kept telling me we\u2019d need him to pour our mineral water, and I kept telling him, no, we wouldn\u2019t, we\u2019re not total lazy gits. Makes you wonder what kind of people stay here\u2014\u201d Ben breaks off mid-sentence and his jaw drops. As I turn my head, I can feel mine dropping too.</p><p>No.</p><p>That can\u2019t be ...</p><p>Both of us stare in disbelief as Hermes, the assistant butler, strides into the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. and Mrs. Parr,\u201d he says cheerfully. He approaches the cocktail bar and starts arranging exactly the same glasses that Georgios was tidying ten seconds ago. \u201cMay I offer you a drink? A small snack? May I help you with your entertainment for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ... what ...\u201d Ben seems almost incapable of speech. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Hermes looks up, apparently perplexed by the question.</p><p>\u201cI am your assistant butler,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI am on duty while Georgios is resting. I await your command.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve gone mad.</p><p>We\u2019re trapped in butler hell.</p><p>Is this how rich people live? No wonder celebrities look so miserable the whole time. They\u2019re thinking, If only the butler would let us have some bloody sex.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Ben looks almost demented. \u201cPlease go. Now. Go.\u201d He\u2019s ushering Hermes toward the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSir,\u201d says Hermes in alarm. \u201cI do not use the guest entrance, I use the kitchen entrance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care which bloody entrance you use!\u201d Ben practically yells. \u201cJust go! Get out! Vamoose! Scram!\u201d He\u2019s batting Hermes toward the door as though he\u2019s a pest, and Hermes is backing away, looking terrified, and I\u2019m watching from the doorway, the duvet wrapped around me, and all three of us jump violently as the doorbell rings. Ben stiffens and looks around as though suspecting a trick.</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d Hermes is composing himself. \u201cPlease, sir. You permit I answer the door?\u201d</p><p>Ben doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s breathing heavily through his nostrils. He glances at me and I give an agonized shrug.

But no cleaners. No turndown service, no turnup service, no champagne, no fruit, and no bloody harps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir,\u201d says Hermes, eyeing him anxiously. \u201cYou permit me.\u201d</p><p>Hermes edges past Ben, into the lobby, and opens the door. In sweeps Nico, followed by the six workmen from last night.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Parr, Mrs. Parr!\u201d he breezes. \u201cI trust you slept well? A thousand apologies for last night. But I have good news! We have come to change your bed.\u201d</p> <p>13</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening. We\u2019ve been turfed out of our own honeymoon suite.</p><p>What is wrong with them? I\u2019ve never seen such an inept crew in my life. They unscrewed the legs of one bed, shuffled it round, and lifted it up and pronounced it too big, then Nico suggested they screw the legs back on and start again ... and all the time Ben was simmering to a boil.</p><p>At last he started yelling so loudly, the workmen gathered protectively around Nico. To his credit, Nico kept his cool, even when Ben started brandishing the hair dryer. Nico asked if we would please leave the suite while the workmen were operational and perhaps we would enjoy a complimentary \u00e0 la carte breakfast on the veranda?</p><p>That was two hours ago. There\u2019s only so much \u00e0 la carte breakfast you can eat. We\u2019ve been back to the room to get our beach stuff and there are still people in there, all peering at the beds and scratching their heads. The room is full of bed legs and headboards and a super-king mattress propped up against the wall. Apparently it\u2019s the \u201cwrong kind of bed.\u201d What does that even mean?</p> <p>\u201cHow hard can it be to swap a couple of beds?\u201d says Ben with a furious scowl, as we head toward the beach. \u201cAre they morons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLudicrous.\u201d</p><p>We pause by the entrance to the beach. It\u2019s quite something. Blue sea, golden sand, rows of the plushiest sun beds I\u2019ve ever seen, white umbrellas billowing in the breeze, and waiters hurrying around with drinks on trays. Any other day, I\u2019d be salivating at the sight.</p><p>But there\u2019s only one thing I want right now. And it\u2019s not a suntan.</p><p>\u201cThey should have given us another room,\u201d says Ben for the hundredth time. \u201cWe should be suing.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they asked us to leave, Ben requested a substitute room, and for one heavenly moment I thought everything was going to work out after all. We could disappear into a spare room, have a wonderful morning together, emerge in time for lunch.... But, no, Nico wrung his hands and said he was devastated and mortified but the hotel was fully booked, could he offer sir a complimentary hot-air-balloon ride instead?</p> <p>A complimentary bloody hot-air-balloon ride. I thought Ben was going to throttle him.</p><p>As we\u2019re pausing by the towel stand, I become aware of a presence lurking. It\u2019s Georgios. Where did he appear from? Has he been following us? Is this all part of the service? I nudge Ben, and he raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d says Georgios gravely. \u201cMay I help you with your towels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um, thanks,\u201d I say awkwardly. I don\u2019t really need help, but it would be rude to tell him to go away.</p><p>Georgios collects two towels and we follow a beach attendant to a pair of sun beds facing the sea. Lots of guests are already ensconced, and there\u2019s a smell of sun cream in the air. Waves are washing gently onto the beach. This is fairly blissful, I have to admit.</p><p>Between them, the beach attendant and Georgios are laying out our towels with military precision.</p><p>\u201cBottled water.\u201d Georgios sets a chiller on our table. \u201cShould I open the cap for madame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Maybe I\u2019ll have some later. Thanks so much, Georgios. That will be all for now. Thank you.\u201d I sit down on a bed, and Ben takes the other. I kick off my flip-flops, peel off my caftan top, lean back, and close my eyes, hoping this will give the message to Georgios. A moment later a shadow crosses my eyelids and I open them. To my disbelief, Georgios is neatly straightening my flip-flops and folding up my caftan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Is he planning to hang around with us all bloody day?

Madame wishes to cross the hot sand?\u201d He proffers the flip-flops.</p><p>What?</p> <p>OK, this is just stupid. These five-star hotels have gone way, way too far. Yes, I\u2019m on holiday; yes, it\u2019s nice to have some personal service. But that doesn\u2019t make me suddenly incapable of laying out a towel or unscrewing a bottle cap or putting on my own flip-flops.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. What I\u2019d really like is ...\u201d I try to think of some time-consuming challenge. \u201cI\u2019d like a freshly squeezed orange juice with honey drizzled in it. And some M&amp;M\u2019s. The brown ones only. Thank you so much, Georgios.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame.\u201d To my relief, he bows and walks away.</p><p>\u201cBrown M&amp;M\u2019s?\u201d says Ben incredulously. \u201cYou diva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to get rid of him!\u201d I retort in an undertone. \u201cIs he going to stalk us all day? Is that what a personal butler does?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod knows.\u201d Ben seems distracted. He keeps eyeing my bikini top. Or, rather, the contents of my bikini top.</p><p>\u201cLet me rub your sun cream in,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not giving that job to the butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d I hand him the bottle and he squeezes a big dollop of cream onto his palm. As he starts to apply it, I hear him inhale sharply.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I\u2019m too rough,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cOr not rough enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... Ben,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI meant my back. I don\u2019t actually need help applying it to my cleavage.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think Ben can hear, because he doesn\u2019t stop. A nearby woman is giving us an odd look. Now Ben takes another dollop of sun cream and starts rubbing it under my bikini top. With both hands. He\u2019s breathing very heavily. And now several people are looking.</p> <p>\u201cBen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being thorough,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cBen! Stop!\u201d I jerk away. \u201cDo my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He blinks a few times, his eyes unfocused.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should do it myself.\u201d I take the bottle from him and start slathering it on my legs. \u201cDo you want some? Ben?\u201d I wave to get his attention, but he seems in a trance. Then suddenly he comes to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of idea?\u201d I say warily.</p><p>\u201cA brilliant idea.\u201d</p> <p>He gets up and approaches a couple lying on sun beds nearby. I noticed them earlier, at breakfast. They both have red hair and I\u2019m already worried about them burning in the sun.</p><p>\u201cHi, there.\u201d Ben smiles charmingly down at the woman. \u201cEnjoying your holiday? I\u2019m Ben, by the way. We\u2019ve just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Hi, there.\u201d The woman has a slightly suspicious tone.</p><p>\u201cLovely hat.\u201d He gestures at her head.</p><p>Lovely hat? It\u2019s the most nondescript straw hat I\u2019ve ever seen. What is he up to?</p><p>\u201cActually, I was wondering,\u201d Ben carries on. \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a bind. I\u2019ve got a very important call to make and our room is out of action. Would you mind if I used yours? Just briefly. I\u2019d pop up really briefly. With my wife,\u201d he adds carelessly. \u201cWe\u2019d be quick.\u201d</p><p>The woman looks a bit flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cA call?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAn important business call,\u201d Ben says. \u201cAs I say, we\u2019d be super quick. In and out.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me and gives the tiniest of winks. I\u2019d smile if I weren\u2019t so transfixed with longing. A room. Oh God, we so need a room....</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d The woman leans over and nudges her husband. \u201cThese people want to borrow our room.\u201d The husband sits up and stares at Ben, shading his eyes against the sun. He\u2019s older than his wife and is doing The Times\u2019s crossword.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you need to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a call,\u201d says Ben. \u201cA really quick business call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you use the conference center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot private enough,\u201d says Ben without missing a beat. \u201cThis is a very confidential, discreet kind of call. I\u2019d very much appreciate a secluded space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what ...\u201d Ben hesitates. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I give you a little gift for your trouble? Say, fifty quid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The husband sounds flabbergasted. \u201cYou want to pay us fifty quid just to use our room? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the hotel would find you a room for nothing,\u201d puts in the wife helpfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t, OK?\u201d Ben sounds a tad impatient. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried.

A credit on your room bill. Don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d The husband jabs his finger at Ben as if he\u2019s suddenly worked it all out. \u201cIs this a scam?

We can have the sheets changed. Or use the floor.\u201d He turns to me as though for confirmation. \u201cThe floor would be OK, right?\u201d</p> <p>My entire face is prickling. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s dragging me into this. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s telling the whole beach we\u2019re going to do it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d The wife turns to her husband. \u201cSay something!\u201d</p><p>Andrew is silent, frowning for a moment\u2014then looks up.</p><p>\u201cFive hundred and not a penny less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now it\u2019s the wife\u2019s turn to explode. \u201cYou have to be joking! Andrew, that\u2019s our room and this is our honeymoon and we\u2019re not having some strange couple going in it to do ... anything.\u201d She grabs the room card, which is lying on Andrew\u2019s sun bed, and stuffs it down her swimsuit defiantly. \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d She glowers at Ben. \u201cYou and your wife.\u201d</p><p>Heads have turned all over the beach. Great.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Ben at last. \u201cWell, thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>As Ben is heading back to me, a large, hairy guy in tight swimming trunks leaps up from a nearby sun bed and taps Ben on the shoulder. Even from here I can smell his aftershave.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says in a heavy Russian accent. \u201cI have a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Ben turns, interested.</p><p>\u201cYou, me, your wife, my new wife, Natalya\u2014you want to make some fun?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause\u2014then Ben swivels to meet my gaze, eyebrows raised. I stare back in slight shock. Is he actually asking me? I shake my head violently, mouthing, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d says Ben, in what sound like genuinely regretful tones. \u201cAnother time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d The Russian guy claps him on the shoulder, and Ben comes back over to his sun bed. He slides onto it and stares savagely out to sea.</p> <p>\u201cWell, so much for that bright idea. Bloody frigid cow.\u201d</p><p>I lean over and poke him hard in the chest. \u201cHey, what was that? Did you want to take him up on his offer? That Russian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it would have been something.\u201d</p><p>Something? I stare at him incredulously, till he looks up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says defensively. \u201cIt would have been something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, excuse me for not wanting to share my wedding night with a gorilla and a girl with rubber boobs,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cSorry to spoil your fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot rubber,\u201d says Ben.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve looked, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilicone.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help snorting. Meanwhile, Ben is deftly flinging a couple of towels up over our parasol. What\u2019s he doing?</p><p>\u201cJust creating a bit of privacy,\u201d he says with a wink, and squeezes next to me on my sun bed, his hands all over me like an octopus. \u201cGod, you\u2019re hot. You haven\u2019t got a crotchless bikini on, have you?\u201d</p><p>Is he serious?</p><p>Actually, a crotchless bikini would have been handy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they even exist\u2014\u201d I suddenly notice two children watching us in curiosity. \u201cStop!\u201d I hiss, and drag Ben\u2019s hand out of my bikini bottoms. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it on a sun bed! We\u2019ll get arrested!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaved ice, madame? Lemon flavor?\u201d We both jump about a million miles as Hermes ducks his head under the towels and proffers a tray bearing two cones. I am honestly going to have a heart attack before I leave this place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a while we sit in silence, slurping at our shaved ice and listening to the low hum of beach chatter and waves lapping the sand.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s a shit situation, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Either we sit here, boiling with frustration and getting ratty with each other, or we go and do something till the room\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d I try to sound optimistic. \u201cFun holiday activities. Tennis, sailing, canoeing. Ping-Pong. Whatever they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds riveting,\u201d says Ben moodily.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk, anyway, and see what we can find.\u201d</p><p>I want to get away from this beach. Everyone keeps turning to look at us while they whisper behind their paperbacks, and the Russian guy keeps winking at me.</p><p>Ben finishes his shaved ice and leans over to kiss me, his icy lips parting mine with a delicious lemony, salty taste.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d I say as his hand automatically finds my bikini top. \u201cLook, stop.\u201d I wrench his hand away. \u201cIt makes it too hard. No touching. Not till our room\u2019s ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo touching?\u201d He stares at me incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo touching.\u201d I nod resolutely. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s walk through the hotel and whatever activity we find first, we\u2019ll do. Yes? Deal?\u201d</p><p>I wait for Ben to get to his feet and slip into his flip-flops. Georgios is heading toward us down the path from the hotel, and to my disbelief he\u2019s actually holding a salver bearing a glass of orange juice and a dish of brown M&amp;M\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMadame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I drain the orange juice in one gulp and crunch a couple of M&amp;M\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs our room ready yet?\u201d demands Ben abruptly. \u201cIt must be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe not, sir.\u201d Georgios\u2019s gloomy expression descends yet further. \u201cI believe a problem has arisen with the fire alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire alarm?\u201d Ben echoes incredulously. \u201cWhat do you mean, the fire alarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sensor was knocked as the beds were moved. Unfortunately, this must be fixed before we can allow you back into the room. It is for your own safety. My deepest apologies, sir.\u201d</p><p>Ben has both his hands to his head. He looks so apoplectic, I\u2019m almost scared.</p><p>\u201cWell, how long will it be now?\u201d</p><p>Georgios spreads his hands. \u201cSir, I only wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d Ben interrupts tensely. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t know. Why would you know?\u201d</p><p>I have a horrible feeling he\u2019s going to flip out in a minute and hit Georgios.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d I hastily join in the conversation. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll go and amuse ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame.\u201d Georgios nods. \u201cHow can I assist you with this?\u201d</p><p>Ben scowls at him. \u201cYou can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me some more juice, please!\u201d I trill, before Ben says something really offensive. \u201cMaybe some ... some ...\u201d I hesitate. What\u2019s the most time-consuming juice there is? \u201cSome beet juice?\u201d</p><p>A flicker passes across Georgios\u2019s otherwise impassive face. I think perhaps he\u2019s cottoned onto my ruse.</p><p>\u201cOf course, madame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! See you later.\u201d We head up a path lined with white walls and bougainvillea. The sun is beating down on our heads and it\u2019s very quiet. I know Georgios is following us, but I\u2019m not making chitchat with him. Then he\u2019ll never go.</p><p>\u201cThe beach bar\u2019s this way,\u201d observes Ben as we pass a sign. \u201cWe could look in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beach bar?\u201d I give him a sardonic look. \u201cAfter last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHair of the dog. Virgin Mary. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWe could have a quick one.\u201d</p><p>The beach bar is large and circular and shady, with Greek bouzouki music playing softly. Ben immediately slumps onto a bar stool.</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d The barman approaches us with a wide smile. \u201cMany congratulations on your marriage.\u201d He gives us a laminated drinks menu and moves away.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know we were just married?\u201d Ben regards him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cSaw our shiny new wedding rings, I suppose? What shall we have?\u201d I start looking down the menu, but Ben is lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cThat bloody woman,\u201d he mutters. \u201cWe\u2019d be there now. In their bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll fix the fire alarm soon,\u201d I say unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cThis is our bloody honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s have a drink.

She\u2019s wearing an orange caftan with bobbles on the sleeves and has jeweled sandals with very high heels. \u201cOf course it is! Everyone here is on honeymoon. When were you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. We just arrived last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were Saturday! Holy Trinity Church in Manchester. My dress was Phillipa Lepley. We had a hundred and twenty to the reception. It was a buffet. Then in the evening we had dancing to a band, and fifty additional guests attended.\u201d She looks at us expectantly.</p><p>\u201cOurs was ... smaller,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cQuite a lot smaller. But lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Lovelier than yours, I add silently. I turn to Ben to back me up, but he\u2019s swiveled away and is talking to the bartender instead.</p><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve noticed a trait that Ben has in common with Richard\u2014i.e., being totally antisocial and narrow-minded about new people. The number of times I\u2019ve struck up a conversation with some really interesting, fun person, and Richard just wouldn\u2019t join in. Like that fascinating woman we met at Greenwich once, who he point-blank refused to be introduced to. And, OK, it turned out she was a bit of a weirdo and tried to get me to invest \u00a310,000 in a houseboat, but he wasn\u2019t to know that, was he?</p><p>\u201cRing?\u201d The girl shoves her hand forward. Her nails are orange to match her caftan, I notice. Does that mean all her caftans are orange or that she repaints her nails every night? \u201cI\u2019m Melissa, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d I thrust my left hand forward to match, and my platinum wedding band glints in the sunshine. It\u2019s studded with diamonds and is really quite fancy.</p><p>\u201cVery nice!\u201d Melissa raises her eyebrows, impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling, isn\u2019t it, wearing a wedding ring?\u201d She leans forward conspiratorially. \u201cI catch my reflection and see the ring on my hand and I think, Bloody hell! I\u2019m married!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I suddenly realize I\u2019ve missed this: girly chat about getting married. That\u2019s the downside of rushing off with no family or bridesmaids at your side. \u201cAnd being called \u2018Mrs.\u2019 is weird too!\u201d I add. \u201cMrs. Parr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Falkner.\u201d She beams. \u201cI just love it. Falkner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Parr.\u201d I smile back.</p><p>\u201cYou know this place is the honeymoon resort? They\u2019ve had celebs here and everything. Our suite is to die for. And we\u2019re renewing our vows tomorrow night, on the Love Island. That\u2019s what they call it, the Love Island.\u201d</p><p>She gestures down toward the sea, at a wooden jetty extending into the distance. At the end it broadens into a large platform which has been set up with a gauzy white canopy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having cocktails afterward,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou should come along! Maybe you could renew your vows too!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to sound rude, but that\u2019s the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I got married yesterday. Why would I renew my vows?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to renew ours every year,\u201d says Melissa complacently. \u201cNext year we\u2019re going to do them in Mauritius, and I\u2019ve already seen exactly the dress I want to wear. Last month\u2019s Brides. The Vera Wang on page fifty-four. Did you see it?\u201d Melissa\u2019s phone trills before I can answer, and she frowns. \u201cExcuse me a moment.... Matt? Matt, what on earth are you doing? I\u2019m at the bar! As we arranged. The bar ... No, not the spa, the bar!\u201d</p><p>She exhales impatiently, then puts her phone away and beams at me again. \u201cSo, you two must go in for the Couples\u2019 Quiz this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples\u2019 Quiz?\u201d I echo blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou know. Like the TV show. You answer questions about your partner and the winners are the couple who know each other best.\u201d She gestures at a nearby poster, which reads:</p><p>TODAY at 4 PM:</p><p>COUPLES\u2019 QUIZ on the BEACH.</p> <p>BIG PRIZES!! FREE ENTRY!!</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s entered,\u201d she adds, sipping at her drink through a straw. \u201cThey put on loads of activities for honeymooners here. It\u2019s all marketing nonsense, of course.\u201d She casually brushes back her hair. \u201cI mean, honestly, as if marriage were a competition.\u201d</p><p>I almost snort with laughter. Nice try. She wants to win so badly, it\u2019s practically etched on her skin.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you in?\u201d She peers at me over her Gucci shades. \u201cGo on! It\u2019s only a laugh!\u201d</p><p>I suppose she\u2019s right. I mean, let\u2019s face it, what else are we doing with our time?</p><p>\u201cOK.

Well, this is it.\u201d</p><p>Yianni passes two paper flyers to Ben and me, along with a bottle of wine and two glasses, which Ben must have ordered. Melissa has stood up from her bar stool. She\u2019s on the phone again and sounds even more irate than before.</p> <p>\u201cThe beach bar, not the lobby bar. The beach bar! ... OK, stay there, I\u2019m coming.... See you later,\u201d she mouths, and totters off in a swirl of orange caftan.</p><p>When she\u2019s gone, Ben and I are silent for a moment, studying the Couples\u2019 Quiz flyers. Demonstrate your love! Prove you have what it takes as a couple!</p><p>Despite everything, I can feel my competitive spirit rising. Not that I need to prove anything at all. But I just know there isn\u2019t any couple at this resort more intimate and connected than Ben and me. I mean, look at them. And look at us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so going to lose this,\u201d says Ben, with a snort of amusement.</p><p>Lose?</p> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not!\u201d I stare at him in dismay. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we need to know stuff about each other,\u201d replies Ben, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cWhich we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know heaps about each other!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were eighteen! If you ask me, we\u2019re going to win.\u201d</p><p>Ben raises an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe. What kind of questions do they ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I never watched the show.\u201d I have a sudden idea. \u201cBut Fliss has got the board game. I\u2019ll call her.\u201d</p><p>14</p> <p>FLISS</p><p>We\u2019re at the departure gate at Heathrow when my phone rings. Before I can move, Noah plucks it out of the side pocket of my bag and studies the display.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aunt Lottie phoning!\u201d His face lights up in excitement. \u201cShall I tell her we\u2019re coming to surprise her on her special holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I grab the phone. \u201cJust sit down a minute. Look at your sticker pack. Do the dinosaurs.\u201d I press answer and take a couple of steps away from Noah, trying to compose myself. \u201cLottie, hi!\u201d I greet her.</p><p>\u201cThere you are! I\u2019ve been trying to reach you! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... you know. Just around.\u201d I force myself to pause before I add, light as gossamer, \u201cAny luck with your room yet? Or the bed? Or ... anything?\u201d</p><p>I know from Nico that she\u2019s still roomless. But I also know Ben tried to hire a room off another guest on the beach. Sneaky little sod.</p><p>\u201cOh, the room.\u201d Lottie sounds disconsolate. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a bloody saga. We\u2019ve given up for now. We\u2019re just going to enjoy the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Sensible plan.\u201d I breathe a slight sigh of relief. \u201cSo, how is it out there? Sunny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoiling.\u201d Lottie sounds preoccupied. \u201cListen, Fliss, d\u2019you remember that game Couples\u2019 Quiz?\u201d</p><p>I wrinkle my brow. \u201cYou mean the TV show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. You had the board game, didn\u2019t you? What kind of questions do they ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I say, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing a Couples\u2019 Quiz contest. Are the questions hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard? No! They\u2019re just fun. Silly things. Basic stuff that couples know about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me some.\u201d Lottie sounds a bit tense. \u201cGive me some practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK.\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cWhat kind of toothpaste does Ben use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d says Lottie after a pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his mother called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is his favorite meal that you cook for him?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a longer pause. \u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI\u2019ve never cooked for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was going to the theater, would he choose Shakespeare, a modern play, or a musical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d wails Lottie. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to the theater with him. Ben\u2019s right! We\u2019re going to lose!\u201d</p><p>Is she insane? Of course they\u2019re going to lose.</p><p>\u201cDoes Ben know any of those things about you, do you think?\u201d I ask mildly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!

Well ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d says Lottie, lowering her voice savagely. \u201cThere\u2019s this bridezilla girl here and she\u2019s been boasting about her wedding, and if I don\u2019t know anything about my husband and he doesn\u2019t know anything about me ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have married each other!

So, should I know where Ben went to high school, all that kind of stuff? What about hobbies?\u201d</p><p>My frustration returns in a flash. This is ridiculous. She sounds like someone mugging up, trying to fool an immigration officer. For an instant I consider saying all this to her right now.</p><p>But, at the same time, my deeper instincts tell me not to try anything by phone. All that will happen is we\u2019ll have a steaming row and she\u2019ll ring off and get Ben to impregnate her right then and there, probably on the beach in full view of everyone, just to show me.</p><p>I need to get out there. Pretend that I simply wanted to surprise her. I\u2019ll assess the territory, let her relax. Then I\u2019ll draw her aside and we\u2019ll have a chat. A frank chat. A long, relentless chat, from which I will not let her escape till she\u2019s seen the whole picture. Really seen it.</p> <p>This Couples\u2019 Quiz has played into my hands, I realize.

I left him sitting on a plastic chair two feet away, but he\u2019s made his way to the desk and is deep in conversation with an air hostess, who is crouching down and listening intently to him.</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d I call, and both their heads turn. The air hostess raises a hand in acknowledgment, stands up, and leads him back to me. She\u2019s very curvy and tanned, with huge blue eyes and hair in a bun, and as she approaches I catch a waft of perfume.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d I smile at her. \u201cNoah, stay here. No wandering.\u201d</p><p>The air hostess is gazing at me, transfixed, and I put my hand to my mouth, wondering if I have a crumb on my lip.</p><p>\u201cI just want to say,\u201d she says in a rush, \u201cthat I heard about your little boy\u2019s ordeal, and I think you\u2019re all really brave.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment I can\u2019t find a reply. What the hell did Noah say?</p><p>\u201cAnd I think that paramedic should get a medal,\u201d she adds, her voice trembling.</p><p>I look daggers at Noah, who returns my gaze, serene and untroubled. What do I do? If I explain that my son is a complete fantasist, we all look stupid. Maybe it\u2019s easier to go along with it. We\u2019ll be boarding in a minute; we\u2019ll never see her again.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big a deal,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThank you so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big deal?\u201d she echoes incredulously. \u201cBut it was all so dramatic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes.\u201d I swallow. \u201cNoah, let\u2019s buy some water.\u201d</p><p>I hurry him off to a nearby drinks machine, before this conversation can go any further. \u201cNoah,\u201d I say as soon as we\u2019re out of earshot, \u201cwhat did you say to the lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I want to be in the Olympics when I grow up,\u201d he replies promptly. \u201cI want to do the long jump. Like this.\u201d He breaks free of my grasp and leaps across the airport carpet. \u201cCan I be in the Olympics?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I give up. We\u2019ll have to have a big chat at some time\u2014but not now.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d I ruffle his hair. \u201cBut, listen. No more chatting to strangers. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lady wasn\u2019t a stranger,\u201d he points out reasonably. \u201cShe had a badge, so I knew her name. It was Cheryl.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes the logic of a seven-year-old is undefeatable. We return to our seats and I sit him firmly down next to me.</p> <p>\u201cLook at your sticker book and do not move.\u201d I take out my BlackBerry and polish off a few quick emails. I\u2019ve just agreed to an entire supplement on Arctic holidays when I pause, frowning. Something has attracted my attention. The top of a head, behind a newspaper. A dark crest of hair. Long-fingered, bony hands turning a page.</p><p>No way.</p><p>I stare, riveted, until he turns another page and I catch a glimpse of cheekbone. It\u2019s him. Sitting five yards away, a small travel bag at his feet. What the fuck is he doing here?</p><p>Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s had the same idea as me.</p><p>As he turns yet another page, looking calm and unruffled, I start to feel a burning anger. This is all his fault. I\u2019ve had to disrupt my life, take my son out of school, and stress out all night, simply because he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut. He was the one who went blundering in. He caused all this. And now here he is, looking as cool and relaxed as though he\u2019s off on holiday.</p> <p>His phone rings, and he puts down his paper to answer.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I can hear him saying. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. We\u2019ll discuss all those issues. Yes, I know there\u2019s a time factor.\u201d Strain appears in his face. \u201cI know this is not ideal. I\u2019m doing the best I can in tricky circumstances, OK?\u201d There\u2019s a pause as he listens, then replies, \u201cNo, I\u2019d say not. Need to know only. We don\u2019t want to start the rumor mill.... OK. Right. Talk to you when I get there.\u201d</p><p>He puts his phone away and resumes reading the paper, while I watch with growing resentment. That\u2019s right. Lean back. Smile at a joke. Have a good time. Why not?</p><p>I\u2019m glaring at him so hard, I feel I might start burning holes in the paper. An elderly lady sitting next to him picks up on my glare and eyes me nervously. I smile at her quickly, to indicate that it\u2019s not her I\u2019m livid with\u2014but this seems to freak her out even more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cBut ... is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d says Lorcan, misunderstanding and turning to her. \u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong\u2014\u201d He catches sight of me and starts in surprise. \u201cOh. Hello.\u201d</p> <p>I wait for him to add a fulsome, groveling apology, but he seems to feel this greeting is enough. His dark eyes meet mine, and with no warning I have a flashback: a blurred moment of skin and lips from the middle of that night. His hot breath on my neck. My hands clutching his hair. The color comes to my cheeks and I glare at him even more venomously.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I echo. \u201cIs that all you can say? \u2018Hello\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re headed to the same place?\u201d He puts his newspaper down and leans forward, his face suddenly intent. \u201cAre you in touch with them? Because I have to talk to Ben, urgently. I have documents for him to sign. I need him to be at the hotel when I arrive. But he won\u2019t pick up when I call. He\u2019s avoiding me. He\u2019s avoiding everything.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in disbelief. All he\u2019s concerned with is some business deal. What about the fact that his best friend has married my sister in a totally stupid knee-jerk gesture caused by him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in touch with Lottie. Not Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He frowns and turns back to the paper. How can he read the paper? I feel deeply, mortally offended that he can concentrate on the sports pages when he\u2019s created such a mess.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d He peers up at me. \u201cYou seem a little ... fixated.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m simmering all over with rage. I can feel my head prickling; I can feel my fists clenching. \u201cFunnily enough, no,\u201d I manage. \u201cI\u2019m not OK.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d He glances at the paper yet again, and something inside me snaps.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at that!\u201d I leap up and grab it from his hands before I\u2019m fully aware of what I\u2019m doing. \u201cStop it!\u201d I crumple the paper furiously and throw it on the floor. I\u2019m panting and my cheeks are blazing.</p><p>Lorcan stares at the paper, apparently bemused.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d says Noah, in delighted shock. \u201cLitterbug!\u201d</p><p>All the other airline passengers have turned to stare at me. Great. And now Lorcan is gazing up at me too, dark brows drawn together, as though I\u2019m some inscrutable mystery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d he says at last. \u201cAre you pissed off?\u201d</p><p>Is he joking?</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I erupt. \u201cI am a little pissed off that, after I had sorted out the whole situation with Ben and my sister, you had to go barging in and wreck it!\u201d</p><p>I can see the truth slowly dawning on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re blaming me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m blaming you! If you\u2019d said nothing, they wouldn\u2019t be married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d He shakes his head adamantly. \u201cIncorrect. Ben\u2019s mind was made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie said it was because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie was wrong.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not going to back down, is he? Bastard.</p> <p>\u201cAll I know is, I\u2019d sorted the situation,\u201d I say stonily. \u201cI\u2019d managed it. And then this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you\u2019d sorted it,\u201d he corrects me. \u201cYou thought you\u2019d managed it. When you know Ben as well as I do, you\u2019ll realize that his mind flips direction like a fish. Previous agreements count for nothing. Agreements to sign crucial, time-sensitive documents, for example.\u201d There\u2019s a sudden irritation in his voice. \u201cYou can pin him down all you like. He still slips away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here?\u201d I glance at his briefcase. \u201cJust for these documents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Muhammad won\u2019t come to the mountain, the mountain has to cancel all his plans and get on a plane.\u201d His phone bleeps with a text and he reads it, then starts typing a reply. \u201cIt would really help me if I could talk to Ben,\u201d he adds as he types. \u201cDo you know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples\u2019 Quiz,\u201d I reply.</p><p>Lorcan looks baffled, then types some more. Slowly, I sit down. Noah has descended onto the floor and is making a hat out of Lorcan\u2019s newspaper.</p> <p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I say, without conviction. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. My son,\u201d I add to Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says Lorcan to Noah. \u201cNice hat. So, you never told me. What are you doing here, exactly? Joining the happy couple, I assume. Do they know?\u201d</p><p>The question takes me off guard. I sip the water, my mind working hard.</p><p>\u201cLottie asked me to go out there,\u201d I lie at last. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if Ben knows yet, so don\u2019t mention that you\u2019ve seen me, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cA little odd, asking your sister to join you on honeymoon. Isn\u2019t she having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, they\u2019re thinking of renewing their vows,\u201d I say in sudden inspiration. \u201cLottie wanted me there as a witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Lorcan scowls. \u201cWhat kind of shit idea is that?\u201d</p><p>His tone is so dismissive, I find myself getting irritated.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s rather a nice idea,\u201d I contradict him. \u201cLottie\u2019s always wanted a ceremony by the sea. She\u2019s quite a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Lorcan nods as though digesting this, then looks up, deadpan. \u201cWhat about the ponies? Is she having those?\u201d</p><p>Ponies? I peer at him blankly. What on earth\u2014</p><p>Matching ponies. Great. So he did hear me yesterday morning. My face fills with blood, and just for an instant I feel myself losing my cool.</p><p>The way to deal with this, I swiftly decide, is to be direct. We\u2019re grown-ups. We can acknowledge an embarrassing situation and move on. Exactly.</p><p>\u201cSo. Um.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cYesterday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He leans forward, with mock interest. He\u2019s not going to make this easy for me, is he?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what you ...\u201d I try again. \u201cObviously I was talking on the phone to my sister when you came into the room. And what you heard was totally out of context. I mean, you\u2019ve probably forgotten what I said. But just in case you haven\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t want you to ... misinterpret anything....\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not paying me any attention. He\u2019s taken out a notepad and is writing on it. So rude. Still, at least that means I\u2019m off the hook. I offer the water bottle to Noah, who sips absentmindedly, his attention fixed on his newspaper hat. Then I look up as Lorcan taps me on the shoulder. He hands me his notepad, on which are lines of writing.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have a good memory for words,\u201d he says politely. \u201cBut please correct me if any of it is wrong.\u201d</p><p>As I read the lines, my jaw drops in dismay.</p><p>Small. Seriously, tiny. The whole night was such an ordeal. I had to pretend I was having a good time, and all along ... No. Terrible. And afterward wasn\u2019t much better. I feel ill at the very thought. In fact, I might throw up. And then Lorcan will never love me, and we\u2019ll never get married in a double wedding on matching ponies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I manage at last, my face puce. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean ... that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich bit?\u201d He raises his eyebrows.</p><p>Bastard.

They didn\u2019t refer to ...\u201d I trail off as a growing hubbub attracts my attention. It\u2019s coming from the desk. Two air hostesses are remonstrating with a man in a linen shirt and chinos, who\u2019s trying to squash a suitcase into the hand-baggage measuring stand. As he raises his voice angrily to answer, I realize it\u2019s familiar.</p> <p>He turns, and I quell a gasp of shock. I thought so: it\u2019s Richard!</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m afraid the case is clearly too big for the cabin.\u201d A woman from the airline is addressing him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late to check it in now. Might I suggest that you wait and catch a later flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA later flight?\u201d Richard\u2019s voice erupts from him like the sound of a tormented animal. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other flights to this godforsaken place! One a day! What kind of service is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get on this flight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, sir\u2014\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment, Richard vaults up so that he\u2019s resting on the high desk, his eyes level with the airline woman\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThe girl I love has tethered herself to another man,\u201d he says intensely. \u201cI was too slow off the mark, and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for that. But if I can do nothing else, I can tell her how I really feel. Because I never showed her. Not properly. I\u2019m not even sure I knew myself.\u201d</p><p>I gape at him, absolutely astonished. Is this Richard? Making declarations of love in public? If only Lottie could see this! She\u2019d be bowled over! The airline woman, on the other hand, looks supremely unmoved. She has black dyed hair pulled into a harsh bun and a doughy face with mean little eyes.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, sir,\u201d she says, \u201cyour case is too big for the cabin. Could you step aside from the desk?\u201d</p><p>What a bitch. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people take luggage that size onto planes. I know I should step forward and tell Richard I\u2019m here, but something inside me needs to see what will happen next.</p> <p>\u201cFine. I won\u2019t bring the bag.\u201d Glowering at her, Richard jumps back down to the floor and snaps open the clasps of his case. He grabs a couple of T-shirts, a wash bag, a pair of socks, and some boxer shorts, then kicks the case aside.</p><p>\u201cThere. This is my hand luggage.\u201d He brandishes it all at her. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>The airline woman regards him evenly. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave that case there, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He snaps the case shut and dumps it on top of a litter bin. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave it there either, sir. It\u2019s a security issue. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just saw me unpack it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe that as it may, sir.\u201d</p><p>The entire place has turned to watch this exchange. Richard is breathing hard. His broad shoulders are raised. Again I\u2019m reminded of a bull about to charge.</p><p>\u201cUncle Richard!\u201d Noah has suddenly noticed him. \u201cAre you coming on holiday with us?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s whole body jolts in astonishment as he registers first Noah, then me.</p><p>\u201cFliss?\u201d He drops a pair of boxer shorts on the floor and stoops to pick them up, looking a little less bull-like. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Richard.\u201d I try to sound nonchalant. \u201cWe\u2019re joining Lottie. What\u2014 er\u2014\u201d I spread my hands questioningly. \u201cI mean, what exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Clearly I know the gist of what he\u2019s up to, as does everyone here, but I\u2019m interested in the details. Does he have a plan?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit back,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just lose her and walk away and never even tell her what I\u2014\u201d He breaks off, his face working with emotion. \u201cI should have proposed when I had the chance,\u201d he adds suddenly. \u201cI should have cherished what I had! I should have proposed!\u201d</p><p>His roar of grief rises through the silent air. The whole place is agog, and, quite frankly, I\u2019m flabbergasted. I\u2019ve never seen Richard moved to such passion. Has Lottie?</p><p>I wish I\u2019d recorded his whole speech on my BlackBerry.</p><p>\u201cSir, please remove your case from that bin.\u201d The airline woman is addressing Richard. \u201cAs I say, it\u2019s causing a security alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine anymore,\u201d he counters, brandishing his boxer shorts at her. \u201cThis is my hand luggage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman\u2019s chin tightens. \u201cDo you want me to call security and have your case destroyed, thus delaying the flight by six hours?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the only person who gasps in horror. Around us, polite murmurs of protest start swelling into hostile, pointed comments. I\u2019m sensing Richard is not the most popular passenger in the place. In fact, I\u2019m sensing that the boos and slow hand-claps may begin any moment.</p><p>\u201cUncle Richard, are you coming on holiday with us?\u201d Noah is consumed with joy. \u201cCan we do wrestling? Can I sit next to you on the plane?\u201d He throws himself at Richard\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it, kiddo.\u201d Richard gives him a wry smile. \u201cUnless you can persuade this lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is your uncle?\u201d Noah\u2019s friend Cheryl springs into life at the other desk, where she\u2019s been watching proceedings with a vacant stare. \u201cThe uncle you were telling me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Uncle Richard,\u201d confirms Noah happily.</p><p>I should never have let him get into the habit of calling Richard \u201cUncle,\u201d I think to myself. It started one Christmas and we thought it was cute. We didn\u2019t predict a breakup. We thought Richard had become part of the family. We never thought\u2014</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m aware that Cheryl is almost hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cMargot!\u201d At last she manages to speak through her gasps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let this man on the plane! He saved his nephew\u2019s life! He\u2019s a brilliant man!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Margot scowls.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Richard gapes at Cheryl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be modest! Your nephew told me the whole story!\u201d Cheryl says tremulously. \u201cMargot, you have no idea. This whole family. They\u2019ve been through such a lot.\u201d She steps out from behind her desk. \u201cSir, let me take your boarding pass.\u201d</p><p>I can see Richard\u2019s mind whirring in disbelief. He glances suspiciously at Noah, then at me. I pull an agonized face, trying to convey the message, Just go with it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you too.\u201d Cheryl turns gushingly to me. \u201cYou must have been deeply affected by your little boy\u2019s ordeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take each day as it comes,\u201d I murmur vaguely.</p> <p>This seems to satisfy her, and she moves away. Richard is still clutching his underpants, looking gobsmacked. I\u2019m not even going to try to explain.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, you want to sit down?\u201d I say. \u201cI could get us a coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you joining Lottie?\u201d he demands without moving. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to answer. On the one hand, I don\u2019t want to give him false hope. On the other, could I perhaps hint that all is not perfect in paradise?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re renewing their vows, aren\u2019t they?\u201d says Lorcan over his newspaper.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Richard reacts with instant suspicion. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cUm, Richard, this is Lorcan. Ben\u2019s best man. Best friend. Whatever. He\u2019s flying out there too.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Richard stiffens into his bull-like posture again.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think he does see, but he\u2019s so tense I don\u2019t dare interrupt. He\u2019s instinctively squared up to Lorcan, his fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d says Lorcan politely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the idiot who let her go!\u201d says Richard with sudden passion. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see the vision she wanted for us. I thought she was, I don\u2019t know, starry-eyed. But now I can see the stars too. I can see the vision. And I want it too.\u201d</p><p>All the women nearby are listening to him, rapt. Where did he learn to speak like that? Lottie would love that stuff about stars. I\u2019ve been fumbling at my BlackBerry, trying to surreptitiously record him, but I\u2019m too slow.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I quickly lower my phone.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Maybe this is a bad idea.\u201d Richard suddenly seems to come to and see himself standing in the middle of a departure lounge with underwear in his hands and an audience of passengers. \u201cMaybe I should just bow out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t bow out!\u201d</p><p>If only Lottie could see Richard right now. If only she could know his true feelings. She\u2019d see sense, I know she would.</p><p>\u201cWho am I kidding?\u201d He sags in desolation. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. They\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not!\u201d I retort before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard and Lorcan both stare at me. I can see lots of other interested faces leaning in to listen too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI mean they haven\u2019t, you know, consummated it yet,\u201d I explain as quietly as I can. \u201cSo technically that means they could still get a legal annulment.

We tell each other everything. And as for why ...\u201d I clear my throat evasively. \u201cIt\u2019s simply bad luck. The hotel messed up with the beds. Ben got drunk. That kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo much information,\u201d says Lorcan, and starts putting his papers away in his briefcase.</p><p>Richard says nothing. His brow is furrowed and he appears to be taking this all in. At last he sinks down on the seat next to me and savagely screws his boxer shorts into a ball. I watch him, still feeling disbelief that he\u2019s here at all.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou know the phrase \u2018Too little, too late\u2019? Well, you\u2019re more like \u2018Too much, too late.\u2019 Flying halfway across the world. Rushing to the airport. Making romantic speeches all over the place. Why didn\u2019t you do any of this before?\u201d</p><p>Richard doesn\u2019t answer the question but stares at me glumly. \u201cYou think I\u2019m too late?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a question I don\u2019t want to answer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an expression,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cCome on.\u201d I pat him reassuringly on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re boarding.\u201d</p><p>About half an hour into the flight, Richard comes up to the front, where Noah and I are sitting in a row of three in club class. I haul Noah onto my lap and Richard slides in next to me.</p><p>\u201cHow tall would you say this Ben is?\u201d he says with no preamble.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve seen pictures. Would you say ... five eight? Five nine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say five nine. Definitely shorter than me,\u201d Richard adds, with a grim satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not hard,\u201d I point out. Richard is at least six foot two.</p><p>\u201cNever thought Lottie would go for a short-arse.\u201d</p><p>I have no reply to make to this, so I roll my eyes and carry on reading the airline magazine.</p><p>\u201cI looked him up.\u201d Richard mashes an airsick bag between his fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s a multimillionaire. Owns a paper company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to find out if he\u2019s got a private jet. It didn\u2019t say. Expect he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, stop torturing yourself.\u201d I finally turn to him. \u201cIt\u2019s not about private jets. Or height. There\u2019s no point comparing yourself to him.\u201d</p> <p>Richard looks at me for a few silent seconds. Then, as though I hadn\u2019t even spoken, he says, \u201cHave you seen his house? They used it for Highton Hall. He\u2019s a multimillionaire and he\u2019s got a stately home.\u201d He scowls. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s pretty puny, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He\u2019s tearing the airsick bag into strips. \u201cNever thought Lottie would go for someone so puny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, stop it!\u201d I exclaim in exasperation. If he\u2019s going to go on like this the whole journey, I\u2019ll go mad.</p><p>\u201cIs this our special guest?\u201d A sugary voice interrupts us, and we look up to see an air hostess with a French plait, bearing down on us with a wide smile. She\u2019s holding a teddy bear, an airline wallet, some lollipops, and a huge box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates. \u201cCheryl told us all about you,\u201d she addresses Noah brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve got some special gifts for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool! Thank you!\u201d Noah grabs the presents before I can stop him and gasps, \u201cMummy, look! A big box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates! You can get them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s really unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do!\u201d the air hostess assures me. \u201cAnd is this the famous uncle?\u201d She bats her eyelashes at Richard, who stares back with a blank frown.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle can speak three languages,\u201d says Noah proudly. \u201cUncle Richard, talk Japanese!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surgeon and a linguist?\u201d The air hostess opens her eyes wide, and I dig my fingers into Richard\u2019s hand before he can protest. I don\u2019t want Noah mortified in public.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s a very talented man. Thanks so much.\u201d I smile at the air hostess fixedly till she leaves, after a final pat on the head for Noah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFliss, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d expostulates Richard in an undertone as soon as she\u2019s walked away.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a credit card to put in my wallet?\u201d asks Noah, examining it. \u201cCan I have an AmEx? Can I have points?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He knows about AmEx points at the age of seven? This is mortifying. Almost as bad as when we checked in to a hotel in Rome and, by the time I\u2019d found change for a tip, Noah had already asked to see a different room.</p><p>I get out my iPod and hand it to Noah, who whoops with delight and slots the earphones into his ears. Then I lean toward Richard and lower my voice.</p> <p>\u201cNoah told some made-up story to the ground staff.\u201d I bite my lip, feeling a sudden relief at sharing my worries. \u201cRichard, he\u2019s turned into a complete fantasist. He does it at school. He told one teacher he\u2019d had a heart transplant and another he had a surrogate baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard\u2019s face drops.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he get those kind of ideas, anyway? A surrogate baby sister, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff a DVD they were playing in the special-needs department,\u201d I say wryly.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Richard digests this. \u201cSo what story did he tell this lot?\u201d He gestures at the air hostess.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Apart from the fact that you play a starring role as a surgeon.\u201d I meet his eye and we suddenly both snort with laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d Richard shakes his head, biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor little guy.\u201d Richard ruffles Noah\u2019s head, and he looks up briefly from his iPod trance, a beatific smile on his face. \u201cDo they think he\u2019s doing it because of the divorce?\u201d</p><p>My residual laughter melts away. \u201cProbably,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cOr, you know, the evil career mother.\u201d</p> <p>Richard winces. \u201cSorry.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHow\u2019s that all going, anyway? Have you signed the settlement yet?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to answer honestly\u2014then stop myself. I\u2019ve bored Richard many times over dinner about Daniel. I can see he\u2019s bracing himself for the rant. Why did I never notice people bracing themselves before?</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I give him my new saccharine smile. \u201cAll good! Let\u2019s not talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Richard looks taken aback. \u201cGreat! So ... any new men on the horizon?\u201d His voice suddenly seems to have doubled in volume, and I flinch. Before I can stop myself, I glance at Lorcan, who is sitting by the opposite window, engrossed in his laptop, and thankfully didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNothing. No one.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m telling myself furiously not to look at Lorcan, not to even think about Lorcan. But it\u2019s like telling yourself not to think about a rabbit. Before I can stop them, my eyes have darted to him again. This time, Richard follows my gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He peers at me in astonishment. \u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean ... yes.\u201d I feel flustered. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Richard sounds mortally offended. \u201cBut he\u2019s on the other side!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t sides.\u201d</p><p>Richard is surveying Lorcan with narrowed, suspicious eyes. After a moment, Lorcan looks up. He seems startled to see us both gazing at him. My whole body floods with heat and I abruptly turn away.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I hiss. \u201cDon\u2019t look at him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were looking at him too,\u201d points out Richard.</p><p>\u201cOnly because you were!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, you seem hassled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hassled,\u201d I say with dignity. \u201cI\u2019m simply trying to be an adult in an adult situation\u2014 You\u2019re looking at him again!\u201d I jab at his arm. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s oldest friend. A lawyer. Works at his company.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo ... is it a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not a thing. We just hooked up and then ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou unhooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a bundle of laughs,\u201d says Richard, still surveying Lorcan critically. \u201cI\u2019m being sarcastic,\u201d he adds after a pause.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I nod. \u201cGot that.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan looks up again and raises his eyebrows. The next minute he\u2019s unbuckling his seat belt and coming over to where we\u2019re sitting.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I murmur. \u201cThanks, Richard. Hello.\u201d I smile sweetly up at Lorcan. \u201cEnjoying the flight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tremendous.

But maybe this isn\u2019t the place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you,\u201d he cuts across me, taking in Richard with his glance too. \u201cI\u2019m flying out to Ikonos for good reason. I have some important business to discuss with Ben. He needs to be focused. So if you\u2019re planning to yell at him or beat him up or steal his wife from him, or whatever you\u2019re going to do, I have a request. Please leave it till our meeting is over. Then he\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>I feel an instant surge of resentment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d I jut out my chin.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only interested in your business. Not in the fact that you caused this marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not cause it,\u201d he retaliates. \u201cAnd of course the business is my priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Of course\u2019?\u201d I echo sarcastically. \u201cBusiness is more important than marriage? Interesting viewpoint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight now, yes. And it needs to be Ben\u2019s priority too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might beat him up.\u201d Richard pounds his palm with his fist. \u201cI might just do that.\u201d</p><p>The elderly lady sitting next to me looks appalled. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she says hurriedly to Lorcan. \u201cWould you like to exchange seats so you can talk to your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I begin, as Lorcan says, \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Great. A minute later, Lorcan is buckling up his seat belt next to me while I stare studiously ahead. Just the sense of him so close to me is making my skin prickle. I can smell his aftershave. It\u2019s giving me Proustian flashbacks to that night, which are really not helpful.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say shortly. It\u2019s only one syllable, but I think it successfully conveys the message: You\u2019re wrong on everything, from who\u2019s to blame for this marriage, to what exactly I meant that morning, to your priorities generally.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he replies with a curt nod. I have a feeling he means much the same thing.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I open my newspaper. I\u2019m hereby going to ignore him for the whole flight.</p><p>The only trouble is, I can\u2019t help glancing over at his laptop every so often and seeing phrases that interest me. Richard and Noah are listening to the iPod together while Noah makes inroads into his lollipops. There\u2019s no one else to talk to, even if he is an arrogant bighead on the other team.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I say at last, with a shrug to indicate I\u2019m really not interested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re rationalizing the company,\u201d says Lorcan after a pause. \u201cExpanding one part of our business, refinancing another, jettisoning another. It all needs to be done. The paper industry these days\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmare,\u201d I agree before I can stop myself. \u201cThe price of paper affects us too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The magazine.\u201d He nods. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p> <p>The two of us are making a connection again. I don\u2019t know if this is a mistake or not, but somehow I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s such a relief to have someone to talk to who isn\u2019t my boss or my staff or my child or my ex-husband or my loopy little sister. He doesn\u2019t need anything from me. That\u2019s the difference. He\u2019s just sitting there, composed, as though he doesn\u2019t give a fuck.</p><p>\u201cI read online you developed Papermaker,\u201d I say. \u201cThat was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brainchild.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cOthers more talented than me design the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Papermaker,\u201d I allow. \u201cNice cards. Expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still buy them.\u201d He gives me a tiny grin.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d I retaliate. \u201cTill I find another brand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d He winces and I give him a sidelong look. Maybe that was a bit harsh.</p><p>\u201cAre you actually in trouble?\u201d Even as I ask, I know it\u2019s an inane question. Everyone\u2019s in trouble right now. \u201cI mean, real trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a junction.\u201d He exhales. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky time. Ben\u2019s dad died with no warning, and we\u2019ve been treading water ever since. We need to make a few brave decisions.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cThe right brave decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I consider this. \u201cDo you mean Ben has to make the right brave decisions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou catch on quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is he likely to? You can tell me. I won\u2019t let on.\u201d I pause, wondering whether to be tactful or not. \u201cAre you about to go bust?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He reacts so hotly, I know I\u2019ve hit a nerve. \u201cWe are not about to go bust.

Lorcan is glowering at the screen saver on his laptop, which I notice is a Papermaker design that I\u2019ve bought myself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Ben will sell,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut to anyone but Zhernakov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Zhernakov?\u201d I challenge him, laughing. \u201cAre you a snob?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a snob!\u201d retorts Lorcan forcefully. \u201cBut I care about the company. A guy like Zhernakov isn\u2019t interested in some two-bit paper company spoiling his view. He\u2019d close down half the company, relocate the rest, ruin the community. If Ben ever spent any time up there, he\u2019d realize\u2014\u201d He stops himself and exhales. \u201cBesides which, the offer\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Ben think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen ...\u201d Lorcan takes a gulp of his mineral water. \u201cUnfortunately, Ben\u2019s pretty na\u00efve. He doesn\u2019t have the business instinct of his father but he thinks he does. Which is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I glance at his briefcase. \u201cSo you want to get out there and persuade Ben to sign all the restructuring contracts before he can change his mind.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan is silent for a while, drumming his fingers lightly together.</p><p>\u201cI want him to start taking responsibility for his inheritance,\u201d he says at last. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t realize how lucky he is.\u201d</p> <p>I take a few sips of champagne. Some of this makes sense to me and some of it really doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter so much to you?\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s not your company.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan blinks, and I sense I\u2019ve touched a nerve again, although he\u2019s careful to hide it.</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s dad was an amazing guy,\u201d he says at length. \u201cI just want to make things work out the way he would have wanted. And they can,\u201d he adds with sudden vigor. \u201cBen\u2019s creative. He\u2019s smart. He could be a great leader, but he needs to stop dicking around and offending people.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to ask exactly how Ben has offended people, but I can\u2019t quite bring myself to be that nosy.</p><p>\u201cYou were a lawyer in London, weren\u2019t you?\u201d My thoughts head off in a new direction.</p><p>\u201cFreshfields are still wondering where I am.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s face flashes with humor. \u201cI was on gardening leave between law firms when I went up to stay with Ben\u2019s dad. That was four years ago. I still get calls from recruitment companies, but I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you do annulments?\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I can stop them.</p> <p>\u201cAnnulments?\u201d Lorcan raises his eyebrows very high. \u201cI see.\u201d As he meets my eyes, his expression is so quizzical, I nearly laugh. \u201cYou have a Machiavellian mind, Ms. Graveney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a practical mind,\u201d I correct him.</p><p>\u201cSo they really haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d Lorcan interrupts himself. \u201cHey. What\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><p>I follow his glance and see that the old woman who was sitting next to me is clutching her chest and fighting for breath. A teenage boy is looking around helplessly, and he calls out, \u201cIs there a doctor? Is anyone here a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a GP.\u201d A gray-haired man in a linen jacket hurries to the seat. \u201cIs this your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019ve never seen her before!\u201d The teenager sounds panicky, and I don\u2019t blame him. The old lady doesn\u2019t look very well. We\u2019re all watching the doctor talk to the old woman in a low voice and feel for her pulse, when suddenly the air hostess with the French plait appears.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she says breathlessly to us. \u201cPlease could we ask for your help?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Help?

We have a very senior pioneering surgeon from Great Ormond Street on board! He\u2019ll take charge!\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes are bulging in alarm. \u201cNo!\u201d he manages. \u201cNo. Really.

But if you want to give a second opinion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Richard looks desperate. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given her sublingual nitroglycerin. Would you agree with that?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This is bad. Richard looks absolutely desperate.</p> <p>\u201cI ... I ...\u201d He swallows. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never practices on board planes!\u201d I come to his rescue. \u201cHe has a phobia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d gulps Richard, shooting me a grateful glance. \u201cExactly! A phobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since a flight which went dreadfully wrong.\u201d I shudder dramatically, as though from a painful memory. \u201cFlight 406 to Bangladesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me to talk about it.\u201d Richard plays along.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in therapy.\u201d I nod gravely.</p> <p>The GP stares at us both as if we\u2019re crazy.</p><p>\u201cWell, good thing I was here,\u201d he says shortly. He turns back to the old woman, and both Richard and I subside. I feel weak. The air hostess shakes her head in disappointment and heads over to the other side of the plane.</p><p>\u201cFliss, you have to get Noah sorted out,\u201d says Richard in a low, urgent voice. \u201cHe can\u2019t go around just making up stories. He\u2019ll get someone in real trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wince. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The old lady is being taken to some farther bit of the plane. The GP and the cabin crew are having what looks like a tense discussion. They all disappear behind a curtain, and for a little while there\u2019s no sign of life. Richard is staring ahead intently, his forehead creased in concern. He must be worried about the old woman, I find myself thinking benevolently. He has a kind heart, Richard.</p><p>\u201cSo, listen. Tell me.\u201d He turns to me at last, his brow still furrowed. \u201cThey really haven\u2019t done it yet?\u201d</p><p>Oh, honestly. Silly me. He\u2019s a man. Naturally he\u2019s thinking about only one thing.</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I know.\u201d I shrug.</p> <p>\u201cHey, maybe this Ben can\u2019t get it up.\u201d Richard\u2019s face brightens in sudden animation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s the only explanation! He can\u2019t get it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get what up?\u201d asks Noah with interest.</p><p>Great. I glare at Richard, but he\u2019s so triumphant, he doesn\u2019t notice. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some special long German word meaning \u201cthe joy you feel at your rival\u2019s sexual impotence,\u201d and right now Richard has it with bells on.</p><p>\u201cPoor guy,\u201d he adds, as he finally notices my disapproving look. \u201cI mean, I feel for him, obviously. Nasty affliction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no evidence for this,\u201d I point out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his honeymoon,\u201d retorts Richard. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t do it on their honeymoon unless he can\u2019t get it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get what up?\u201d Noah\u2019s voice pipes louder.</p><p>\u201cNothing, darling,\u201d I say hastily to Noah. \u201cJust something very grown-up and boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a grown-up thing that goes up?\u201d asks Noah with piercing curiosity. \u201cDoes it ever go down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get it up!\u201d Richard is exultant. \u201cIt all falls into place. Poor old Lottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can\u2019t get it up?\u201d says Lorcan, turning toward us.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d says Richard.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lorcan looks taken aback. \u201cShit.\u201d He frowns thoughtfully. \u201cWell, that explains a lot.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This is how rumors start. This is how misunderstandings happen and archdukes get shot and world wars begin.</p><p>\u201cListen, both of you!\u201d I say fiercely. \u201cLottie has said nothing whatsoever to me about anything being up ... or down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is up,\u201d volunteers Noah matter-of-factly, and I gasp in horror before I can stop myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK, Fliss.

I thought we had a chance to get there before they ... you know.\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cBut now it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible!\u201d I retort, trying to reassure myself as much as him. \u201cRichard, listen. The truth is, Lottie\u2019s so-called marriage is already falling to bits.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to say as much as that, but I think he needs a shot of confidence in the arm.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cI do! What you don\u2019t know is, there\u2019s a history here. Every time Lottie breaks up with someone, she does this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe gets married?\u201d Richard looks scandalized. \u201cEvery time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I want to laugh at his expression. \u201cI just mean she does something rash and idiotic. And then she comes to. I\u2019ll probably get off the plane and find a text waiting for me, saying, Fliss, I made a huge mistake! Help!\u201d</p><p>I can see Richard digesting this idea. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve been here before. I call them her Unfortunate Choices. Sometimes she joins a cult, sometimes she gets a tattoo.... Think of this marriage as an extreme piercing. Right this minute, they\u2019re doing a Couples\u2019 Quiz,\u201d I add to encourage him. \u201cI mean, what a joke! They haven\u2019t got a clue about each other. Lottie will see that, and she\u2019ll start to think straight, and then she\u2019ll realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples\u2019 Quiz?\u201d says Richard after a pause. \u201cYou mean like that TV game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Like, \u2018What is your partner\u2019s favorite meal that you cook for her?\u2019 That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpaghetti carbonara,\u201d says Richard, without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d I squeeze his hand. \u201cIf you guys did it, you\u2019d win.

Test me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, what shampoo does she use?\u201d I challenge him.</p><p>Ben screws up his face to think. \u201cI know this.... It\u2019s Silvikrin. It\u2019s in the opening sequence. What\u2019s Dirk\u2019s favorite drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBourbon straight up,\u201d I say without missing a beat. \u201cEasy. When\u2019s Sally\u2019s birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune twelfth, and Dirk always gets her white roses. When\u2019s yours?\u201d he asks, looking alarmed. \u201cIt\u2019s not soon, is it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. We know the marriage of a fictional TV detective couple better than we know our own. It\u2019s so ridiculous I can\u2019t help grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cOK, Dirk, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d I look up to see Nico approaching, flanked by Georgios and Hermes. The Three Stooges, as Ben\u2019s started calling them. We\u2019re in the most secluded, hidden spot in the garden, but even so, they managed to track us down. They\u2019ve been hovering round us endlessly all afternoon, offering drinks, snacks, and even appearing with the most unflattering Ikonos-branded sun hats in case we were getting overheated.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr, I believe you are entered for the Couples\u2019 Quiz? It\u2019s beginning in a few minutes, down on the beach,\u201d Nico addresses us pleasantly. He\u2019s changed into a jacket with glittery braid, which makes me wonder if he\u2019s quizmaster.</p> <p>\u201cWe were just coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent! Georgios will assist you.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t need bloody assistance, I want to retort, but I bite my lip and smile.</p><p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on, Sally,\u201d mutters Ben in my ear, and I stifle a giggle. Maybe this will be fun after all.</p><p>They\u2019ve really gone to town. There\u2019s a wooden platform set up on the beach, decorated with a skirt of red foil strips. Clusters of red-heart helium balloons are anchored at each side. A massive banner reads COUPLES\u2019 QUIZ, and a three-piece band is playing \u201cLove Is All Around.\u201d Melissa is pacing about on the sand in her orange caftan, followed two steps behind by a sandy-haired man in Vilebrequin trunks and an aqua polo shirt. I assume he\u2019s her husband, as they\u2019re both wearing prominent badges reading COUPLE ONE, along with their printed names.</p> <p>\u201cStella McCartney,\u201d she\u2019s saying furiously as we approach. \u201cYou know it\u2019s Stella McCartney. Oh! Hi! You made it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to do battle?\u201d says Ben, with a mischievous glint.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of fun!\u201d she replies, almost aggressively. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, Matt?\u201d</p><p>Matt is holding The Couples\u2019 Quiz Official Question Book, I suddenly notice in disbelief. Did they bring that with them?</p><p>\u201cOh, we happened to have that,\u201d says Melissa, flushing as she sees me register it. \u201cPut it away, Matt. It\u2019s too late now, anyway,\u201d she adds to him in a savage undertone. \u201cI really think you could have made more effort.... Hello! You must be the other competitors! Just a bit of fun!\u201d She greets an older-looking couple who are approaching hand in hand, looking a bit perplexed by the whole thing. They have graying hair, coordinated beige slacks, and short-sleeved Hawaiian cotton shirts, and the man has socks on with sandals.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr, your badge.\u201d Nico descends and gives us our COUPLE THREE badges. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Kenilworth, here are your name badges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you on honeymoon?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking the woman, who it turns out, is called Carol.</p><p>\u201cBless you, no!\u201d She\u2019s fiddling with her lapel. \u201cWe won this trip at our bridge-club auction. Not our kind of thing, really, but you have to show willing, and we do enjoy a quiz....\u201d</p> <p>Nico ushers all six of us onto the platform, and we survey the audience, which is a middle-size crowd of guests in sarongs and T-shirts, with cocktails in their hands.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d Nico has switched on his radio mike, and his voice booms round the beach. \u201cWelcome to the hotel\u2019s very own Couples\u2019 Quiz!\u201d</p><p>Actually this is quite fun. It\u2019s just like it is on the telly. All of us women are led away to a nearby gazebo and given headphones which blast music into our ears, while the men answer questions onstage. Then we swap places and it\u2019s our turn. As I write down my answers, I feel suddenly nervous. Did Ben stick to the plan? Did he really answer as Dirk? What if he chickened out?</p><p>Well, too late now. I scribble my final answer and hand in the paper.</p><p>\u201cAnd now!\u201d Nico says to an accompanying drumroll from the band. \u201cLet us reunite our couples! No conferring!\u201d The audience applauds as the men come back onto the stage. The men are on one side of Nico and the women on the other, and I can see Melissa trying to attract Matt\u2019s attention while he resolutely ignores her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFirst question!

Congratulations, ten points!\u201d He turns to me, his eyebrows raised. \u201cYou don\u2019t have it with you now, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never go anywhere without it.\u201d I twinkle back at him.</p> <p>\u201cA gun?\u201d persists Melissa. \u201cAre you serious?

Zero points. Couple Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go to Dill\u2019s Diner now,\u201d I say. \u201cIs that what he put?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d begins Nico, \u201cbut that is not the answer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I interrupt, as a relieved smile spreads across Melissa\u2019s face. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished. We go to Dill\u2019s Diner now, but we used to go to Jerry and Jim\u2019s Steakhouse, until it was blown up by the mob.\u201d I glance over at Ben, who gives an imperceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Nico, peering at the paper. \u201cYes. Your husband wrote, We went to Jerry and Jim\u2019s till Carlo Dellalucci\u2019s lot blew it up; now we go to Dill\u2019s Diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d demands Melissa. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApartment Forty-three-D, West Eightieth Street,\u201d we say in unison. It\u2019s part of the opening titles.</p><p>\u201cOh, New York,\u201d she says, as though she\u2019s saying, Oh, the rubbish dump.</p><p>\u201cBlew up, as in exploded?\u201d chimes in Matt, looking impressed. \u201cWas anyone killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief of police,\u201d I say, with a terse nod. \u201cAnd the ten-year-old daughter he\u2019d only just met, who died in his arms.\u201d</p><p>It was the finale to season one. Absolutely major telly. I almost want to recommend it to them all. Except that would slightly defeat the point.</p><p>\u201cQuestion three!\u201d Nico exclaims. \u201cNow the competition heats up!\u201d</p><p>By question eight we\u2019ve covered season one, season two, and the Christmas special. Melissa and Matt are ten points behind, and Melissa\u2019s looking more and more tetchy.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be true,\u201d she says, as Ben finishes describing our \u201cmost memorable day together,\u201d which involved an armed siege, a police chase through the Central Park Zoo, and blowing out the candles on his birthday cake in a jail cell (long story). \u201cI dispute these answers.\u201d She raps on the microphone as though it\u2019s a gavel and she\u2019s a judge. \u201cNobody has a life like this!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDirk and Sally do!\u201d I say, trying not to giggle as I meet Ben\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re Dirk and Sally?\u201d she demands at once, looking from face to face as though we\u2019re tricking her in some new way.</p><p>\u201cOur pet names for each other,\u201d says Ben blandly. \u201cAnd may I ask what exactly you\u2019re suggesting? That we learned an entire set of fake answers especially for this competition? Do we look like tragic losers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Her eyes spark indignantly. \u201cAre you telling me your first date was really at a mortuary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you telling me yours was really at the Ivy?\u201d he counters at once. \u201cNo one goes to the Ivy for a first date unless they already know they\u2019ll be so bored they\u2019ll need to do some people-watching. Sorry,\u201d he adds politely to Matt. \u201cI\u2019m sure you had a great time.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop laughing. Melissa\u2019s getting crosser and crosser, and I don\u2019t blame her. More and more people have joined the audience, and they\u2019re loving it too.</p><p>\u201cQuestion nine!\u201d Nico tries to get control of the situation. \u201cWhere is the most unusual place you have had ... amorous relations? Couple Two, would you like to answer first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Carol is growing pinker and pinker. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about this question. Very personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says Nico sympathetically.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the correct word is ...\u201d She pauses, wriggling awkwardly. \u201cFellatio.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an explosion of laughter from the audience, and I clamp my lips together so that I don\u2019t join in. Carol gave Tim a blow job? No way. I cannot imagine that in a million years.</p><p>\u201cYour husband put A cottage in Anglesey,\u201d says Nico, grinning widely. \u201cZero points, I am afraid, dear lady. Although full marks for trying.\u201d</p><p>Carol looks as though she wants to spontaneously combust.</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018place,\u2019 \u201d she begins, \u201cI thought you meant ... I thought ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He nods sympathetically. \u201cCouple One?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHyde Park,\u201d says Melissa promptly, as though she\u2019s a child in class.</p><p>\u201cCorrect! Ten points! Couple Three?\u201d</p><p>I had to think about this one. There are a few options. I just hope Ben remembered the episode.</p><p>\u201cThe boardwalk at Coney Island.\u201d As I look at Ben\u2019s face, I know I got it wrong.</p><p>\u201cAlas! Your husband wrote, On the district attorney\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe district attorney\u2019s desk?\u201d Melissa looks livid. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZero points!\u201d Nico chimes in hurriedly. \u201cAnd now we reach the climax of our quiz. All rests on the final question. The most personal, intimate question of all.\u201d He pauses dramatically. \u201cWhen did you first realize you were in love with your wife?\u201d</p><p>An expectant hush comes over the audience, and there\u2019s a low drumroll from the band.</p> <p>\u201cCouple Three?\u201d says Nico.</p><p>\u201cIt was when we were tied together to a railroad track with a train approaching,\u201d says Ben reminiscently. \u201cShe reached over, kissed me, and said, \u2018If it ends here, I\u2019ll be happy.\u2019 And then she freed us both with her nail file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA railroad track?\u201d Melissa looks from face to face. \u201cCan I appeal that?\u201d</p><p>I beam at Ben and raise my fist in a victory salute. But he doesn\u2019t respond; his eyes are out of focus as though he\u2019s still remembering.</p><p>\u201cCouple Two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d says Ben suddenly. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished my answer. That time on the railroad track\u2014that\u2019s when I realized I was in love with my wife. But the moment I realized I loved her ...\u201d He glances over at me with an unreadable look. \u201cThat was quite another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d says Melissa petulantly. \u201cAre you trying to wind us all up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fall in and out of love,\u201d says Ben. \u201cBut when you really love someone ... it\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>Is that a line from the show? I don\u2019t recognize it. I\u2019m feeling a bit confused here. What\u2019s he talking about?</p><p>\u201cThe day I realized I loved my wife was right here on the island of Ikonos, fifteen years ago.\u201d He leans toward the microphone and his voice rises, now resonant. \u201cI\u2019d had the flu. She nursed me all night. She was my guardian angel. I still remember that sweet voice telling me I\u2019d be OK. Now I realize I\u2019ve loved her since that day, though I didn\u2019t always know it.\u201d</p><p>He finishes to silence. Everyone seems thunderstruck. Then a girl from the audience whoops appreciatively, and it\u2019s as though the spell is broken, and applause breaks out, louder than ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so gripped, I barely hear the others give their answers. He was talking about us. Not Dirk and Sally: us. Ben and Lottie. A warm glow has stolen over me, and I can\u2019t stop smiling. He\u2019s loved me for fifteen years. He\u2019s stood up and said it in public. Nothing so romantic has ever happened to me, ever.</p><p>The only tiny, minuscule niggle is ...</p><p>Well. Just a teeny point, which is that I still don\u2019t remember it happening. My mind is blank. I don\u2019t remember Ben having the flu, nor do I remember nursing him. But, then, there\u2019s a lot about that time I don\u2019t remember, I reassure myself. I\u2019d forgotten all about Big Bill. I\u2019d forgotten about the poker tournament. It\u2019s probably buried somewhere deep inside me.</p><p>\u201c... you know it was on that picnic! You\u2019ve always said so!\u201d</p> <p>Abruptly, I become aware that Melissa and Matt are still squabbling about his answer.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on the picnic,\u201d says Matt obstinately. \u201cIt was in the Cotswolds. But the way you\u2019re carrying on, maybe I wish I hadn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Melissa takes a sharp breath, and I can practically see smoke puff from her ears.</p><p>\u201cI think I know when we fell in love, Matt! And it wasn\u2019t in the bloody Cotswolds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us to the end of our contest!\u201d Nico puts in deftly. \u201cAnd I am delighted to say that our winners are Couple Three! Ben and Lottie Parr! You win a special open-air couple\u2019s massage and will be awarded the Happy Couple of the Week trophy at our gala prize ceremony tomorrow evening. Congratulations!\u201d He leads an uproarious round of applause, and Ben winks at me. We take a bow, and I feel Ben squeeze my hand tightly.</p> <p>\u201cI like the sound of this couple\u2019s massage,\u201d he says into my ear. \u201cI read about it earlier. They do it on the beach in a special curtained arbor with essential oils. You get glasses of champagne, and after they\u2019ve finished, they leave you alone for some \u2018private time.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Private time? I meet his eyes. At last! Ben and I alone on a beach in our own private space, with the waves crashing on the shore and glasses of champagne and our bodies slick with oil ...</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it as soon as we can.\u201d My voice is thick with longing.</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d His hand lightly brushes against my breast, making me shiver with anticipation. I guess we\u2019ve abandoned the no-touching rule. We bow again to the audience and then head down off the platform. \u201cAnd now let\u2019s go for a drink,\u201d adds Ben. \u201cI want to ply you with alcohol.\u201d</p><p>Turns out there are advantages to having a butler. The minute we say that we want a celebratory drink, Georgios swings into action, securing us a corner table at the posh beach restaurant, complete with champagne on ice and special lobster canap\u00e9s brought down from the main restaurant. For once I don\u2019t mind the fuss and bother as the butlers dance around us. It feels right. We should be fussed over. We\u2019re the champions!</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d says Ben when at last we\u2019re left alone. \u201cGood day, as it turns out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery good.\u201d I grin back.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours till our massage.\u201d He meets my eyes, and his mouth twitches with a smile.</p><p>Two delicious hours of savoring the spectacular beach sexathon which is to come. I can cope with that. I sip my champagne and lean back, feeling the sun on my face. Life is just about perfect right now. There\u2019s only the tiniest strain in my thoughts, which I\u2019m trying to ignore. I can ignore it. Yes. I can.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t.</p><p>As I sip my champagne and crunch salted almonds, I\u2019m aware of a glitch in my mood. A weak point I keep trying to skate over. But I can\u2019t fool myself. And I know it\u2019s only going to worry me more, the longer I leave it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know him. Not properly.

He\u2019s gazing at me with the most charming lopsided smile and a distant look to his eyes, as though he\u2019s imagining our future together.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same,\u201d I can\u2019t help blurting out. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve got a whole new future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA future with you.

Sell it to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrance?\u201d I say tentatively. \u201cA farmhouse in France?\u201d I\u2019ve always fantasized about moving to France. \u201cMaybe the Dordogne, or Provence? We could do up a house, find a real project....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that idea.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes are sparkling. \u201cFind a wreck, turn it into something amazing, have friends to stay, long lazy meals\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d My words tumble out, mingling with his. \u201cWe\u2019d have a great big table and wonderful fresh food, and the children would help make the salad....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d learn French too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many children do you want?\u201d</p> <p>My question halts the conversation for a moment. I\u2019m holding my breath, I realize.</p><p>\u201cAs many as we can,\u201d says Ben easily. \u201cIf they all look like you, I\u2019ll have ten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not ten.\u201d I\u2019m laughing in relief. We chime perfectly! My worries were unfounded! We\u2019re totally on the same page when it comes to life choices. I almost want to get out my phone and start finding old French properties to drool over. \u201cYou really want to move to France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I want to do in the next two years, it\u2019s settle myself down,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cFind a lifestyle I can love. And France is a passion of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak French?\u201d</p><p>He reaches for the paper dessert menu, produces a pencil, and scribbles a few lines on the back, then turns it to show me.</p> <p>L\u2019amour, c\u2019est toi</p><p>La beaute, c\u2019est toi</p><p>L\u2019honneur, c\u2019est toi</p><p>Lottie, c\u2019est toi</p><p>I\u2019m enchanted. No one\u2019s ever written me a poem before. And certainly not in French.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much! I love it!\u201d I read it through again, bring the paper right up to my face as though trying to inhale the words, then put it down.</p><p>\u201cBut what about your work?\u201d I\u2019m so desperate for this plan to come true now, I can\u2019t help pressing him, just to make sure. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t leave that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can dip in and out.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t even know quite what Ben\u2019s work consists of. I mean, it\u2019s a company which makes paper, obviously, but what does he do? I\u2019m not sure he ever explained it properly, and it feels a bit late to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave you got someone who could take the reins? What about Lorcan?\u201d I remember Ben\u2019s best friend. \u201cHe works with you, doesn\u2019t he? Could he step in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to.\u201d There\u2019s a sudden bitter twist to Ben\u2019s voice, and I take a mental step back.</p><p>Yikes. I\u2019ve obviously touched a nerve. Not that I know the details, but Ben\u2019s manner instantly evokes a background of tense meetings in boardrooms and slammed doors and emails regretted the following day.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your best man,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cAren\u2019t you best friends?\u201d</p><p>Ben is silent for a few moments, preoccupied with some thought or other.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know why Lorcan\u2019s in my life,\u201d he says at last. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. I turned round and there he was. Just there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis marriage broke up four years ago. He went up to Staffordshire to stay with my dad. Fair enough; they\u2019d always been friendly, since we were at school together. But next thing, Lorcan\u2019s advising my dad and getting a job in the company and running the whole bloody show. You should have seen him and my dad, striding around the place together, making plans, leaving me out completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds awful,\u201d I say sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIt all came to a head two years ago.\u201d He gulps his champagne. \u201cI just upped and left. Went AWOL. I needed to sort myself out. It freaked them so much they contacted the police.\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cI never told them where I was. After that, they behaved as though I was some sort of fragile nutcase. My dad and Lorcan were thicker than ever. Then my dad goes and dies....\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a rawness to his voice which makes my skin prickle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd Lorcan stayed at the company?\u201d I venture.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would he go?

Or weren\u2019t into them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, why don\u2019t you quietly get rid of him?\u201d I\u2019m about to suggest a legal firm I know which specializes in tactfully exiting staff, but Ben doesn\u2019t seem to be listening.</p><p>\u201cLorcan thinks he knows best about everything!\u201d The words come shooting out in a resentful stream. \u201cWhat I should do with my life. What I should do with my company. What advertising agency I should employ. What I should pay my cleaners. What grade of paper is best for which ... I don\u2019t know, desk diary.\u201d He exhales. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know the answer. So he wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of winning,\u201d I say, but I can tell Ben isn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>\u201cHe once confiscated my phone in public, because he thought it \u2018wasn\u2019t appropriate.\u2019 \u201d Ben is burning with resentment.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like harassment!\u201d I say, shocked. \u201cDo you have an effective HR head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ben sounds sulky. \u201cBut she\u2019s leaving. She\u2019d never say anything to Lorcan, anyway. They all love him.\u201d</p><p>Listening with my professional hat on, I\u2019m aghast. This all sounds like a shambles. I want to get a piece of paper and start a five-point action plan for Ben to manage Lorcan more effectively, but that\u2019s not exactly sexy honeymoon talk.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I say instead, my voice gentle and coaxing. \u201cWhere did you go when you went AWOL?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d Ben gives me a curious, wry smile. \u201cNot my finest moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to have lessons in comedy from Malcolm Robinson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Robinson?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>I love Malcolm Robinson. He\u2019s hilarious. He used to have this brilliant sketch show, and once I saw him live at Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cI bought them anonymously at a charity auction. It was originally a weekend, but I persuaded him to extend it to a week. Cost me a fortune. At the end of the week, I asked him to tell me, straight up, if I had any talent.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I\u2019m already cringing inside at his expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I say at last, and clear my throat. \u201cWhat did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said no.\u201d Ben cuts me off, almost tonelessly. \u201cHe was blunt. Told me to give it up. Did me a favor, really. I haven\u2019t cracked a joke since.\u201d</p><p>I wince. \u201cThat must have been devastating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurt my pride, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long had you been ...?\u201d I trail off awkwardly. I don\u2019t know quite how to phrase it. Luckily, Ben gets the gist.</p><p>\u201cSeven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just gave up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell anybody? Your dad? Lorcan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they might notice I\u2019d stopped doing gigs and ask why. They didn\u2019t.\u201d The hurt in his voice is unmistakable. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone else to ... you know. Tell stuff.\u201d</p><p>Spontaneously, I reach for his hand and squeeze it tight. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me now,\u201d I say softly. \u201cTell me stuff.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my hand back and our eyes are locked. For a moment I feel totally connected to him. Then two waiters come to clear our canap\u00e9 plates; we release hands and the spell is broken.</p><p>\u201cStrange honeymoon, huh?\u201d I say wryly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m starting to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI\u2019m almost glad it\u2019s been so weird. At least we won\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>And I mean it. If we hadn\u2019t had all the bedroom disasters, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had this drink and I might never have found out these things about Ben. It\u2019s funny how things work out. I entwine my leg around Ben\u2019s under the table and start working my toe up his thigh in my signature maneuver, but he shakes his head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cUh-uh. Can\u2019t stand it. Too horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth will you survive the couple\u2019s massage, then?\u201d I tease him.</p><p>\u201cBy telling them to keep it to ten minutes flat and then leave us alone in utter privacy,\u201d he replies seriously. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to tip heavily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour to go.\u201d I glance at my watch. \u201cI wonder what kind of oil they use?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChange the subject from oil.\u201d He looks strained. \u201cGive a man a break.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help laughing. \u201cOK, here\u2019s a new subject.

It\u2019s where my life changed. It\u2019s where everything happened. All at one little guest house, fifteen years ago.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Ben nods. \u201cYou have to do cartwheels along the beach for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d I smile at him. \u201cAnd you have to dive off that rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll find that cave we used to go in ...\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both hazy-eyed and smiling, lost in memories.</p><p>\u201cYou used to wear those tiny tie-dyed shorts,\u201d says Ben. \u201cThey drove me wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought them with me,\u201d I confess.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d His eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept them, all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou angel.\u201d</p><p>I grin wickedly back at him, feeling my desire rocket.

She sounded hassled before. I wonder what\u2019s going on. On impulse, I add to my text:</p><p>Hope u r having a lovely day too. Everything OK?? L xxx</p><p>16</p><p>FLISS</p><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with Sofia, Bulgaria. It\u2019s a great city. I\u2019ve been here many times before. It boasts beautiful churches and interesting museums and an outdoor book market. However, it is not where I want to be standing at six in the evening, hot, sweaty, and harassed, waiting for my baggage at the carousel, when I should be on the Greek island of Ikonos.</p><p>The only plus point of the situation: I can\u2019t blame Daniel. Not this time. This one is firmly fate/act of God. (Thanks a lot, God. Is this because of what I said in religious studies class, age eleven? I was joking.) Although I\u2019d actually like to blame Daniel right now. More specifically, I\u2019d like to kick him. Failing that, I may well kick my baggage trolley.</p><p>The crowd around the carousel is five deep. There are people waiting for luggage from several flights, and no one is in a good mood, least of all my fellow passengers from Flight 637 to Ikonos. Not many smiles. Not a lot of jolly banter.</p><p>Sofia, bloody Bulgaria. I mean.</p> <p>Years of traveling for work have made me fairly Zen about airlines and delays and cock-ups, but I must say, this cock-up is of epic proportions. We couldn\u2019t just land, wave the poor old lady off to hospital, and then efficiently resume our journey. Oh no. Her luggage needed to be found, and then there was a problem getting a takeoff slot, and then it turned out something had gone wrong with an engine. The upshot is an unscheduled overnight stay in Sofia. We\u2019re being put up at the City Heights Hotel. (Not bad, four stars, great rooftop bar, as I remember.)</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ours!\u201d yells Noah for the fifty-first time. He\u2019s tried to claim nearly every black suitcase that has appeared on the carousel, despite the fact that ours has a distinctive red strap and is probably on its way to Belgrade right now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, Noah,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cKeep looking.\u201d A woman steps heavily on my toe, and I\u2019m trying to remember any curse words I know in Bulgarian when my phone beeps with a text and I pull it out of my pocket.</p><p>Guess what? WE WON!!!! All going brilliantly. Ben and I make a fab team. Totally happy. Hope u r having a lovely day too. Everything OK?? L xxx</p><p>I\u2019m so shocked I can\u2019t move for a moment. They won? How the hell did they win?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that from?\u201d Richard has seen me reading my phone. \u201cIs that from Lottie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yes.\u201d I\u2019m too slow off the mark to lie.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she say? Has she realized she\u2019s made a mistake?\u201d His face is so eager that I cringe inside. \u201cPresumably they did terribly at the quiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d I hesitate. How do I break this to him? \u201cActually, they won.\u201d</p><p>His face drops and he stares at me, aghast. \u201cThey won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought they didn\u2019t know anything about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they would tank.\u201d Richard becomes accusing.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say, feeling rattled. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some explanation.

But somehow that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her tone softens lovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s as if all the crazy disasters have brought Ben and me closer together.\u201d</p> <p>The disasters have brought them closer together? I\u2019ve brought them closer together?</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d My voice is shrill. \u201cThat\u2019s great!

Are you in touch with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d Her vitriolic tone nearly takes my ear off. \u201cWhy would I be in touch with Richard? He\u2019s well out of my life, and I wish I\u2019d never ever met him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I rub my nose, trying not to look at Richard. I hope he can\u2019t hear.</p> <p>\u201cCan you believe I was prepared to fly across the Atlantic for him? He would never have made such an effort for me. Never.\u201d Her bitterness makes me flinch. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a single romantic bone in his body!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he has!\u201d I retort before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t,\u201d she says resolutely. \u201cYou know what I think? He never loved me at all. He\u2019s probably forgotten all about me already.\u201d</p><p>I look at Richard\u2014hot, sweaty, and resolute\u2014and I want to scream. If only she knew.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Fliss, I think it\u2019s really tasteless of you to mention Richard,\u201d she adds crossly.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I backtrack hastily. \u201cJust thinking aloud. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a fantastic time,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking and bonding and making plans\u2014oh, by the way.

You know he works for Ben\u2019s company? Well, he basically talked Ben\u2019s dad into giving him a job there, and now he has a cushy number and he\u2019s taking over everything and trying to control Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, nonplussed. \u201cI had no idea. I thought they were mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought so too. But Ben really hates him. Apparently he once confiscated Ben\u2019s phone in public!\u201d Her voice rises indignantly. \u201cLike some kind of schoolteacher. Isn\u2019t that atrocious? I told Ben he should charge him with harassment! And there\u2019s loads of other stuff too. So promise me you won\u2019t go and fall for him or anything.\u201d</p><p>I resist the desire to give a hollow, sardonic laugh. Some chance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you promise me you\u2019ll ... er ... carry on having a wonderful time.\u201d It\u2019s killing me to say the words. \u201cWhat\u2019s up next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple\u2019s massage on the beach,\u201d she says happily.</p><p>Every fiber in my body stiffens in alarm.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow. \u201cSo, when\u2019s that? Exactly?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already planning the ear-bashing I\u2019m going to give Nico. What\u2019s going on? How can he have been so negligent? Why are they drinking champagne and eating lobster? Why did he allow Ben to write a French love poem? He should have leapt in and grabbed the pencil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in half an hour,\u201d says Lottie. \u201cThey rub you with oil and then leave you alone for some private time. Honestly, Fliss.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cBen and I are just gagging for it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hopping with agitation. This was not the plan. I\u2019m stuck in bloody Sofia and she and Ben are about to conceive a baby on the beach, whom no doubt they\u2019ll christen \u201cBeach\u201d and then viciously fight over in the high court when it all falls apart. As soon as I\u2019ve said goodbye, I speed-dial Nico.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Richard instantly questions me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation is: I\u2019m on top of the situation,\u201d I say curtly as I\u2019m put through to voicemail. \u201cHello, Nico, it\u2019s Fliss. We need to talk, asap. Give me a call. Bye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what did Lottie say?\u201d demands Richard as I end the call. \u201cDid they win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d He\u2019s breathing heavily. \u201cBastard. What does he know about her that I don\u2019t? What\u2019s he got that I haven\u2019t? Apart from, obviously, the stately home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, stop!\u201d I snap in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition!\u201d</p><p>Richard stares at me as though I\u2019m the thickest moron that ever existed. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a competition,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss, everything in a man\u2019s life is a competition!\u201d He suddenly loses it. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that? From the moment you\u2019re a three-year-old boy, peeing up against the wall with your friends, all you really care about is: Am I bigger than him? Am I taller? Am I more successful? Is my wife hotter? So, the day that some smooth bastard with a private jet runs off with the girl you love: yes, it\u2019s a competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know he\u2019s got a private jet,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. In spite of myself, I\u2019m rating Richard against Ben in my mind. Well, Richard would win in my book\u2014but, then, I\u2019ve never met Ben.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK. Suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWhat counts as winning? Where\u2019s the finish line? She\u2019s married to someone else. So doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019ve already lost?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean to be harsh\u2014but these are the facts.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019ve told Lottie how I really feel ... and she\u2019s still said no,\u201d says Richard resolutely, \u201cthen I\u2019ll have lost.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twinges with sympathy for him. He\u2019s putting himself on the line here. No one can say he\u2019s taking the easy way out.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, you know which way I would vote.\u201d I squeeze his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing now?\u201d He glances at my phone. \u201cTell me what they\u2019re doing. I know she\u2019ll have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve just had champagne and lobster,\u201d I say reluctantly. \u201cAnd Ben\u2019s written her a love poem in French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn French?\u201d Richard looks as though someone has kneed him in the stomach. \u201cSmarmy bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re planning to go to the guest house tomorrow,\u201d I tell him, as Lorcan joins us. He and Noah are wheeling three cases between them. \u201cWell done, you two! That\u2019s all the luggage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHigh five,\u201d says Noah solemnly to Lorcan, and smacks his proffered palm.</p><p>\u201cThe guest house?\u201d Richard looks stricken by this piece of news. \u201cThe guest house where they met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>His scowl deepens. \u201cShe always goes on about that place. The calamari that was unlike any calamari in the world. And the secluded beach that was better than any other beach. I took her to Kos once, and all she could say was it wasn\u2019t as good as the guest house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez, the guest house.\u201d Lorcan nods in agreement. \u201cI hate that place. If I have to hear Ben tell me one more time about how the sunset was like a mind-altering experience ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie went on about the sunset too.\u201d Richard nods.</p><p>\u201cAnd how they all used to get up at dawn and do fucking yoga\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and the people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014the atmosphere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sea was the clearest, most turquoise, most perfect sea in existence,\u201d I chime in, rolling my eyes. \u201cI mean, get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody place,\u201d says Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI wish it had burned down,\u201d adds Richard.</p><p>We all look at each other, immensely cheered. There\u2019s nothing like having a common enemy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, we should go,\u201d says Lorcan.

I know what you are thinking, and I am mortified\u2014\u201d As he launches into some long, rambling apology, I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got time for all that. They\u2019re about to get it together on the beach. You need to move fast. Listen.\u201d</p> <p>17</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>This is the perfect setting for a wedding night. I mean, our own private beach! How cool is that?</p><p>We\u2019re in a secluded little cove that you reach from the main beach over stepping stones and there\u2019s a DO NOT DISTURB sign placed on a rock. Our two massage therapists led us here in a little procession, followed by Georgios and Hermes carrying champagne and oysters, which are waiting for us on ice. Now we\u2019re lying on a huge double massage bed, while the two massage therapists, Angelina and Carissa, rub oil into our bodies. Billowing all around us are white curtains, so we\u2019re totally private in our enclosure. The sky is that intense blue you only get at a certain point in the early evening, and scented candles planted in the sand are giving off a sweet aroma. Birds are swooping and calling. I can hear the tiny splash of waves on the sand, and the air has a salty tang. It\u2019s all so scenic, I feel as though I\u2019m in some arty pop video.</p><p>Ben reaches out his hand to take mine, and I squeeze it back, wincing as Carissa tackles a particularly stubborn knot in my neck. Mmm. Ben and me and a canopied bed on the beach, which we\u2019ll have to ourselves for two hours afterward. The therapists have stressed that several times. \u201cTwo hours,\u201d Angelina kept saying. \u201cPlenty of private time. You will be relaxed as a couple.... All the senses will be stimulated.... No one will disturb you, this is guaranteed....\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t quite wink, but she might as well have. Obviously this is the open-air shagging service, which they\u2019re too coy to spell out in the brochure.</p><p>Carissa has finished with my neck. She and Angelina move to the head end of the bed and in synchronization begin a head massage. I\u2019m relaxing more and more\u2014in fact, I\u2019d probably fall asleep if it weren\u2019t that I\u2019m also absolutely hopping with lust. Just the sight of Ben slick with oil and naked beside me was enough. We are going to use every minute of that two hours, I vow. We have earned this sex. He\u2019ll only have to touch me and I\u2019ll explode\u2014</p><p>Ting!</p><p>I\u2019m jolted out of my reverie. From nowhere, Angelina and Carissa have produced matching little bells, which they\u2019ve struck above our heads in a kind of ritual.</p><p>\u201cFinish,\u201d whispers Carissa, and tucks my sheet around me. \u201cNow relax. Take it easy.\u201d</p><p>Yes! It\u2019s over! Sexy private time, here we come. I watch through semi-closed eyes as Angelina and Carissa withdraw from our curtained enclosure. There\u2019s no sound at all except for the cotton curtains, flapping gently in the breeze. I stare up at the blue, unable to speak, I\u2019m so overcome by torpor and lust. I think this is the most blissful state I\u2019ve ever been in. Post-massage; pre-sex.</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ben\u2019s hand squeezes mine again. \u201cAt last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last.\u201d I\u2019m about to lean over and kiss him, but he\u2019s too fast. Before I know it, he\u2019s straddling me, holding a small bottle of oil. He must have brought it along secretly. He thinks of everything!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like anyone massaging you but me.\u201d He pours oil onto my shoulders. It smells musky and sensual and gorgeous. I inhale pleasurably as he covers me all over with it, using firm, sweeping gestures which make me shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re very talented, Mr. Parr,\u201d I say, my voice jerky with lust. \u201cYou could set up a spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want only one client.\u201d He starts to rub the oil into my nipples, over my stomach, lower down.... At once I\u2019m whimpering with desire. I have so, so wanted him....</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d His eyes are intent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tingling all over. It\u2019s unbearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He leans in to kiss me, his hands moving down with purpose, between my thighs....</p> <p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I\u2019m breathless. \u201cI really am tingling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I can\u2019t help wincing.</p><p>\u201cI know you like it a bit rough.\u201d He chuckles, but I\u2019m not sure I can join in. I\u2019m tingling too much. Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop a moment?\u201d I push him away. My skin feels like it\u2019s crawling with insects. \u201cI\u2019m a little sore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSore?\u201d His eyes glint with amusement. \u201cBabe, we haven\u2019t even started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny! It\u2019s painful!\u201d I stare agitatedly at my arm. It\u2019s turned red. Why is it red? Ben moves in on me again, and I try my hardest to moan with appreciation as his lips nuzzle their way down my neck. But, truthfully, they\u2019re moans of pain.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I say at last, in desperation. \u201cTime out! I feel like I\u2019m on fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d pants Ben.</p> <p>\u201cReally! I can\u2019t do this! Look at me!\u201d</p><p>At last Ben moves back and surveys me, his eyes cloudy with desire. \u201cYou look great,\u201d he says briefly. \u201cYou look awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! I\u2019m all red.\u201d I survey my arms with mounting alarm. \u201cAnd I\u2019m swelling up! Look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are swelling up, all right.\u201d Ben cups one of my breasts appreciatively. Isn\u2019t he listening?</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I wrench his arm away. \u201cThis is serious. I think I\u2019ve had an allergic reaction. What\u2019s in that oil? Not peanut oil? You know I\u2019m allergic to peanuts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just oil.\u201d Ben seems evasive. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must! You must have looked at the label when you bought it.\u201d There\u2019s a short silence. Ben looks a bit sulky, as though I\u2019ve caught him out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d he says at last. \u201cNico gave it to me, compliments of the hotel. It\u2019s their signature blend or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling disappointed. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t check? Even though you know I\u2019m allergic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten, OK?\u201d Ben sounds thrown. \u201cI can\u2019t remember every tiny little thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think your wife\u2019s allergy is \u2018every tiny little thing\u2019!\u201d I say furiously, feeling an uncharacteristic urge to hit him. It was all going so brilliantly. Why did he have to slather me with evil peanut oil?</p> <p>\u201cLook, maybe if we get the right angle it won\u2019t hurt you so much.\u201d Ben looks around desperately and pushes aside the curtains. \u201cTry standing on those rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I\u2019m as eager as he is to make this work. If we minimize actual contact ... I clamber onto the rocks, trying not to flinch too much. \u201cOw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch! Stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the other way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could rotate a bit ... Oof!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that your nostril?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d I say, after slipping off the rocks for the third time. \u201cI could try kneeling on the rocks if we had some padding....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr on the edge of the bed ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go on top.... No! Ow! Sorry,\u201d I wince, \u201cbut that\u2019s really painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you put your leg behind your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d I say resentfully. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere has totally disintegrated, as we try one acrobatic position after another. I keep gasping, and not in a good way. By now my skin is seriously inflamed. I need some soothing aqueous cream, urgently. But I also need to have sex. It\u2019s unbearable. I want to weep with frustration.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I say to myself crossly. \u201cI\u2019ve had root-canal surgery. I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoot-canal surgery?\u201d Ben sounds mortally offended. \u201cSex with me is like root-canal surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding sex with me all holiday,\u201d he snarls, suddenly losing his temper. \u201cI mean, what kind of a bloody honeymoon is this?\u201d</p><p>This is such an unfair accusation that I recoil with shock.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t avoided sex!\u201d I cry. \u201cI want it as much as you do, but I ... It\u2019s so painful....\u201d I cast around desperately. \u201cCould we try tantric sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTantric sex?\u201d Ben sounds contemptuous.</p><p>\u201cWell, it works for Sting.\u201d I feel near tears of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cIs your mouth sore?\u201d says Ben, a note of hope in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I got oil on my lips. They\u2019re really smarting.\u201d I catch his drift. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Ben unhooks his leg from mine and slumps onto the bed, his shoulders hunched. Despite everything, I can\u2019t help feeling relieved that he\u2019s not chafing against me anymore. It was sheer torture.</p><p>For a while we just sit there in stony misery. My flesh is still swollen and vivid red. I must look like an overgrown glac\u00e9 cherry. A tear rolls down my cheek, then another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hasn\u2019t even asked me if my allergy is dangerous.

We\u2019re going back to the guest house tomorrow. We\u2019re returning to the place we first got it together. Maybe that\u2019s where we\u2019re meant to consummate our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be pretty romantic.\u201d This idea is growing on me. \u201cWe could find the same spot in that little cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always remember that night,\u201d I say in heartfelt tones. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my all-time great memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we can top it,\u201d says Ben, his good humor restored. \u201cHow long will you be out of action?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I glance down at my lobster skin. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty bad reaction. Probably till tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. So we press pause. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I say gratefully. \u201cWe are hereby pressing pause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tomorrow will be play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then rewind and play again.\u201d I grin wickedly at him. \u201cAnd again. And again.\u201d</p><p>I can tell, we\u2019re both cheered by this plan. We sit gazing out to sea, and I feel myself gradually soothed by the repetitive noise of the surf, punctuated by the cry of birds and, far away, the throb of music coming from the main beach. A band is playing there tonight. Maybe we\u2019ll wander over in a while, drink a cocktail, and have a listen.</p><p>It feels as if we\u2019ve made our peace. As we\u2019re sitting there, Ben carefully extends his arm behind me, then bends it round as though to cradle my back, without actually touching. It\u2019s like a ghost embrace. My skin prickles mildly in response, but I don\u2019t mind. All my resentment has faded away; in fact, I can\u2019t think why it was there at all.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cNo peanut oil. No butlers. No harps. Just us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust us.\u201d I nod. Maybe Ben\u2019s right: maybe we were supposed to do it at the guest house all along. \u201cI love you,\u201d I add impulsively. \u201cEven more because of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d He gives me that lopsided smile and my heart swells. And suddenly I feel almost euphoric, despite my stinging skin and frustrated libido and a cricked ankle from climbing on the rocks. Because, after all, here we are, back on Ikonos, after all these years. And tomorrow we come full circle. Tomorrow we return to the most important place of our lives: the guest house. The place where we found love and experienced seismic events and changed our destinies forever.</p><p>Ben holds out his hand as though to take mine, and I curl my fingers underneath without quite touching (my hands are swollen too). I don\u2019t need to tell him how important this visit to the guest house is to me. He understands. He gets it like no one else does. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re meant to be together.</p><p>18</p><p>FLISS</p><p>No. Nooo! What is this drivel?</p><p>Ben understands me at a profound level. He thinks it\u2019s Destiny and I do too. We\u2019ve made so many plans for our future. He wants to do all the same things that I do. We\u2019ll probably end up living in France in a g\u00eete....</p><p>I click briskly through the next three texts with mounting dismay.</p><p>... amazing atmosphere with white curtains next to the sea, and, OK, it didn\u2019t work out, but that\u2019s not important ...</p><p>...

Marvelous.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d says Lorcan, observing my expression.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s dandy,\u201d I almost snarl back, and flip viciously through the leather-bound cocktail menu.</p><p>My spirits have not exactly been high since the touchdown in Sofia. Now they\u2019re plummeting to rock bottom. Everything has backfired and I\u2019m bone weary and my minibar was lacking tonic water and now I\u2019m surrounded by Bulgarian prostitutes.</p> <p>OK, they may not all be Bulgarian prostitutes, I allow, as I do another sweep of the hotel rooftop bar. Some may be Bulgarian glamour models. Some may even be business types. The light in here is dim, but it\u2019s glinting off all the diamonds and teeth and Louis Vuitton buckles on show. Hardly the most understated place, the City Heights. Although, to their credit, they knew my name and I didn\u2019t even need to ask for an upgrade. I\u2019m in the most bling suite I\u2019ve stayed in for a while, complete with two massive bedrooms, a sitting room with cinema screen, and a vast mirrored art-deco-style bathroom. I may be compelled to show it off to Lorcan later on.</p><p>I feel an anticipatory squeeze inside. Not quite sure where things are with Lorcan and me. Maybe after a few drinks I\u2019ll find out.</p><p>This bar is fairly bling too, with glass floor-to-ceiling windows and a narrow wraparound swimming pool tiled in black, which all the beautiful people/glamour models/business types are regarding with disdain. Unlike Noah, who is hopping up and down, demanding to be allowed in.</p><p>\u201cYour swimsuit is all packed away,\u201d I say for the fifth time.</p><p>\u201cLet him swim in his underpants,\u201d says Lorcan. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d crows Noah, enchanted by this idea. \u201cUnderpants! Underpants!\u201d He\u2019s jumping up and down, totally hyper after the flight. Maybe a swim is a good idea after all.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I relent. \u201cYou can go in in your underpants. But quietly. Don\u2019t splash anyone.\u201d</p><p>Eagerly, Noah starts to strip off, discarding his clothes with abandon.</p><p>\u201cLook after my wallet, please,\u201d he says with grown-up precision, and hands me the airline wallet he was given on the flight. \u201cI want some credit cards to go in it,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not quite old enough for credit cards,\u201d I say, folding up his trousers and putting them neatly on a velvet-upholstered banquette.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s one,\u201d says Lorcan, and hands him a Starbucks card. \u201cExpired,\u201d he adds to me.</p> <p>\u201cCool!\u201d says Noah in delight, and carefully slots it into his wallet. \u201cI want it to be full like Daddy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to make a barbed comment about Daddy\u2019s bulging wallet\u2014but rein myself back just in time. That would be bitter. And I\u2019m not doing bitter. I\u2019m doing sweetness and light.</p><p>\u201cDaddy works hard for his money,\u201d I say in sugary tones. \u201cWe should be proud of him, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeronimo!\u201d Noah is running up to the pool. A moment later he lands in a bomb with the most almighty splash. Water showers onto a nearby blonde in a minidress, who recoils in horror and brushes the drops off her legs.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d I call over cheerfully. \u201cOccupational hazard of drinking next to a swimming pool!\u201d</p><p>Noah has begun his extremely splashy version of the front crawl and is drawing looks of consternation from beautiful people and beautiful waitstaff alike.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the betting that Noah is the first person ever to swim in this pool?\u201d says Lorcan in amusement.</p><p>As we\u2019re watching, Richard enters the bar, along with a group of travelers I recognize from the plane. He looks wearier than he did earlier on, and I feel a twinge of sympathy for him.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d he greets us, and sinks onto the banquette. \u201cHeard from Lottie again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and the good news is they still haven\u2019t got it together!\u201d I say, to cheer him up.</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d Lorcan sets down his glass with an incredulous crash. \u201cWhat is wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllergic mishap.\u201d I shrug carelessly. \u201cThey used peanut oil or something on Lottie and she swelled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut oil?\u201d Richard looks up suddenly, concerned. \u201cWell, is she OK? Did they call a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause those reactions can be dangerous. Why did they use peanut oil, for God\u2019s sake? Didn\u2019t she warn them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t know,\u201d I say evasively. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I add, to change the subject, and nod at the piece of paper Richard is holding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d says Richard protectively, as Noah bounds up, wrapped in a chic black towel. \u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ...

On the front it reads Delectable Bulgarian Specialties, and inside are lists of bar snacks and light meals.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Have something to eat,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>Richard gives the menu a cursory glance, then flags down a waitress, who approaches with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSir? Can I help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have some questions about your \u2018delectable Bulgarian specialties,\u2019 \u201d he says with an uncompromising stare. \u201cThe tricolore salad.

Which area of Bulgaria do they come from?\u201d</p> <p>The girl has stopped writing now and is gazing at him, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I hiss at Richard, then smile up at the girl. \u201cThanks so much. We\u2019ll need a couple more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just asking,\u201d says Richard, as she walks away. \u201cClarifying. I\u2019m allowed to clarify, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you can\u2019t write French love poetry, there\u2019s no need to take it out on an innocent waitress,\u201d I say sternly. \u201cAnyway, look.

That\u2019s a Bulgarian specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Greek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bulgarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you know all about it.\u201d He looks at the menu broodingly, then closes it. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll turn in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get room service.

My body is flooding with adrenaline. I\u2019m fingering my memory stick nervously. I have speeches lined up in my head. Long, erudite, scathing speeches. Also: I want to punch someone.</p><p>\u201cOnly, some of my friends have had fairly torrid times with custody battles,\u201d Lorcan adds.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I\u2019m trying to achieve composure. \u201cRight.

My ability to lie is unnerving even to myself. Essentially, I\u2019m saying the diametric opposite of the truth.

But even as I\u2019m composing them\u2014We all play table tennis together! Daniel\u2019s naming his new baby after me!\u2014my head is buzzing. My fingers are fiddling at the memory stick with more and more agitation. I don\u2019t like this game anymore. My inner good fairy is losing her glow. The bad fairy is barging in and wants to have a say.</p><p>\u201cSo, your husband must be a great guy,\u201d says Lorcan, after he\u2019s given our order. \u201cFor you two to have such a special relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a star!\u201d I nod, my teeth gritted.</p><p>\u201cMust be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just so thoughtful and kind!\u201d I\u2019m clenching my fists by my sides. \u201cHe\u2019s such a charismatic, charming, unselfish, caring\u2014\u201d I break off. I\u2019m panting. There are actual stars in front of my eyes. Complimenting Daniel is bad for my health; I can\u2019t do it anymore. \u201cHe\u2019s a ... a ... a ...\u201d It\u2019s like a sneeze. It has to come out. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a slight pause. I can see some men at a nearby table looking over with interest.</p><p>\u201cA bastard in a good way?\u201d hazards Lorcan. \u201cOr ... oh.\u201d He sees my face.</p> <p>\u201cI lied. Daniel is the biggest nightmare that any divorced wife has had to put up with, and I\u2019m bitter, OK? I\u2019m bitter!\u201d Just saying it is a relief. \u201cMy bones are bitter, my heart\u2019s bitter, my blood is bitter....\u201d Something occurs to me. \u201cWait. You\u2019ve had sex with me. You know I\u2019m bitter.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way he couldn\u2019t have picked that up from our night together. I was fairly tense.

Bad-taste joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apology needed.\u201d Lorcan doesn\u2019t even blink. \u201cThe only way to survive a divorce is to tell bad-taste jokes. What do you do if you miss your ex-wife? Take better aim next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is divorce so expensive?\u201d I automatically counter. \u201cBecause it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do divorced men get married again? Bad memory.\u201d</p><p>He waits for me to laugh, but I\u2019m lost in thought. My adrenaline tidal wave has ebbed away, leaving behind the detritus of old familiar thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is ...\u201d I rub my nose hard. \u201cThe thing is, I haven\u2019t survived my divorce. Wouldn\u2019t \u2018survival\u2019 imply I\u2019m the same person I was before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who are you now?\u201d says Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say after a long pause. \u201cI feel scalded inside. Like, third-degree burns. But no one can see them.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan winces but doesn\u2019t reply. He\u2019s one of those rare people who can wait it out and listen.</p><p>\u201cI started to wonder if I was going mad,\u201d I say, staring into my glass. \u201cCould Daniel really see the world that way? Could he really be saying those awful things and could people be believing him? And the worst thing is, no one else is in it with you. A divorce is like a controlled explosion.

They might inadvertently hurt him.</p><p>At last I retreat to the safe, once-removed territory of Lottie and Ben.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is ...\u201d I exhale. \u201cI just want to save my sister from the same kind of hurt that we\u2019ve both experienced. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I make a small point?\u201d says Lorcan. His mouth twitches with humor, and I can tell he wants to lighten the mood. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even met Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d I retort. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t realize is there\u2019s a history to this. Every time Lottie breaks up with someone, she makes some stupid, rash, insane gesture that she then has to undo. I call them her Unfortunate Choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Unfortunate Choices.\u2019 I like it.\u201d Lorcan raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo you think Ben is her Unfortunate Choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you? I mean, really. Getting hitched after five minutes, planning to live in a g\u00eete\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA g\u00eete?\u201d Lorcan looks surprised. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie! She\u2019s full of it. They\u2019re going to have goats and chickens and we all have to visit them and eat baguettes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like Ben at all,\u201d says Lorcan. \u201cChickens? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely! It sounds like some ridiculous pipe dream. And it\u2019ll crumble to bits and she\u2019ll end up divorced and bitter and just like me\u2014\u201d Too late, I realize I\u2019m almost shouting. The men at the next table are looking at me again. \u201cJust like me,\u201d I repeat more quietly. \u201cAnd that would be a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do yourself a disservice,\u201d says Lorcan. I think he\u2019s trying to be nice. But I\u2019m really not in the mood for flattery.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d I lean forward. \u201cWould you wish the sheer hell of divorce on someone you cared about? Or would you try to prevent it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to arrive out of the blue, tell her to get an annulment and marry Richard. You think she\u2019ll listen?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I happen to think Richard\u2019s great and perfect for Lottie, but I\u2019m not going out there under the banner of Team Richard. Richard will have to be his own team. I\u2019m on Team Don\u2019t Mess Your Life Up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProvidential for you that they\u2019ve had such a nightmare of a honeymoon,\u201d says Lorcan, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>There\u2019s a brief, charged pause in which I wonder whether to tell him about my secret operation\u2014then decide against it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say as nonchalantly as I can. \u201cLucky.\u201d</p><p>Noah comes pattering up again, his feet leaving wet marks in the deep-gray carpet. He snuggles onto my knee and at once I feel myself lighten. Noah carries hope round with him like an aura, and whenever I touch him a little bit of it filters into me.</p> <p>\u201cHere!\u201d Suddenly he\u2019s waving at someone. \u201cThis table!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d A waitress appears, bearing a silver tray on which is an ice-cream sundae. \u201cFor the brave little soldier. You must be so proud,\u201d she adds to me.</p><p>Oh God. Not again. I smile back, my expression carefully vague, trying to hide my embarrassment. I have no idea where we\u2019re heading with this. It could be heart transplant. It could be bone marrow. It could be new puppy.</p><p>\u201cTraining for three hours a day!\u201d She squeezes Noah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI admire your dedication! Your son was telling me about his gymnastics,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cThinking of the Olympics 2024, are you?\u201d</p><p>My smile freezes. His gymnastics? OK, I can\u2019t put this off any longer. I\u2019m having the Talk, right here, right now.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I manage. \u201cWonderful. Thank you so much.\u201d As soon as the waitress has disappeared, I turn to Noah. \u201cDarling. Listen to me. This is important. You know the difference between truth and lies, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Noah nods confidently.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that we mustn\u2019t tell lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept to be polite,\u201d chimes in Noah. \u201cLike, \u2018I do like your dress!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>This comes from another Big Talk we had, about two months ago, after Noah was disastrously honest about his godmother\u2019s cooking.</p><p>\u201cYes. But generally speaking\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd \u2018What delicious apple pie!\u2019 \u201d Noah warms to his theme. \u201cAnd \u2018I\u2019d love some more, but I\u2019m just too full!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! OK. But the point is, most of the time we have to be truthful. And not\u2014for example\u2014say that we\u2019ve had a heart transplant when we haven\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m watching Noah closely for a reaction, but he seems unmoved. \u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t had a heart transplant, have you?\u201d I say gently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agrees.</p><p>\u201cBut you told the airline staff that you\u2019d had one. Why?\u201d</p><p>Noah thinks for a bit. \u201cBecause it\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well. Let\u2019s be interesting and truthful, OK? From now on, I want you to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Noah shrugs as though it\u2019s neither here nor there. \u201cCan I start my sundae now?\u201d He picks up his spoon and digs in, sending chocolate flakes everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNicely done,\u201d says Lorcan quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Why does he say this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig imagination.\u201d Lorcan shrugs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry. You\u2019re a good mother,\u201d he adds, so matter-of-factly that I wonder if I misheard.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I don\u2019t quite know how to react. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re like a mother to Lottie too, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d He\u2019s pretty perceptive, this Lorcan.</p><p>I nod. \u201cOur own mother didn\u2019t do a great job. I\u2019ve always had to watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you get it?\u201d I look up, suddenly wanting to hear his true opinion. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d I spread my arms wide. \u201cThis. Trying to save my sister from the biggest mistake of her life. Am I right, or am I insane?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan is silent for a while. \u201cI think you\u2019re very loyal and very protective and I respect you for that. And, yes, you\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I shove him.</p><p>\u201cYou asked.\u201d He shoves me back and I feel a tiny electric dart, coupled with a flashback to our night together. It\u2019s so graphic that I gasp. Looking at the way Lorcan\u2019s mouth is tightening, I think he\u2019s remembering exactly the same bit.</p><p>My skin has started to prickle in a mixture of memory and anticipation. Here we are: the two of us, in a hotel. No-brainer. The thing about great sex is, it\u2019s a gift from God which should be enjoyed to the max. That\u2019s my theory, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have a big suite?\u201d Lorcan asks, as though reading my mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo bedrooms,\u201d I reply carelessly. \u201cOne for me, one for Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyes are locked onto mine with a promise of more, and I feel an involuntary shiver. Not that we can run upstairs and rip our clothes off straightaway. There is the small matter of my seven-year-old son sitting next to me.</p> <p>\u201cShall we ... eat?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Noah, finishing his ice-cream sundae, tunes in to the conversation with precision accuracy. \u201cI want a burger and chips!\u201d</p><p>An hour later, between the three of us, we\u2019ve eaten one club sandwich, one burger, one bowl of normal fries, one bowl of sweet-potato fries, one platter of shrimp tempura, three chocolate brownies, and a basketful of bread. Beside me, Noah is half asleep on the banquette seat. He\u2019s had a riotous time, darting around the bar, making friends with all the Bulgarian prostitutes, scoring Cokes and packets of crisps and even some Bulgarian money, which, to his dismay, I made him give straight back.</p><p>Now a six-piece band is playing and everyone is listening, and the lights are even dimmer than before, and I\u2019m feeling fairly blissful. I\u2019ve mellowed after my three glasses of wine. Lorcan\u2019s hand keeps brushing against mine. We have an entire empty, delicious night ahead of us. I reach over to take the last sweet-potato chip from the bowl and glimpse Noah\u2019s precious airline wallet on the seat next to him. It\u2019s stuffed with what look like credit cards. Where on earth did he get those?</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d I nudge him awake. \u201cSweetheart, what have you got in your wallet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCredit cards,\u201d he says sleepily. \u201cI found them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found credit cards?\u201d My blood freezes. Oh God. Has he stolen someone\u2019s credit cards? I grab the wallet and pull out the cards in consternation. But they\u2019re not credit cards after all. They\u2019re\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoom keys!\u201d says Lorcan, as I pull out about seven at once. The entire wallet is stuffed with electronic room keys. He must have about twenty of them.</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d I shake him awake again. \u201cDarling, where did you get these from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I found them,\u201d he says resentfully. \u201cPeople put them down on tables and things. I wanted some credit cards for my wallet....\u201d His eyes are already closing again.</p><p>I look up at Lorcan, my hands full of room keys splayed out like playing cards.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I do? I\u2019ll have to give them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all look the same,\u201d observes Lorcan, and gives a snort of laughter. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! It\u2019s not funny! There\u2019ll be a riot when everyone finds out they\u2019re locked out of their rooms....\u201d I look again at the electronic cards and suddenly snuffle with laughter myself.</p><p>\u201cJust put them back,\u201d says Lorcan decisively.</p><p>\u201cBut where?\u201d I look around the tables of smartly dressed beautiful people, all enjoying the band, oblivious to my agitation. \u201cI don\u2019t know whose key is whose, and I can\u2019t find out without going to the front desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the plan,\u201d says Lorcan decisively. \u201cWe\u2019ll scatter them around the room like Easter eggs. Everyone\u2019s watching the band. No one\u2019ll notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how will we know whose key is whose? They\u2019re identical!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll guess. We\u2019ll use our psychic powers. I\u2019ll take half,\u201d he adds, and starts grabbing key cards out of the wallet.</p> <p>Slowly, cautiously, we get to our feet. The lights are dim and the band is playing a Coldplay song, and no one turns a hair. Lorcan walks authoritatively toward the bar, leans slightly to his left, and deposits a key card on a bar table.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I hear him say charmingly. \u201cLost my balance.\u201d</p><p>Following his lead, I approach another group, pretend to look at a light fitting, and drop three cards down onto the mirrored surface of the table. The sound of them landing is covered by the band, and no one even notices.</p><p>Lorcan is planting cards on the main long bar, moving along quickly, deftly reaching between bar stools and behind backs.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped this, I think?\u201d he says, as a girl turns a questioning face to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d She takes the card from him, and my insides curdle. I am half appalled and half delighted at what feels like the most massive prank. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the key to her room. There are going to be some very angry guests later on....</p><p>Now Lorcan is up near the stage, leaning right over a blond lady and blatantly flipping a key card onto her table. He meets my eye and winks at me, and I want to laugh. I get rid of my remaining cards as quickly as I can and hurry back to Noah, who is now fully asleep. I summon a waiter and quickly scribble a signature on our bill, then hoist Noah into my arms and wait for Lorcan to join us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m found out, my name will be mud,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cIn Bulgaria,\u201d points out Lorcan. \u201cPopulation 7.5 million. That\u2019s like your name being mud in Bogot\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want my name to be mud in Bogot\u00e1 either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Maybe it is already. Have you been to Bogot\u00e1?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, as it happens,\u201d I inform him. \u201cAnd I can tell you, my name is not mud there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were being polite.\u201d</p><p>This conversation is so ridiculous, I can\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. Let\u2019s escape before we get attacked by angry key holders.\u201d</p><p>As we walk out of the bar, Lorcan holds out his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry Noah if you like. He looks heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I smile automatically. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... OK.\u201d</p><p>It feels odd, handing over Noah to Lorcan. But the truth is, I do have a dodgy shoulder and it is a bit of a relief. We reach our suite and Lorcan carries Noah straight to his bed. He\u2019s so sound asleep, he doesn\u2019t stir. I remove his shoes but nothing else. He can clean his teeth and put his pajamas on tomorrow night, if he wants to.</p><p>I turn off Noah\u2019s light and head to the door, and for a moment Lorcan and I stand there together, for all the world like two parents.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Lorcan at last, and a luscious anticipation starts to grow within me again. I can feel an internal limbering-up, that little dance of muscles yearning to be used. I\u2019m doing better than Lottie on the shag front flashes through my mind, giving me a pinch of guilt\u2014but only a small one. It\u2019s all for the best. She can have another honeymoon, another time.</p><p>\u201cDrink?\u201d I say, not because I really want one but to prolong the moment. This suite is the perfect setting for a shag-fest, what with all the smoky, sexy mirrors and soft, sensual rugs and the (fake) open fire flickering in the grate. There are also several conveniently placed pieces of furniture, which I\u2019ve already eyed up.</p><p>When I\u2019ve poured Lorcan a whiskey, I sit down with my own glass of wine on an amazing creation of a chair. It\u2019s made of deep-purple velvet, with wide rolltop arms and a deep seat and an erotic swoop to its back. I\u2019m hoping that I strike quite a figure as I lean provocatively on one of the arms and allow my dress to ruck up. There\u2019s a delectable, urgent pulsing deep inside me. But, still, I\u2019m not going to hurry anything. We can talk first. (Or just stare at each other with desperate want. Also good.)</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Ben and Lottie are up to.\u201d Lorcan breaks the silence. \u201cPresumably not ...\u201d He shrugs significantly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor guys. Whatever you think, it\u2019s the worst luck for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say noncommittally, and sip my wine.</p><p>\u201cI mean, no sex on your honeymoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTerrible.\u201d I nod. \u201cPoor them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019d waited, hadn\u2019t they?\u201d His face crinkles in remembrance. \u201cJesus. You\u2019d think they\u2019d shag in the loos and just have done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried, but they got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He looks at me, startled. \u201cYou serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Heathrow. In the business-class lounge.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan throws back his head and roars with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m going to rib Ben about that. So your sister fills you in on everything, does she? Even her sex life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor girl. Foiled even in the Heathrow loos. It\u2019s the worst luck.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer at once. The wine I\u2019m drinking is stronger than the stuff I drank downstairs and it\u2019s going to my head. It\u2019s tipping me over the edge. My head is a bit of a maelstrom. Lorcan keeps talking about \u201cbad luck,\u201d but he\u2019s wrong. Luck has nothing to do with it. Ben and Lottie have not consummated their marriage because of me. Because of my power. And suddenly I feel the urge to share this with him.</p><p>\u201cNot so much luck ...\u201d I let the word trail in the air and, sure enough, Lorcan picks up on it at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not chance that Ben and Lottie haven\u2019t done it yet. It\u2019s design. My design. I\u2019ve been in charge of the whole thing.\u201d I lean back proudly, feeling like the queen of remote-control honeymoon-fixing, all-powerful in my empress\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lorcan looks so taken aback, I feel another twinge of pride.</p><p>\u201cI have an agent helping me on the ground,\u201d I clarify. \u201cI issue commands, he carries them out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?

Also the word \u201csabotaged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was the only way! What else was I supposed to do?\u201d Something about this conversation is going wrong. I don\u2019t like his expression, or mine. I know I appear defensive, which is not a good look. \u201cYou do understand I had to put a stop to it? Once they\u2019ve consummated it, it\u2019ll be too late for an annulment. So I had to do something. And this was the only way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts, woman? Are you out of your mind?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s tone is so forceful, I recoil in shock. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t the only way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was the best way.\u201d I jut my chin out.</p><p>\u201cIt was not the best way.

I had her interests at heart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy having her massaged with peanut oil? What if she\u2019d had an extreme reaction and died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I say uncomfortably. \u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re happy for her to spend a night in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? Jesus.\u201d He rests his head in his hands a moment, then looks up. \u201cAgain, what if she finds out? You\u2019re prepared to lose your relationship with her? Because that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the hotel suite, although words still seem to be bouncing off the smoky mirrors, sharp, accusing words. The erotic atmosphere has disintegrated. I can\u2019t find the phrases to rebut Lorcan. They\u2019re in my brain somewhere, but I\u2019m feeling slow and a little dazed. I thought he would be impressed. I thought he\u2019d understand. I thought\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou talk about Unfortunate Choices?\u201d says Lorcan suddenly. \u201cWell, what the hell is this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I glower at him. He\u2019s not allowed to talk about Unfortunate Choices. They\u2019re my thing.</p><p>\u201cYou suffer a painful divorce, so you rush out and decide to save your sister from the same fate by derailing her honeymoon. Sounds like a pretty fucking Unfortunate Choice to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m almost winded with shock. What? What?</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I manage in fury. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about it. I shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d He stares back implacably. \u201cHers. And you\u2019re making a big mistake interfering with it. One you may live to regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cFinished the sermon?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan just shakes his head. He finishes his whiskey in a couple of gulps, and I know that\u2019s the end. He\u2019s going. He walks over to the door, then pauses. His back is tensed, I can tell. I think he feels as awkward as I do.</p><p>Uncomfortable thoughts are needling me. There\u2019s a painful dragging at the pit of my stomach. It feels a bit like guilt\u2014not that I\u2019d ever admit this to him. But there is something I must say. Something I must make clear.</p><p>\u201cJust in case you were wondering.\u201d I wait till he turns his head. \u201cI care about Lottie a great deal. A great deal.\u201d My voice gives a treacherous wobble. \u201cShe\u2019s not only my little sister, she\u2019s my friend. And I\u2019ve done all this for her.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan stares at me for a moment, his expression unreadable. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re acting for the right reasons,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI know you\u2019ve had a lot of pain in your life that you want to protect Lottie from. But this is wrong. Deeply wrong. And you know it, Fliss. You do, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes have softened. He feels sorry for me, I suddenly realize. Sorry for me. I can\u2019t stand it.</p><p>\u201cWell, good night,\u201d I say shortly.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d He matches my tone and leaves the room without a further word.</p><p>19</p> <p>LOTTIE</p><p>It was meant to be! This is my all-star, gold-plated, total dream scenario. Ben and me on a boat again. Skimming across the Aegean waves. On our way to total bliss.</p><p>Thank God we\u2019ve left the Amba. I know it\u2019s luxurious and has five stars, but it\u2019s not the real Ikonos. It\u2019s not us. The moment we were dropped off for the day at the little bustling port, I felt something buried inside me come alive. This is what I remember of Ikonos. Old white houses with shutters, and shaded streets, and elderly women in black sitting on corners, and the dock for the ferry. The port was full of fishing boats and water taxis, and the overpowering smell of fish made my senses reel. I remember that smell. I remember all of it.</p><p>The sky is a bright morning blue and the sun is dazzling my eyelids, just as it always did. I\u2019m lying back in the water taxi, the way I did when I was eighteen. My feet are in Ben\u2019s lap and he\u2019s idly fiddling with my toes and there\u2019s only one thing on both our minds.</p><p>My skin has recovered perfectly from its allergic reaction, and Ben was keen on a quick shag this morning. But I talked him out of it. How could we consummate our marriage in a boring old hotel bed when instead there\u2019s the chance to do it in the cove where we first did it, all those years ago? The romance of it makes me want to hug myself. Here we are after all these years! Going back to the guest house! Married! I wonder if Arthur will be there. I wonder if he\u2019ll recognize us. I don\u2019t think I look that different. I\u2019m even wearing the same tiny tie-dye shorts I wore when I was eighteen ... and praying desperately they don\u2019t split.</p> <p>Spray splashes my face as we bump across the waves, and I lick the delicious saltiness off my lips. I\u2019m surveying the coastline as we pass and remembering all the little villages we explored back then, with their narrow cobbled alleyways and unexpected treasures, like that half-ruined marble statue of a horse we once came across in the middle of a deserted square. I look up to share this thought with Ben, but he\u2019s engrossed in his iPad. I can hear rap coming from it and feel a flicker of irritation. Does he have to listen to that now?</p><p>\u201cDo you think Arthur\u2019s still there?\u201d I try to attract his attention. \u201cAnd that old cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be, surely.\u201d Ben looks up briefly. \u201cI wonder what happened to Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Sarah again. Do I even know this girl?</p><p>The music seems to be getting louder, and now Ben\u2019s rapping along. He really can\u2019t rap. I mean, I\u2019m being a dispassionate, loving wife here\u2014and he\u2019s crap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely and peaceful out here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say with a meaningful edge to my voice, but he doesn\u2019t take the hint. \u201cCould we maybe not have the music on for a bit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s DJ Cram, babe,\u201d says Ben, and turns the volume up. Fuck yo brudder blares out across the beautiful sea, and I wince.</p><p>He\u2019s a selfish git.</p><p>The thought lands in my brain with no warning and makes me panic slightly. No. I didn\u2019t really mean \u201cselfish.\u201d Or \u201cgit.\u201d It\u2019s all good. All blissful.</p><p>I don\u2019t mind rap music, anyway. And we can talk over the top of it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going back to the place where it all changed,\u201d I say, beginning a new tack. \u201cThat fire was, like, the turning point for my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop going on about that bloody fire?\u201d says Ben irritably, and I stare back in hurt shock.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, I suppose. Ben\u2019s never been interested in the fire. He\u2019d gone sponge-diving on the other side of the island for a couple of days when it happened, so he missed the whole thing and has always been chippy about that. Still, he doesn\u2019t have to be so snappy. He knows how important it was to me.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he suddenly exclaims. He\u2019s peering at his iPad and I can see he\u2019s just got a text. We\u2019re fairly near the coast, so there must be some random patch of signal.</p> <p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>Ben looks as though he\u2019s bursting with pride and excitement. Has he won something? \u201cHeard of someone called Yuri Zhernakov? He only wants a private meeting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuri Zhernakov?\u201d I gape at him. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to buy the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! And do you want to sell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Already my mind is whirring. This would be amazing! Ben would get a lump of cash, we could buy an old farmhouse in France.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYuri wants to talk to me.\u201d Ben seems totally puffed up. \u201cHe asked for me personally.

And Lorcan can\u2014\u201d Ben stops himself. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he says moodily.</p><p>There\u2019s some weird vibe going on which I don\u2019t understand, but I don\u2019t care. We\u2019re going to move to France! And we\u2019re about to have sex, finally! I\u2019ve forgotten my earlier irritation. I\u2019m back to super-bliss. As I happily swig my Coke, I suddenly remember something I\u2019ve been meaning to say to Ben for days.</p> <p>\u201cHey, last year I met these scientists at Nottingham who were researching a new way to make paper. More eco. Something about a special filtering process? Have you heard of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ben shrugs. \u201cBut Lorcan might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should link up with them. Do some funding or whatever. Although I suppose if you\u2019re selling the company ...\u201d I shrug too.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Ben nudges me. \u201cDo you have lots of good ideas like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions.\u201d I grin back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Lorcan right now.\u201d Ben starts typing at his iPad. \u201cHe\u2019s always going on about research and development. He thinks I\u2019m not interested. Well, bollocks to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him about the Zhernakov meeting too,\u201d I suggest. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll have some good advice.\u201d Immediately, Ben\u2019s fingers freeze and his face closes up.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d he says at last, and shoots me a warning look. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not saying a word to anyone either. Not a word.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>FLISS</p><p>The morning after is always hell.</p> <p>In Sofia, Bulgaria, after too many glasses of wine, an excruciating argument, and a night of sexual frustration, the morning after achieves fresh levels of hellishness.</p><p>From Lorcan\u2019s expression, he feels the same way. Noah ran joyfully to greet him as soon as we entered the dining room, which is why I\u2019m sitting with him, not through choice. He\u2019s savagely buttering a piece of toast, and I\u2019m crumbling a croissant. From our desultory conversation we\u2019ve established that we both slept terribly, that the coffee is abysmal, that there are 2.4 Bulgarian leva to the pound and that the flight to Ikonos today hasn\u2019t been delayed, as far as we can glean from the airline website.</p><p>Areas we haven\u2019t touched on: Ben, Lottie, their marriage, their sexual conduct, Bulgarian politics, the state of the world economy, my attempts to sabotage my sister\u2019s honeymoon and thus risk losing my relationship with her forever. Among others.</p><p>The restaurant is adjacent to the bar we were in last night, and I can see a pool attendant dabbing at the pristine water with a filtering net. I\u2019ve no idea why they bother. I expect Noah is the only person to have swum in that pool all year. Although, to be fair, he might well have peed in it.</p><p>\u201cCan I swim?\u201d he says, as though reading my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re getting on the airplane soon.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan has his BlackBerry to his ear again. He\u2019s been speed-dialing all through breakfast but never getting through. I think I can guess who he\u2019s been calling, and this is confirmed when he says, \u201cBen, at last,\u201d and pushes his chair back. I watch in slight resentment as he walks right away, to the side of the pool, and perches in front of the sauna entrance. How am I supposed to eavesdrop now?</p><p>I try to ignore my tension by slicing up an apple for Noah. When Lorcan returns, I force myself not to grip his lapels and demand information. Instead, I ask, with only moderate urgency:</p> <p>\u201cWell? Have they done it?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan gives me a disbelieving look. \u201cIs that all you\u2019re interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say defiantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, they haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve just arrived at the guest house. I guess they\u2019re planning to do it there.\u201d</p><p>The guest house? I stare at him in horror. I can\u2019t get at them there. There\u2019s no Nico. It\u2019s out of my power zone. Shit. Shit. I\u2019m going to be just too late\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour sister is quite something,\u201d Lorcan continues with animation. \u201cShe\u2019s come up with a great idea for the company. We\u2019re far too weak on the research-and-development side, and I\u2019ve known it for a while. But she\u2019s suggested we tie up with a research project in Nottingham she knows about. It\u2019s a tiny team, which is why I hadn\u2019t heard of it, but it sounds as if it\u2019s directly relevant to us. We could get some joint funding going. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, still preoccupied. \u201cShe\u2019d know about that.

It\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p> <p>Lorcan stares at me silently for a moment, and I feel the briefest of shivers under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou really take the biscuit,\u201d he says at last. \u201cHow do you know you\u2019re not ruining your sister\u2019s great love? How do you know this isn\u2019t her chance for a fantastically happy life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d I shake my head impatiently. I\u2019m not even going to answer that question, it\u2019s so stupid.</p><p>\u201cI think Ben and Lottie have every chance of being happy,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cAnd I, for one, am going to encourage them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t switch sides!\u201d I glare at him in fury.</p><p>\u201cI was never on your side,\u201d retorts Lorcan. \u201cYour side is the nutty side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe nutty side.\u201d Noah picks up on this and decides it\u2019s hilarious. \u201cThe nutty side!\u201d He falls about in laughter. \u201cMummy\u2019s on the nutty side!\u201d</p><p>I glare at Lorcan, stirring my coffee viciously. Traitor.</p><p>\u201cMorning, everyone.\u201d</p><p>I look up to see Richard approaching the table. He looks about as cheery as the rest of us, i.e., suicidal.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerribly.\u201d He scowls and pours himself some coffee, then glances at my phone. \u201cSo, have they done it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake!\u201d I take out some of my resentment on him. \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk,\u201d mutters Lorcan.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you keep asking if they\u2019ve done it?\u201d says Noah alertly.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you obsessed too?\u201d counters Richard.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not obsessed. And, no, they haven\u2019t done it.\u201d I put him out of his misery.</p><p>\u201cDone what?\u201d asks Noah.</p><p>\u201cPut the sausage in the cupcake,\u201d says Lorcan, draining his coffee.</p><p>\u201cLorcan!\u201d I snap. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that!\u201d</p><p>Noah has exploded with laughter. \u201cPut the sausage in the cupcake!\u201d he crows. \u201cThe sausage in the cupcake!\u201d</p><p>Great.

I\u2019ve worked it out exactly.\u201d He takes a piece of toast from the rack. \u201cSix hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I put a hand on his. \u201cBut you should know.

It\u2019s in Daniel\u2019s writing.</p><p>NEW ADDRESS</p> <p>Daniel Phipps and Trudy Vanderveer</p><p>5406 Aubrey Road</p><p>Beverly Hills</p><p>CA 90210</p><p>I blink several times in bewilderment. Beverly Hills? What? I mean\u2014 What?</p><p>\u201cJust wait there a minute, Noah,\u201d I say, in a voice which doesn\u2019t sound like mine. I\u2019m already speed-dialing Daniel and pushing back my chair.</p><p>\u201cFliss,\u201d he replies in his infuriating I\u2019ve just been doing yoga, how about you? voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about Beverly Hills?\u201d My words are falling over one another. \u201cYou\u2019re moving to Beverly Hills?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBabe, calm down,\u201d he says.</p><p>Babe?</p><p>\u201cHow can I calm down? Is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Noah told you.\u201d</p><p>My heart falls like a clanging thing. It\u2019s true. He\u2019s moving to L.A. and he didn\u2019t even tell me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Trudy\u2019s work,\u201d he\u2019s saying now. \u201cYou know she\u2019s in media law? This great opportunity arose for her, and I have dual nationality anyway....\u201d</p><p>His words carry on, but they fade to meaningless sounds. For some reason I\u2019m remembering our wedding day. We had a very cool wedding. All ironic twists and fun details like custom-made cocktails. I was so concerned with making sure my guests would have a good time that I forgot to check the small detail of whether I was marrying the right man.</p><p>\u201c... fabulous realtor, and she came up with this place under budget\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Daniel.\u201d I cut him off in midstream. \u201cWhat about Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d He sounds surprised. \u201cNoah can come out and visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seven. He\u2019s at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the holidays, then.\u201d Daniel sounds unconcerned. \u201cWe\u2019ll make something work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>Monday?</p><p>I close my eyes, breathing hard. The hurt I\u2019m feeling on Noah\u2019s behalf is indescribable. It\u2019s physical pain that makes me want to curl into a ball. Daniel\u2019s moving to L.A. with barely a thought of how he\u2019ll maintain a relationship with his only child, our son. Our precious, charming, imaginative son. He\u2019s putting five thousand miles between them in the blink of an eyelid.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I try to gather myself. There\u2019s no point saying anything else. \u201cDaniel, I have to go. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>I switch off and swivel round, intending to join the others. But something strange is happening to me. An unfamiliar, scary sensation. Suddenly a sound escapes from my lips. A kind of yelp, like a dog might make.</p><p>\u201cFliss?\u201d Lorcan has got out of his seat. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy?\u201d Noah looks worried.</p><p>The two men make brief eye contact and Richard nods.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Richard says easily to Noah. \u201cLet\u2019s go and buy some chewing gum for the flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChewing gum!\u201d yells Noah ecstatically, and follows Richard off.</p><p>I give another involuntary yelp, and Lorcan takes me by the elbows.</p><p>\u201cFliss ... are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say at once. \u201cI never cry in the daytime. It\u2019s my rule. I never ever cryyy-eee.\u201d The word disintegrates into a third of these strange, high-pitched yelps. Something wet is on my cheek. Is that a tear? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did Daniel say?\u201d says Lorcan gently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s moving to L.A.

I have to stop....\u201d</p><p>I emit a fourth yelp, which sounds a bit more like a sob. It feels as if something is looming up inside me, something unstoppable and violent and loud. The last time I felt like this, I was giving birth.</p><p>\u201cYou need somewhere private,\u201d says Lorcan swiftly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a meltdown. Where shall we go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve checked out of my room,\u201d I mutter, between gasps. \u201cThey should have a crying room. Like a smoking room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d Lorcan grabs my arm and leads me through the tables to the swimming-pool area. \u201cSteam room.\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for a reply but opens the glass door and pushes me inside.</p><p>The atmosphere is so thick, I have to grope for a seat. The air is dense with vapor and there\u2019s a soft, herby scent.</p><p>\u201cCry,\u201d says Lorcan through the misty air. \u201cNo one\u2019s watching. No one can hear, Fliss. Cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d I swallow hard. Everything in me is resisting. The odd yelp still escapes, but I can\u2019t surrender.</p> <p>\u201cThen tell me. Daniel\u2019s moving to L.A.,\u201d he prompts.</p><p>\u201cYes. He won\u2019t see Noah anymore, and he doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d A shudder overcomes me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted him out of your life? That\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I say, momentarily confused. \u201cI do. I think I do. But this is so final. It\u2019s such a rejection of us both.\u201d Something is rising up in me again. Something churning and powerful. I think it could be grief. \u201cIt means it\u2019s over. Our family\u2019s oooover.\u201d And now the churning is threatening to consume me. \u201cOur whole family is ooooover....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Fliss,\u201d says Lorcan quietly, and proffers a shoulder. Immediately, I recoil.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cry on you,\u201d I say, my voice jerky. \u201cLook away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can cry on me.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ve had sex, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sex. This is far more embarrassing.\u201d I gulp. \u201cLook away. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking anywhere,\u201d he says steadily. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say desperately.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you stupid woman.\u201d He holds out his suited arm, pearlescent with steam. And finally, gratefully, I descend on it in a volcano of sobs.</p><p>We\u2019re there for a while\u2014me shuddering and sobbing and coughing, and Lorcan rubbing my back. For some reason I keep remembering Noah\u2019s delivery. It was an emergency C-section and I was terrified, but, all the way through, Daniel was beside me in green scrubs, holding my hand. I never doubted him then. Back then I never doubted anything for a minute. And that makes me want to cry all over again.</p><p>At last I look up and push my hair back off my sweaty face. I can feel that my nose is swollen and my eyes are puffy. I haven\u2019t cried like that since I was about ten, probably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d I begin, but Lorcan holds up a hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo. No apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your suit!\u201d I begin to become aware of exactly what we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re sitting in a steam room, both fully dressed.</p><p>\u201cEvery divorce has casualties,\u201d says Lorcan calmly. \u201cThink of my suit as one of the casualties of yours. Besides which,\u201d he adds, \u201csteam is good for suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least our skin will be clean,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Loads of pluses.\u201d</p><p>A concealed mechanism in the corner is puffing fresh steam into the tiny chamber, and the air is becoming more opaque. I pull up my feet onto the mosaic-tiled bench and hug my knees tight, feeling as though the steam is a protective barrier. It\u2019s intimate in here. But it\u2019s private too.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got married, I knew life wouldn\u2019t be perfect,\u201d I say into the mist. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect a rose garden. And then, when I got divorced, I didn\u2019t expect a rose garden there either. But I hoped I might at least get ... I don\u2019t know. A patio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA patio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. A little terrace. Something small with a few plants to tend. Something with a tiny bit of optimism and love. But what I have is a post-nuclear war zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lorcan gives a little laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have? Not a rose garden?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of alien territory,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cLike a moonscape.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes meet through the murky atmosphere and we don\u2019t need to say any more. We get it.</p><p>The steam is still puffing and wreathing around us. It feels healing. It feels as though it\u2019s lifting troublesome thoughts up away with it, leaving behind a kind of clarity. And the longer I sit there, the clearer things are to me. There\u2019s a growing heaviness in my stomach. Lorcan was right. Not just now, but last night. He was right. This has all been a mistake.</p><p>I have to give this mission up right now. It\u2019s flashing through my brain like a TV headline. Give up. Give up. I can\u2019t carry on. I can\u2019t risk losing Lottie.</p> <p>Yes, I want to protect my little sister from the same pain I had. But it\u2019s her life. I can\u2019t make her choices for her. If she breaks up with Ben, so be it. If she goes through a divorce, so be it. If they\u2019re married for seventy years and have twenty grandchildren, so be it.</p><p>I feel as though a kind of madness has been propelling me down a crazy path. Was it really about Lottie, or was it about Daniel and me? Is Lorcan right? Has this been my own Unfortunate Choice? Oh God, what have I been doing?</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly aware that I muttered those last few words aloud. \u201cSorry,\u201d I add. \u201cI just ... I realized ...\u201d I raise my head, feeling abject.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing your best to help your sister,\u201d says Lorcan, almost kindly. \u201cIn a totally deluded, fuckwit, wrong-headed way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I clap my hand to my mouth. \u201cOh God. What if she found out?\u201d The thought is so horrifying, I feel almost faint. I was so determined to succeed, I never considered the downside. I\u2019ve been an absolute fool.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to,\u201d says Lorcan. \u201cNot if you turn round and go home and never say a word. I won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico won\u2019t tell either. He\u2019s my guy at the hotel.\u201d I\u2019m breathing hard, as though I\u2019ve had a narrow escape. \u201cI think I\u2019m OK. She\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the honeymoon-sabotage campaign is off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs of this moment.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll call Nico. He\u2019ll be relieved.\u201d I look at Lorcan. \u201cI\u2019m never going to interfere in my sister\u2019s life again,\u201d I say with emphasis. \u201cHold me to that. Hold me to my vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d He nods seriously. \u201cAnd what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Get to the airport. Take it from there.\u201d I tug at my sweaty hair, remembering again that I\u2019m sitting in a steam room in my clothes. \u201cI must look a sight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d says Lorcan seriously. \u201cYou can\u2019t get on a plane like that. You\u2019d better go under the cold-drench shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cold-drench shower?\u201d I stare at him disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cCloses up the pores. Invigorates the circulation. Gets rid of snotty tearstains.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s teasing me. I think. Is he?</p><p>\u201cI will if you will,\u201d I challenge him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He shrugs. I feel a rising giggle. We cannot be planning to do this.</p><p>\u201cOK, here goes.\u201d I push the door open and hold it politely for Lorcan. I can see the stares and nudges from hotel guests at the sight of two fully-clothed people emerging from the steam room, one in a business suit.</p><p>\u201cAfter you.\u201d Lorcan gestures politely at the cold-drench shower. \u201cI\u2019ll pull the lever, if you like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on, then.\u201d I start to laugh as I step underneath. A moment later a blast of freezing water descends on me, and I give a tiny scream.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d A piercing voice hails me in delight. \u201cYou had a shower with your clothes on.\u201d Noah is watching from the table with Richard, his face bright with disbelief.</p><p>Lorcan takes his turn and lifts his face up to the drenching shower.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he says to me when it\u2019s finished. \u201cIsn\u2019t that refreshing? Doesn\u2019t life seem better?\u201d He shakes out his wet suit sleeve.</p><p>I pause a moment, wanting to answer him honestly. \u201cYes,\u201d I say at last. \u201cMuch better. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I don\u2019t quite know how to react. Here we are. Back at the guest house. And it\u2019s just as it was. Kind of.</p><p>As soon as we descended from the water taxi, Ben took a call from Lorcan, which really annoyed me. I mean, this is our big, romantic, meaningful moment\u2014and he takes a call. That\u2019s like Humphrey Bogart saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll always have\u2014 Sorry, love, just got to take this.\u201d</p><p>Anyway. Be positive, Lottie. Relish the moment. I\u2019ve been thinking about this place for fifteen years. And here I am. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m standing on the wooden jetty, waiting for waves of nostalgia and enlightenment to engulf me. I\u2019m waiting to cry and maybe think of something poignant to say to Ben. But the weird thing is, I don\u2019t really want to cry. I feel a bit blank.</p><p>I can just glimpse the guest house, far above, from where I\u2019m standing. I can see the familiar dusty ochre stone and a couple of windows. It\u2019s smaller than I remember, and one of the shutters is drooping. My gaze lowers to the cliff. There are the steps cut into the rock, forking halfway down. One set leads to the jetty where we\u2019re standing and the other leads to the main beach. They\u2019ve put in metal barriers, which kind of ruin the look. And a railing across the top of the cliff. And there\u2019s a safety sign. A safety sign? We never had a safety sign. Anyway. Be positive.</p><p>Ben rejoins me, and I take his hand. The beach is round a jutting outcrop of rock, so I can\u2019t see yet if that\u2019s changed. But how can a beach change? A beach is a beach.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do first?\u201d I ask softly. \u201cGuest house? Beach? Or secret cove?\u201d</p> <p>Ben squeezes my hand back. \u201cSecret cove.\u201d</p><p>And now, at last, I start to feel ripples of excitement. The secret cove. The place we first undressed each other, shaking with hot, insatiable, teenage desire. The place where we did it three, four, five times in a day. The idea of revisiting it\u2014in all senses\u2014is so exciting that I shiver.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to hire a boat.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019ll sail me round to the cove like he always used to, my feet up on the side of the boat. And we\u2019ll drag the boat up onto the sand and find that sheltered patch of sand, and ...</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a boat.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice is thick, and I can tell he\u2019s as excited as I am.</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you think they still hire them out at the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden lightness of heart, I take hold of his hand and pull him toward the steps. We\u2019ll go straight to the beach, we\u2019ll get a boat; it\u2019s all going to happen.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I\u2019m leaping up the rocky steps, my heart thumping with excitement. We\u2019re nearly at the fork in the steps. We\u2019ll see that familiar stretch of beautiful golden sand at any moment, waiting for us after all this time\u2014</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>I\u2019m staring down onto the beach in shock. What\u2019s happened to it? Who are all these people?</p> <p>When we were staying at the guest house, the beach seemed a massive, empty space. There were about twenty of us at the guest house, tops, and we used to spread ourselves over the sand so no one was crowded.</p><p>What I\u2019m staring at now looks like an occupation. Or the morning after a festival. There are about seventy people filling the sand in disheveled groups, some still cocooned in sleeping bags. I can see the remains of a fire. There are a couple of tents. Most of them are students, I guess, appraising them. Or eternal students, maybe.</p><p>As we\u2019re standing there uncertainly, a young guy with a goatee comes partway up the steps and greets us in a South African accent.</p><p>\u201cHi. You look lost.\u201d</p><p>I feel lost, I want to retort, but instead I muster a smile. \u201cJust ... looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re visiting,\u201d says Ben easily. \u201cWe came here years ago. It\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The light in the guy\u2019s face changes. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those. From the golden age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe golden age?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we call it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWe get so many people your age coming back, telling us how it used to be before they built the hostel. Most of them spend the whole time whinging about how it\u2019s been ruined. You coming down?\u201d</p><p>As we follow him, I\u2019m prickling a little at his words. \u201cWhinging\u201d is a bit aggressive. And \u201cyour age\u201d? What does that mean? I mean, obviously we\u2019re a little older than he is, but we\u2019re still, broadly speaking, young. I\u2019m still in the same category.</p><p>\u201cWhat hostel?\u201d asks Ben as we arrive on the beach. \u201cDon\u2019t you stay at the guest house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few do.\u201d The guy shrugs. \u201cNot many. It\u2019s a fairly ropy outfit. I think the old guy\u2019s just sold it. No, we\u2019re at the hostel. A few hundred yards behind. It was built maybe ... ten years ago? They had a big advertising campaign. Really worked. This place is so amazing,\u201d he adds as he walks away. \u201cThe sunsets are unbelievable. Take care now.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiles back, but I feel like exploding with fury. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve built a hostel. I feel livid. This was our place. How dare they advertise it?</p><p>And just look at the way they treat it. There\u2019s rubbish everywhere. I can see cans and empty crisp packets and even a couple of used condoms. At the sight of them, my stomach turns. They\u2019ve been having sex all over the place. That\u2019s so gross. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mean, I know we used to have sex on the beach, but that was different.

There\u2019s a tall strapping guy pushing a boat out into the water, and I hurry over the sand to the sea.</p><p>\u201cHi! Excuse me! Hold on a minute.\u201d He turns, his smile white in his tanned face, and I plant a hand on his dinghy.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell me, do they still hire out boats here? Is this a hire boat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nods. \u201cBut you have to get in early. They\u2019re all gone. You could try tomorrow? The list is at the hostel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I pause, then add plaintively, \u201cThe trouble is, we\u2019re here only today. My husband and I. It\u2019s our honeymoon. And we really did want a boat.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silently willing him to be gallant and offer us his boat. But he doesn\u2019t. He just keeps pushing it out into the water and says pleasantly, \u201cThat\u2019s tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, this is very special to us,\u201d I explain, splashing after him. \u201cWe really, really wanted to go sailing. We wanted to visit this tiny secret cove we used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little cove that way?\u201d He gestures round the headland.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say. \u201cDo you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to sail there.\u201d He looks surprised. \u201cYou can get to it via the walkway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe walkway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s farther inland.\u201d He points. \u201cA big wooden walkway. They built it a few years ago. Opened up the whole area.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in horror. They built a walkway to the secret cove? This is desecration. It\u2019s a travesty. I\u2019m going to write a furious letter to ... someone. It was our secret. It was supposed to stay secret. How are we supposed to have sex there now?</p><p>\u201cEveryone goes there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s quite popular.\u201d He grins. \u201cBetween you and me, it\u2019s where people go to skin up.\u201d</p><p>Skin up? I stare at him in even greater horror. Our perfect, romantic, idyllic cove is now Drug Central?</p><p>I rub my face, trying to adjust to this new, grim picture.</p><p>\u201cSo ... there\u2019ll be people there now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. There was a party there last night. They\u2019ll all be asleep now, though. See you.\u201d He pushes off and unfurls his sail.</p><p>That\u2019s it, then. Our whole plan, ruined. I paddle back through the shallows to where Ben is standing.</p><p>\u201cIt was so perfect,\u201d I say in despair. \u201cAnd now they\u2019ve ruined it. I can\u2019t bear it. I mean, look.\u201d I gesture wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s hideous! It\u2019s a hellhole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Lottie!\u201d says Ben, a little impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting. We used to party on the beach, remember? We used to leave rubbish around. Arthur was always complaining.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot used condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe probably did.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t!\u201d I retort indignantly. \u201cI was on the pill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>He forgot? How could you forget whether you used condoms or not with the love of your life?</p><p>I want to say, If you really loved me, you\u2019d remember we didn\u2019t use condoms, but I bite my tongue. An argument about condom use is not what you want on your honeymoon. Instead, I hunch my shoulders and stare mournfully out to sea.</p><p>I\u2019m so disappointed, I want to cry. This is so absolutely not what I imagined. I suppose, to be honest, I didn\u2019t imagine anyone on the beach at all. I imagined that we\u2019d have it totally to ourselves. We would run over the deserted sand and leap through the foamy surf, landing in a perfect embrace while violins played. So maybe that was a tad unrealistic. But this is the opposite extreme.</p><p>\u201cWell, what shall we do?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cWe can still enjoy ourselves.\u201d Ben pulls me close and gives me a kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back, anyway, isn\u2019t it? Still the same sand. Still the same sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I gratefully sink into his kiss.</p><p>\u201cStill the same Lottie. Same sexy shorts.\u201d His hands cup my bum, and I feel a sudden urge to reclaim at least some of my fantasy.</p><p>\u201cRemember this?\u201d I give him my bag to hold. I take a deep breath, preparing myself, then give a light hop and a skip and launch into what is supposed to be a flawless series of cartwheels down the beach.</p><p>Ow. Oof.</p><p>Argh. Shit. My head.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened, except my arms buckled beneath my weight, and there were a few shouts of alarm around me, and I landed hard on my head. Now I\u2019m sprawled in an ungainly position on the sand, my breath coming short in shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My arm is throbbing in pain and my mind is throbbing in humiliation. I can\u2019t do cartwheels anymore? When did that happen?</p><p>\u201cSweets.\u201d Ben approaches, looking embarrassed. \u201cDon\u2019t do yourself an injury.\u201d His gaze shifts to my shorts. \u201cSlight accident, I think?\u201d</p><p>I follow his gaze and feel a fresh jolt of dismay. There\u2019s a rip in my tie-dye shorts. I\u2019ve split them, in the worst possible place. I want to die.</p><p>Ben hauls me to my feet, and I rub my arm, wincing. I must have twisted it or something.</p> <p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d says a nearby girl in denim shorts and a bikini top, who looks about fifteen. \u201cYou need to take off with a bit more spring. Like this.\u201d She throws herself lightly over and performs a perfect cartwheel, followed by a roundoff.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d I take my bag back from Ben and there\u2019s an awkward silence. \u201cSo ... what shall we do?\u201d I say at last. \u201cCheck out the cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some coffee,\u201d says Ben firmly. \u201cAnd I want to see the guest house, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I feel a last flicker of hope. Even if the beach is ruined, the guest house may not be. \u201cOnly, you go first up the steps,\u201d I add.</p> <p>If my shorts are split, I\u2019m not having him behind me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the cartwheel fiasco or maybe my heart monitor at the gym has been lying to me, but I\u2019m not as fit as I thought I was. And 113 steps is a lot of steps. I find myself grabbing on to the handrail and using it to haul myself upward, and I\u2019m glad Ben can\u2019t see me. I\u2019m hot in the face, and my hair has escaped from its elastic, and I\u2019m puffing in a deeply non-sexy way. The sun is starting to glare down, so I\u2019m avoiding looking upward, but as we near the top I glance up and blink in surprise. There\u2019s a figure silhouetted against the top of the cliff. A girl.</p><p>\u201cHello there!\u201d she calls down in an English accent. \u201cAre you guests?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s a stunning girl, I realize as I get higher. With quite an extraordinary chest. All the clich\u00e9s are springing to my mind. Her boobs look like two brown moons straining against her strappy white tank top. No, two brown lively puppies. Even I\u2019m so fascinated I want to touch them. She\u2019s leaning over to greet us as we stumble upward, and I can see right into the cavernous depths of her cleavage.</p><p>Which means Ben can too.</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d she laughs as we eventually reach the top. I\u2019m panting so hard I can\u2019t speak. Nor can Ben, but he looks as if he\u2019s trying to convey something to me\u2014or is it to the extraordinarily shaped girl?</p> <p>It\u2019s to the extraordinarily shaped girl.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d he manages at last\u2014and he sounds absolutely stunned. \u201cSarah!\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>My mind is a whirl. I don\u2019t know what to focus on. I don\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>First of all, there\u2019s the guest house. How can it be so different from the way I remember? Everything is smaller and shabbier and kind of less iconic. We\u2019re sitting on the veranda, which is far less impressive than I remember and has been painted in a quite revolting beige color that\u2019s peeling away in strips. The olive grove is just a scrubby patch of ground with a few sparse trees. The view is good, but no different from any other Greek island view.</p><p>And Arthur. How could I have been impressed by him? How could I have sat at his feet, lapping up his pearls of wisdom? He\u2019s not wise. He\u2019s not a sage. He\u2019s a seventy-something alcoholic lech.</p><p>He\u2019s tried to grope me twice already.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t come back,\u201d he\u2019s saying, waving his roll-up in the air. \u201cI tell all you young people. Don\u2019t revisit. Youth is still where you left it, and that\u2019s where it should stay. What are you returning for? Anything that was worth taking on life\u2019s journey, you\u2019ll already have taken with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Sarah rolls her eyes. \u201cEnough already. They did come back. And I\u2019m glad they did.\u201d She twinkles at Ben. \u201cYou were just in time. We\u2019ve sold up. We\u2019re leaving next month. More coffee?\u201d</p><p>As she leans over to pour the coffee, I can\u2019t help staring. Up close, she isn\u2019t any less extraordinarily shaped. Everything about her is sheeny and silky, and her breasts are straining against her tank top as though they\u2019re in breast-yoga class and are showing off in front of everybody.</p><p>And this is the other reason that my mind is in a whirl. Several reasons, in fact. Number one: she\u2019s gorgeous. Number two: it\u2019s quite clear that she and Ben had some whole history here at the guest house before I even arrived. They keep alluding to it and laughing and changing the subject. Number three: there\u2019s a spark between them still. If I can see it, surely they can see it? Surely they can feel it? What does it mean? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What does any of it mean?</p><p>I take my coffee from Sarah with trembling hands. I thought coming back here to the guest house would be the glorious finale to our honeymoon, where all the threads would come together in a big satisfying knot. Instead, it feels as though all sorts of bright new threads have appeared and nothing is tied up at all. Especially Ben. He feels like he\u2019s unraveling away from me. He won\u2019t meet my eye, and when I put my arm around him, he shrugged it off. I know Sarah saw, because she tactfully turned away.</p><p>\u201cWe get old.\u201d Arthur is still on his rant. \u201cLife gets in the way of dreams. Dreams get in the way of life. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been. Anyone want a Scotch?\u201d He brightens suddenly. \u201cSun\u2019s over the yardarm, Greek time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Scotch,\u201d replies Ben, to my dismay. What\u2019s he doing? It\u2019s eleven in the morning. I don\u2019t want him to start sinking into glasses of Scotch. I shoot him a Is that really a good idea, darling? look, and he sends me back a glare, which I have a horrible feeling means, Butt out and stop trying to run my life.</p> <p>And again Sarah is tactfully looking away from us.</p><p>Oh God, this is torture. Other women tactfully looking away while you exchange acrimonious glares with your husband is the most mortifying experience going. Tied with your tie-dye shorts splitting while you try to do a cartwheel.</p><p>\u201cGood man! Come and choose a single malt.\u201d Arthur ushers Ben into the recesses of the guest house, and I\u2019m left with Sarah on the veranda. The air feels prickly between us, and I don\u2019t know where to start. I desperately want to know ... what, exactly?</p><p>\u201cDelicious coffee.\u201d I retreat into politeness.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She smiles back, then sighs. \u201cLottie. I just want to say ...\u201d She spreads her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware that Ben and I ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cBut I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the briefest of flings. I was out here seeing Dad, and we just clicked. It lasted a couple of weeks, if that. Please don\u2019t think ...\u201d Again she pauses. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking anything!\u201d I cut her off brightly. \u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She smiles again, showing perfect teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely you\u2019ve come back. Lots of good memories, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, loads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an awesome summer.\u201d She sips her coffee. \u201cThat was the year Big Bill was out here. Did you know him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I knew Big Bill.\u201d I unbend a little. \u201cAnd Pinky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the two Neds? They got arrested one night when I was here,\u201d she says, grinning. \u201cThey were thrown into jail, and Dad had to bail them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that.\u201d I sit up, suddenly enjoying this conversation. \u201cDid you hear about the fishing boat sinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yeah.\u201d She nods. \u201cDad told me about it. What with the fire, it was, like, the year of disasters. Even poor Ben got the flu. He was really ill.\u201d</p><p>What did she say? The flu?</p><p>\u201cThe flu?\u201d I echo, in a strangled voice. \u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was awful.\u201d She draws her brown feet up onto her chair. \u201cI got quite worried about him. He was delirious. I had to nurse him through the night. I sang him Joni Mitchell songs.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>My brain is whirring in a panic. It was Sarah who nursed him through the flu. Sarah who sang to him.</p> <p>And he thinks it was me.</p><p>And that was the moment he \u201cknew he loved me.\u201d He told a whole audience so.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed. \u201cWow. Well done, you.\u201d I swallow. \u201cBut no point dwelling on the past, eh? So, er ... how many guests do you have at the moment?\u201d</p><p>I want to get off this topic fast, before Ben comes back. But Sarah ignores me.</p><p>\u201cHe said the funniest things while he was delirious,\u201d she reminisces. \u201cHe wanted to go flying. I was like, \u2018Ben, you\u2019re ill! Lie down!\u2019 Then he said I was his guardian angel. He kept saying it, over and over. I was his guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your guardian angel?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice greets us. He appears on the veranda, holding a glass. \u201cYour dad\u2019s taken a call, by the way. Who\u2019s your guardian angel?\u201d he repeats.</p><p>My stomach is churning. I have to stop this conversation right now.</p><p>\u201cLook at that olive tree!\u201d I say shrilly, but both Ben and Sarah ignore me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Ben?\u201d Sarah laughs easily, throwing back her head. \u201cWhen you had the flu and I nursed you through the night? You said I was your guardian angel. Nurse Sarah.\u201d She pokes him teasingly with her foot. \u201cRemember Nurse Sarah? Remember the Joni Mitchell songs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben seems almost frozen.

I don\u2019t know what to say. Why did I take the credit for nursing him, why?</p><p>\u201cLottie?\u201d Sarah says in surprise. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t even there! It was me, and I\u2019m getting the Brownie points, thank you! I\u2019m the one who sat up and mopped your brow till dawn.

Of course I haven\u2019t forgotten! I\u2019ve remembered that night all my life. But I remembered wrong. I thought it was ...\u201d He looks accusingly at me.</p><p>I\u2019m prickling all over. I have to speak. Everyone\u2019s waiting.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I got confused.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cWith ... another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other time?\u201d demands Ben. \u201cI only had the flu once. And now it turns out you didn\u2019t nurse me, Sarah did. Which I find confusing.\u201d His voice is hard and unforgiving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sarah looks from face to face, as though she\u2019s picked up on the tense vibe between us. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Ben puts his fist to his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize? You saved me. You were my guardian angel, Sarah. This changes\u2014\u201d He stops himself.</p><p>I stare at him in indignation. This changes what? I was his guardian angel till three minutes ago. You can\u2019t just switch guardian angels because you feel like it.</p><p>\u201cNot that again!\u201d Sarah shakes her head, smiling. \u201cI told you,\u201d she adds to me, as though trying to lighten the atmosphere. \u201cHe said all kinds of crazy stuff about angels and all sorts. Anyway.\u201d She clearly wants to get off the subject herself. \u201cSo. What do you guys do for a living?\u201d</p><p>Ben glares at me, then takes a slug of whiskey. \u201cI make paper,\u201d he begins.</p><p>As he\u2019s explaining about his paper company, I sip my tepid coffee, trembling a little. I can\u2019t believe my stupid white lie came out. But neither can I believe how seriously Ben is taking it. For God\u2019s sake. Who cares who nursed whom? I\u2019m so distracted, I tune right out of the conversation, then wake up when I hear the words \u201cmove abroad\u201d from Ben. Is he talking about France?</p><p>\u201cMe too! I\u2019ll probably sail around the Caribbean for a while,\u201d Sarah is saying. \u201cDo a bit of teaching to make money. See how it goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do too.\u201d Ben is nodding vigorously. \u201cSailing\u2019s my passion. If there\u2019s one thing I want to do in the next two years, it\u2019s spend more time on my boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever sailed the Atlantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cI want to get a crew together. You in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely! And then a season sailing in the Caribbean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettled.\u201d They high-five each other, laughing. \u201cDo you sail?\u201d adds Sarah politely to me.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I\u2019m staring at Ben, seething. He\u2019s never mentioned sailing the Atlantic to me. And how\u2019s that going to fit in with buying a French farmhouse? And what\u2019s all that matey high-fiving about? I want to address all of this straightaway, but I can\u2019t in front of Sarah.</p><p>I suddenly wish we\u2019d never come back here. Arthur was right. Don\u2019t revisit.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re selling up?\u201d I say to Sarah.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sarah nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but the party\u2019s over. The hostel took away our business. They\u2019re buying the land. They\u2019ll build more units.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastards!\u201d says Ben angrily.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She shrugs, sanguine. \u201cTo be honest, business was never that great after the fire. I don\u2019t know how Dad has limped on for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire was terrible,\u201d I chime in, glad to move on to a subject I can talk about. I\u2019m hoping someone will mention the way I brilliantly took command and saved lots of lives, but all Sarah says is, \u201cYeah, what a drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a faulty cooker or something, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Ben.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Sarah shakes her head, and her earrings make little chinking noises. \u201cThat\u2019s what they thought at first. But then they worked out it was someone\u2019s candles. You know, in a bedroom. Scented candles.\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cI must get my casserole out. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>As she disappears, Ben takes a sip of Scotch, then he glances at me and his expression changes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He frowns. \u201cLottie?

Instead, he looks uninterested.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a long time ago,\u201d he says at last. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d I stare at him in disbelief. \u201cOf course it matters! I ruined everyone\u2019s summer! I ruined this business! It\u2019s awful!\u201d</p> <p>I feel ill with guilt. And more than that\u2014I feel as if I\u2019ve been wrong, stupidly wrong, this whole time. All these years. I\u2019ve been cherishing the wrong memory. Yes, I made a difference that night\u2014but it was a disastrous difference. I could have killed someone. I could have killed lots of people. I\u2019m not the woman I thought I was. I\u2019m not the woman I thought I was.</p><p>I give a sudden little sob. It feels as though everything\u2019s fallen apart.</p><p>\u201cShould I tell them? Should I confess everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Lottie,\u201d says Ben impatiently. \u201cOf course you shouldn\u2019t. Get over it. It was fifteen years ago. No one was hurt. No one cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care!\u201d I say in shock.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should stop. You go on and on about that bloody fire\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Something inside me snaps.</p><p>\u201cWell, you go on and on about sailing!\u201d I shout, stung. \u201cWhere did all that come from?\u201d</p><p>We glare at each other in a kind of shocked uncertainty. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re sizing each other up for a game but aren\u2019t sure of the rules. At last, Ben launches in with a fresh salvo.</p><p>\u201cBasically, how can I trust anything you say anymore?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I recoil in utter shock.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t nurse me through the flu, but you let me think you did.\u201d His gaze is unrelenting. \u201cWhy would anyone do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was ... confused.\u201d I gulp. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, OK?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t alter. Sanctimonious bastard.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK.\u201d I launch a counterattack. \u201cSince we\u2019re doing home truths, can I ask how you\u2019re planning to sail a season in the Caribbean when we\u2019re moving to France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might move to France,\u201d he retorts impatiently. \u201cWe might not. We were only knocking a few ideas around. Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t knocking ideas around!\u201d I stare at him in horror. \u201cWe were making plans! I was basing my whole life on them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d Sarah rejoins us on the veranda, and Ben instantly switches on his charming, lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d he says, as though nothing\u2019s happened. \u201cWe\u2019re just chilling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore coffee? Or Scotch?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer her. I\u2019m realizing the awful truth: I\u2019m basing my whole life on this guy sitting in front of me. This guy with his charming smile and easy manner who suddenly seems alien and unfamiliar and just wrong, like a guest bedroom in someone else\u2019s house. Not only do I not know him, I don\u2019t understand him, and I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t much like him.</p><p>I don\u2019t like my husband.</p><p>It\u2019s like a clanging in my ears. A death knell. I have made a monumental, humongous, terrifying mistake.</p><p>I have an instinctive, desperate longing for Fliss, but at the same time I realize I can never, never admit this to her. I\u2019ll have to stay married to Ben and pretend everything\u2019s OK till the end of my days. It\u2019s too embarrassing otherwise.</p><p>OK. So that\u2019s my fate. I feel quite calm about it. I married the wrong man and must simply live with it in misery forever. There\u2019s no other way.</p><p>\u201c... great place for a honeymoon,\u201d Sarah\u2019s saying as she sits down. \u201cAre you having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d says Ben sarcastically. \u201cReally great. Super.\u201d He flicks an antagonistic look at me, and I bristle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve hardly been enjoying the usual \u2018honeymoon pleasures,\u2019 have we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho turned me down this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for the cove!

Beds. Condoms, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Ben lifts his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a bed upstairs? A private double bed that we could use? You have no idea how we\u2019ve wanted to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoads of them. We\u2019re half empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is great! Great!\u201d Ben\u2019s spirits have zoomed up. \u201cWe can do it right here at the guest house! Where we first met! Come on, Mrs. Parr, let me ravish you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t listen,\u201d jokes Sarah.</p><p>\u201cYou can join in if you like!\u201d says Ben, then adds to me quickly, \u201cJoke. Joke.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his hands to me, his smile as endearing as it\u2019s ever been. But the magic isn\u2019t working. The sparkle has gone.</p> <p>There\u2019s silence for what seems like forever. My mind is a maelstrom. What do I want? What do I want?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say after a long pause, and hear Ben inhale sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d He sounds as though he\u2019s at the end of his tether. \u201cYou don\u2019t fucking know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I have to take a walk.\u201d Abruptly, I push back my chair and stride away before he can say anything else.</p><p>I head round the back of the guest house and up the scrubby hill behind. I can see the new hostel\u2014a concrete-and-glass building plonked in the space where the guys used to play football. I stride straight past it and keep walking down the hillside till I can\u2019t see it anymore. I\u2019m in a little dip in the land, surrounded by olive trees, with a derelict hut that I dimly remember from the old days. There\u2019s rubbish here too\u2014old cans and crisp packets and the remains of some pita bread. I stare at it, feeling a swell of hatred for whoever left it here. On impulse, I go round the small clearing, picking up all the trash, working with a burst of energy. There isn\u2019t a rubbish bin, but I gather it together and put it next to a large rock. My life might be a mess, but I can clear a patch of land, at least.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I sit on the rock and stare ahead, not wanting to visit my thoughts. They\u2019re too confusing and scary. The sun is beating on my head and I can hear the distant bleating of goats. It makes me smile reminiscently. Some things haven\u2019t changed.</p><p>After a while, the sound of puffing makes me turn my head. A blond woman in a pink sundress is climbing up the hill. She sees me on the rock, smiles, and heads toward it gratefully.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot.\u201d She wipes her forehead.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to look at the ruins? The ancient ruins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m just hanging out. I\u2019m on my honeymoon,\u201d I add, as an excuse.</p><p>I vaguely remember people talking about the ruins in my gap year. We all intended to go and look at them, but in the end none of us ever bothered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on honeymoon too.\u201d She brightens. \u201cWe\u2019re at the Apollina, but my husband dragged me here to look at these ruins. I told him I needed a sit-down and I\u2019d join him in a minute.\u201d She gets out a bottle of water and takes a swig. \u201cHe\u2019s like that. We went to Thailand last year; it nearly killed me. I went on strike in the end. I said, \u2018Not another bloody temple. I want to lie on the beach.\u2019 I mean, what\u2019s wrong with lying on the beach?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree.\u201d I nod. \u201cWe went to Italy and it was endless churches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurches!\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cTell me about it. That was us in Venice. I said to him, \u2018Do you ever go to churches in England? Why the sudden interest just because we\u2019re on holiday?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said to Richard!\u201d I say eagerly.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s called Richard too!\u201d the woman exclaims. \u201cIsn\u2019t that funny? Richard what?\u201d</p> <p>She smiles at me, but I stare back, stricken. What have I been saying? Why did my thoughts instantly go to Richard, not Ben? What is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cActually ...\u201d I rub my face, trying to calm my thoughts. \u201cActually, my husband\u2019s not called Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looks taken aback. \u201cSorry. I thought you said ...\u201d She peers closer in dismay. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Tears are streaming out of my eyes. Lots of tears. I wipe them away and try to smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cI\u2019ve recently split up from my boyfriend. I haven\u2019t really got over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d The woman stares at me, disconcerted. \u201cI thought you said you were on your honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I sob. \u201cI am on my honeymoon!\u201d And now I\u2019m really crying: huge, racking, childlike sobs.</p><p>\u201cSo which one is Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my husband!\u201d My voice rises to an anguished wail. \u201cRichard\u2019s not my husband! He never asked me! He never asked meeeee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d says the woman awkwardly, and clambers down off the rock. As she disappears hastily from view, I give way to the noisiest, most abandoned crying I\u2019ve ever indulged in.</p><p>I feel homesick. Homesick for Richard. I miss him so much. I feel as though when we split up he wrenched a bit of my heart out. For a while the adrenaline of the situation kept me going\u2014but now I\u2019m realizing just how wounded I am. My whole body\u2019s throbbing with the pain, and it\u2019s nowhere near healing.</p> <p>I miss him, I miss him, I miss him.</p><p>I miss his humor and his sense. I miss the feel of him in bed. I miss catching his eye at a party and knowing we\u2019re thinking the same thing. I miss the smell of him. He smells the way a man should. I miss his voice and his kisses and even his feet. I miss everything.</p><p>And I\u2019m married to someone else.</p><p>I give a fresh, desperate sob. Why did I get married? What was I thinking? I know Ben is hot and fun and charming, but suddenly that all seems meaningless. It feels hollow.</p><p>So what do I do now? I bury my head in my hands, feeling my breathing gradually slow down. I\u2019m twisting my wedding ring round and round on my finger. I\u2019ve never felt so terrified in my life. I\u2019ve made mistakes before, but never on this scale. Never with these repercussions.</p><p>I can\u2019t do anything about it, my brain is telling me. I\u2019m stuck. Trapped. It\u2019s my own fault.</p><p>The sun is beating strongly on my head. I should really get down off the rock and move into the shade. But I can\u2019t bring myself to. I can\u2019t move a muscle. Not till I\u2019ve sorted myself out. Not till I\u2019ve made a few decisions.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly an hour before I move. I jump down from the rock, dust myself off, and head swiftly toward the guest house. Ben didn\u2019t bother trying to find me to see if I was all right, I note. But I don\u2019t even care anymore.</p> <p>I see them before they see me. Ben is sitting close to Sarah on the veranda, his hand curled around her shoulders and playing lightly with her strap. It\u2019s so obvious what has been going on, I feel like screaming. But, instead, I creep toward the guest house, staying silent as a cat.</p><p>Kiss, I\u2019m willing them. Kiss. Confirm what I secretly believe.</p><p>I stand there, hardly breathing, my eyes fixed on them. It\u2019s like watching Ben and me when we met up in the restaurant however many days ago. They\u2019re revisiting their teenage fling. They can\u2019t help it. The hormones emanating from them are so strong, they\u2019re almost visible. Sarah is laughing at something Ben is saying, and he\u2019s playing with her hair now, and they\u2019ve got that intense couple-y look going on and ...</p><p>Houston, we have touchdown.</p><p>Their lips have fixed together. His hand is exploring inside her tank top. Before this can go any further, I march toward the veranda, feeling like a soap opera actress who\u2019s slightly late for her cue.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d As I yell the words, I realize there\u2019s a genuine torment behind them. How could he bring me here, to the scene of his other teenage fling, the one which predates me and which he never mentioned? He should have known Sarah would be here. He should have known the teenage hormones would flare up again. Did he do it all on purpose? Is it a game? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least I\u2019ve rattled them.

Sarah tactfully disappears into the guest house, and I join Ben on the veranda.</p><p>\u201cSo. This isn\u2019t working.\u201d I stare away from him, out toward the sea, my whole body tensed miserably. \u201cAnd now I see you prefer someone else, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d he says irritably. \u201cOne kiss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d he says furiously. \u201cYou just turned me down! What\u2019s a guy supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t turn you down,\u201d I retort, immediately realizing that, yes, I did turn him down. \u201cOK.\u201d I backtrack. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I just ...\u201d</p><p>I just didn\u2019t want to do it with you. I wanted to do it with Richard. Because he\u2019s the man I love. Richard, my beloved Richard. But I\u2019ll never see him again. And now I\u2019m going to cry again....</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say this,\u201d I manage at last, and blink back fresh tears. \u201cBut I think our marriage was too quick. I think we rushed. I think ...\u201d I exhale a shuddery breath. \u201cI think it was ... wrong. And I blame myself. I\u2019d only recently come out of a relationship. It was too soon.\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cMy bad. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Ben at once. \u201cMy bad.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as I take his words in. So we both think it was a mistake. A massive sense of failure is heaving in my chest. Combined with relief. Fliss was right shoots through my brain, and I flinch. That thought is too painful to deal with right now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to move to France,\u201d says Ben abruptly. \u201cI hate fucking France. I shouldn\u2019t have let you think I was serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t have pressed you on it,\u201d I say, wanting to be fair. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t have made you go in for Couples\u2019 Quiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have got drunk the first night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should have had sex with you in the guest house,\u201d I say remorsefully. \u201cThat was rude. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Ben shrugs. \u201cThose beds squeak, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... we\u2019re done?\u201d I can barely say the words. \u201cCall it quits, no hard feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go for quickest divorce,\u201d says Ben, deadpan. \u201cWe might get a world record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we tell Georgios to cancel the honeymoon album, then?\u201d I give a snort of almost painful laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the honeymooners\u2019 karaoke evening? Shall we still do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won Couples\u2019 Quiz,\u201d I remind him. \u201cMaybe we could announce our divorce at the gala prize-giving.\u201d I catch his eye, and suddenly the pair of us are in fits of uncontrollable, hysterical laughter.</p><p>You have to laugh. Because what\u2019s the alternative?</p> <p>When we\u2019ve both calmed down a bit, I hug my knees and look at him properly. \u201cWas this marriage ever real to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He winces as though I\u2019ve touched a sore spot. \u201cNothing\u2019s felt real to me these last few years. My dad dying, the company, giving up on comedy ... I think I need to sort this out.\u201d He bangs his head with his fist.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real for me either,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cIt was like a fantasy. I was in such a bad place, and you pitched up and you looked so hot....\u201d</p><p>He still looks hot. He\u2019s lithe and tanned and taut. But to my eye he\u2019s lost something. He has a synthetic quality, like orange soda instead of freshly squeezed juice. It\u2019s orangey and bubbly and it quenches your thirst, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste. And it\u2019s not good for you.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d All my laughter has abated, and all my anger too. I feel strangely detached. This is surreal. My marriage is over before it\u2019s begun.</p><p>And we haven\u2019t even had sex. I mean, how laughable is that? What kind of cruel, twisted games has fate been playing with us? Our honeymoon has been such an unbelievable disaster, it\u2019s like someone Up There didn\u2019t want us to stay together.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. See out the holiday? Take it from there?\u201d Ben looks at his phone. \u201cI have this meeting with Yuri Zhernakov. You know he\u2019s sailed here especially to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I stare at him, impressed.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He puffs himself out a bit. \u201cI want to sell.

I\u2019m only the soon-to-be ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t give up,\u201d says Ben, looking a little stung. \u201cYuri says he\u2019ll keep me on as special adviser. We\u2019ll start some new projects together. Play around with some ideas. Yuri\u2019s a great guy. Want to see his yacht?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d I might as well milk the benefits of being his wife while I can. \u201cAnd after that? What about you and lover-girl?\u201d I nod sharply toward the guest house, and a look of contrition comes over Ben\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He shakes his head ruefully. \u201cIt was like Sarah and I were suddenly eighteen again; all the memories came flooding back....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, relenting. \u201cI know. It was the same for us, remember?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe how much damage has been done, just from teenage loves meeting again. People should never come into contact with their first loves, I decide. There should be some official form of quarantine. The rule should be: you break up with your teenage lover and that\u2019s it. One of you has to emigrate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind what you do with her,\u201d I say. \u201cKnock yourself out. Have your fun.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cSeriously? But ... we\u2019re married.\u201d</p> <p>If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not, it\u2019s a hypocrite.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we are on paper,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe we signed papers and exchanged rings. But you didn\u2019t really commit to me, and I didn\u2019t really commit to you. Not properly. Not thoughtfully.\u201d I give a gusty sigh. \u201cWe never even dated properly. I don\u2019t see how I can have any hold over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He looks incredulous. \u201cLottie, you\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re the most generous ... broad-minded ... you\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>For a while I\u2019m silent. I might be keeping it together in front of Ben, but inside I feel battered by everything. I want to fall on someone\u2019s shoulder and wail. Everything I thought is upside down. My marriage is over. I started the fire. Fail, fail, fail.</p><p>I sit there, my entire body twisted in tension. I feel like my brain is a confused, whirling cloud, with only a few tiny rays of clarity. Like little nudges pushing me in a certain direction. The thing is ...</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing. Ben is very hot. And good in the sack. And I am absolutely desperate. And maybe it would help me briefly forget how I nearly killed twenty innocent students.</p><p>Ben is quiet too, staring out over the arid olive grove, and at last he turns to me with a new glint in his eye.</p><p>\u201cJust had an idea,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMe too, actually,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFirst and final shag? For old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. But not here.\u201d I wrinkle my nose. \u201cThe mattresses were always gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I nod, feeling a tingle of excitement rise through me, like a bit of comfort in this whole sorry mess. We deserve this. We need this. First, it will be closure, and, second, it will distract me from my throbbing aching heart, and, third, I\u2019ve been wanting to do this for nearly three weeks and I am going to go mad if we don\u2019t.</p> <p>If we\u2019d simply shagged each other senseless when we first met up, none of this would have happened. There\u2019s a lesson there, somewhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Sarah we\u2019re off and say our goodbyes.\u201d Ben heads inside the guest house.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, I pull out my phone. Just then, as Ben was talking, I had a weird, psychic-type flash about Richard. It was as though I could sense him thinking about me, somewhere in the world. It was so vivid that I\u2019m actually expecting to see Richard\u2019s name in my phone. My fingers are fumbling as I press the keys, my heart thudding with sudden hope.</p><p>But of course there\u2019s nothing. No call, no message, nothing, even after I\u2019ve scrolled through twice. I\u2019m being idiotic. Why would there be? Richard\u2019s in San Francisco, busy with his new life. I may miss him, but he doesn\u2019t miss me.</p><p>My spirits crash back down so heavily, I feel tears stinging my eyes again. Why am I even thinking about Richard? He\u2019s gone. Gone. He\u2019s not going to text me. He\u2019s not going to call me. Let alone fly across the world to declare his undying love and say he wants to marry me after all (my secret, stupid, never-going-to-happen fantasy). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miserably, I scroll again through my other messages, noticing that I have loads of texts from Fliss. Just seeing her name makes me cringe. She warned me about this marriage. She was right. Why is she always right?</p><p>The thought of telling her the truth is too excruciating. Too humiliating. I can\u2019t\u2014at least, not straightaway.</p><p>I start a new text, feeling a desperate, childish defiance, a determination to prove her wrong.</p><p>Hi Fliss. All wonderful here. Guess what? Ben is selling his company to Yuri Zhernakov and we\u2019re going on his yacht!!</p> <p>As I stare at the words, they mock me. Happy, happy, happy. Lies, lies, lies. My fingers add a new lie:</p><p>I\u2019m so glad I married Ben.</p><p>A tear drips onto my BlackBerry, but I ignore it and type on.</p><p>We\u2019re so happy together; it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>More tears are dripping down, and I roughly wipe my eyes. And then my fingers start tapping again and this time I can\u2019t stop:</p> <p>Imagine the best marriage in the world. Mine is better. We are so sympatico, so alive with the future. Compared with Richard, Ben is a marvel of a man. I haven\u2019t given Richard a single thought....</p><p>23</p><p>FLISS</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so chastened in my life. Finally, I can see the light. The truth. The actuality. I was wrong. One hundred percent, totally, utterly, absolutely wrong. How could my instincts have been so off? How can I be such an idiot?</p><p>I don\u2019t just feel chastened: I feel crushed. Devastated. I\u2019m standing in Sofia airport, reading Lottie\u2019s text, prickling all over as I think of what I\u2019ve put her through during the last few days. Her honeymoon has been hellish\u2014yet she and Ben seem to be bonded better than ever.</p><p>This whole stupid farce was about Daniel and me. I was indulging my own needs. I was looking at the world through skewed glasses, and Lottie was the innocent victim. The only saving grace is she doesn\u2019t know what I did, and she never will know. Thank God.</p> <p>I turn back to Lottie\u2019s text, ignoring the boarding call for Ikonos. I\u2019m not going to Ikonos. I\u2019m not going anywhere near my sister\u2019s honeymoon. I\u2019ve done enough damage already. I\u2019m finding a nice safe flight back to London for Noah and me. This whole ridiculous stunt is over.</p><p>Imagine the best marriage in the world. Mine is better. We are so sympatico, so alive with the future. Compared with Richard, Ben is a marvel of a man. I haven\u2019t given Richard a single thought, and I really can\u2019t remember what it was I ever liked about him. Ben has so many wonderful plans for the future!! He is going to work with Yuri Zhernakov on joint projects!! We are going to travel and sail in the Caribbean, then buy our French farmhouse!! Ben would like our children to be bilingual!!!</p><p>As I read, I feel a twinge of envy. This Ben sounds like Superman. Lorcan\u2019s view of him seems seriously inaccurate.</p><p>The only low point happened at the guest house. It turns out I started the fire all those years ago. It was my scented candles. So that was a shock. But otherwise it\u2019s the perfect, dreamy honeymoon. Lucky me!!!!</p><p>I stare at the phone in shock. She started the fire? The fire that changed her life? I can\u2019t help exclaiming out loud, and Richard looks up sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say automatically. I can\u2019t share Lottie\u2019s private text with him. Can I?</p><p>Oh, sod it. I need to tell someone who will understand.</p> <p>\u201cLottie started the fire,\u201d I say succinctly. To my satisfaction, he understands instantly, as I knew he would.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d His face drops.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s huge. Is she OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says so.\u201d I gesture at the phone, but he shakes his head resolutely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be putting on a brave face. She\u2019ll be in a real state.\u201d His expression changes to a kind of protective anger. \u201cDoes this Ben realize? Will he look after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d I shrug awkwardly. \u201cHe\u2019s doing all right so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see the text?\u201d</p><p>I pause for only an instant. We\u2019ve gone too far in this adventure to start being coy now.</p><p>He reads it silently, but I can see from the hunch of his shoulders how affected he is. I can see him reading it through again, and then a third time. At last he looks up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in love with him,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s a kind of brutality to the way he speaks, as though he\u2019s punishing himself. \u201cIsn\u2019t she? She\u2019s in love with the man, and I just didn\u2019t want to face up to it. I\u2019ve been a fucking idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had this stupid dream that I\u2019d arrive there, tell her how I feel, sweep her off her feet, and she\u2019d run off with me....\u201d He shakes his head as though the very thought is painful to him. \u201cWhat planet am I on? This has to end. Now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I almost can\u2019t bear to see him give up, even though I\u2019m doing the same myself.</p><p>\u201cBut what about telling her how you feel? What about the competition?\u201d I\u2019m trying to rekindle his fire, but he shakes his head again.</p><p>\u201cI think I lost the competition a long time ago, Fliss,\u201d he says. \u201cFifteen years ago, to be exact. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s happily married with the love of her life. Good for her.

I encouraged you.\u201d</p><p>As I meet his eyes, I feel sadness at the realization that this is goodbye. If he and Lottie are over, then we\u2019re over too. Over as friends. Over as siblings-in-law.</p><p>There\u2019s another call for passengers on the flight to Ikonos, but I ignore it.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d says Lorcan, looking up from his BlackBerry. He\u2019s sitting on an airport chair next to Noah, who is happily reading through a leaflet on security in Bulgarian. \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d He takes in Richard\u2019s stricken face. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been an idiot, is what happened,\u201d says Richard with a sudden intensity. \u201cFinally I see it.

I\u2019ll probably never have the chance to visit Ikonos again. I want to see the sunset. Lottie always told me the sunset was the best in the world. I\u2019ll find a quiet place to watch it and then I\u2019ll head back to San Francisco. She\u2019ll never know I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Noah?\u201d Lorcan turns to me. I\u2019m about to tell him that wild horses wouldn\u2019t drag me to Ikonos now when his BlackBerry bleeps.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ben. Hold on.\u201d He starts reading the text, and an odd expression comes over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he mutters at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan raises his eyes silently. He looks genuinely poleaxed.</p><p>\u201cLorcan, what?\u201d I feel a blade of worry. \u201cIs Lottie OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never understand Ben,\u201d he says slowly, not answering my question. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Lottie OK?\u201d I persist. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s happened....\u201d A kind of sick expression passes over Lorcan\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not protecting him,\u201d he says, as though to himself. \u201cThis is beyond the pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He exhales. \u201cTwo days into his marriage and he\u2019s already fixing up a rendezvous with some other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard and I speak in unison.</p><p>\u201cHis PA is on holiday, so he wants mine to book him a weekend hotel in England. For him and some woman named Sarah. I\u2019ve never even heard of her before. He\u2019s saying ...\u201d He passes me the phone. \u201cWell, look at what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>I grab the phone and scan the text. I\u2019m so stressed I can take in only about one word in three, but I get the gist.</p><p>We met up after all these years ... amazing body ... you have to meet her....</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d My incandescent cry echoes around Sofia airport. I feel so white-hot with fury, I may spontaneously combust. \u201cMy little sister loves this man! And this is the way he treats her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for Ben, it\u2019s pretty low.\u201d Lorcan is shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s given him her heart. She\u2019s given him her body and soul.\u201d I\u2019m shaking with fury. \u201cHow dare he? Where are they now?\u201d I consult the text again. \u201cStill at the guest house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but apparently they\u2019re leaving there after lunch and returning to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Richard.\u201d I turn to him. \u201cWe have to rescue Lottie from this vile, odious man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a minute!\u201d chimes in Lorcan. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018I\u2019m never going to interfere in my sister\u2019s life again\u2019? What happened to \u2018Hold me to my vow\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before,\u201d I retort. \u201cThat\u2019s when I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are.

It\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to read these texts?\u201d I bang my BlackBerry with my hand for emphasis. \u201cMy poor trusting sister is absolutely besotted with Ben.

She made that perfectly plain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her marriage with Ben is on the rocks!\u201d I cry in frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd, anyway, what are you expecting me to do, pick up the pieces? Lottie chose Ben, and that\u2019s something I have to live with.\u201d He hoists his bag on his shoulder. \u201cYou can do what you like, but I\u2019m going my own way. I\u2019m finding a sunset and I\u2019m watching it and I\u2019m going to try to find some inner peace.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him in disbelief. Now he goes all Dalai Lama on me?</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I turn to Lorcan, who lifts his hands and shakes his head too.</p><p>\u201cNot my affair. I\u2019m strictly here for business reasons. Once the restructuring papers are signed, I\u2019m leaving Ben alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re both bailing out on me?\u201d I glare at the two men. \u201cFine. Fine. I\u2019ll save the day without you.\u201d I extend a hand. \u201cCome on, Noah. We\u2019re going to Ikonos after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Have they done it?\u201d he adds chattily as he gathers up all the Bulgarian leaflets he\u2019s collected.</p><p>\u201cDone what?\u201d I\u2019m momentarily stunned.</p> <p>\u201cLottie and Ben. Have they put the sausage in the bun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuffin,\u201d amends Richard.</p><p>\u201cCupcake,\u201d corrects Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d I say frantically. I feel as though I\u2019m losing control of everything. Do I have to have the facts-of-life conversation with my seven-year-old right now, in Sofia airport?</p><p>Also, more pertinent: it\u2019s a good question. Have they done it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say at last, and put an arm round Noah. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, darling. Nobody knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I know.\u201d Lorcan looks up from his BlackBerry. \u201cJust got a new text from Ben.\u201d His face twists a little. \u201cApparently the wedding night is a go. They\u2019re heading back to the hotel in order to ...\u201d He glances at Noah. \u201cPut it this way. The sausage is heading toward the cupcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooooooooo!\u201d My agonized cry rises to the roof of the building, and a few nearby passengers turn to stare. \u201cBut she has no idea what a treacherous cheating rat he is!\u201d I look agitatedly from face to face. \u201cWe have to stop them!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFliss, calm down,\u201d says Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cStop them?\u201d Richard looks shocked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sabotaging their entire honeymoon,\u201d explains Lorcan succinctly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you wonder why they were so unlucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Fliss.\u201d Richard looks shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe need to board,\u201d says Noah, tugging at my sleeve, but all three of us ignore him. Determination is coursing through my veins like molten steel. A crusader could not be any more crusading than I am right now.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard is not going to break my sister\u2019s heart.\u201d I\u2019m speed-dialing Nico. \u201cRichard, give me some more pointers. You have the inside track; you can help.

Whatever it takes!\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I can hardly believe it\u2019s true. Our hotel suite is empty. No staff milling around. No butlers. No harps. As I look around the sleek, silent furniture, I can feel a buzz of anticipation in the air. It\u2019s as though the rooms are waiting for us to fill them with noise and heat and gasps and lovely, lovely sex.</p><p>We arrived back at the hotel and came straight up here. Neither of us said a word. I\u2019m blocking everything else out right now. All thoughts about our marriage. All thoughts about Richard. All thoughts about Sarah. My shame, my sadness, my humiliation\u2014I\u2019m blocking it all out. The only thing I\u2019m focusing on is that insistent pulse inside me I\u2019ve been feeling ever since I clapped eyes on Ben in that restaurant. I want him. He wants me. We deserve this.</p> <p>As he comes toward me, his eyes are darkening and I can tell he feels like I do: where to start? We have the whole experience ahead of us, like a delicious box of chocolates.</p><p>\u201cDid you put out DO NOT DISTURB?\u201d I murmur as his lips find my neck.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd lock the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is really happening.\u201d My hands run down his back and even lower, cupping his two taut buttocks, and I fleetingly wish mine were that firm. \u201cMmmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He eases out of my grip and peels off his shirt. God, I fancy this man. And I know he\u2019s a flake; I know he\u2019ll be on to Sarah, or even some other girl, tomorrow. But for now\u2014glorious now\u2014he\u2019s all mine.</p><p>He\u2019s slowly unbuttoning my shirt. Thank God I\u2019m wearing an expensive, froufrou bra. Richard never took any notice of my underwear, just used to peel it off in a great hurry. Then I told him I was hurt by this and he went to the other extreme, always murmuring \u201cGreat bra\u201d or \u201cSexy pants.\u201d Dear Richard.</p><p>No. Stop, Lottie. No Richard thoughts. They\u2019re banned.</p><p>Ben is doing delicious things inside my ear with his tongue, and I moan urgently, reaching for his belt, unbuttoning his jeans. I thought I wanted this to be long and drawn out and epic, the stuff of memories. But now that it\u2019s happening, I realize I don\u2019t care about it being long and drawn out. I want him now. Now. Now. Short and epic will suit me fine.</p><p>Ben\u2019s panting and I\u2019m panting, and I can feel he\u2019s as desperate as I am, and I have never wanted anyone so much in my whole entire life\u2014</p><p>\u201cMadame? A drink?\u201d</p><p>What the fuuuck?</p><p>We both leap so high, it\u2019s as though we\u2019re Irish dancers doing a pas de deux.</p> <p>I\u2019m half undressed. Ben is half undressed. And Georgios is standing a meter away, holding a silver salver bearing a bottle of wine and several glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben barely seems capable of words. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of wine? Or iced water?\u201d says Georgios nervously. \u201cCourtesy of the management.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the management! Fuck the fucking management!\u201d Ben explodes. \u201cI put on the DO NOT DISTURB sign. Can\u2019t you read? Can\u2019t you see what we\u2019re doing? Have you heard of the concept of privacy?\u201d</p><p>Georgios is speechless. He takes a step forward and nervously proffers the silver salver.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Ben seems to reach the end of his tether. \u201cStay there! Watch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to leave us alone. Well, then, he can watch us. We\u2019re consummating our marriage,\u201d he adds over his shoulder to Georgios. \u201cShould be fun.\u201d</p><p>He reaches to unhook my bra and I clamp my hands over my breasts. \u201cBen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake no notice of the butler,\u201d Ben says fiercely. \u201cPretend he\u2019s a pillar.\u201d</p><p>Is he serious? He expects us to have sex while the butler watches? Isn\u2019t that against the law?</p><p>Ben starts nuzzling at my cleavage, and I shoot a glance at Georgios. He\u2019s put one hand over his eyes but is still holding out the salver.</p><p>\u201cChampagne?\u201d he says, sounding distraught. \u201cYou would prefer champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go?\u201d I say furiously. \u201cLeave us alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot!\u201d He sounds desperate. \u201cPlease, madame. Stop for refreshment at least.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy does this matter to you?\u201d I wrench Ben\u2019s head up from my breast and turn to stare at Georgios. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to stop us ... you know ... all honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame!\u201d Another voice hails us, and I whip round incredulously. \u201cPlease! Urgent message!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t cope with this. It\u2019s Hermes. He\u2019s also standing a meter away, holding out some bit of paper. I take it from him and read the words Urgent Message.</p><p>\u201cWhat urgent message?\u201d I snap. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome here, Lottie,\u201d snarls Ben, who is clearly beside himself. \u201cIgnore them! We\u2019re doing this. We\u2019re getting it on.\u201d He rips my bra off completely and I scream.</p><p>\u201cBen! Stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame!\u201d shouts Georgios impetuously. \u201cI come to your rescue!\u201d He puts down the salver and grabs Ben in a half nelson, while Hermes throws a glass of iced water over us both.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bloody dogs!\u201d yells Ben. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean Stop, stop!\u201d I say, equally livid. \u201cI meant Stop, don\u2019t take my bra off in front of the butlers!\u201d</p> <p>Ben and I are both panting, but not in a good way. We\u2019re both dripping too, but, again, not in a good way. Georgios releases Ben, who rubs his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to stop us?\u201d I glare at Georgios. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Ben is suddenly alert. \u201cIt can\u2019t be coincidence, all these glitches. Is someone behind it?\u201d</p><p>I gasp. \u201cIs someone telling you to do this?\u201d My mind instantly flashes to Melissa. Maybe she wants this suite. She\u2019s the kind of person who would try all kinds of dirty tricks. \u201cHave you been deliberately trying to ruin our wedding night all along?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cMadame. Sir.\u201d Georgios glances uncertainly at Hermes. The pair of them look like guilty schoolkids.</p><p>\u201cAnswer us!\u201d says Ben.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer us!\u201d I echo furiously.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parr.\u201d The familiar tones of Nico interrupt the conversation. He glided into the room so smoothly that I didn\u2019t even notice him arriving, but here he is, batting not an eyelid at the fact that I\u2019m topless. He holds out an envelope to Ben. \u201cA message from a Mr. Zhernakov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZhernakov?\u201d Ben swivels round. \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d He tears the envelope open and we all wait breathlessly, as though this will be the answer to everything.</p><p>\u201cOK, I have to go.\u201d Ben starts looking around. \u201cWhere are my shirts?\u201d He addresses Hermes. \u201cWhere did you put them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find you a shirt, of course, sir. Which color?\u201d Hermes seems relieved to have something to do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d I stare at Ben. \u201cYou can\u2019t go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZhernakov wants to see me asap on the yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we were in the middle of something!\u201d I cry in frustration. \u201cYou can\u2019t just bail out!\u201d</p> <p>Ben ignores me and heads off with Hermes to the dressing area. I stare after him, quivering with rage. How can he leave? We were having sex. At least, we were about to. He\u2019s as bad as these butlers, interrupting all the time.</p><p>Speaking of which, where\u2019s Nico?</p><p>I spot him in the lobby of the suite and, clutching my shirt ineffectually to my chest, hasten after him. I intend to give him a piece of my mind, but to my surprise, he\u2019s standing in the corner, whispering into his phone.</p><p>\u201cThey have stopped. I assure you. They are apart.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen all over. Does \u201cthey\u201d mean Ben and me? Who\u2019s he talking to? Who the hell is he talking to? My mind is working frantically. He\u2019s talking to the person behind it all. The person who\u2019s been trying to scupper us. I know it\u2019s Melissa.</p><p>I studied martial arts at school, and just occasionally it comes in handy. Silently, I creep up behind Nico till my hand is poised, ready for action.</p><p>\u201cI am in the vicinity, and I can assure you that no coupling or intercourse of any kind will take place\u2014oof!\u201d Nico gasps as I neatly relieve him of his phone. I clamp it to my ear without saying a word and listen as hard as I can.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nearly there, Nico. You\u2019re doing a great job. Just keep them apart, whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>A brisk, commanding, thoroughly familiar voice greets my ear. For a moment I think I\u2019m hallucinating. My jaw has dropped. My head is spinning. It can\u2019t be. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>Nico is trying to grab his phone, but I swing around, eluding him.</p><p>\u201cFliss?\u201d I say, and feel a sudden, white-hot bolt of fury. \u201cFliss?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>25</p><p>FLISS</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Oh fuck.</p> <p>I feel hot and cold. I didn\u2019t see this coming. I never thought that at this late stage she would find out. We\u2019re on the island. We\u2019re nearly there. We\u2019re so nearly there.</p><p>We\u2019re standing outside the airport on Ikonos, our luggage assembled in a pile. Lorcan is at the taxi rank, negotiating a fare to the Amba Hotel, and I gesture to him to keep an eye on Noah.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lottie,\u201d I manage, but my voice has stopped working. I swallow several times, trying to regain my cool. What do I say? What can I say?</p><p>\u201cIt was you.\u201d Her voice is lacerating. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to stop Ben and me from getting it together, haven\u2019t you? You were behind the butlers and the single beds and the peanut oil. Who else would know about peanut oil but you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d I rub my face. \u201cListen. I ... I just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you do that? Why would anyone do that? It\u2019s my honeymoon!\u201d Her voice rises to a shriek of anguish and fury. \u201cMy honeymoon! And you ruined it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie. Listen.\u201d I gulp. \u201cI thought ... I was doing it for the best. You don\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing it for the best?\u201d she cries. \u201cDoing it for the best?\u201d</p><p>OK. This is going to be tough to explain in the thirty seconds I have before she screeches again.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll probably never, ever forgive me,\u201d I begin rapidly. \u201cBut you were going to try for a honeymoon baby and I was so afraid it would be a mistake, and I know what it\u2019s like on the other side, postdivorce; it\u2019s absolutely miserable, and I couldn\u2019t bear that to happen to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to have the hottest sex of my life!\u201d she yells. \u201cThe hottest sex of my life!\u201d</p> <p>OK, she didn\u2019t listen to a word, did she?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say feebly, dodging a man wheeling a huge suitcase bound with raffia.</p><p>\u201cYou always have to interfere, Fliss! Just because you think you know best. You\u2019ve always been the same, my whole life, interfering, telling me what to do, bossing me around....\u201d</p><p>Suddenly her words sting me. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve done this for my own benefit.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lottie. I\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you,\u201d I say, as calmly as I can manage. \u201cBut since we\u2019re discussing it, Ben isn\u2019t planning to be a faithful husband. He\u2019s two-timing you with a girl called Sarah; Lorcan told me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a small, shocked silence. However, if I was expecting her to capitulate at this piece of news, I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d she lashes back. \u201cSo bloody what? Maybe ...\u201d She hesitates. \u201cMaybe we have an open marriage! You didn\u2019t think of that, did you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so stunned, my mouth pops open like a fish. She\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t think of that. An open marriage? Crikey. I never thought of Lottie as the open-marriage type.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, anyway, what does Lorcan know about anything?\u201d Lottie starts on a fresh tirade. \u201cLorcan\u2019s a twisted control freak who\u2019s been muscling in and wants to steal Ben\u2019s company from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie\u2014\u201d I\u2019m still so confused by this view of Lorcan that I don\u2019t know what to say. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen told me. That\u2019s why Ben\u2019s selling his company, because Lorcan told him not to. So let\u2019s not trust the word of Lorcan, shall we?\u201d She spits out \u201cLorcan\u201d as though it\u2019s despicable.</p><p>There\u2019s another silence. I feel so many conflicting emotions I\u2019m almost paralyzed. There\u2019s a lingering astonishment at Lottie\u2019s version of Lorcan. But the strongest feeling is remorse. Wave after wave of remorse. She\u2019s right: I knew nothing about the situation. I assumed far too much.</p><p>Maybe I really don\u2019t know my little sister after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say at last, my voice low and abject. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just thought that you might not be over Richard yet. And that you might find Ben wasn\u2019t the man for you. I thought you might suddenly regret marrying him. And I thought that if things had gone too far and you\u2019d conceived a baby, then it would be the most almighty mess. But I was wrong. Obviously. Please, please forgive me. Lottie?\u201d There\u2019s silence down the phone. \u201cLottie?\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I hate her. Why is she always right? Why is she always right?</p><p>Tears have sprung to my eyes. I want to pour out the whole sorry story to her. I want to tell her that Ben isn\u2019t the man for me, and I\u2019m not over Richard, and I\u2019ve never felt so miserable in all my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But still I can\u2019t forgive her.

In recompense, I offer you a deluxe weekend for two in one of our premium suites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you can say?\u201d I stare at him in disbelief. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deluxe weekend for two will include all meals and one snorkeling experience,\u201d says Nico, apparently not hearing me. \u201cIn addition, may I remind you that, as winners of our Couples\u2019 Quiz, you and your husband are invited to our gala prize ceremony this evening, where you will be awarded your Happy Couple of the Week trophy.\u201d He gives a little bow. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy Couple of the Week trophy?\u201d I practically scream. \u201cAre you kidding me? And stop looking at my chest!\u201d I add, suddenly realizing my shirt has slipped.</p><p>I pick up my bra and start hooking it on as Nico discreetly leaves. My mind is like a hurricane. Lots of thoughts and emotions are whizzing dangerously around, and I feel like some of them might do some damage. My marriage to Ben is a nonstarter. He couldn\u2019t even see our consummation through. Fliss is an interfering COW. I still miss Richard. I really do miss Richard. I started the fire. It was me. I started it. I feel a pang of anguish and give an uncontrollable sob. That\u2019s almost the worst thing of all: I started the fire. For fifteen years I\u2019ve had that memory as a comforting prop whenever life has gone wrong: at least that time, I saved the day. But now I know I didn\u2019t. I ruined the day.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d Ben enters the room, fully dressed, looking dapper and as if he\u2019s squeezed in a quick shower.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say miserably. There\u2019s no point sharing my thoughts with him. He wouldn\u2019t understand. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re supposed to go to a prize ceremony tonight and get our trophy. We\u2019re Happy Couple of the Week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Zhernakov\u2019s yacht,\u201d Ben says, ignoring me. \u201cThey\u2019re sending a boat for me,\u201d he adds importantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too,\u201d I say in sudden determination. \u201cWait for me.\u201d I\u2019m not missing out on an oligarch\u2019s super-yacht. I\u2019m going to go along with Ben and find the bar and drown all my sorrows, one by one, in a series of mojitos.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming?\u201d He stares at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your wife,\u201d I say pointedly. \u201cAnd I want to see the yacht.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says with bad grace. \u201cI suppose you can come. But for God\u2019s sake put some clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to come in my bra,\u201d I retort irritably.</p><p>We\u2019re arguing like an old married couple but we haven\u2019t even managed to have sex.

It\u2019s time to put all this to an end.\u201d He holds out his hand to Noah. \u201cBye, little chap. It\u2019s been good traveling with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, Uncle Richard!\u201d Noah flings his arms passionately around Richard\u2019s legs, and for a moment I wish I could do that too. I\u2019m going to miss him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBest of luck.\u201d I hug him. \u201cIf I\u2019m ever in San Francisco I\u2019ll look you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word to Lottie that I did this,\u201d he says with a sudden fierceness. \u201cShe must never know any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even I love you, Lottie, More than a zloty?\u201d I say, trying to keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He kicks my case.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I touch his arm. \u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d Lorcan shakes Richard\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to know you.\u201d</p><p>Richard heads toward the taxi rank, and I quell a sigh. If only Lottie knew. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. My only priority right now is to make the hugest apology in the world. I\u2019ve got my groveling kneepads on, all ready.</p><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s go,\u201d says Lorcan. He consults his phone. \u201cBen isn\u2019t replying to my texts. Do you know where they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. They were about to have sex when I interrupted.\u201d I wince at my own conduct. Gradually, my haze of lunacy is lifting. I can see quite how badly I\u2019ve been behaving. So what if they have sex? So what if they conceive a honeymoon baby? It\u2019s their life.</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you think she\u2019ll ever forgive me?\u201d I say as we get into the taxi. I\u2019m hoping that Lorcan will make some reassuring reply like, Of course she will; the bond of sisterhood is too strong to break with a mere bagatelle like this. Instead, he wrinkles his nose and shrugs deeply.</p><p>\u201cIs she the forgiving type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cUnlikely.\u201d</p><p>My heart drops. I\u2019m the most misguided big sister there ever was. Lottie will never speak to me again. And it\u2019s my own fault.</p><p>I dial her number and go straight to voicemail.</p> <p>\u201cLottie,\u201d I say for the zillionth time. \u201cI\u2019m so, so, so sorry. I have to explain. I have to see you. I\u2019m coming to the hotel. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m there, OK?\u201d I put my phone away and drum my fingers impatiently. We\u2019ve joined the main road but we\u2019re going at a modest speed, by Greek standards. I lean forward to the driver. \u201cCan we go faster? I need to see my sister, pronto. Can we go any faster?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten how far the Amba Hotel is from the airport. It seems like several hours before we\u2019re arriving, climbing out of the taxi, slamming the doors, and running up the marble steps.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give our luggage to a bellman,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cWe can get it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Lorcan summons a bellman with a trolley and swings our cases up onto it. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s almost more impatient than I am. He gradually became more and more urgent and tetchy in the car, consulting his watch and trying to contact Ben.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly close of play,\u201d he keeps saying. \u201cI need these signatures scanned in and sent over.\u201d</p><p>Now, as we arrive in the familiar marble lobby, he turns to me expectantly. \u201cWhere will they be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I riposte. \u201cHow should I know? In their suite?\u201d</p> <p>Through the glass doors at the back of the lobby, I can see the shimmering, inviting blue of the sea, and Noah has spotted it too.</p><p>\u201cThe sea! The sea!\u201d He wrenches at my hand. \u201cCome on! The sea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, darling!\u201d I rein him back. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we have a smoothie?\u201d he adds, spotting a waiter carrying a tray of several pink smoothie-type drinks.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I promise. \u201cWe\u2019ll have smoothies and we\u2019ll go to the buffet and you can swim in the sea. But first we need to find Aunt Lottie. Keep your eyes open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Lorcan is saying curtly into his phone. \u201cI\u2019m here. Where are you?\u201d He rings off and turns to me. \u201cWhere\u2019s their suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs. I think I remember ...\u201d I\u2019m leading him swiftly across the expanse of marble, dodging a group of tanned men in pale suits, when a voice assails my ears.</p><p>\u201cFliss? Felicity?\u201d</p><p>I wheel round to see a familiar plump figure hurrying through the lobby on patent shoes. Shit.</p><p>\u201cNico!\u201d I say, trying to keep my chin up. \u201cHi, there. And thanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Thanks for everything\u2019?\u201d He seems almost apoplectic. \u201cDo you realize the damage I have done in trying to carry out your wishes? Never have I known such farce. Never have I known such shenanigans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I gulp. \u201cEr ... sorry. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister, she is beside herself with rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wince. \u201cNico, I\u2019m so sorry. But I\u2019ll be expressing my gratitude with a very big feature about you in the magazine. Very big. Very flattering. A double-page spread.\u201d I\u2019ll write it myself, I vow. Not one critical word. \u201cThere\u2019s just one more tiny thing you could help us with\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp you?\u201d His voice rises indignantly. \u201cHelp you?

I\u2019ll sweeten him up with a glowing review.\u201d I\u2019m looking frantically around the lobby, trying to remember it. \u201cOK, I think the Oyster Suite is on the top floor. And the lifts are this way. Come on!\u201d</p> <p>As we\u2019re traveling up in the lift, Lorcan tries Ben\u2019s phone yet again.</p><p>\u201cHe knew I was coming,\u201d he mutters ominously. \u201cHe should have been ready to sign. This is so unhelpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a minute!\u201d I retort irritably. \u201cStop stressing.\u201d</p><p>As we arrive at the top floor, I hare out of the lift, dragging Noah by the hand and not stopping to check any signs. I head to the door at the end of the corridor and bang on it as hard as I can.</p><p>\u201cLottie! It\u2019s me!\u201d I notice a tiny doorbell and ring that too, for good measure. \u201cCome out! Please! I want to apologize! I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019M SO SORRY!\u201d I thump on the door again, and Noah, delighted, joins in.</p> <p>\u201cCome out!\u201d he yells, banging on the door. \u201cCome out! Come out!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the door is flung open and a strange man wrapped in a towel stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he says bad-temperedly.</p><p>I stare back, disconcerted. This doesn\u2019t look like the photo I saw of Ben. Nothing like.</p><p>\u201cEr ... Ben?\u201d I try anyway.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says flatly.</p> <p>My mind is racing. She\u2019s in an open marriage. Does that mean\u2014 Oh my God. Are they having a threesome?</p><p>\u201cAre you with ... Ben and Lottie?\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m with my wife.\u201d He glowers at me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the Oyster Suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the Pearl Suite.\u201d He points to a discreet sign by the door, which I totally missed.</p><p>\u201cAh. Right. Sorry.\u201d I back away.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew this place,\u201d says Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI did. I do. I was sure\u2014\u201d I break off as something catches my eye through a nearby window. It\u2019s a narrow window with a view of the sea, and I can just glimpse a jetty decorated with flowers. Standing in the middle of the jetty is a couple that looks very familiar\u2014</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s them! They\u2019re renewing their vows! Quick!\u201d</p><p>I grab Noah again and all three of us hurry back along the corridor. The lift is unbearably slow but, even so, we\u2019re soon outside, running over lawns and down paths, toward the sea. The jetty is ahead, decorated with flowers and balloons, and in the center, there they are, the happy couple, holding hands.</p><p>\u201cSwimming!\u201d shouts Noah joyously.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I pant. \u201cWe need to\u2014\u201d I break off, peering again at the couple on the jetty. They\u2019re facing away from us, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Lottie. I think it\u2019s Lottie. Except ...</p><p>Hang on. I rub my eyes, trying to focus more clearly. I need my lenses checked.</p><p>\u201cIs it them?\u201d demands Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I confess. \u201cIf they\u2019d just turn round ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Aunt Lottie!\u201d says Noah scornfully. \u201cThat\u2019s a different lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t really look like Ben,\u201d confirms Lorcan, squinting at the guy. \u201cToo tall.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the girl turns her head and I realize she looks nothing like Lottie.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I sink down onto a nearby sun bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not them. I can\u2019t run around anymore. Can\u2019t we have a drink?\u201d I turn to Lorcan. \u201cYou must have missed your deadline by now. Get it done in the morning. Have a drink. Lorcan? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I blink at him in surprise. His face is suddenly like stone. He\u2019s staring at something beyond my shoulder, and I swivel to see what he\u2019s looking at. It\u2019s a normal luxury-hotel beach, with sun beds, and waves crashing onto the sand, and swimmers in the sea, and, beyond, a few sailing boats and, way beyond that, a big yacht moored in deep water. That\u2019s what he\u2019s staring at, I realize.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Zhernakov\u2019s yacht,\u201d he says steadily. \u201cWhat\u2019s it doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I gasp as I put the pieces together. \u201cOf course. That\u2019s where they are. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot?\u201d</p><p>He sounds so censorious, I feel a tweak of resentment.</p><p>\u201cLottie told me earlier, but it slipped my mind.

He\u2019s meeting Yuri Zhernakov on his yacht.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing what?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s face drains of color. \u201cHe can\u2019t be.

Why else have I chased him halfway across Europe? We have plans for the company in place. Exciting plans. We\u2019ve spent weeks fine-tuning them.

He keeps telling me to calm down about Lottie, but now he goes berserk about a company which isn\u2019t even his?</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d I say with deliberate insouciance. \u201cHis company. His money. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Lorcan angrily. \u201cThis is a total fucking disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting a tad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I do not think I\u2019m overreacting!

I\u2019ve said it.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel bitter!\u201d Lorcan looks absolutely incredulous. \u201cBen needs me on board. Yes, we have our fallings-out\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea!\u201d I\u2019m so frustrated, I shake my phone at him. \u201cLorcan, you have no idea! I know more about your relationship with Ben than you do! Lottie told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie told you what?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s voice is suddenly quiet and his face still. I stare back, nervous of what I\u2019m about to say. But I have to. He has to know the truth.</p><p>\u201cBen resents you,\u201d I say at last. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re a control freak. He thinks you\u2019ve got a cushy number. He thinks you\u2019re trying to muscle in and steal his company. You once confiscated his phone in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lorcan stares at me.</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s brow is creased in thought for a moment\u2014then it clears. \u201cOh God, that. It was after his father died. Ben came up to Staffordshire and one of the older workers was making a speech. Ben took a call in the middle.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s face twists. \u201cIt was atrociously rude. I had to grab the phone and smooth things over. Jesus. He should be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still angry about it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Lorcan is quivering with emotion, his eyes distant.</p> <p>\u201cCushy number?\u201d he bursts out at last, fixing me with accusing eyes. \u201cCushy number? Do you know how much I\u2019ve done for him? For his father? For that company? I put my career on hold. I turned down offers from big City firms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started Papermaker, I restructured the finances, I gave it everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t listen to this anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I interrupt bluntly. \u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He gapes at me as though he doesn\u2019t understand the question.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d I repeat. \u201cWhy did you go up to Staffordshire in the first place? Why did you get so close to Ben\u2019s father? Why did you turn down City jobs to do this? Why have you got so emotionally involved with a company that isn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan looks as though he\u2019s floundering. \u201cI ... I had to step in,\u201d he begins. \u201cI had to take control\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did! The whole thing was in a complete mess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d I take a deep breath, marshaling my words. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do any of it. You chose to. You were in a horrible place after a relationship broke down. You were sad. You were angry.\u201d This is hard to say, but I\u2019m going to. \u201cYou were just trying to do the same as Lottie. And the same as me. Fix your broken heart. And you chose to do it by trying to save Ben\u2019s company for him. But it wasn\u2019t the right way to go.\u201d I meet his eyes and add gently, \u201cIt was your Unfortunate Choice.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan is breathing hard. His hands are clenched into fists, as though he\u2019s bracing himself against something. I can see pain rising in his face, and I\u2019m sorry I caused it.

Yay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d I look up to see Nico making his way across the beach, his white shirt as starched as ever and his shoes shiny against the sand. \u201cWhere is your sister? I need to talk through the arrangements for the gala ceremony. She and her husband are our Happy Couple of the Week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that. She\u2019s there.\u201d I gesture at the yacht.</p><p>\u201cCan you contact her?\u201d Nico looks harassed. \u201cCan you phone her? We should have had a rehearsal for the ceremony; everything has been thrown off course\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSwimming?\u201d begs Noah, who has already ripped all his clothes off and thrown them on the sand. \u201cSwimming, Mummy?\u201d</p><p>As I stare down at his eager little face, something seems to pierce my heart. And suddenly I know what\u2019s important in life. It\u2019s not gala ceremonies. It\u2019s not wedding nights. It\u2019s not saving my sister. And it\u2019s certainly not Daniel. It\u2019s right here in front of me.</p><p>My underwear is plain and black. It would just about pass as a bikini.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say cheerfully to Nico, and start stripping down to my bra and knickers. \u201cI can\u2019t stop. I\u2019m going swimming with my son.\u201d</p><p>After half an hour of splashing with Noah in the turquoise Aegean waves, all\u2019s right with the world. The late-afternoon sun is baking my shoulders, my mouth is salty from the surf, and my ribs hurt from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a shark!\u201d Noah is advancing on me through the shallows. \u201cMummy, I\u2019m a splashing shark!\u201d He splashes me furiously and I give as good back, and then we both tumble down onto the soft sandy floor of the sea.</p> <p>He\u2019ll be OK, I find myself thinking, cradling his lithe little body. We\u2019ll both be OK. Daniel can go and live in Los Angeles if he likes. Good place for him, in fact. They like plastic people out there.</p><p>I beam at Noah bobbing alongside me.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aunt Lottie?\u201d he demands in return. \u201cYou said we\u2019d see Aunt Lottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s busy,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see her.\u201d</p><p>Every time I glance up at the yacht looming huge in the bay, I vaguely wonder what\u2019s happening on board. The bizarre thing is that, when I was still in England, Lottie\u2019s affairs all felt so close and important and immediate. But now that I\u2019m here, they feel distant.</p><p>Not my life. Not my life.</p><p>Suddenly I hear something that sounds like my name. I turn instinctively and see Lorcan standing at the water\u2019s edge, incongruous in his business suit.</p> <p>\u201cI have something to say to you!\u201d he shouts indistinctly.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hear!\u201d I yell back without moving.</p><p>I\u2019m not rushing around anymore. Even if he wants to tell me that Lottie has had twins by Ben, who has turned out to be a Nazi warlord, I can hear it later.</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d he calls again.</p><p>I make a hand gesture which is supposed to mean, I\u2019m busy with Noah; let\u2019s catch up later, but I\u2019m not sure he gets it.</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m swimming!\u201d</p><p>Some emotion seems to be gathering in Lorcan\u2019s face. With an abrupt movement, he dumps his briefcase on the sand and marches into the shallows, still in his shoes and suit. He strides briskly through the waves until he reaches Noah and me, then stops. He\u2019s up to his thighs in water. I\u2019m so gobsmacked I don\u2019t know what to say. Noah, who started gasping as Lorcan approached, now collapses in paroxysms of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou really haven\u2019t heard of swimming trunks, have you?\u201d I say, trying to stay deadpan.</p><p>\u201cI have something to say to you.\u201d He glowers at me as though this is all my fault.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, long silence, apart from the noise of waves and beach chatter and the cry of a gull. Lorcan\u2019s eyes have an extra charge of intensity, and his hand is constantly raking through his hair as though trying to order his thoughts. He takes a deep breath, and then another, but doesn\u2019t speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A rubber dinghy full of children pulls near us, then bobs away again. And still Lorcan doesn\u2019t speak. I think I\u2019m going to have to do this for him.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d I say gently. \u201cIn no particular order: You realize I was right. You find this difficult. You\u2019d like to talk about it sometime. You\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re doing here, chasing after Ben, when he\u2019s betraying everything you hold dear. You\u2019re suddenly looking at your life in a different way and thinking that things need to change.\u201d I pause. \u201cAnd you wish you\u2019d brought your swimming trunks.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another long silence. A tiny muscle is working in Lorcan\u2019s cheek, and I feel apprehensive. Did I go too far?</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut you missed out a couple.\u201d He takes a step through the sea, the water washing around his legs. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever understood things like you. No one\u2019s ever challenged me like you. You were right about Ben. You were right about my website photo. I went to have another look, and you know what I saw?\u201d He pauses. \u201cWho the hell are you? What are you looking at? I haven\u2019t got time for this.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re right: Dupree Sanders is not my company,\u201d he continues, his jaw tightening. \u201cMaybe I wish it was, but it\u2019s not. If Ben really wants to sell, he should sell. Zhernakov will close the whole operation down within six months, but so be it. Nothing lasts forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you feel bitter if that happens?\u201d I can\u2019t help pushing him. \u201cYou put so much into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He nods seriously. \u201cFor a while. But even bitterness fades away eventually. We both have to believe that. Don\u2019t we?\u201d He meets my eyes, and I feel a wave of empathy for him. Emotional investment\u2014it\u2019s the hardest game of the lot.</p><p>\u201cYou were wrong on one thing, though,\u201d Lorcan adds with sudden energy. \u201cCompletely wrong. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t bring my swimming trunks.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he peels off his jacket and tosses it toward the shore. It lands on the waves, and Noah dives for it joyously.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d He holds it aloft. \u201cI got it!\u201d He goggles in delight as Lorcan takes off one shoe, then the other, tossing them toward the shore too. \u201cThey\u2019ve sunk! Your shoes have sunk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, can you dive down for Lorcan\u2019s shoes,\u201d I say, giggling, \u201cand put them on the beach? I think he\u2019s going to swim in his underpants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderpants!\u201d yells Noah. \u201cUnderpants!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderpants.\u201d Lorcan grins at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>28</p> <p>LOTTIE</p><p>I can see the tiny figures of swimmers bobbing around in the sea as I gaze back to shore. The late-afternoon sun is casting long shadows on the beach. Children are screaming and couples are embracing and families are playing together. And I suddenly wish with all my heart I was one of them. People on simple holidays, without complicated lives, without flaky, self-centered husbands, without disastrous decisions they have to unpick.</p><p>I hated the yacht the minute we got on board. Yachts are awful. Everything is clad in white leather and I\u2019m terrified of making a mark, and Yuri Zhernakov just ran a glance over me as though to say, No, you won\u2019t make the cut as my fifth wife. I was instantly banished to the company of two Russian women with plumped-up lips and boobs. They\u2019re so puffed up with silicone they make me think of balloon animals, and they have made no conversation except \u201cWhich limited-edition designer compact are you examining your reflection in?\u201d</p><p>Mine\u2019s Body Shop, so that didn\u2019t go very far.</p><p>I sip my mojito and wait for my worries to drown in it. But instead of sputtering and fading, they\u2019re circling my brain, bigger and bigger. Everything\u2019s a catastrophe. Everything\u2019s terrible. I want to cry, I realize. But I can\u2019t cry. I\u2019m on a super-yacht. I\u2019ve got to be sparkling and bright and somehow increase my cleavage.</p><p>I lean over the rail of the deck I\u2019m standing on and wonder how far it is down to the sea. Could I jump?</p><p>No. I might hurt myself.</p><p>God knows where Ben is. He\u2019s been unbearable ever since we arrived here, showing off and preening and telling Yuri Zhernakov about fifteen times how he\u2019s planning to buy a yacht himself.</p> <p>My hand steals into my pocket. There\u2019s a thought that\u2019s been sitting in my brain like a very patient person who isn\u2019t going to give up. The same, simple thought. It\u2019s been there for hours now. I could call Richard. I could call Richard. I\u2019ve been ignoring it and ignoring it, but now I can\u2019t remember all the reasons why it\u2019s a bad idea. It seems like an exciting idea. A joyful idea. I could just call him. Now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know Fliss would tell me not to, but it\u2019s not her life, is it?</p><p>I don\u2019t exactly know what I want to say to him. In fact, I think I don\u2019t want to say anything. I only want to make a connection. Like when you reach for someone\u2019s hand and squeeze it. That\u2019s it: I want to squeeze his hand over the ether. And if he pulls his hand away, well, then I\u2019ll know.</p><p>I can see the two Russian women coming on deck, and I hurry round the corner so they won\u2019t see me. I pull out my phone, stare at it for an instant, then plunge my finger down onto the keypad. As his number rings, my heart starts to thud, and I feel sick.</p><p>\u201cHello, it\u2019s Richard Finch here.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s gone to voicemail. My stomach corkscrews in panic and I press stop. I can\u2019t leave a voicemail. A voicemail isn\u2019t a squeezed hand. It\u2019s an envelope pressed into the palm. And I don\u2019t know what I want to put in the envelope. Not exactly.</p><p>I try to visualize what he might be doing right now. I have no concept of his life in San Francisco. Getting up, maybe? Having a shower? I don\u2019t even know what his apartment looks like. He\u2019s drifted right away from me. Tears sting my eyes and I look miserably at my phone. Could I try again? Would that count as stalking?</p><p>\u201cLottie! There you are!\u201d It\u2019s Ben, along with Yuri. I shove my phone back in my pocket and turn to face them. Ben is pink-faced from booze, and my heart sinks. He looks manic, like a small child who\u2019s stayed up too late. \u201cWe\u2019re going to seal the deal over some champagne,\u201d he says excitedly. \u201cYuri\u2019s got some vintage Krug. Care to join us?\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>ARTHUR</p> <p>Young people! With their hurrying and their worrying and their wanting all the answers now. They wear me out, the poor, harried things.</p><p>Don\u2019t come back, I always tell them. Don\u2019t come back.</p><p>Youth is still where you left it, and that\u2019s where it should stay. Anything that was worth taking on life\u2019s journey, you\u2019ll already have taken with you.</p><p>Twenty years I\u2019ve been saying this, but do they listen? Do they, hell. Here comes another of them now. Panting and puffing as he reaches the top of the cliff. Late thirties, I\u2019d guess. Attractive enough, against the blue sky. Looks a bit like a politician. Do I mean that? Maybe a movie star.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember his face from the old days. Not that that means anything. These days I barely even recall my own face when I glimpse it in the mirror. I can see this chap\u2019s gaze raking the surroundings, taking in me sitting in my chair under my favorite olive tree.</p><p>\u201cAre you Arthur?\u201d he says abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d</p><p>I scan him adroitly. Looks well off. Wearing one of those expensive-logo polo shirts. Probably good for a few double Scotches.</p><p>\u201cYou must want a drink,\u201d I say pleasantly. Always useful to steer the conversation in the direction of the bar early on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a drink,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help stifling a yawn. So predictable. He wants to know what happened. Another merchant banker having a midlife crisis, returning to the scene of his youth. The scene of the crime. Leave it where it was, I want to answer. Turn round. Return to your adult, problematic life, because you won\u2019t solve it here.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t believe me. They never do.</p><p>\u201cDear boy,\u201d I say gently. \u201cYou grew up. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says impatiently, and rubs his sweaty brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m here for a reason. Listen to me.\u201d He comes forward a few paces, an impressive height and figure against the sun, intentness of purpose on his handsome face. \u201cI\u2019m here for a reason,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to get involved\u2014but I can\u2019t help it. I have to do this.

We should have got the boat to drop us a mile up the coast. Because, the moment we landed, we were seized by Nico.</p> <p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Parr! Just in time for the gala ceremony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben stared at him quite rudely. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d I nudged him. \u201cHappy Couple of the Week.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing we could do to escape. Now we\u2019re milling around with about twenty other guests from the hotel, drinking cocktails and listening to a band play \u201cSome Enchanted Evening.\u201d Everyone is gossiping about Yuri Zhernakov\u2019s yacht being moored in the bay. I\u2019ve heard Ben tell at least five sets of people that we were there earlier on, drinking Krug. Every time, it makes me flinch. And any minute we\u2019re going to have to go up onto the platform and receive the Happy Couple of the Week trophy. Which is insane.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we could get out of it?\u201d I murmur to Ben as conversation lulls. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, we\u2019re hardly Happy Couple of the Week.\u201d</p> <p>Ben looks at me blankly. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Why not? Is he for real? \u201cBecause we\u2019re already discussing divorce!\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re still happy.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>Happy? How can he possibly be happy? I glare at him, suddenly wanting to hit him. He was never into this marriage. Never. It was just a diversion. A craze. Like the time I got into Scandinavian knitwear and bought a knitting machine.</p><p>But a marriage isn\u2019t a knitting machine! I almost want to yell this at him. This whole thing is a joke. I want to leave.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mrs. Parr.\u201d It\u2019s Nico again, swooping down as though suspecting I was about to escape. \u201cWe are nearly ready for the trophy presentation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d My sarcasm is so pointed that he winces.</p><p>\u201cMadame, may I apologize yet again for the inconvenience you have suffered on this holiday. As I said, I am pleased to offer you, in recompense, a deluxe weekend for two in one of our premium suites, to include all meals and one snorkeling experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d I glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined our honeymoon. Ruined our marriage.\u201d</p><p>Nico drops his eyes to the sand. \u201cMadame, I am desolate. But I must tell you, this was not my own idea, this was not my own will. It was a huge mistake on my part and one that I will always regret, but the original idea, it came from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>Nico nods his head. He looks so abject that I feel a pang of sympathy for him. I know what Fliss is like. When she gets into crusading mood, no one can refuse her.</p><p>\u201cLook, Nico,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t blame you. I know what my sister\u2019s like. I know she\u2019s been sitting there in London like a puppet mistress pulling the strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was very determined.\u201d He bows his head again.</p> <p>\u201cI forgive you.\u201d I hold out my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive her,\u201d I add quickly. \u201cBut I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame, I am not worthy.\u201d Nico takes my hand to his lips. \u201cI wish you a thousand happinesses.\u201d</p><p>As he walks away, I wonder what Fliss is doing now. She said in her voicemail she was coming to the hotel. Maybe she\u2019ll arrive tomorrow. Well, maybe I\u2019ll refuse to see her.</p><p>I take a few more sips of cocktail and have a conversation with a woman in blue about which spa treatment is the best value, while trying to avoid Melissa. She keeps trying to quiz me on what exactly Ben and I do for a living, and isn\u2019t it a bit dangerous, keeping a gun in my handbag? And then, all of a sudden the band comes to a halt and Nico has mounted the stage. He taps the microphone a few times and beams down on the gathered throng.</p><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d he says. \u201cWe are delighted to see you all at our cocktail and presentation event. Just as Aphrodite is the goddess of love, so the Amba is the home of love. And tonight we celebrate a very special couple. They are here on their honeymoon and have won our Happy Couple of the Week award: Ben and Lottie Parr!\u201d</p><p>Applause breaks out around us, and Ben gives me a nudge. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d I say bad-temperedly. I make my way over the sand to the platform and step up, squinting a little as a spotlight hits my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, dear lady!\u201d exclaims Nico, as he hands me a large silver trophy in the shape of a heart. \u201cLet me give you both your crowns....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crowns?</p><p>Before I can protest, Nico places silvered plastic crowns on our heads.

A trophy, a crown, and a sash? I feel like a beauty queen without the beauty.</p><p>\u201cAnd now a few words from our happy couple!\u201d Nico passes the microphone to Ben, who promptly passes it to me.</p> <p>\u201cHello, everybody.\u201d My voice booms out, and I wince at the sound. \u201cThank you so much for this ... honor. Well, obviously we\u2019re a very happy couple. We\u2019re so, so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery happy,\u201d adds Ben into the microphone.</p><p>\u201cBlissful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the ideal honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Ben first proposed, I had no idea that I would end up so ... so happy. So very happy.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, with no warning, a tear snakes down my face. I can\u2019t help it. When I look back to myself in that restaurant, elatedly agreeing to marry Ben, it\u2019s like looking at a different person. A mad, deluded, crazy person. What was I thinking of? Marrying Ben was like drinking four double shots of vodka. For a bit, it masked the pain and I felt fabulous. But this is the hangover, and it\u2019s not pretty.</p><p>I smile harder and lean into the microphone. \u201cWe\u2019re just so happy,\u201d I repeat for emphasis. \u201cEverything\u2019s gone so smoothly and brilliantly, and there hasn\u2019t been a tense moment between us. Has there, darling?\u201d</p><p>Two more tears are rolling down my face. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll play as tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cWhat a delightful, heavenly time we\u2019ve had,\u201d I add, wiping my face. \u201cWhat a wonderful, idyllic time. It\u2019s been perfect in every way, and we couldn\u2019t be happier\u2014\u201d I break off mid-flow as my eye is caught by a trio of silhouetted figures making their way up the beach from the sea. They\u2019re all wrapped in towels, but even so ...</p><p>Is that ...</p><p>No. It can\u2019t be.</p> <p>Beside me, Ben is looking the same way, his mouth falling open in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cLorcan?\u201d He grabs the microphone from me and calls into it loudly. \u201cLorcan! What the fuck? How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Lottie!\u201d cries the smallest toweled figure, suddenly spotting me. \u201cAunt Lottie, you\u2019ve got a crown on!\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s the third figure that I\u2019m staring at, my jaw sagging.</p><p>\u201cFliss?\u201d</p><p>31</p><p>FLISS</p><p>I\u2019m frozen. All I can do is stare mutely back. This was not how I was planning to let Lottie know that I\u2019d arrived on Ikonos.</p> <p>\u201cFliss?\u201d she says again, and now there\u2019s a sharp edge to her voice which makes me flinch. What do I say? What can I say? Where do I even begin?</p><p>\u201cFliss!\u201d Nico speaks before I can marshal my thoughts, and snatches the microphone from Ben. \u201cAnd here we have the sister of the happy couple!\u201d He addresses the audience. \u201cMay I introduce Felicity Graveney, editor of Pincher Travel Review. She is here to give the hotel a special five-star review!\u201d He beams delightedly. \u201cAs you can see, she has been sampling the delights of the Aegean Sea.\u201d</p><p>The audience gives a polite laugh. I have to hand it to Nico. No marketing opportunity left unexploited.</p><p>\u201cNow let us have the whole family onstage!\u201d He\u2019s bustling Lorcan, Noah, and me onto the platform. \u201cA family shot for your special honeymoon album. Stand together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Lottie\u2019s eyes are dark with anger as she turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say feebly. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. I thought\u2014 I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>My mouth feels dry. Words have deserted me. It\u2019s as though they can sense my guilt and have scampered away to the other side.</p><p>\u201cHello, Aunt Lottie!\u201d Noah is greeting her enthusiastically. \u201cWe came to see you on your holiday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enlisted Noah too, I see,\u201d Lottie spits out. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile, everybody!\u201d calls out the photographer. \u201cFace this way!\u201d</p><p>I have to get myself together. I have to apologize. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cOK, listen,\u201d I begin rapidly as the flash almost blinds me. \u201cI\u2019m so, so, so, so sorry. Lottie, I didn\u2019t mean to ruin your honeymoon. I only wanted to ... I don\u2019t know. Look after you. But I realize I\u2019ve got to stop. You\u2019re an adult and you have your own life and I made a huge, huge mistake, and I just hope you can forgive me. And you make a brilliant couple.\u201d I turn to Ben. \u201cHello, Ben, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Fliss, your sister-in-law.\u201d I lift a hand awkwardly. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll be meeting at lots of family Christmases or whatever....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis way!\u201d shouts the photographer, and we all obediently swing back.</p><p>\u201cSo you were behind everything?

I was in agony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d I gulp, almost crying. \u201cI don\u2019t know what got into me. I\u2019m so sorry. I just wanted to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always try to protect me! You\u2019re not my mother!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not.\u201d There\u2019s a sudden shake to my voice. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>I meet eyes with Lottie, and suddenly it\u2019s as though a silent, sisters-only set of memories is transmitting between us. Our mother. Our life. Why we are who we are. Then something shuts down in Lottie\u2019s eyes and it\u2019s over. Her face is closed up and unforgiving again.</p><p>\u201cAnd big smiles, everyone.\u201d The photographer waves his arms. \u201cLook this way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLotts, will you ever forgive me?\u201d I wait breathlessly for her answer. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, agonizing silence. I don\u2019t know which way this will swing. Lottie\u2019s eyes are unfocused, and I know better than to rush her.</p> <p>\u201cSmile! Nice wide smiles, everyone!\u201d the photographer keeps exhorting us. But I can\u2019t smile and neither can she. I\u2019m clenching my fingers, I realize. And my toes.</p><p>At long last Lottie turns her head to face me. Her expression is disdainful, but the hatred has lessened a tad. My towel is slipping and I take the opportunity to wrap it around me again. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, her eyes flicking over me. \u201cDid you actually go swimming in your underwear?\u201d</p><p>I give a little inward cheer. I want to hug her. In our code, that\u2019s forgiveness. I know I\u2019m not completely off the hook yet\u2014but at least there\u2019s hope.</p><p>\u201cBikinis are so over.\u201d I match her detached tone. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice panties.\u201d She gives a reluctant shrug.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderpants!\u201d shouts Noah. \u201cUnderpants! Hey, Aunt Lottie, I have a question,\u201d he adds chattily. \u201cHave you put the sausage in the cupcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lottie says, as though stung. \u201cDoes he mean\u2014\u201d She stares at me incredulously.</p><p>\u201cHave you put the sausage in the cupcake yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah! That\u2019s ... that\u2019s none of your business! Why shouldn\u2019t I have? Anyway, why are you asking me?\u201d She seems so flustered that I look at her, suddenly alert. The way she\u2019s behaving, it\u2019s almost as though\u2014almost as though ...</p><p>\u201cLotts?\u201d I say, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d she says frantically.</p><p>Oh my God. She\u2019s totally giving herself away.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d My mind is working overtime. They haven\u2019t had sex yet? Why not? Whyever not?</p> <p>\u201cStop talking about it!\u201d She seems near tears. \u201cJust butt out of my marriage! Butt out of my honeymoon! Butt out of everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie?\u201d I look at her more closely. Her eyes are wet and her lips are quivering. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m OK!\u201d She suddenly flips out. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be OK? I\u2019ve got the happiest marriage in the world! I\u2019m the luckiest girl in the world, and I\u2019m totally utterly, ecstatically\u2014\u201d She breaks off and rubs her eyes as though she can\u2019t believe her own vision.</p><p>I squint past her, trying to focus, and suddenly I see what she\u2019s staring at. It\u2019s a figure. A man. Coming over the beach toward us, with an unmistakable, heavy, sure-footed gait. Lottie has turned so pale, I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to faint\u2014and no wonder. I stare incredulously at the familiar figure, my mind scurrying with possibilities. He vowed he was going to stay away. So what on earth is he doing here?</p><p>32</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to have a heart attack. Or a panic attack. Or some other kind of attack. The blood is zooming from my head to my feet and back to my head as though it doesn\u2019t know what to do with itself. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t ... anything.</p><p>It\u2019s Richard. Here.</p><p>Not zillions of miles away, leading a completely new life in which he\u2019s forgotten I exist. But here, on Ikonos. Walking toward me over the beach. I blink at him rapidly, my eyelids almost in spasm; I\u2019m unable to speak. It makes no sense. He\u2019s in San Francisco. He\u2019s supposed to be in San Francisco.</p><p>Now he\u2019s making his way steadily through the audience. I\u2019m shaking all over as he draws near. The last time I saw him was in that restaurant, telling him I didn\u2019t accept his nonexistent proposal. That seems like a million years ago. How did he even know where I was? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance sharply at Fliss, but she looks as flabbergasted as I do.</p><p>And now he\u2019s in front of the stage and he\u2019s looking up at me with those dark eyes that I love, and I think I\u2019m going to lose it. I was just about holding it together, but now he goes and turns up\u2014</p><p>\u201cLottie,\u201d he says, and his voice is as deep and comforting as ever. \u201cI know you\u2019re ... m\u2014\u201d He seems to have difficulty saying the word. \u201cMarried. I know you\u2019re married. And I wish you every happiness with that.\u201d He pauses, breathing heavily. Around him, all the chatter has died away. The audience is watching us, riveted. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d His eyes flick to Ben, then away again, as though Ben is some loathsome creature he can\u2019t bear to look at.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I manage at last.</p> <p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t keep you. But I thought you should know something. You didn\u2019t start the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I peer at him, unable to process his words.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t start the fire,\u201d he repeats. \u201cIt was another girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2014 How\u2014\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cHow did you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss told me that you thought you\u2019d started the fire. I knew you\u2019d be devastated and I couldn\u2019t believe it was true. So I went to find out the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou went to the guest house?\u201d I say disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cI talked to your friend Arthur.\u201d Richard nods. \u201cI made him get out the original police reports. He let me spread them over his table and read through all of them. And it was quite clear. The fire didn\u2019t start in your room. It was above the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, my thoughts are so jumbled I can\u2019t reply. No one\u2019s even whispering. The only sound is that of the bunting flapping in the sea breeze.</p><p>\u201cYou went to the guest house?\u201d I repeat at last, falteringly. \u201cYou did all that? For me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Richard, as though it\u2019s obvious.</p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m married to someone else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Richard again.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Richard shoots me a disbelieving look as though to say, Do you really have to ask?</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cSorry,\u201d he adds to Ben.</p><p>33</p><p>FLISS</p><p>Of all the moments I\u2019ve experienced in life, this is the one I will remember forever. I\u2019m holding my breath. The whole place is silent. Lottie\u2019s staring at Richard, transfixed, her eyes huge. Her Happy Couple of the Week sash is glimmering in the lights, and her crown has slipped.</p><p>\u201cWell ... well ...\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem able to get the words out. \u201cWell, I still love you!\u201d She tears off her crown. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p>Richard visibly jolts with shock. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d He gestures at Ben.</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake!\u201d She\u2019s almost sobbing now. \u201cIt was all a mistake! And I was thinking about you all the time, but you\u2019d gone to San Francisco, but now here you are\u2014\u201d She suddenly turns to me, her face tearstained. \u201cFliss? Did you bring Richard here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... kind of,\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThen I love you too.\u201d She flings her arms around me. \u201cFliss, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lotts.\u201d Tears are welling up in my eyes now. \u201cI love you. I just want you to have the happiest, happiest life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She squeezes me tight, then turns and leaps off the stage, straight into Richard\u2019s arms and the tightest embrace I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cI thought you were gone forever!\u201d she says into his shoulder. \u201cI thought you were gone forever. I couldn\u2019t bear it! I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it either.\u201d He\u2019s looking warily at Ben. \u201cThe only thing is, you\u2019re married\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says miserably. \u201cI know. But I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p><p>My antennae are on full alert. This is my moment! I leap down off the stage and tap Lottie, hard.</p><p>\u201cLotts! Tell me. This is important.\u201d As she turns, I grip her by both shoulders. \u201cHave you\u2014\u201d I glance at Noah. \u201cHave you put the sausage in the muffin? Have you done it? Tell the truth! This is important!\u201d</p><p>34</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>What\u2019s the point in lying anymore?</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, almost defiantly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done it! We\u2019re complete frauds. We\u2019re not a happy couple; in fact, we\u2019re not even a couple! Here.\u201d I turn to Melissa, who has been watching avidly with all the others. \u201cHave my crown. Have the sash.\u201d I rip it off and grab the trophy from Ben. \u201cHave everything! We were telling lies the whole time.\u201d I press them all onto her, and she gazes back at me, her eyes narrowed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo the first date in the mortuary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cSex on the district attorney\u2019s desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal lie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d She turns to her husband triumphantly. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d She puts the silver crown on her head and holds the trophy aloft. \u201cThis belongs to us, I think.

I don\u2019t know why we ever split up. My ear is pressed against his chest, and I can hear the familiar, soothing thump of his heartbeat. This is where I want to be forever. I\u2019ve tuned out the rest of the world, although I\u2019m dimly aware of the others\u2019 voices.</p><p>\u201cYou can get an annulment,\u201d Fliss keeps saying. \u201cDo you see, Lottie? This is brilliant! You can get an annulment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s put the sausage in the cupcake,\u201d Lorcan keeps saying. \u201cCupcake.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>FLISS</p><p>Well, she was right about the sunsets. I\u2019ve never seen anything as spectacular as this in my life. The sun is slowly glowing down the sky, and it\u2019s not just sinking, it\u2019s shooting rays of pink and orange with such dramatic force, I\u2019m put in mind of one of Noah\u2019s superheroes. \u201cSunset\u201d sounds quite passive, quite nothing-y. This is more like sun-pow! Sun-take-that!</p><p>I look down at Noah\u2019s face, all rosy in the light, and I think again, He\u2019ll be OK. For the first time in ages, I don\u2019t feel angst or stress or anger. He\u2019ll be OK. He\u2019ll sort himself out. I\u2019ll sort myself out. It\u2019s all good.</p><p>We\u2019ve had an odd time. Kind of cathartic and uncomfortable, embarrassing and joyful, awkward and wonderful, all at the same time. Nico rustled us up a table at the beach-side restaurant, and all five of us sat around eating meze to make your taste buds sing with joy and slow-cooked lamb to make your insides whimper with ecstasy.</p><p>The food here really is good. Must make sure I big it up in my piece.</p><p>There were a lot of questions. There were a lot of stories. There was a lot of kissing.</p> <p>Lottie and I are ... OK. I think. There are still sore spots and rough patches between us, but there\u2019s also been a kind of revelation. We\u2019re on the way to a gradual understanding about who we are to each other, which maybe we\u2019ll look at properly later. (Or not bother and just charge on with life, probably more likely.)</p><p>Lorcan was the quiet star. He steered the conversation whenever it was threatening to become awkward, and he ordered fantastic wine, and he kept a kind of humorous knee-nudging thing going on with me, which I liked. I like him. I don\u2019t just fancy him, I like him.</p><p>As for Ben, he\u2019s disappeared. Which is understandable. Once it became plain that he\u2019d been publicly rejected for another man by his brand-new wife, he skedaddled. Can\u2019t blame him. I expect he\u2019s found solace at a bar somewhere.</p><p>Richard and Lottie have gone for a walk down the beach, and Noah is skimming stones at the water\u2019s edge, so it\u2019s just Lorcan and me, sitting on a low wall with our bare feet in the sand. The smell of cooking from the restaurant is mingled with the salty sea air and the faint aroma of his aftershave, which is bringing back all sorts of memories.</p><p>I don\u2019t just like him, I fancy him. Really quite a lot.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait. I got you something,\u201d he says suddenly.</p><p>\u201cYou got me something?\u201d I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much. I put it aside ... Hold on.\u201d He heads toward the restaurant and I watch him, intrigued. A few moments later he comes back, holding a plant in a pot. A little olive tree in a pot, to be precise.</p><p>\u201cFor your patio,\u201d he says, and I stare at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou bought that for me?\u201d I\u2019m so touched, tears spring to my eyes. I can\u2019t remember the last time someone bought something for me.</p><p>\u201cYou need something,\u201d he says gravely. \u201cYou need ... a start.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have put it better. I need a start. As I look up again, his eyes are so warm I feel something stumble inside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already gave me something.

The words resonate in my brain, round and round. And then I get to my feet. There\u2019s something I have to do, right now. I detach my memory stick from the chain around my neck and look at it. All my pain and anger toward Daniel seems to be contained in this one tiny piece of metal. It feels toxic. It\u2019s contaminating me. It has to go.</p><p>I head briskly to the shallows and put a hand on Noah\u2019s shoulder. As he looks up, I smile.</p> <p>\u201cHi, darling. I\u2019ve got something for you to skim.\u201d I hand him the memory stick.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d He looks up at me, his eyes wide with shock. \u201cThis is a computer thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nod. \u201cBut it\u2019s a computer thing I don\u2019t need anymore. Just throw it in the sea, Noah. As far as you can.\u201d</p><p>I watch as he takes aim and skims it. Three bounces and it\u2019s gone, into the Aegean Sea. Gone, gone, gone, really gone.</p><p>I walk slowly back up the beach to Lorcan, relishing the feel of my bare feet on the sand.</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d He reaches out and entwines his fingers in mine.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I\u2019m about to suggest a walk along the beach, when Ben\u2019s voice hits the back of my head.</p><p>\u201cLorcan. There you are. At bloody last.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even need to look to know that he\u2019s drunk, and I feel a squirm of sympathy. It can\u2019t be easy for him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ben,\u201d says Lorcan, getting to his feet. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met with Zhernakov today. On his yacht.\u201d Ben eyes both of us expectantly, as though waiting for a reaction. \u201cI met him on his yacht,\u201d he repeats. \u201cDrank some Krug, shot the breeze, you know....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Lorcan nods politely. \u201cSo you\u2019re selling after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Yes.\u201d Ben sounds aggressive. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame you couldn\u2019t have let me know that before I spent weeks on those refinancing and restructuring agreements. They\u2019re all a bit irrelevant now, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean ... yes.\u201d Ben seems confused. \u201cThing is ...\u201d His swagger dips a little. \u201cYuri and I made an agreement. A gentleman\u2019s agreement. But now ...\u201d He wipes his face. \u201cHe\u2019s already sent me an email I don\u2019t understand....\u201d He holds out his BlackBerry to Lorcan, who ignores it and gazes at Ben, his expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to sell,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThe company that your father built up over years and years. You\u2019re just letting it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Ben glares at him. \u201cYuri says nothing will change for the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will change?\u201d Lorcan bursts into laughter. \u201cAnd you bought that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s interested in developing new projects!\u201d says Ben hotly. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s a great little company!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think Yuri Zhernakov is interested in creating a new aspirational paper range for the middle-class consumer?\u201d Lorcan shakes his head. \u201cIf you believe that you\u2019re even more na\u00efve than I thought. He wants the house, Ben. Nothing else. I hope you got a good price out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure exactly ... I\u2019m not sure what we ...\u201d Ben wipes his face again, clearly beleaguered. \u201cYou need to look at it.\u201d He holds out his BlackBerry again, but Lorcan lifts his hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to do anything at this moment,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cMy office day is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve agreed to.\u201d All hint of bravado disappears from Ben\u2019s demeanor. \u201cHave a look, OK, Lorcan? Sort it out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence, and just for a moment I wonder whether Lorcan is going to capitulate. But at last he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cBen, I\u2019ve sorted out enough for you.\u201d He sounds weary and a little sad. \u201cI have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resigning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben looks absolutely staggered. \u201cBut ... you can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider this my notice. I\u2019ve been with you far too long already. Your father\u2019s gone and ... well, it\u2019s time for me to go too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... but you can\u2019t! You\u2019re really into the company!\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes are wide with panic. \u201cYou\u2019re into it more than me! You love it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. And that\u2019s the problem.\u201d There\u2019s a wryness to Lorcan\u2019s voice, and I reach out to squeeze his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll help you till my notice period is served out, then I\u2019m going. And it\u2019ll be for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will I do?\u201d Ben sounds genuinely freaked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take charge of the situation.\u201d Lorcan takes a step toward him. \u201cBen, you\u2019ve got a choice. You can sell the company to Yuri if you want to. Pocket the cash and have fun. But you know what else you could do? Take the reins. Take control. It\u2019s your company. It\u2019s your heritage. Make a go of it.\u201d</p><p>Ben seems poleaxed.</p> <p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d adds Lorcan. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be a pretty big challenge. You\u2019ll need to want to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a gentleman\u2019s agreement with Yuri.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes dart wildly about. \u201cOh Jesus. I don\u2019t know. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuri Zhernakov is no gentleman,\u201d says Lorcan sardonically. \u201cSo I think you\u2019re safe there.\u201d He sighs, ruffles his fingers through his hair, his face unreadable. \u201cLook, Ben. I have the restructuring agreements in my briefcase, and I\u2019ll take you through them tomorrow. I\u2019ll explain what all your options are, as I see it.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I\u2019m not telling you what to do. Sell, not sell, it\u2019s your choice. Yours.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes are fixed on Lorcan. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, apparently unable to speak. Then at last he turns on his heel and walks away, pocketing his BlackBerry as he goes.</p><p>\u201cWell done.\u201d I squeeze Lorcan\u2019s hand again as we sit back down on the wall. \u201cThat was courageous.\u201d Lorcan says nothing, just tilts his head.</p> <p>\u201cWill he make a go of it?\u201d I ask tentatively.</p><p>\u201cHe might.\u201d Lorcan exhales. \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t do it now, it\u2019s never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do when you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take up that job offer I had in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon?\u201d I say, brightening in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cOr Paris,\u201d he says teasingly. \u201cI\u2019m fluent in French.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cParis is crap,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuebec, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I hit him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s teasing tone disappears; he looks thoughtful. \u201cThat was my training. That was my career. And maybe I was knocked off course for a while. Maybe I did make the wrong choice.\u201d His eyes flicker toward mine, and I nod in acknowledgment. \u201cBut now it\u2019s time to get back on course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRev up the engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull steam ahead,\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cYou see life as a boat trip?\u201d I say, in mock incredulity. \u201cIt\u2019s a road trip. Everyone knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boat trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so a road trip.\u201d</p><p>We sit there for a while, watching as the sunset turns from orange and pink to mauve and indigo and streaks of vivid crimson. It really is a corker.</p><p>Presently, Lottie and Richard come sauntering along the beach, and they perch on the wall beside us. They look good together, I can\u2019t help thinking yet again. They just fit.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m out of a job,\u201d says Lorcan conversationally to Lottie, \u201cand it\u2019s all your sister\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d I exclaim at once. \u201cHow is it my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t made me look at my life with a fresh pair of eyes, I never would have resigned.\u201d His mouth twitches. \u201cYou have a lot to answer for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did you a favor,\u201d I retort.</p><p>\u201cStill your fault.\u201d His eyes twinkle.</p><p>\u201cWell ...\u201d I cast around. \u201cNo. I dispute that. It\u2019s actually Lottie\u2019s fault. If she hadn\u2019t run off and got married, I would never have met you and we never would have discussed the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lorcan nods. \u201cGood point. I blame you.\u201d He swivels to Lottie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d she retorts. \u201cIt\u2019s Ben\u2019s fault! That stupid marriage was all his idea. If he hadn\u2019t proposed, I would never have come out here, and you would never have met Fliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Ben\u2019s the villain of the piece?\u201d Lorcan raises a quizzical eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lottie and I say in unison.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d agrees Richard firmly.</p><p>The sky is a deep purple by now, mottled with midnight blue. The sun is a sliver of orange brightness at the horizon. I imagine it sliding down to another bit of the world, another bit of the sky, shining on other sets of Lotties and Flisses, with all their troubles and joys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say, and sit bolt upright at the realization. \u201cThe villain of the piece isn\u2019t Ben, it\u2019s Richard. If he\u2019d proposed to Lottie in the first place, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Richard, and rubs his nose. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a weird, silent little beat, in which I wonder wildly whether Richard will hurl himself onto one knee on the sand and do the business, but it passes, and no one says anything. Yet there\u2019s a strangeness in the air now; this is pretty awkward; I should never have mentioned it....</p><p>\u201cWell, I can do something about that.\u201d Lottie has a strange fire in her eyes. \u201cWait there. I need my bag.\u201d</p> <p>We all watch in puzzlement as she hurries back to the restaurant, heads straight to our table, and starts scrabbling in her handbag. What on earth is she up to?</p><p>And then suddenly I gasp. Oh God. I know. I want to hug myself with glee, with nerves, with anticipation. This could be amazing, this could be brilliant....</p><p>Do not fuck it up, Richard.</p><p>And now she\u2019s coming back toward us and her chin is up but trembling, and I can see exactly what she\u2019s going to do, and I am so, so, so glad I am here to see this.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. Lottie is walking slowly and deliberately up to Richard. She kneels down in front of him and holds out a ring.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite a nice ring, I see, to my relief. Quite manly.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d she says, and blows out sharply, as though with nerves. \u201cRichard ...\u201d</p><p>36</p><p>LOTTIE</p><p>Tears are in my eyes. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. It\u2019s what I should have done in the first place.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d I say for a third time. \u201cEven though I\u2019m currently married to someone else\u2014will you marry me?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a taut, still silence. The last sliver of light from the sun slips away into the sea, and, above us, tiny stars start to glimmer in the deep-blue sky.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Of course. Of course.\u201d Richard envelops me in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! It\u2019s what I want. Marriage. To you. Nothing else. I was an idiot before.\u201d He hits his own head. \u201cI was a fool. I was a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say gently. \u201cI know. So ... it\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a yes! Oh God.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a yes. I\u2019m not letting you get away again.\u201d He\u2019s holding my hand so tightly, I think he may break a bone.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Fliss throws her arms around me, while Lorcan pumps Richard\u2019s hand energetically. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged! For real this time! We need champagne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd an annulment,\u201d puts in Lorcan drily.</p> <p>I\u2019m engaged! To Richard! I feel light-headed with euphoria and shock at myself. I proposed? I proposed? Why didn\u2019t I do this before? It was easy!</p><p>\u201cGood work!\u201d says Lorcan, kissing me. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d Fliss is hugging herself. \u201cSo, so, so happy. It\u2019s exactly what I hoped for.\u201d She shakes her head disbelievingly. \u201cAfter all that.\u201d She reaches out and squeezes my hand.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that.\u201d I squeeze it back. A waiter is passing, and Fliss summons him over.</p><p>\u201cChampagne, please! We have an engagement to celebrate!\u201d</p><p>And now, as we all finally draw breath, there\u2019s a pause. Everyone\u2019s looking at the ring lying in my palm. Richard still hasn\u2019t taken it from me. Should I slide it onto his finger? Or just hand it over? Or ... what? What are you supposed to do with men\u2019s engagement rings?</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, about the ring,\u201d says Richard at last. I can tell he\u2019s trying to contort his face from \u201cdubious\u201d to \u201centhusiastic,\u201d but it\u2019s not working.</p><p>\u201cNice ring,\u201d observes Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d says Fliss encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Richard quickly. \u201cVery ... shiny. Very smart. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear it,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s not for wearing. You can keep it on your nightstand or whatever ... maybe keep it in a drawer ... or in a safe....\u201d</p><p>The look of relief on Richard\u2019s face is so palpable, I can\u2019t help laughing. As he hugs me tight again, I slip the ring into my pocket. We\u2019ll just quietly forget it.</p><p>I knew that ring was a mistake. </p> </body></html>"]
