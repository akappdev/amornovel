It was all downhill from there.</p> <p>Stephen had not been pleased when I\u2019d pushed him off of me, rolled out of bed, and yelled, \u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m going!\u201d at the image of a half-moon burning against my ceiling. I mean, I guess there are limits to what men are willing to put up with, and one\u2019s girlfriend interacting with invisible omens is a bit out of a perfectly nice investment broker\u2019s scope. He seemed to think I was huffing off after taking offense to that counterclockwise tickle he\u2019d improvised near the end.</p><p>Of course, telling him about the increasingly forceful hints I\u2019d received from my noncorporeal grandmother for the last two weeks would have made the situation worse. Stephen tended to clam up when we discussed my family and our \u201cnonsense.\u201d He refused to discuss Nana Fee or the promise I\u2019d made to her that I\u2019d travel all the way from our tiny village to the wilds of America. So I\u2019d tried ignoring the dreams, the omens, the way my alphabet soup spelled out \u201cHlfMunHollw.\u201d</p><p>I tried to rationalize that a deathbed promise to a woman who called herself a witch wasn\u2019t exactly a binding contract. But my grandma interrupting the big O to make her point was the final straw.</p><p>And so I was moving to Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky, indefinitely, so I could locate four magical objects that would prevent a giant witch-clan war and maintain peace in my little corner of northwestern Ireland.</p><p>Yes, I was aware that statement sounded absolutely ridiculous.</p> <p>Sometimes it paid to have a large, tech-savvy family at your disposal. When you tell them, \u201cI have a few days to rearrange my life so I can fly halfway across the world and secure the family\u2019s magical potency for the next generation,\u201d they hop to do whatever it takes to smooth the way. Aunt Penny had not only booked my airline tickets but also located and rented a house for me. Uncle Seamus had arranged quick shipping of the supplies and equipment I would need to my new address. And my beloved, and somewhat terrifying, teenage cousin Ralph may have broken a few international laws while online \u201carranging\u201d a temporary work visa so I wouldn\u2019t starve while I was there. Not everybody in our family could work magic, but each had his or her own particular brand of hocus-pocus.</p><p>Although my mother was an only child, my nana was one of nine. So I had great-aunts and uncles coming out of my ears, and their children were the right age to serve as proper aunts and uncles. I had more third and fourth cousins than I could count. Literally\u2014I tried once at Christmas, got dizzy, and had to sit down. They never treated me as if there were any sort of line dividing me from the rest of the McGavocks. So when my mother walked out and I was shipped off to my nana, it was as if the whole town was one very large, very loud family. When Aunt Penny permed my hair, to disastrous results, it was my schoolteacher who undid the damage in her kitchen sink. When my uncles were too traumatized by incidents that shall remain undisclosed to let me get behind the wheel of a car again, it was the postman, Tom Warren, who taught me to drive. They gave me a home I could depend on for the first time in my life. They gave me a family. They gave me back chunks of my childhood I\u2019d missed until then. I would do whatever it took to make sure they were healthy and protected.</p><p>Given how Stephen felt about my family, I\u2019d decided it was more prudent to tell him I\u2019d accepted an offer for a special nursing fellowship in Boston. The spot came open when another nurse left the program unexpectedly, I told him, so I had to make a quick decision. He argued that it was too sudden, that we had too many plans hanging in the balance for me to run off to the States for half a year, no matter how much I loved my job.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to leave Stephen. For months, he had been a bright spot in a life desperately needing sunshine, with the loss of Nana and my struggles to keep the family buoyed. And yet, somehow, here I was, sprawled in the back of a run-down cab as it bumped down a sunlit gravel road in Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky. The term \u201ccab\u201d could be applied only loosely to the faded blue Ford station wagon\u2014the only working taxi in the entire town, the driver informed me proudly. We had a fleet of two working in Kilcairy, and we had only about four hundred people living inside the town limits. Clearly, living in Boston until my early teens hadn\u2019t prepared me for life in the semirural South.</p><p>Yawning loudly, I decided to worry about cultural adjustments later. I was down-to-the-bone tired. My skirt and blouse were a grubby shambles. I smelled like airplane sweats and the manky Asian candy my seatmate insisted on munching for most of the flight from Dublin to New York. It took an additional two-hour hop to Chicago and another hour ride on a tiny baby plane-let before I finally arrived in the Hollow. I just wanted to go inside, take a shower, and sleep. While I was prepared to sleep on the floor if necessary, I prayed the house was indeed furnished as Aunt Penny had promised.</p><p>While the McGavock clan had collectively bankrolled my flight, I needed to save the extra cash they\u2019d provided as \u201cbuy money\u201d for my targets. Living expenses were left to me to figure out. I would have to start looking for some acceptable part-time work as soon as my brain was functional again. I squinted against the golden spring afternoon light pouring through the cab windows, interrupted only by the occasional patch of shade from tree branches arching over the little lane. The sky was so clear and crystal blue that it almost hurt to look out at the odd little clusters of houses along the road. It was so tempting just to lay my head back, close my eyes, and let the warm sunshine beat hot and red through my eyelids.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re rentin\u2019 half of the old Wainwright place?\u201d the cabdriver, Dwayne-Lee, asked as he pulled a sharp turn onto yet another gravel road. I started awake just in time to keep my face from colliding with the spotty cab window. Dwayne-Lee continued on, blithe as a newborn babe, completely oblivious. \u201cThat place always creeped me out when I was a kid. We used to dare each other to run up to the front door and ring the bell.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow at his reflection in the rearview. \u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cNo one lived there.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath and tried to find the patience not to snap at the man. Dwayne-Lee had, after all, been nice enough to make a special trip to the Half-Moon Hollow Municipal Airport to pick me up. Dwayne-Lee had been sent by Iris Scanlon, who handled various business dealings for my new landlord. Dwayne-Lee\u2019s skinny frame was puffed up with pride at being tasked with welcoming a \u201cnewcomer\u201d as he\u2019d handed me an envelope from Iris containing a key to my new house, a copy of my lease, her phone number, and a gift certificate for a free pizza delivered by Pete\u2019s Pies.</p><p>Anyone who tried to make my life easier was aces in my book. So from that moment on, I was a little in love with Iris Scanlon. Less so with Dwayne-Lee, who was currently nattering on about the Wainwright place and its conversion to a rental duplex after Gilbert Wainwright had moved closer to town years before. I closed my eyes against the sunlight, and the next thing I knew, the cab was pulling to a stop.</p><p>Wiping furiously at the wet drool on my chin, I opened my door while Dwayne-Lee unloaded my luggage from the trunk. Separated from the other houses on the street by a thicket of dense trees, the rambling old Victorian was painted a faded robin\u2019s-egg blue with sun-bleached white trim. The house was two stories, with a turret off to the left and a small central garden separating the two front doors. Given that the opposite side of the front porch seemed occupied with lawn chairs and a disheveled garden gnome, I assumed that the \u201ctower side\u201d of the house was mine. I grinned, despite my bone-aching fatigue. I\u2019d always been fascinated by the idea of having a tower as a kid, although I\u2019d long since cut my hair from climbing length.</p><p>The grass grew scrabbled in patches across the lawn. A section of brick had fallen loose from the foundation on the west corner. Knowing my luck, there was a colony of bats living in the attic, to complete that Addams Family look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have bats in my belfry.\u201d I giggled, scrubbing at my tired eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou feelin\u2019 all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d Dwayne-Lee asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I said, blinking blearily at him. \u201cOh, sorry, just a little out of sorts.\u201d</p><p>I pulled a wad of cash from my pocket and handed him enough for my fare and a generous tip.</p><p>Dwayne-Lee cleared his throat. \u201cUm, ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t take Monopoly money.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the bills in my hand. I was trying to pay Dwayne-Lee in euros. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>With Dwayne-Lee compensated in locally legal tender, I took my key out of Iris\u2019s envelope, unlocked the door, and hauled my stuff inside. My half of the old Wainwright place consisted of two bedrooms and a bath upstairs, plus a parlor and a kitchen downstairs. It was a bit shocking to have this much room to myself. I was used to living in Nana Fee\u2019s tiny cottage, where I still whacked my elbows on the corner of the kitchen counter if I wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>The house appeared to have been decorated by a fussy old lady fond of dark floral wallpaper and feathered wall sconces. The house was old, but someone had paid some attention to its upkeep recently. The hardwood floors gleamed amber in the afternoon light. The stairs were recently refurbished and didn\u2019t creak once while I climbed them. The turret room turned out to be a little sitting area off my bedroom, lined with bookshelves. I ran my fingers along the dusty shelves. I loved a good book. If I stayed long enough, I could put a little reading chair there . . . if I had a reading chair. I\u2019d need to do something about getting some more furniture.</p><p>Despite Aunt Penny\u2019s assurances, the rooms were furnished in only the meanest sense. There were a table and chairs in the kitchen, a beaten sofa in the parlor, plus a dresser and a bare mattress in the front bedroom. Sighing deeply and promising myself I wouldn\u2019t mention this to my aunt, I drew the travel sack\u2014a thin, portable sleeping bag for people phobic about touching hotel sheets\u2014over the bare mattress. The travel sack was a Christmas gift from Stephen. I smiled at the thought of my dear, slightly anal-retentive boyfriend and resolved to call him as soon as it was a decent hour overseas.</p><p>I found blankets in the bottom drawer of the dresser. I wasn\u2019t too keen on using them as covers, given their musty state, but they would make a good shade for the window so the sun wouldn\u2019t keep me awake. I boosted myself against the dresser to hang one . . . only to observe that some sort of Greek statue had come to life in my back garden.</p><p>He was built like a boxer, barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, with narrow hips encased in ripped jeans. Thick sandy hair fell forward over his face while he worked. His sculpted chest was bare, golden, and apparently quite sweaty, given the way it glistened while he planted paving stones near a pristine concrete patio.</p><p>I wavered slightly and grabbed the window frame, my weakening knees caused by more than jet lag. Was this my next-door neighbor? I wasn\u2019t sure if I was comfortable living with a he-man who could lift giant stones as if they were dominoes. And when had it gotten so bloody hot in here? I hadn\u2019t noticed that I was warm in the cab . . . Oh, wait, it was time for the he-man to take a water break. He took a few long pulls off a bottle from his cooler and dumped the rest over his head.</p><p>My jaw dropped, nearly knocking against my chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>Just then, he looked up and spotted me ogling him from above. Our eyes connected . . .</p><p>And he winked at me like some Lothario gardener out of a particularly dirty soap opera! I spluttered indignant nonsense before tucking the blanket over the window with a decisive shove.</p><p>I pressed my hands over my eyes, trying to coax some moisture around my dry, tacky contact lenses. I didn\u2019t have the mental reserves for this. I needed to sleep, eat, and bathe, most likely in that order. I would deal with the man reenacting scenes from A Streetcar Named Desire in my back garden at a later date. My shoulders tense and heavy, I crawled onto the mattress, bundled my shirt under my head, and plummeted into sweet unconsciousness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I woke up bleary and disoriented, unable to figure out where the hell I was. Why was it so dark? Was I too late? Were they here already? Where was my family? Why couldn\u2019t I hear anyone talking? I lurched up from the mattress and snagged the blanket from the window, letting in the weak twilight.</p><p>As soon as I saw the paving stones, I remembered the flight, the mad taxi ride, and the Adonis in the back garden.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I sighed, scrubbing my hand over my face. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>I stumbled into the bathroom and splashed cool water on my face. The grimy mirror reflected seven kinds of hell. My face was pale and drawn. My thick coffee-colored hair was styled somewhere near \u201ccrazy cat lady,\u201d and my normally bright, deep-set brown eyes were marked with dark smudges that weren\u2019t entirely composed of mascara. I had my grandfather\u2019s features, straight lines, delicate bones, and a particularly full bottom lip. Of course, that meant I looked like my mother, too, which was not something I liked to dwell on. I swiped my hand across the fly-specked glass, smearing the haggard image.</p><p>I stripped out of my clothes, standing under the lukewarm spray and letting it wash away the grime. The heavy claw-footed tub actually wobbled a little when I moved, and I worried that it was going to fall through the floor. Long after the water cooled, I climbed out of the tub, only to remember that I hadn\u2019t thought to bring any towels into the bathroom with me. Aunt Penny had stuffed a few into my suitcase because she knew the house wouldn\u2019t have them. But my suitcase was downstairs, next to the door. And I was stark naked.</p><p>\u201cMoron.\u201d I cursed myself as I made a shivering dash across the bedroom to retrieve my jacket. I took the stairs carefully\u2014because I wasn\u2019t about to die in a household accident wearing only an outdated rain jacket\u2014and carefully avoided windows as I made my way to my luggage. The towels, somehow, still smelled line-fresh, like the lavender and rosemary in Nana Fee\u2019s back garden. I pressed one to my face before wrapping it around myself toga-style.</p><p>I mentally blessed Penny for packing some ginger tea in my bag, which was good for postflight stomachs. I retrieved the tea bags and cast a longing glance at the kitchen. Did the \u201cfurnished\u201d bit include dishes and cups? I could function\u2014I might even be able to dress myself properly\u2014if I just had some decent tea in me. Even if it meant boiling the water in a microwave.</p><p>I shuddered. Blasphemy.</p> <p>If I set the water to boil now, it would be ready by the time I picked out clothes. Multitasking would be the key to surviving here. There would be no loving aunties to make my afternoon tea, no uncles to pop into town if I needed something. I was alone here with my thoughts, for the first time in a long time. And considering my thoughts of late, that could be a dangerous thing.</p><p>\u201cStaring into space isn\u2019t going to brew the tea,\u201d I chided myself. Securing my towel, I made my way to the stove, careful to avoid the windows. I didn\u2019t know if my neighbor was doing his sweaty work out in the yard, and I didn\u2019t fancy being winked at while wearing this getup.</p><p>After setting the tea bags on the counter, I began rummaging through the cupboards, finding dirty, abandoned cookware but no kettle. I sighed and thunked my head against the cupboard. I just wanted some tea. Just a little tea, and I\u2019d be right as rain . . . as right as rain could be.</p><p>I was starting to sound like one of the less sane characters in Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>I could take the risk of heating it by less conventional means. Honestly, I\u2019d been on a plane for hours. It had been days since I\u2019d used any proper magic\u2014or improper magic, for that matter. Maybe the hiatus and the change in environment would help with my little . . . problem. Maybe, for the first time in months, I would have a handle on it.</p><p>I took a deep, cleansing breath and filled a ceramic mug with tap water. After glancing around, as if some random stranger might be pressing his face to the window to catch me using illicit, magical tea-brewing techniques, I wrapped my fingers around the mug and imagined energy flowing from my hands, into the ceramic, into the water. I closed my eyes and pictured heat growing between my hands into a glowing ball of energy that slipped between all of the tiny molecules in the water and got them moving, got them hot, got them boiling. I pictured how good it would feel to get dressed, put my feet up, and have a nice cuppa. I felt the smooth material grow hot beneath my fingertips and the steam rising from the cup, curling around my face. But too quickly, the pleasant, soothing heat turned volcanic. I hissed, yanking my hands away from the burning-hot mug, watching with resigned frustration as it cracked down the middle and spilled boiled water all over the counter.</p> <p>Dodging out of range, I scrubbed a hand over my face in defeat. Clearly, my self-imposed ban on nonessential magic was for my own good, in addition to that of the general populace.</p><p>I tossed the remains of the destroyed cup into the sink and tried to mop up the water with the corner of my towel. I grabbed another mug, opened the top cupboard nearest the refrigerator, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cACCCK!\u201d I shrieked at the sight of beady black eyes glaring out at me from the cupboard shelf. The furry gray creature\u2019s mouth opened, revealing rows of sharp white fangs. It swiped its paws at me, claws spread, and hissed like a brassed-off cobra.</p><p>I let loose a bloodcurdling scream and ran stumbling out of the kitchen, through a screen door, and into the moonless purple light of early evening. With my eyes trained behind me to make sure it, whatever it was, didn\u2019t follow me, I slammed into a solid, warm object. The force of my momentum had me wrapping my arms and legs around it as I struggled away from the fanged menace.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d the object huffed.</p><p>The object was a person. To be specific, the shirtless, sweaty person who\u2019d been standing in my back garden earlier. Dropping a couple of yard tools with a clank, he caught my weight with his hands, stumbling under the impact of struggling, panicked woman. Certainly as surprised to find me in his arms as I was to be there.</p><p>Slashing dark eyebrows shot skyward. The full lips parted to offer, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Oh, saints and angels, I was doomed. He was even better-looking up close. Tawny, whiskey-colored eyes. A classic straight nose with a clear break on the bridge. Wide, generous lips currently curved into a naughty, tilted line as he stared up at me.</p> <p>Completely. Doomed.</p><p>Focus, I told myself. There\u2019s a mutant rodent in your cupboard, waiting to devour your very soul, then terrorize the townsfolk.</p><p>\u201cIn my kitchen!\u201d I shouted in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The man seemed puzzled, and not just by the fact that I seemed to be wrapped around him like some sort of cracked-up spider monkey.</p><p>\u201cIn. My. KITCHEN!\u201d I yelled, scrabbling to keep my grip on his shoulders while leaning back far enough to make eye contact. Despite my all-out terror, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the smooth, warm skin or the tingles traveling down my arms, straight to my heart. He smelled . . . wild. Of leather and hay and deep, green pockets of forest. As my weight shifted backward, his large, warm hands slid around my bottom, cupping my cheeks to keep me balanced against him. \u201cTh-there\u2019s a creature!\u201d I cried. \u201cIn my kitchen! Some demon rat sent from hell! It tried to bite my face off!\u201d</p><p>The fact that his hand was ever so subtly squeezing my unclothed ass managed to subdue my mind-numbing terror and replace it with indignant irritation. I didn\u2019t know this man. I certainly hadn\u2019t invited him to grope me, spider-monkey climbing or no. And I had a perfectly lovely boyfriend waiting for me at home, who would not appreciate some workman\u2019s callused hands on my ass.</p><p>\u201cYou can move your hand now,\u201d I told him, trying to dismount gracefully, but his hands remained cupped under my left cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, you tackled me!\u201d he protested in a smoky, deeply accented tenor.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cMove your hand, or I\u2019ll mail it back to you by a very slow post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighed, gently lowering me to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s get a look at this creature in your kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Struggling to keep my towel in place, I led him into my kitchen and tentatively pointed toward the home of the Rodent of Unusual Size. I could hear the beast hissing and growling inside, batting at the closed door with its claws. I was surprised it hadn\u2019t managed to eat its way through yet. But somehow my would-be rescuer seemed far more interested in looking around, noting the pile of luggage by the door.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had much time to unpack yet, huh?\u201d he asked. I glared at him. He shrugged. \u201cFine, fine, critter crisis. I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>He opened the cupboard door, let out a horrified gasp, and slammed it shut. He grabbed a grimy old spatula I\u2019d left on the counter during my rummaging and slid it through the cupboard handles, trapping the monster inside. He turned on me, his face grave while his amber eyes twinkled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to have to call in the big guns.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared out the door on quick, quiet feet. I stared after him, wondering if I\u2019d just invited help from a complete lunatic, when the early-evening breeze filtering in through the back door reminded me that I was standing there in just a towel. I scrambled over to my suitcase and threw on a loose peasant skirt and a blue tank top. I wondered what he meant by \u201cbig guns.\u201d Was he calling the police? The National Guard? MI5?</p><p>I was slipping on a pair of knickers under my skirt just as my bare-chested hero came bounding back into the kitchen with a large, lidded pot and a spoon.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cook it?\u201d I gasped, ignoring the bald-faced grin he gave my lower quadrants as the floaty blue skirt fell back into place.</p><p>\u201cWell, my uncle Ray favors a good roast possum. He says it tastes like chicken,\u201d he drawled, holding the lid over his thick forearm like a shield as he tapped the spatula out of place. \u201cPersonally, I have to wonder if he\u2019s eaten chicken that tastes like ass, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201d</p><p>I darted away as he opened the cupboard door. A feral growl echoed through the empty house as he maneuvered the pot over the front of the cupboard. He used the wooden spoon to reach over the grumpy animal and nudge the possum into the pot. Slapping the lid over it, he turned and gave me a proud grin.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cReally, I don\u2019t know what I would have done\u2014\u201d</p><p>The giant rat began thrashing around inside the pot and making the lid dance.</p><p>\u201cI want that thing tested for steroids!\u201d I yelped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a baby,\u201d he said, placing one of his ham-sized hands on the lid. \u201cThese things burrow in pretty much wherever they want to, doors and walls be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a baby?\u201d I peered down at the dancing pot. \u201cHow big do the mothers get?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBetter question: where is his mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I groaned as he opened the back door, crossed the yard, and gently shook the possum out of the pot and into the tall grass near the trees. I called after him, \u201cWhy did you have to say that? I have to sleep here!\u201d</p><p>Climbing my back steps, he looked far more relaxed than he should have been after evicting a vicious furred fiend from my kitchen. Shirtless. \u201cI have to sleep here, too. And if it makes you feel better, there\u2019s a good chance that the mama could be sleepin\u2019 under my side of the house,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m Jed, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I giggled, a hysterical edge glinting under the laughter, as he extended his hand toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>He arched a sleek sandy eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, barely concealing a giggle. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never met a Jed before.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019d imagine not, with that accent and all.\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to raise the bitch-brow, a super-extension of the eyebrow combined with one\u2019s best frosty expression. He of the sultry backwoods drawl was mocking my accent? That was disappointing. Since landing in New York, I\u2019d worked hard to control whatever lilt I\u2019d picked up in the fifteen years I\u2019d lived with Nana Fee. It wouldn\u2019t do for the locals to know where I was from. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour accent,\u201d he said, his forehead creasing. \u201cBoston, right? \u2018Pahk the cah in the yahd\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I blushed a little and regretted the bitch-brow. I\u2019d forgotten how muddled my manner of speaking was, compared with my new neighbor\u2019s Southern twang. My accent was vaguely Boston, vaguely Irish. Nana Fee had tried to correct my lack of Rs in general and attempted to teach me Gaelic, but the most I picked up were some of the more interesting expressions my aunts and uncles used. Mostly the dirty ones. So I spoke in a bizarre mishmash of dialects and colloquialisms, which led to awkward conversations over what to call chips, elevators, and bathrooms.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said, laughing lightly. \u201cBoston\u2014born and raised.\u201d</p> <p>Technically, it wasn\u2019t a lie.</p><p>Jed looked at me expectantly. I looked down to make sure I hadn\u2019t forgotten some important article of clothing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me your name, I\u2019m just gonna make one up,\u201d he said, leaning against the counter. \u201cAnd fair warnin\u2019, you look like a Judith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHalf-dressed girls who climb me like a tree are usually named Judith,\u201d he told me solemnly.</p><p>\u201cThis happens to you often?\u201d I deadpanned.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nola,\u201d I told him. \u201cNola Leary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJed Trudeau,\u201d he said, shaking my outstretched hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me sayin\u2019, you look beat. Must\u2019ve been a long flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019ll just go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>There was a spark of mischief in his eyes, but I think he picked up on the fact that I was in no mood for saucy talk. His full lips twitched, but he clamped them together. He held up one large, work-roughened hand. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared out the back door, and I could hear his boot steps on the other side of my kitchen wall. He returned a few moments later, having donned a light cotton work shirt, still unbuttoned. He placed a large, cold, foil-wrapped package in my hands. \u201cChicken and rice casserole. One of the ladies down at the Baptist church made it for me. Well, several of the church ladies made casseroles for me, so I have more than I can eat. Just pop a plateful in the microwave for three minutes.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at the dish for a long while before he took it out of my hands and placed it in my icebox. \u201cDo local church ladies often cater your meals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go to Sunday services, so they\u2019re very concerned about my soul. I can\u2019t cook to save my life. They\u2019re afraid I\u2019m just wasting away to nothing,\u201d he said, shaking his head in shame, but there was that glint of trouble in his eyes again. He gave me a long, speculative look. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get back to sleep. Welcome to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as he moved toward the door. I locked it behind him, then turned and sagged against the dusty sheers covering the window in the door. \u201cIf there are any greater powers up there\u2014stop laughing.\u201d</p><p>I massaged my temples and set about making my tea. Jed seemed nice, if unfortunately named. And it was very kind of him to give a complete stranger a meal when he knew she had nothing but angry forest creatures in her cupboards. But I couldn\u2019t afford this sort of distraction. I\u2019d come to the Hollow for a purpose, not for friendships and flirtations with smoldering, half-dressed neighbors.</p><p>Just as I managed to locate a chipped mug in the spice drawer, a loud, angry screech sounded from somewhere to the left of my stove. I turned and fumbled with the locked kitchen door, yelling, \u201cJed!\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Love affairs between the human and the nonhuman rarely end well for the human.</p><p>\u2014Love Spells: A Witch\u2019s Guide to Maintaining Healthy Relationships</p> <p>By the time Jed had reunited the mama possum and her young, I determined I was far too awake to go to bed. I went through the house making lists of everything I would need to survive here, things such as food, sheets, towels, and mousetraps. Big ones.</p><p>I needed to go shopping, but I didn\u2019t have a car, and I thought it would be pushing already-fragile \u201cgood neighbor\u201d impressions by asking to borrow Jed\u2019s. And now that I was able to recall more clearly moments from Dwayne-Lee\u2019s drive to the house, I wasn\u2019t about to take the cab service. Iris Scanlon proved that my love for her was not in vain. All it took was one phone call for her to send \u201cmore discreet transport\u201d right to my doorstep.</p><p>Miranda Puckett was a slender thing, with long dark hair and keen green eyes. What she lacked in size she made up for with the obscenely large black SUV she maneuvered from my driveway to the gravel road with considerably fewer bumps than Dwayne-Lee. Aside from knowing where the all-night grocers were, Miranda was also a veritable font of information about the locals. She\u2019d grown up in the Hollow and was happy to share what she knew of local history and gossip.</p><p>For instance, Miranda\u2019s boss was not a freelance miracle worker but ran a concierge service for vampires called Beeline. The special arrangements Iris had been making for me were on behalf of my landlord, a vampire named\u2014of all things\u2014Dick Cheney. Miranda admitted to having a \u201csoft spot\u201d for Dick since he\u2019d served as her knight in shining armor months earlier when she\u2019d had car trouble.</p><p>\u201cHe comes off like this sketchy con artist, but underneath it all, he\u2019s a marshmallow,\u201d she told me, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. \u201cTotally devoted to his wife, which is a good thing. Otherwise, Collin would really frown on all those book club meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBook club?\u201d I asked, my brow furrowed. But Miranda had pulled into the car park of the local twenty-four-hour Walmart Supercenter, so I couldn\u2019t question why a vampire and a chauffeur would join the same book club. Or who the bloody hell Collin was.</p><p>The Hollow, Miranda informed me as we shopped, had become quite the vampire-friendly place since the vampires had emerged from the shadows in 1999. That was the year a Milwaukee-based vampire named Arnie Frink demanded that his employers change his work hours to lessen his chances of bursting into flames. But seeing as they were as blind as the rest of the world when it came to the existence of vampires, the human resources department insisted that Arnie keep bankers\u2019 hours. Arnie\u2019s counterproposal was a massive lawsuit, claiming that he suffered from porphyria, a painful allergy to sunlight, and the company was not accommodating him. When the allergy discrimination argument failed to impress a judge, Arnie had a hissy in open court and declared that he was a vampire, a medical condition that rendered him unable to work during the day, thereby making him subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p><p>Although Arnie won his case, the first year or so afterward was a dark time indeed. For the Irish, who had always kept folk tales close to their hearts, it was no surprise to hear that one of many beasties they\u2019d been warned against was an actuality. For the McGavocks, it was even less so. We knew witches were real, so why not vampires, werewolves, and any number of fairy folk we knew to be dancing in the hedgerows? Still, it was a shock to watch the scenes of destruction play out on TV. Here in America and across Europe, mobs of people forced vampires out into the sunlight or set about hunting them for no reason other than that they existed. More often than not, the hunters were injured in the process.</p><p>Once they had quelled their fury at being launched from the coffin, an elected contingent of ancient vampires officially notified the United Nations of their presence and asked the world\u2019s governments to recognize them as legitimate beings. The World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead also asked for special leniency in certain medical, legal, and tax issues that were sure to come up. Oh, and for humans to stop dragging them from their homes and turning them into kindling . . . or else.</p><p>And so humans had to adjust . . . or else. For a small town, the Hollow had adjusted rather admirably. The local Council office had taken every step to ingratiate itself with the local human population, all the while doing the sneaky, slightly underhanded errands necessary to monitor and govern its undead citizens. A local woman had even opened the town\u2019s first vampire-oriented restaurant recently, after winning a cooking contest sponsored by a synthetic-blood company.</p><p>Knowing that the town was paranormally liberal did not prepare me for the grocers. While I found everything on my list, the products and the packaging seemed garish and bright under the sickly green fluorescents. The sheer amount of nacho-flavored food available on each aisle was staggering. And there was the spectacle of the other shoppers\u2014some without shirts and others trying to pass off other clothing as shirts. Honestly, who leaves the house wearing an athletic bra and a pair of bicycle pants?</p><p>Somehow, through this whole excursion, Miranda managed to keep up a steady stream of chatter. She talked like my uncle Jack after a few pints. Words spilled from her lips at such a clip that one wouldn\u2019t dare try to ask questions\u2014all this despite the distinct throbbing pain radiating from her left side. She was working hard to disguise the hitch in her gait by using the shopping cart handle for support, but the ache was obvious to someone with certain sensitivities, such as myself. So I worked around her, discreetly trying to keep her from having to lift or bend.</p><p>By the time I picked up all my essentials\u2014specifically, a teapot, some passable Earl Grey, and some industrial-sized pest traps\u2014I was a bit dizzy, both from the strain of Miranda\u2019s discomfort and the information she had shared. And then there was the small matter of Miranda\u2019s knocking a bottle of dish liquid off a shelf as I was bent over the cart, rendering me temporarily senseless. Given the way she managed to pick up the conversation after she picked me up from the floor, I suspected this sort of thing happened to her frequently.</p><p>\u201cWell, this took less time than I expected,\u201d I marveled as she unlocked the car. When a grimacing Miranda lifted a bag of groceries from the carriage to load into the back of the SUV, I gently took over the task.</p><p>\u201cGod bless the cultural amalgam that is the superstore,\u201d Miranda said, keeping a hand pressed tightly to her side. \u201cSome might object, but personally, I like being able to buy my underwear and antifreeze in the same place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to talk about your ribs, or are you going to continue \u2018playing through the pain\u2019?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Miranda blushed. \u201cThat obvious, is it? I thought I was doing a better job of covering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you were the soul of discretion,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit sensitive to these things.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, wincing as her stomach muscles tightened. \u201cI guess you would be, being a nurse and all.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling blithely. Now was definitely not the time to try to squeeze \u201cI have an extrasensory perception that allows me to feel your pain\u201d into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to take a look?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I chuckled, stepping closer. \u201cWant to tell me how this happened? And why you haven\u2019t been to see a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and no,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>I held my hands over Miranda\u2019s shoulders. While the pain throbbed steadily with every breath, her lungs felt clear. There was no puncture there, but her ribs were thoroughly bruised. It felt like some sort of side impact, as if she\u2019d been thrown into a corner or a piece of furniture.</p><p>\u201cMiranda, did someone hurt you?\u201d I asked, feeling a sudden urge to find this \u201cCollin\u201d and introduce him to an old-fashioned Kilcairy arse-whipping.</p><p>Miranda closed her eyes, her face flushing red. \u201cNo,\u201d she groaned, clapping a hand over her face. \u201cAs usual, I have no one to blame but myself. Let\u2019s just say that when one is having athletic makeup sex with her vampire boyfriend, she should hold on for dear life. Particularly when there is a pointy nightstand nearby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you telling me you fell off your undead boyfriend while having sex and landed against a nightstand, bruising your ribs?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI blew the dismount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want the details of his dismount,\u201d I said, laughing. I held my hand against her ribs as she snickered in response. The bones felt sound. It would be a simple enough thing to heal, but I needed to stay under the radar. So I gave her my best serious, professional expression and told her, \u201cIce and ibuprofen. Deep-breathing exercises and gentle stretching if you feel up to it. Just take it easy. If the pain gets worse or it becomes difficult to breathe, go to your doctor right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said, breathing a sigh of relief as we climbed into the car. \u201cI was really afraid I\u2019d done myself permanent damage this time. What do I owe you for the consult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Collin to be more careful with his breakable girlfriend,\u201d I told her as she blushed crimson again. \u201cYou shameless sex maniac.\u201d</p><p>As Miranda started the car and backed out of the car park, I waited for her to relaunch her verbal barrage. But in her embarrassment, she seemed to be concentrating on maneuvering the car safely, so I took advantage of the silence. I breathed deeply, trying to center my thoughts and regain the energy it had taken to check Miranda\u2019s ribs.</p><p>Being a medical empath was not an easy gift. Often, when I came across people with medical problems, I felt a \u201ctug\u201d of pressure in my own body reflecting the area of their body where they were ailing. And I came across a lot of people with medical problems. And sometimes, if I did nothing to heal them, or at least talk to them about how to improve their problem, the pressure would get worse, and I would get sick myself.</p><p>My gift was the reason I couldn\u2019t practice in a large hospital setting. The discomfort and \u201ctugging\u201d were so draining that I would keel over by the end of the day. It was easy to spend time with Stephen because he was a health nut who rarely came down with so much as a cold.</p> <p>Being a hereditary witch is like inheriting frizzy hair or an unfortunate nose. I had no choice in the matter. For my family, witchcraft wasn\u2019t quite a religion. It simply was. It was part of our lives, the way we saw and interacted with the world. I couldn\u2019t turn it off, no matter how I tried. Believe me, I tried. I couldn\u2019t always control it. And there was nothing I could do, take, or try to make my ability easier to use. Sometimes it was particularly embarrassing, trying to broach the topic of sensitive medical problems with people who didn\u2019t want to discuss such things with complete strangers. But Miranda seemed happy with the outcome of our conversation, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d heard a story more embarrassing than hers.</p><p>In some cases, it would have been easier to use magic to heal my patients. But I\u2019d learned that illness had a purpose. Bodies have to go through the pain to get to the good part, the healing. It\u2019s the payment portion of the process and shouldn\u2019t be skipped over.</p><p>My relationship with magic was complicated. At one time, I had been Nana Fee\u2019s prize student. Like most witches, I had a smattering of talent in most magical areas but excelled in a particular skill. In my case, I was a gifted healer. My instruction started at a later age than that of most of my cousins, but I had taken to it like a duck to water. The problem was that I had a little too much \u201coomph,\u201d an erratic excess energy. When I tried a simple exercise intended to restore a withered mint plant to its former glory, I overdid it on the roots, which grew so spectacularly that they burst the pot and peppered the walls with shattered clay and potting soil. And then there were the fires. After that, I limited myself to harmless glamours and spells that made everyday life a little easier. I was too timid to try advanced spells, because I could pose a threat to myself or others.</p><p>I tended to limit friendships to members of my family or the village, because I could never quite trust outsiders with \u201ceverything.\u201d Either they\u2019d think I was bonkers and drop me, or they\u2019d want to use me to their own ends\u2014quick fixes to money problems or love spells, which frankly never worked the way people hoped. I lost more boyfriends than I cared to admit over the years, because my abilities drove them away. If I lost my temper, things tended to explode. And then there was the boyfriend who was stupid enough to contract an infection when he cheated and then got indignant at me for \u201cspying\u201d on him using my empathy. Not to mention that shared psychic itching was just disgusting. Even the men who had no problem with my family\u2019s history became suspicious of whether I was using spells on them. Were their feelings for me real, they wondered, or the result of a potion? Eventually, they got tired of wondering and left.</p><p>Magic always muddied the waters. There was only so much \u201cweird\u201d that men could take, even the ones who claimed to be open-minded. And so when I\u2019d met Stephen months before, and he turned out to be someone I thought could be \u201cthe one,\u201d I\u2019d decided against using magic anywhere near him. I saw Stephen as my chance at a seminormal life. He was a straight, single, employed, functional adult who was also sweet, considerate, smart, and funny. He had treated me with nothing but kindness since meeting me at a nursing conference in Dublin the previous year. (His brokerage firm was holding a summit at the same hotel.) He remembered my birthday and sent me a huge bouquet of roses for Saint Valentine\u2019s. Coming from a family where sensible was in short supply, that was incredibly attractive. We\u2019d heard that men like him existed, but actually laying eyes on one in person was a once-in-a-lifetime event. He was the Sasquatch of boyfriends.</p><p>Stephen always said he knew what he wanted and how to get it. I was just grateful that he wanted me. Stephen said he wanted to marry me, to raise a family with me. And the way he described our life together in a sweet suburban house with a play set in the back garden, it seemed to be everything I wanted.</p> <p>So three months before I came to the Hollow, when Stephen began talking about moving in together, I asked Penny for a favor. I asked her to place a binding on me. We tried to be clever about it. She worded the spell so that the binding prevented me from \u201cdoing harm,\u201d meaning I could still heal and diagnose, but I couldn\u2019t, say, stir the air or manipulate water or any of the sorts of things that might do harm to my relationship.</p><p>I should have known better than to trust Penny. I loved her dearly. She was my closest friend, the youngest daughter of Nana\u2019s youngest sibling. At thirty-six, she was a few years older than I, so it was a bit like having a cool older sister. But her magic had always been, well, spotty. Sometimes she could perform beautiful spells that made gardens flourish or wounds heal without any sign of a scar. And then there was the eviscerated sofa and the inexplicable loss of Mrs. McClaren\u2019s eyebrows.</p><p>I ended up with the magical equivalent of Mrs. McClaren\u2019s eyebrows. Penny had left me for the most part completely unaffected, but then there were seemingly random times when I had no magic whatsoever, for days at a time, and then, as a result of the \u201cbottling effect\u201d of those lulling intervals, there were terrifying moments in which every bit of power I owned poured forth in torrents of energy that shattered lightbulbs, crockery, and any nearby windows. And unfortunately for me, the most recent of these explosive moments had occurred while I was at dinner with Stephen at a rather posh Italian restaurant. Since I was the only person standing nearby, I ended up paying to replace several Murano glass light fixtures and a rather heavy antique gilt mirror.</p><p>Penny had to go in halvsies with me, the twit.</p><p>It was as if I had a state-of-the-art, wall-shaking stereo but couldn\u2019t control the volume. The only time I felt remotely in control of myself was when I felt \u201ctugged\u201d by the pain in people around me. Penny theorized that particular grace was only granted because I had no choice in the matter. I couldn\u2019t stop feeling those tugs any more than I could choose to stop blinking or breathing. And fortunately, I had enough nursing training to heal people through conventional means.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t seem to undo the spell, no matter how many different approaches we took\u2014countering spells, rituals, prayers, and anointments. Nothing worked. There was no magical \u201ccontrol Z.\u201d</p><p>When Nana began my instruction, I\u2019d been disappointed that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make rooms tidy themselves like Mary Poppins or fly on a broom. I\u2019d eventually adjusted my expectations and learned to enjoy manipulating the energy of the natural world. But now I couldn\u2019t even perform the most basic of \u201cfun\u201d magic: no more minor glamours to cover the occasional spot, no more \u201cquick-start\u201d fires on the hearth, no more kitchen magic to cover for my abysmal cooking. Thanks to this colossal blunder of judgment and execution, which we were endeavoring to hide from the rest of the family to prevent panic, I learned that having magic was like having an automatic dishwasher. Once you were used to having some machine do the washing up for you, even unloading the damn thing seemed like a chore. I could see that now, having become accustomed to some other force taking care of life\u2019s little details. I had, to an embarrassing degree, stopped living my own life. So I tried to do as much as I could independently of magic, even when I did have a \u201cwitchy\u201d solution.</p><p>Nana, who took a dim view of my timidity toward practicing the craft, had told me often that there was no such thing as a \u201chalfway\u201d witch, particularly given my extra ability, and that dabbling would catch up and bite me one day.</p> <p>I had a feeling that day was coming soon.</p><p>I flexed my fingers and toes, feeling my body coming back into balance. I blew out a long breath and gave Miranda my best smile.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind terribly if we drove by Paxton Avenue on the way home?\u201d I asked as we rolled through the neon-lit streets of the Hollow\u2019s \u201cmall district.\u201d As we moved farther and farther away from Walmart, the streets grew darker and quieter. The buildings were sort of mashed together, as if they were supposed to prop each other up. Every other restaurant seemed to serve some form of fire-roasted pig. And most of the business signs were intentionally misspelled, which seemed odd.</p><p>Miranda arched her dark brows. \u201cSure. Any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bookshop in that area I was hoping to visit after I\u2019ve settled in,\u201d I said, working to keep my tone casual. \u201cI\u2019d just like to know how to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecialty Books?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where my book club meets! You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her. \u201cYour book club meets at an occult bookshop?\u201d</p><p>Miranda gave a startled laugh. \u201cHow did you know about that? I mean, it hasn\u2019t been an occult bookshop for a few years, not since Jane took over.\u201d</p><p>I could only assume she meant Jane Jameson, who was now listed as the shop\u2019s proprietor on the updated Web site. According to what my cousin Ralph could find in county court records, Jameson had taken over the store a little more than a year before, when Mr. Wainwright left it to her in his will. I couldn\u2019t find much information about Ms. Jameson online. Her Facebook privacy settings were stringent. She had no Twitter account. In 2002, she gave a comment for a Kentucky Library Association newsletter article about electronic card catalogues. At the time, she was listed as a youth service librarian for the Half-Moon Hollow Public Library, but the library now listed that position as \u201cvacant.\u201d Other than the Specialty Books Web site and a memorial Facebook page on the Half-Moon High School reunion group, her Google presence was virtually nonexistent.</p><p>\u201cThe Internet,\u201d I said. \u201cI try to find little independent bookshops whenever I can. They usually serve great coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if Jane offers to make it for you, wait for Dick or Andrea Cheney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy landlord works at this bookshop?\u201d I asked as she turned the SUV toward Paxton.</p><p>That seemed like a strange coincidence\u2014the man who owned Mr. Wainwright\u2019s former home also worked in Mr. Wainwright\u2019s former shop? What sort of connection did Dick Cheney have to Mr. Wainwright? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTechnically, I don\u2019t think they pay him. He just spends a lot of time there. Anyway, he and his wife, Andrea, are the only ones who can make decent coffee for humans. Jane\u2019s coffee experiments have been known to convulse innocent bystanders, living or otherwise. She says it\u2019s not her fault. She couldn\u2019t cook before she was turned, either.\u201d</p><p>Jane Jameson was a vampire?</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, she was turned about three years ago,\u201d Miranda said in response to the question I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d asked out loud. That explained the memorial page. \u201cNice lady. Married to her sire, Gabriel. And she made her own vampire son earlier this year. Collin says I should call him a \u2018childe,\u2019 but when I call Jamie her son, it makes Gabriel\u2019s eye twitch. And that\u2019s way more fun.\u201d</p> <p>She slowed the car as we approached the one well-lit building on a sad, careworn street lined with dilapidated shops. Specialty Books was like a beacon, its bright windows and security lights accentuating the recent coat of sky-blue paint on the exterior brick. The inside appeared to be painted a darker purplish blue. The walls were lined floor to ceiling with light maple bookshelves. I could make out the shapes of four people sitting at a long polished bar, laughing and chatting. This was not what I expected.</p><p>Given the neighborhood and the state of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s house, I\u2019d expected the shop to be sort of beaten and half-finished. What had Ms. Jameson had to do to get the building into this condition? How much of the stock had she moved around?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stop in now?\u201d Miranda asked, making me jump a bit. Apparently, the anxious expression on my face was coming across as eager. \u201cThey keep vampire hours, so customers are welcome any time of night.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, struggling to find words that wouldn\u2019t set off Miranda\u2019s bullshit sensor. Frankly, I was fighting the absurd urge to slink down in my seat so no one in the shop would see me. I wasn\u2019t ready for this. I needed to prepare for my visit to the shop. I cleared my throat and reminded Miranda about the perishables we\u2019d loaded into the car. \u201cI\u2019ll come back some other time, but thanks for showing me where to find it.\u201d</p><p>Miranda shrugged and sped the car down the street. The farther we got from the store, the more I was able to relax. I leaned back against the seat and mulled over this latest development. My plans would have to change. I would need to do more research on Dick Cheney. I would need to change the way I approached Jane Jameson.</p> <p>The woman who owned my grandfather\u2019s shop was a vampire. That could make my life a lot more complicated.</p><p>Sleep didn\u2019t come easily that night, and not just because of my faulty internal clock or the lingering possibility of small mammals scurrying about my bedroom while I slept. It was a combination of worries, including the fact that I was sleeping under the roof my grandfather once owned. Penny called it a \u201cbeautiful coincidence\u201d that she\u2019d found it on a Web site listing local rentals. It made me edgy and uncomfortable, for reasons I hadn\u2019t quite pinned down yet. So I tossed and turned in my newly outfitted bed, thinking of Nana Fee and the night she died.</p><p>For a witch, Nana Fee died a shockingly normal death. Her heart was old and simply couldn\u2019t give any more. When the body is unable to carry on, there\u2019s only so much magic can do. She was tired of fighting nature and decided to let it take its course.</p><p>So on one unremarkable evening a few weeks ago, she sat propped up in her bed, the same one where she\u2019d spent a lifetime alone, well aware that she was breathing her last. She sent everyone from her cozy little bedroom except me. My uncles, aunts, and cousins did as they were told, knowing it was likely the last time she\u2019d boss them around, but they weren\u2019t happy about it. Death was rarely a solitary event in the McGavock family. We were practically our own Greek chorus.</p><p>Nana tried to keep a stoic face through the whole affair. Although the family had never held an official election, Nana was definitely the leader. And somehow they\u2019d gotten it into their heads that I was inheriting the position, no matter how much I pleaded for someone else to step in. Nana insisted that we dress her in the lavender bed jacket that Uncle Jack had given her for Christmas. Her snowy-white hair was piled high on her head. The fire was burned down to embers, giving her pale-blue eyes an unearthly glow. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she said, her voice steady but weak. \u201cI made a mistake, putting it off for this long. He\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gone?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Moving slowly, she pointed to the foot of her bed, to the space between her mattress and box spring. I reached in and pulled out a well-worn manila envelope. She smiled, a slight lift of the corner of her mouth. \u201cYour grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilbert Wainwright?\u201d I read the address on the envelope, listing a resident in Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky, and looked up at Nana, a million questions burning the tip of my tongue.</p><p>\u201cHe was a good man. Smart, just like my Nola.\u201d</p><p>I emptied the envelope into my hand and found several black-and-white photos of a much younger Nana laughing into the camera, her arms slung around a slight man with light hair and dark eyes. He was grinning down at her, a look of fond admiration on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care. I was young. A little foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got his name tattooed on your bum?\u201d I asked, sniffing as I sorted through photos, letters, and what appeared to be Nana Fee\u2019s journal.</p><p>\u201cImpudent chit,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have expected anything less from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would worry if I was behaving any other way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has them,\u201d she said, leaning back against the pillows. \u201cHad them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d I stared at her, not comprehending. My eyes widened. \u201cThem? Them them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I gave them to him for safekeeping,\u201d she said, tapping a photo in which Mr. Wainwright stood next to a packed motorcycle, giving the camera a sad little wave. \u201cOn the day he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNana, the whole family has wound themselves up over this for decades. How could you\u2014why would you? Why in God\u2019s name would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t curse at an old woman on her deathbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling it a deathbed!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it is, sweetheart,\u201d she said, squeezing my hand between her dry, brittle fingers. \u201cNo use pretending it\u2019s not. It\u2019s my time, you see, it\u2019s run out. And your time is just coming. I\u2019m sorry this has fallen to you, the responsibilities, the burden. But it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNana, I don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d she said. \u201cSwear that you\u2019ll go to America to retrieve them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know he still had them? He could have lost them on the way back to America. What if he sold them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe swore he would keep them safe. He knew how important it was. I contacted him every few years, to check on him. The last time I called, they told me he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if his family has sorted through his effects and sold them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a daughter and a granddaughter,\u201d I snapped. I was immediately sorry for my tone and pushed a stray lock of hair away from Nana\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt was better this way, Nola,\u201d she assured me. \u201cThere was no reason to tell him about your mother, although I know it caused her pain. I had all of the best bits of him, right here. How could I ask him for more? I couldn\u2019t ask him to spend his life with someone he didn\u2019t love. And if he knew there was a baby, he would have come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nana, I really am, but maybe it\u2019s best just to leave the past in the past. There\u2019s no reason for me to go halfway around the world and open old wounds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t go to America and find the Elements before they do, the whole family will be bound. No magic, no healing, no more help for our neighbors when they need it. Have you seen what happens to a village when they\u2019re suddenly without magic after generations have lived under its care and protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this now,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we\u2019ll talk about it some other time.\u201d She sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s schedule an appointment next week. It will be so much more convenient after I die.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, pressing my fingers against my eyelids. She pulled my hands away from my eyes and gave me a stern look. As weak as she was, it was still enough to make me sit up and speak plainly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for this, Nana. I don\u2019t know if I can do what you\u2019re asking of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic won\u2019t tolerate a practitioner who dances around it. You use your talents as you see fit, but there\u2019s a price for it, Nola. And the price has to be paid. If you continue to live as half a witch, you\u2019ll lose your gifts. Promise me that you\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNana . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise. Me,\u201d she ground out, as if the very effort exhausted her. \u201cUnless you want my spirit stuck on this plane with unfinished business. It won\u2019t be pleasant haunting. Lots of flies. Portents of doom. Midnight wailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I promise,\u201d I said. \u201cJust lie back and get some rest, all right? I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, darling.\u201d Nana closed her eyes and leaned back. Her breathing evened out, and her pulse went steady. Just before she fell asleep, her eyes fluttered open. \u201cNola, your mother . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I leaned against the bed and whispered against her temple. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Get some rest.\u201d</p><p>When her breath evened out and faded into light snores, I went into the parlor to assure my family that she was resting comfortably. In other words, they should get out and let both of us rest, for pity\u2019s sake. The next morning, I woke propped against the bedside with my hand still twined in Nana\u2019s. The fire was out, and the room was cold and dark. I\u2019d fallen asleep against the mattress, my face cradled against her journal. At some point, she\u2019d taken off her great-grandmother\u2019s wedding ring and closed my fingers over it. It had no magical significance. It was just an old family ring, passed from mother to daughter. I was the only one in Fiona McGavock\u2019s line left to pass it along to.</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>3</p><p>If you happen across a supernatural creature you don\u2019t understand, do not do anything to attract its attention until you\u2019re sure it\u2019s friendly. Unless you\u2019re comfortable operating with fewer appendages; if that\u2019s the case, carry on.</p><p>\u2014When, What, Witch, Were, and Why?</p><p>The Five W\u2019s of Safe Interactions with the Paranormal</p><p>With my internal clock still all wonky, I ended up sitting in bed reading over my notes on the artifacts. The problem was, I was looking for four everyday objects: a candle, a clay plaque, a knife, and a bell. Apart from being old, they probably wouldn\u2019t catch much attention at your average yard sale. And all supernatural clues from my grandmother had stopped the moment I decided to go to the States. That was maddeningly unhelpful.</p><p>I pored over the sketches Nana had left me, trying to memorize the symbols that had been painstakingly etched into the candle to represent protection. My head drooped over the papers until the landline rang, a sharp, shrieking jangle next to my ear. I jerked awake, blinking blearily at my new alarm clock to see that the numbers on its face were indecently low. I may have muttered a few obscenities into the receiver when I pressed it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a fine greeting for your favorite aunt.\u201d</p><p>I sat up in bed, wiping at my eyes. \u201cPen, what the hell are you doing calling me at three in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Penny cried. \u201cSorry, love, forgot about the time difference.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to reach through the phone and strangle you, Penelope,\u201d I growled.</p><p>Penny scoffed at the very idea, and rightly so. She had about thirty pounds and four inches on me.</p><p>\u201cAny progress?\u201d Penny asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I have food in the house but no angry marsupials. That\u2019s progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re just tired and not spouting gibberish to annoy me,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve found the shop. I\u2019m going to visit tomorrow. And I\u2019ve shopped for groceries and managed to evict a minor possum infestation from my rental house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you called Stephen yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo. I sent him a text when I landed, but after that . . . everything\u2019s a little hazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you should call him. He\u2019s been calling here, asking for your contact information at the hospital in Boston. You know I can\u2019t lie for anything, Nola. Why didn\u2019t you just tell him where you were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Stephen would think this is insane,\u201d I grumbled, forcing myself out of bed and untangling myself from the seemingly endless amount of spiral phone cord keeping me tethered to the receiver. I hobbled across my darkened room toward the window, glancing out to the moonlit garden.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s going to be a part of your life, he\u2019s just going to have to accept that you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I blurted as my eyes came to focus on a strange hulking figure at the edge of my yard. It had the basic shape of a man, only bent and twisted. The stark light of the full moon showed a broad, dark back. Its movements were halting and irregular, as if its long, rangy limbs weren\u2019t working properly. It looked almost canine, like one of those werewolves from the old Universal Studios monster movies. It lumbered toward the treeline, sniffing and scratching.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d Penny admonished me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something in my back garden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother marsupial?\u201d Penny chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt almost looks like a Yeti.\u201d I stepped toward the cheap little nightstand I\u2019d bought to retrieve my glasses, but the movement dragged the sheet with me and knocked a heavy pile of books and notes to the floor with a loud thunk. The shape shifted, its \u201cface\u201d obscured by angled moonlight.</p><p>It stepped toward the house. I scrambled away from the window, pressing against the wall. I could hear Penny\u2019s voice from the receiver, shouting for me to answer her. I tried to remember if the doors downstairs had decent monster-proof locks, but at the moment, all I could see in my head was a series of increasingly grotesque potential Yeti/werewolf bite wounds. Should I try to warn Jed? How would I get to his part of the house without going outside?</p><p>I was snapped out of this mental runaway train by Penny calling my name. I pressed the receiver to my ear. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the Yeti was a Himalayan beastie,\u201d Penny said as I slipped my glasses over my nose.</p><p>\u201cWerewolf is another possibility,\u201d I whispered, peeking from the window frame and forcing myself to look into the yard. Nothing. Whatever it was had gone. What the hell? I was sure there was something out there. This wasn\u2019t some flash out of the corner of my eye. But what was it? As far as I knew, there were no wolfmen or Yetis in this part of the world. And what were the chances of one showing up in my back garden?</p><p>There was also the small matter of my reflection, frightful rat\u2019s nest of dark hair included, which could very easily be mistaken for a furry beast.</p><p>I laughed, wiping at my eyes. \u201cFalse alarm. No werewolves in sight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop talking nonsense, I\u2019m coming over there,\u201d Penny warned.</p><p>I let out a shaky laugh, my shoulders sagging as the tension in my chest eased. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Pen, I swear. I\u2019m just jet-lagged and a little loopy. I didn\u2019t have my glasses on, and the moonlight is playing tricks on me. It was probably a dog or a bear or something. Do they have bears in Kentucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. All the more reason for you to be careful. I don\u2019t like the idea of you being over there by yourself. Rumor has it that several Kerrigan cousins have made plans to \u2018sightsee\u2019 in the States. That means they\u2019re up to something. Da wanted me to call to say we could spare Richard, James, and myself if you thought we could be of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why it had to be this way. Nana Fee only wanted one of us tramping all over the countryside, digging up family dirt. Four strangers with funny accents in a town this small would definitely cause a stir. And your sudden disappearance from the village would attract attention there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much for one person to deal with, no matter how strong you think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not disagreeing with you. But the word is \u2018badass,\u2019 not \u2018strong.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, Miss Steven Seagal, what are you not telling me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that weird excited tension in your voice. And it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve located the shop or managed to find your Nutella. I know you, Nola. You\u2019re crap at keeping secrets. Confess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gorgeous new neighbor has an aversion to wearing shirts. And for reasons beyond my control, he may or may not have seen me wearing nothing but a towel . . . at close range. But that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tramp!\u201d Penny cackled. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away that easy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s. All. I. Have. To. Say.\u201d</p><p>Huffing at my \u201cmule-headedness,\u201d Penny updated me on some of our patients, and I gave notes on their treatment, and for a moment, we sounded like any other medical team in the Western world. Gifted though we were, there were limitations to what we could do. Magic was not the answer to every problem or ailment, which was where my training came in handy. Nana and the others graciously tolerated my little eccentricities when I insisted on using modern techniques and equipment. So in return, if herbal teas would resolve issues such as indigestion, irregularity, and irritability, I prescribed them happily. Treatment at the clinic was a mix of magic and medicine, and our patients had come to expect a little of both.</p><p>My relatives were bolder in their practice of magical healing. Penny, for example, was a dab hand at what she called \u201creplenishing spells.\u201d She could spend just a few minutes talking with a patient who had been run down by a chronic illness or a bout of flu, and that person would walk away feeling as if he or she had spent two weeks at a health spa. She got incredibly offended when I suggested that the soothing, musical lilt of her voice sent the patients into a posthypnotic state that led them to believe they were relaxed and refreshed. If I teased too hard, she\u2019d threaten to perm me again.</p><p>The clinic was what brought the family together, when none of the McGavocks were sure how to handle the scandal of my mother\u2019s birth. Nana was the strongest witch in the family, the best healer in a bloodline that had always had healers in spades. Nana had organized the renovation of an old shearing barn into a sterile facility. She\u2019d arranged for the beds, the medicinal herb garden out back, and the donation of supplies.</p><p>Instead of waiting for a situation to become so dire that they showed up at the McGavock farm at midnight, our neighbors could come to the clinic during office hours. At any given time, there were at least three McGavocks on hand to provide care, although I was the only licensed medical professional in the bunch\u2014a fact we didn\u2019t quite broadcast to the agencies that governed health facilities. It was rare that they approved a form containing the phrase \u201cwe heal our patients with herbs and energy manipulation.\u201d</p><p>As a nurse practitioner, I loved working with my neighbors. I liked the fussy seniors with their imagined ailments, who were in reality visiting us after confession failed to provide them with the social contact they craved. I liked solving the real problems, soothing colicky infants and arthritic hands, and, yes, wiping up plain old colds. I loved knowing I was part of something. Even if I didn\u2019t fully accept my extra gifts, I liked knowing that I was drawing from the same source that had been easing the suffering in Kilcairy for ages in exchange for pennies and, occasionally, chickens and sheep.</p><p>Plainly put, the clinic was what sent me to Half-Moon Hollow. According to family legend, if I didn\u2019t find the four artifacts Nana had left to Gilbert Wainwright by the summer solstice, we would lose our magic. Even with my medical education behind us, the family would close the clinic. For years, the McGavock healers had been doing the near-impossible. My relatives wouldn\u2019t feel right continuing to operate without meeting those high expectations. Without affordable medical care nearby, our patients would put off the ninety-minute drive to the nearest doctor\u2019s office until minor problems became emergencies. Perfectly treatable illnesses would become big problems.</p><p>I would not let this happen to my neighbors or my family. These were the people who took me in when I arrived at the village gate, parentless and wary. They didn\u2019t care that my mother had caused no end of trouble in her short tenure there years before. I was one of their own.</p><p>Hearing Penny\u2019s voice brought on a wave of homesickness so fierce it made my teeth ache. I gave a brief update of my activities so far and promised I would e-mail a follow-up as soon as I met with Jane Jameson. After swearing that I would call if I needed help, I hung up. I opened my phone to dial Stephen\u2019s number but stopped myself. \u201cNot the right time,\u201d I muttered. \u201cCall when you get enough sleep to stop hallucinating mythical creatures . . . and you stop talking to yourself.\u201d</p><p>I rose again, staring out the window. I was awake now, awake enough to stock my kitchen, unpack my clothes, and start my life here. And before the next sunset, I would pay Jane Jameson\u2019s shop a visit.</p><p>In the light of late afternoon, I could see that Specialty Books was indeed located in a run-down neighborhood that seemed to be bouncing back slowly toward respectability. There was a consignment shop next door to the bookstore and a medical clinic down the street. The buildings looked as if they were being gradually rehabbed out of a state of ruin. It was difficult for me to understand\u2014having lived for years in a country where the age of buildings was measured in centuries rather than decades\u2014how Americans let their buildings fall to crap so quickly. Then again, considering Kentucky\u2019s heat and brain-softening humidity in flipping May, maybe the buildings simply melted.</p><p>I sat across the street from the shop in my newly acquired heap of a car, purchased with Iris Scanlon\u2019s help at Bardlow\u2019s Used Cars. The twenty-year-old Nissan featured four tires and a motor. There were no other features. It was a hunk of junk, but at seven hundred dollars, I couldn\u2019t afford to pass on the deal. Poor Miranda couldn\u2019t be saddled with driving me every time I needed to go into town.</p><p>Beyond purchasing transportation, I had not had a productive day. I woke up late, remembering that I needed to call Stephen, who was not pleased to be an \u201cafterthought\u201d in my travel agenda. But he was back to his same sweet self in a few moments, asking how I was sleeping, if I\u2019d taken my vitamins, if my caseload was rewarding. He was always concerned about me pushing myself too hard, and the way he cared warmed my heart as it always did. Of course, our conversation was riddled with none-too-subtle hints that I should abandon this silly fellowship, come home, and discuss his proposal to move to Dublin. I pretended I was still travel-addled to avoid the topic. He ended the conversation with \u201cBe sure to get enough rest.\u201d Which, in terms of a loved-up phone signoff, was extremely lacking, but still, he worried about me. And that was nice of him.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to do about this ambivalence I\u2019d felt about calling Stephen since arriving in the Hollow. And even more shocking was that I\u2019d barely devoted any time or thought to Stephen in the last few days. There was no bone-deep, visceral ache to keep me from sleeping without him or concentrating on the task at hand. And that was disturbing. I liked that \u201chead over heels\u201d feeling. Losing it felt like going through emotional withdrawal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With guilt-inducing speed, my mind flashed to Jed, who was proving to be a considerate neighbor. He\u2019d swept off my side of the porch and placed one of his rickety rocking chairs next to my front door. Apparently, he\u2019d been given permission to fix my back patio, too, because this morning, he began breaking up the old one with a sledgehammer just as the sun came up. And he looked like Hephaestus\u2019s well-built, better-looking brother while doing it. That was not right.</p><p>Since I was most definitely awake and alert, I took a cup of tea out to him after changing into some shorts and completing several rounds of anti-morning-breath tactics. He seemed a little chagrined to see me, his face flushing an adorable pink as I approached with my carefully balanced tea mugs. \u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019.\u201d He cleared his throat, wiping his forehead with a red bandana. \u201cI, uh, should probably apologize for the other night. As pleasant as it was to have my hands full of naked new neighbor, my mama wouldn\u2019t have approved of the way I behaved. My only defense is that I\u2019m not used to ladies introducin\u2019 themselves by climbin\u2019 me like a jungle gym . . . Well, that\u2019s not true; it does happen on occasion. But that\u2019s why I stay away from bachelorette parties nowadays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you blaming this on me? You groped my ass while I was terrified.\u201d</p><p>The worry clouding his expression faded away, shifting from tense to playfully indignant.</p><p>\u201cIt was a comforting grope,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing as a comforting grope.\u201d</p><p>Jed\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cClearly, you\u2019ve never met a man who did it well.\u201d</p> <p>I really wished this wasn\u2019t working on me. Smiling at lines this lame was demoralizing. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not nearly as attractive as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWell, that can\u2019t possibly be true.\u201d</p><p>It was just quick, cheeky conversation over tea, after which Jed went back to work, and I went upstairs to organize my meager belongings. But it had left me confused and twitchy. I was not a cheater. I was not the sort of woman who flirted with other men while her boyfriend waited at home. I was going to have to find a way to interact with Jed that didn\u2019t involve cheekiness. Or shirtlessness.</p><p>And so I\u2019d walked up and down this generally abandoned street all afternoon, working off excess energy and gauging what I might be able to see through the front windows of Specialty Books. (Thanks to thick metal sunproof shades, nothing.) Whether the shop could be accessed from the back door during daytime hours, when there were no vampires lurking about. (No.) And if there was a position available at the consignment shop next door. (Also, no.)</p><p>Eventually, I\u2019d returned to my car to wait for Jane Jameson and her staff to arrive. Like clockwork, as soon as the sun set over the horizon, a large black SUV pulled into the spot directly in front of the shop. Two women piled out, one a redhead, one a brunette, chatting animatedly as the brunette unlocked the heavy front door.</p><p>I waited, watching through the front windows as they moved about inside. A half hour passed, and I ambled casually across the street as if I hadn\u2019t stalked the place for most of the day. I wiped my sweating palms across my dark jeans and straightened the casual green top I\u2019d chosen. Why was I so nervous all of a sudden? It wasn\u2019t as if I\u2019d done anything wrong\u2014yet. And it wasn\u2019t as if I needed the approval of a vampire shopkeeper, even though she could prove to be a great help or hindrance in accomplishing the task at hand.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I would say to Jane Jameson when I met her. It depended on what I found in her shop and the impression I got from her. If she seemed untrustworthy, I would pretend to be selling calendars for an orphans fund and run as if the devil was chasing me. If I got a good feeling from her, well, I hadn\u2019t worked that out just yet.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop giving yourself pep talks, Nola,\u201d I grumbled to myself. \u201cOr your next stop will be a narrow window ledge.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I opened the door, the tinkling of a little bell overhead announcing my arrival. This was my grandfather\u2019s shop? It looked so modern and . . . well, girlie.</p><p>The view from outside hadn\u2019t done the place justice. Specialty Books\u2019 decor was playful and whimsical, not at all what you would expect from a vampire-owned shop. The walls were painted a cheerful blue, with a sprinkle of twinkling silver stars. There were comfy purple chairs and caf\u00e9 tables arranged around the room in little conversation groups. Little pewter fairies danced on the shelves around rings of marble eggs and geodes.</p><p>A large cabinet to the left of the register displayed a huge collection of ritual candles. Although they weren\u2019t the sort of candle I needed, I picked up a pink pillar marked \u201cRomantic Love\u201d and sniffed the wax. Rosemary and marjoram, not your usual rose-scented mix. I could appreciate that. Candle magic was one of the more approachable arenas of magic for a \u201cdabbler.\u201d While most people were uncomfortable with rituals and poppets, they didn\u2019t see any harm in lighting a candle. You just chose a color based on your needs\u2014red for passion, green for monetary gain or fertility\u2014inscribed the candles according to what you wanted, and lit them up. But you had to be careful what you asked for. Spell-based love was notoriously fickle. Casting for financial gain often resulted in quick money fixes but long-term crises. As with most areas of the Craft, I didn\u2019t bother with it. But I liked the smell of Nana\u2019s homemade candles, made with herbs and oils from her garden, and sometimes burned them just for the pleasure of the scent.</p><p>Most witches consecrated their own candles with special oils, herbal mixes designed for their particular purpose. But if you were dealing with novices, which this shop likely would, it made sense to sell candles made of prescented wax. And the candles seemed to be of high quality, good strong scents without being overpowering. Even if Jane Jameson wasn\u2019t a practitioner, she seemed to appreciate what her customers would want and tried to give them a little more than was expected. That made me smile.</p><p>Beyond the candles, the leaded glass and maple cupboard that held the cash register displayed a collection of ritual knives. My heart seemed to stutter a bit. Ritual knives? Athames, right up front? My hands shook slightly as I looked over the display. It couldn\u2019t be that simple, could it? I couldn\u2019t just walk into my grandfather\u2019s shop and find the first two items on my little shopping list.</p><p>I looked over the neatly arranged knives and candles. I\u2019d only seen sketches of the athame in question\u2014silver, with a black enamel handle, inlaid in perfect silver spirals, a large cloudy blue gemstone set in the center of the handle. The candle was thick, white, and round, standing nearly a foot tall, inscribed over and over with a distinctive double version of the Celtic knot.</p> <p>My buoyant little bubble of hope popped and deflated as I scanned the items in the cabinet. The shop had a fine collection, but none of them matched the descriptions I\u2019d been given.</p><p>Sighing, I wandered a bit around the neatly arranged bookshelves, running my fingers over the spines of the books. Jane Jameson had scattered large black-and-white framed photos on the walls, smiling people, happy to be together. Was this her family? There was a wedding picture of the tall brunette and a handsome dark-haired man, though they looked to be dressed like something out of a BBC Jane Austen production. A holiday picture involving some hideous sweaters. I recognized Mr. Wainwright in a few of the shots\u2014much older than he was in Nana\u2019s photos, wizened to the point of being rather adorable, with a fringe of frazzled white hair and bifocals perched on top of his head. His face nearly crackled with laugh lines. He looked so happy, grinning broadly at the camera, particularly in the photos with the others. In one shot, near the register, the brunette had her arm slung around Mr. Wainwright\u2019s shoulders, both laughing at something behind the camera.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to feel about this. I\u2019d pictured Mr. Wainwright as this lonely little hermit, living above his shop. And somehow, that\u2019s what I wanted. He\u2019d left my Nana Fee alone all those years. Some part of me was unsure that I wanted him to be this happy. I\u2019d never understood why Nana Fee never married Jimmy O\u2019Shea, a charming bachelor who lived down the lane. He had been courting Nana Fee since they were in school. But she\u2019d refused him, so many times. His failed proposals were the stuff of legend in Kilcairy.</p><p>The single most depressing thought I had was that Nana Fee had truly loved Mr. Wainwright. And all the while, he\u2019d moved on. Had he ever thought of her after he returned to America? My Nana Fee was a good woman. She\u2019d deserved second thoughts.</p><p>Not to mention that Mr. Wainwright seemed to have replaced me with taller, prettier granddaughter models, which was causing no small amount of latent jealousy.</p><p>Abandonment issues aside, I was comfortable here. There was a good energy in this building, as much as I hated to admit it. The rental may have been Mr. Wainwright\u2019s house, but this was his home.</p><p>Stepping closer to one of the shelves, I noticed a title. Miss Manners\u2019 Guide to Undead Etiquette? Chuckling, I continued down the shelf.</p><p>From Fangs to Fairy Folk: Unusual Creatures of Midwestern North America.</p><p>Have You Ever Seen a Dream Walking: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Otherworldly Travel.</p><p>When, What, Witch, Were, and Why? The Five W\u2019s of Safe Interactions with the Paranormal.</p><p>I picked up a trade paperback, arching an eyebrow. \u201cTuesdays with Morrie?\u201d</p><p>From the back of the store, I could feel a little mental tickle, a nudge at the back of my brain. Holy shit! A mind-reader? I wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with a mind-reader now! I stopped in my tracks, closing my eyes and sliding down what Nana would have called my \u201cmental shield,\u201d picturing a rather large Jell-O mold forming around my head, protecting my brain from intruders.</p><p>Yes, it sounded silly. It\u2019s my brain, and I\u2019ll protect it however I want.</p><p>The tickle turned into an all-out poke. The slim brunette from the photos stepped out of some nook in the back, followed by an irritated-looking redhead. The brunette gave me a warm, if perplexed, smile. She was wearing jeans and a beautiful red silk blouse. The redhead, cool and elegant and far more wrinkle-free than anyone had a right to be at this time of night, was also featured heavily in the photo display. She was more subtly attired in a candy-floss-pink blouse and gray silk slacks.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you find anything?\u201d the brunette asked, her eyes narrowing at me slightly. She blinked a few times and shook her head, as if she had water in her ear.</p><p>\u201cJust looking around,\u201d I said, holding up the paperback.</p><p>\u201cThis one again?\u201d The brunette groaned, taking Tuesdays with Morrie back to the section marked \u201cFiction\u201d and reshelving it. \u201cI swear to you, Andrea, this book is possessed. It\u2019s like the stories about those porcelain dolls that move around while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Andrea, the gorgeous redhead, rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m ninety percent sure Dick moves that book every time he comes into the store, just to mess with you.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cJane has issues with dolls . . . and puppets . . . and clowns. We keep a list in the back, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Despite myself, I found myself snickering. I cleared my throat. \u201cYou have an interesting selection here. You stock ritual items?\u201d I nodded toward the display cupboard.</p><p>The redhead frowned a bit. \u201cSome. We\u2019re primarily a bookshop, but the previous owner had quite a collection, and we keep the athames and candles around as sort of a tip of the hat.\u201d</p><p>Jane stared at me, blinking as if she was having trouble concentrating.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet,\u201d I said, ignoring her blatant perusal and pointing to the little ownership plaque by the register. \u201cSo I take it you\u2019re Jane Jameson, proprietor?\u201d</p><p>Andrea sighed. In a lifeless, resigned tone, she said, \u201cI will never be as smart as Jane Jameson-Nightengale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe lost a bet,\u201d Jane said, grinning evilly at her companion. \u201cEvery time she hears my full name, she has to say that. Do not try to out-trivia me, Andrea. You have no one to blame but yourself. Which reminds me, I need to have that plaque updated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn Nicholas Nickleby\u2019s sister was named Sarah,\u201d Andrea muttered.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Kate,\u201d I said, just as Jane did.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hell, there\u2019s two of you,\u201d Andrea groaned, marching behind the counter. \u201cI\u2019m making myself a bloodychino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodychino?\u201d I asked, turning toward Jane, who was giving me a speculative look.</p><p>\u201cHmm? Oh, yes, Andrea has figured out how to make coffee drinks more palatable for vampires.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my brows. Andrea was fair-skinned, but she didn\u2019t strike me as the vampire type. She was so put-together and polished. It was as if someone had vampirized a Kennedy, which was a terrifying thought. Was everyone who worked in this shop a vampire?</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Jane had that quiet, sturdy sort of beauty, with flyaway hair over bright hazel eyes and a wide, mischievous smile. She also had ink smeared across her cheek and a pencil holding up a rather haphazard bun. And she looked absolutely content about it. She was staring at me, and when I made eye contact, she seemed to give herself a little shake.</p> <p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t think I caught your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola Leary,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m new in town. I heard this was the place to go for a good book.\u201d</p><p>Jane seemed to study me, scanning me from head to toe. Whatever she found seemed to bother her, given the way she kept squinting and working her jaw, as if to pop her ears. \u201cWell, good obscure books, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Given Jane\u2019s scanning, I decided to hold off on any pointed questions about my grandfather. I ordered a coffee, bought a werewolf romance set in Alaska, and made myself comfortable. I sat at the bar and chatted with Andrea while customers filtered in. A book club met in the little circle of chairs near the back. Jane served coffee and sinfully good chocolate biscuits while they had a spirited discussion of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.</p><p>I spent a good deal of time just looking around the shop. What had it looked like when my grandfather was alive? How had he run the store? Did this work make him happy? For the first time since I\u2019d learned his name, I wished so much that Gilbert Wainwright was still alive. I wished that Nana Fee hadn\u2019t been so stubborn about contacting him. I wished that she\u2019d chosen a slightly more convenient baby daddy to bequeath our family legacy to.</p><p>Every time I looked at Jane, she was studying me, a little line of concentration marring her smooth white forehead. After about two hours of this studying/staring cycle, I decided I\u2019d pushed the limits of normal customer loitering and hopped off my bar stool. Jane caught up to me before I reached the door, smiling brightly at the book club as she pulled me toward the shop\u2019s office.</p> <p>I resisted, I pulled, but, well, she had all that vampire strength on her side. The office was small but tidy, with pale-yellow walls and a low shelf that ran the length of the room. Instead of books, the shelf displayed framed photos, running the gamut from old black-and-white shots to color photos of Jane with the man from the wedding photo. Jane wasn\u2019t hurting me, but her grip was awfully firm as she sat me down in her desk chair. I tried to push to my feet, but she shoved me back down, then pulled a bottle of synthetic blood out of the little fridge behind her mahogany desk. She stared me down while we waited for the bottle to finish heating in the mini-microwave.</p><p>Although her habit of mental poking was somewhat annoying, it was rather nice sitting there with Jane. She had no biological functions, therefore no ailments. Other than a constant, niggling thirst that manifested as a dry, buzzing sensation in the throat, I didn\u2019t feel anything from her. I seriously doubted she had any \u201cI fell off my boyfriend\u201d injuries I would have to diagnose.</p><p>\u201cOK, why don\u2019t you just go ahead and tell me what it is you\u2019re trying to do. It will save us both some time and Tasering,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>She sat in her chair, her expression wary. \u201cI\u2019ll tolerate a lot, lady, but I won\u2019t put up with people who try to pull one over on me. It\u2019s been done one too many times. Now, why are you so interested in Mr. Wainwright and his former shop? I can\u2019t get much from you; all I see is rolling green hills and old pictures of Mr. Wainwright. And an old lady with an Irish accent in a purple bathrobe. And then I just get a bunch of static, which is really annoying, by the way. It\u2019s like having nonstop radio feedback in my head.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. So that explained the mental poking. Some vampires had special talents beyond their strength and speed, such as mind-reading, finding lost objects, or just being very good at board games. She said she hadn\u2019t seen much, but how could I know that? What should I tell her? I\u2019d hoped to fly under the radar here in the Hollow, but having Jane\u2019s input could help me track down the Elements. But could I trust her? These items were valuable, if for no other reason than that they were incredibly old. What if she started looking for them on her own and cut me out? Mr. Wainwright had trusted her, but I didn\u2019t know her. And what was with the radio feedback noise? Was that because of Penny\u2019s misfired binding spell?</p><p>\u201cOK, whatever you\u2019re thinking about, please stop,\u201d she said, wincing. \u201cWe just went from radio static to that ear-splitting tone the Emergency Broadcast System uses.\u201d</p><p>During this internal rant, I\u2019d forgotten about my mental Jell-O shield. I stared at her for a long moment, picturing the Jell-O solidifying around my head. The moment I felt it snap into place, Jane\u2019s tense face relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cOK, that\u2019s better. Whatever you did, just keep that in place, would you? You might as well tell me about whatever you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019d like to help.\u201d Leaning her elbows on her desk, she asked, \u201cNow, how do you know Mr. Wainwright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a distant relation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met all of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s relations,\u201d Jane said stiffly. \u201cHe was the last living person in his family line. Now, try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe visited Ireland about fifty years ago. He didn\u2019t know about his daughter, my mother. He wouldn\u2019t have known about me.\u201d</p><p>I felt another little mental nudge. Apparently, Jane was double-checking my story. I gave her an exasperated frown. She started when she realized I could feel it and returned a sheepish grin. \u201cForce of habit.\u201d She scanned a row of framed photos on a shelf behind her desk, before selecting one. \u201cMr. Wainwright was in Ireland researching a family of were-deer. Was your grandma named Bridget?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and explained that although he\u2019d been seeking were-creatures, Mr. Wainwright had been just as happy to discover my grandmother, a hereditary witch who healed the leg he\u2019d shattered in a motorcycle accident near the family farm.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright saw enough to know that Nana Fee wasn\u2019t just a particularly skilled nurse. While she cared for him, she explained about the McGavock family\u2019s magical talent for healing and how we\u2019d used it for generations. According to the journal, they talked about magical theory and books and films until the wee hours of the morning. And at some point, I\u2019m assuming they did things that I\u2019d rather not picture my grandmother doing, because nine months later, long after Mr. Wainwright had packed up and moved to seek a herd of were-deer rumored to be living near the shore, my mother was born.</p><p>I pulled Nana Fee\u2019s photos from my purse and slid them across her desk. Jane\u2019s eyes widened slightly, then she looked me over. She picked up one of the snugglier shots, her eyebrows raised. \u201cMr. Wainwright, you dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was the result of their . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say \u2018union,\u2019 for both of our sakes,\u201d Jane suggested, holding up her hands in a defensive pose.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Nana Fee never contacted him to let him know about the baby. They weren\u2019t in love. She didn\u2019t want to hold him back from whomever he might meet that he would love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNana Fee never revealed her lover\u2019s name until just before she died, not even when my great-grandfather and great-uncles pressed and threatened and outright begged. She moved into the empty herder\u2019s cottage on the edge of the farm proper and went about making a life for her new baby. No simple feat for an unmarried twenty-year-old. But Nana was gifted, and frankly, I think the villagers were too afraid of losing her services as a healer to shun her completely. Likewise, her family loved her too much to send her away. She never married. She had her daughter, and she was happy with her choice.\u201d</p><p>Jane stared at me for a long while. \u201cI want to believe you. The idea of Mr. Wainwright having a child and a grandchild makes me very happy. And I don\u2019t think you have any bad intentions here. But you need to understand that we\u2019ve been burned before by someone claiming a connection to Mr. Wainwright. Do you mind if I ask what brings you here now, after all these years?\u201d</p><p>I gave an equal measure of considerate staring. \u201cThat\u2019s a really long story, and I\u2019d like to wait until your shop is cleared out.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Jane blew out a breath and sank back into her chair. \u201cWell, hell, I wish Mr. Wainwright had stayed around now.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI wish that he\u2019d lived, too. I would have liked to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I meant,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>4</p><p>Never overestimate any supernatural creature\u2019s sense of humor.</p><p>\u2014A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm</p><p>Andrea was staring at me. Hard.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t say that my new vampire friends \u201cdetained\u201d me, but it was made quite clear that any attempts to leave would not be met with friendly handshakes and an exchange of e-mail addresses. With the customers cleared out, I was sitting at the coffee bar, trying to suss out exactly how much I should tell them. Since they\u2019d kept me from dinner, Jane was nice enough to provide me with something called \u201clemon bars,\u201d an odd cross between a biscuit and a custard pie. And Andrea was staring at me. It wasn\u2019t an angry stare. She seemed to be looking for coded messages in my eyelashes. I started to blink in odd patterns while I chewed on lemon bars, just to see what happened.</p><p>Nothing, just more staring.</p><p>\u201cShould we wait for Dick?\u201d Jane asked, pulling the \u201cClosed\u201d sign over the front door of the shop.</p><p>Andrea gave me a quick, furtive look. \u201cUm, Dick has a business meeting. I\u2019m not able to reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do the words \u2018business meeting\u2019 seem to be in unspoken subtext quotation marks?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d Andrea told me, in a tone that brooked no further discussion. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>Jane moved behind the bar as if she were going to make more coffee, until Andrea hopped over the counter with vampire speed and chased her away from the large, shiny cappuccino maker. Jane pouted a bit and plopped into the seat beside me. Andrea gave me a sweeping hand gesture and said, \u201cFloor\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>I straightened in my chair, clearing my throat. \u201c \u2018Once upon a time\u2019 is the best way to start, yes? Well, once upon a time, there was a happy little family in the wilds of Ireland, practicing what they called magic. For years and years, they kept the locals happy by caring for the sick, taking care of ailing livestock, and keeping the crops fertile. Even through the Inquisition and the witchcraft trials, the villagers kept peace with the family, because they needed them to prosper, and vice versa. You would think the lack of pitchfork-toting townsfolk would keep the family safe, but of course, in stories like these, there are always problems.</p><p>\u201cIt boiled down to a difference of opinion on magical policy. The family had always operated under the tenet of \u2018do not harm.\u2019 But a small branch of the family grew tired of being \u2018servants\u2019 to the locals. They argued that the family should take a firmer stance, domination instead of appeasement. They seemed to think that we should be leading the people around us, instead of working with them\u2014through force, if necessary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you telling me that there\u2019s a real Voldemort?\u201d Jane asked, what little color she had leeching from her face.

It\u2019s a legitimate question!\u201d</p><p>I chuckled despite myself. \u201cThese rebellious family members said that the witch who can\u2019t harm can\u2019t heal, that there has to be a balance of both. And unfortunately, this philosophy led to a few . . . well, let\u2019s call them magical amputations. This was unacceptable to the main contingent of McGavocks, and they asked these rogue relatives to leave.</p><p>\u201cSo that branch left the village and settled halfway across the country. Several of the witches married into the Kerrigans, a local family who raised their children according to a more strident magical philosophy. While the McGavocks flourished and enjoyed plentiful harvests and peace, the Kerrigan branch got more aggressive and bitter\u2014although as a side note, they have made a considerable amount of money in the last century or so manufacturing small arms. Anyway, the Kerrigans went out looking for problems to \u2018solve\u2019 with their magic. Because, in their opinion, some people just needed smiting. And eventually, that included members of the McGavock family, which started a vicious cycle of retaliation and misinterpretation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the magical Hatfields and McCoys,\u201d Andrea marveled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not entirely wrong,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe lost people on both sides, to violence and curses. About three hundred years ago, the two matriarchs of the families met and agreed that matters had gone far enough. They selected four objects representing each of the elements and blessed them with magic from both sides. These objects, which they called the Elements, were scattered to the winds, given to strangers, sold to tinkers, that sort of thing. The matriarchs agreed that the family that found all four objects first would be able to bind the other branch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike magical Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d Andrea asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t under an enormous amount of stress, I would find that funny,\u201d I assured her. \u201cThe potential of losing our magic was a considerable risk, a risk I can only imagine was inspired by desperation. It took decades, but we rounded up the Elements first and bound the Kerrigans from doing magical harm. For the most part, they\u2019re no more powerful than the average disenfranchised teenager who has seen The Craft once too often. The most they\u2019re able to pull off is a stirring of air, which, honestly, could be done with a strategically placed fan, so it\u2019s not terribly impressive. But every one hundred years, on the night of the summer solstice, the binding has to be repeated by the family\u2019s strongest witch. This leaves a small window of time in which the Kerrigans have the chance to obtain the objects and undo the binding, reversing it onto my family. They tried it once in the early 1900s, and my nana Fee\u2019s great-grandmother laid down a witchcraft bitch-slapping of epic proportions. I also hear there was a mighty non-magical slap involved. And now it\u2019s my generation\u2019s turn, and by some bizarre accident of birth, the so-called strongest witch in my family happens to be sitting here in front of you.\u201d</p><p>A Cheshire cat\u2019s smile split Jane\u2019s face. Andrea held up her hand and said, \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to ask!\u201d Jane huffed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever juvenile, ill-conceived test of her abilities you were about to demand could only end in tears.\u201d</p><p>I stared at both of them. These were the people Mr. Wainwright had entrusted with his shop? They were the ones who were supposed to help me track down the Elements?</p><p>I was doomed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Nola, you were saying?\u201d Andrea asked, pouring me another cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cUnder normal circumstances, the binding wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor incantation spoken over the artifacts. Around the time Mr. Wainwright visited all those years ago, Nana got rather worried about an increase in Kerrigan-related violence. She saw that he was trustworthy, that he was devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. So she took the objects out of the family vault and entrusted them to his care. She thought they would be safer with him.\u201d</p> <p>Both women winced, the corners of their mouths drawing back sharply. Jane said, \u201cShe probably should have rethought that. I don\u2019t want to alarm you, but when I first got here, the shop looked like an episode of Extreme Hoarders: Book Edition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a basic idea of what I\u2019m looking for. There are some old sketches. Why Nana Fee didn\u2019t think to take some pictures, I have no idea. But according to my family, she was incredibly secretive about the objects. She wouldn\u2019t show them to anyone, for fear of the infamous McGavock loose lips. In other words, my aunt Margaret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuick question. Why the solstice?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>\u201cSolstices are considered times of beginnings, endings, new cycles, so it made sense. And I guess no one wanted to travel to meet on the winter solstice.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Jane pushed up from her chair and paced a bit, straightening a picture frame here, shelving a book there. Andrea seemed to understand that her employer\u2019s silence meant something, so, along with her, I waited patiently for the other vampire to speak. When she finally came to a stop, she said, \u201cSo, basically, you need to rifle through my stock and my records to determine if any of those objects are still in the store. And if they\u2019re not, you need to use any information you find here to try to track down where they went?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Jane shrugged her shoulders. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jane said, shaking her head. She stepped closer, her eyes narrowing suddenly. \u201cUnderstand that we will be monitoring what you do very carefully. You will not be given free access to the shop. You will not be given a key. And if you try to tell me how I should be running things, so help me God, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Andrea barked.</p><p>Jane cleared her throat, seemingly forcing herself to relax. \u201cSorry. One day, we will get you drunk and tell you about your great-uncle Emery.\u201d Andrea shuddered violently.</p><p>I did not quite know how to respond to that, so I said, \u201cI\u2019ll start tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I rolled into the driveway to find Jed frantically moving some tools into his part of the house. It was cloudy, the banks of wispy fog moving over the waxing moon in patches. Given the dim lighting, I wondered how he was able to see. I would have smashed my face into the porch steps by now.</p><p>Jed practically flinched when he saw my car, such as it was, pulling to a stop on the gravel. Irritation, fueled by the gnawing tension left behind when I bared my soul to the vampires, flared in my belly. Really? He wanted to avoid me that badly? The sight of my seminudity was so unappealing that he was eyeing the open front door with desperation?</p><p>That seemed like an overreaction.</p><p>I threw open the car door. As my sight adjusted to the scant light of the porch lamp, I watched his eyes dart from me to the sky and back again. He seemed skittish, like a colt not quite sure of his master\u2019s goodwill. His sandy hair fell over his eyes, giving him the perfect excuse for not looking up. A strange energy emanated from his entire body. A sort of restlessness of his cells, as if he was going to jump out of his skin at any moment. Was he on something? He seemed so healthy, too healthy to be a drug user. And his jumpy, erratic energy was different from that of my mother, who\u2019d made enthusiastic use of every recreational substance she could get her hands on. His head snapped up, and he pulled an angry face, as if he could feel me staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded, keeping a wary eye on the moon as the clouds slipped away. He was nearly flinching, as if he expected a slap instead of silvery light.</p><p>\u201cJed, is everything OK?\u201d I asked, following him up the porch steps, under the protective shelter of the porch. The closer we moved to the house, the less agitated he seemed.</p><p>Once inside his front door, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m bein\u2019 rude. I\u2019ve just had a long day. Work stuff. I was just about to warm up some chicken and dumplin\u2019s. How about you take over the stove while I take a shower? And then you can help me eat some of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou invite me to dinner, and I end up cooking? What sort of swindle is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cookin\u2019, you\u2019re warmin\u2019 up,\u201d he told me, eyeing the leather portfolio in my hand with some interest before turning that handsome grin on me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t use the microwave to do this?\u201d</p><p>I was firmly antitechnology when it came to tea, but I didn\u2019t see the point in dirtying up a bunch of dishes if I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Jed unbuttoned his shirt and tossed it into a little laundry room off the kitchen. Oh, come on, now. I was starting to think he was doing this to provoke me. \u201cMrs. Reilly\u2019s dumplin\u2019s have been known to explode when nuked.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the warmed-over chicken and rice casserole in my fridge and the prospects of trying to piece together a meal at this time of night. \u201cYes, if you explain to me what a dumplin\u2019 is.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and dropped a heavy leather toolbelt near the front door. \u201cYou have your choice; you cook, or you eat dinner with someone smellin\u2019 like he\u2019s been diggin\u2019 ditches all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking sounds like the lesser of two evils,\u201d I said, shuddering.</p><p>I placed the sketches in a drawer in my own kitchen, peeled my contacts out of my dust-plagued eyes, then locked my front door before rejoining Jed in his kitchen. He was setting out a large pot, French bread, and butter on the counter.</p><p>\u201cNext week, I\u2019ll invite you over to make me dinner,\u201d I muttered, feigning indignation and trying hard to ignore the way he was stretching his massive arms over his head, making his shirttail ride up. This just wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>\u201cWell, it would be the polite thing to do,\u201d he said, grinning at me while he kicked off his boots, and I was thankful that he at least left the jeans on. I opened the fridge, boggling at the sheer number of labeled Tupperware containers stacked inside. \u201cJust keep stirrin\u2019. You don\u2019t want it to stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to discuss your harem of church-lady caterers, can we talk about your tendency to strip in front of me?\u201d I called after him. I dumped the congealed dumplings into a pot as he jogged up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not lookin\u2019!\u201d he called back.</p><p>I rolled my eyes but stirred as instructed. The food smelled delicious, particularly after I warmed up the loaf of crusty bread in the oven. Standing at the stove gave me time to look around Jed\u2019s side of the house, which was considerably more comfortable than my own. He\u2019d painted the walls a light, creamy beige, making the rooms airy and bright. It was a vast improvement over the dark, cavelike spaces on my side. The polished living-room floor was covered with an extra-large blue rag rug. He\u2019d added a few sturdy, no-nonsense pieces of furniture in each room, but there were few personal touches. No pictures, no knickknacks. Several large bookshelves flanked his windows. When I got closer, I could see that they were full of language guides. Moon Phases, A Chinese to English Dictionary, Hieroglyphics, Translating Gaelic, The Dummy\u2019s Guide to Understanding Ancient Sanskrit. The rooms told me very little about Jed as a person, other than that he had good color sense and hated reading subtitles in foreign-language movies. Or he\u2019d bought a bunch of coffee-table books at a garage sale.</p><p>By the time Jed trotted down the steps, smelling pleasantly of Dial soap, I had the table set and the dumplings dished. I was bending over the oven to retrieve the bread when I heard, \u201cThis is why men like to watch women cook. It has nothin\u2019 to do with bein\u2019 sexist. It\u2019s the bendin\u2019 and liftin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is also sexist.\u201d I turned to offer a rude response, only to find him wearing another pair of arse-cupping jeans and a T-shirt that showcased his indecently large biceps. I was standing in the presence of living, breathing arm porn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d I cried, throwing up my hands and nearly flinging the bread across the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, crossing to the window and closing the curtains.</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d I shot back. \u201cWhen you go out and buy a shirt like that, do you actually calculate the number of bicep curls you\u2019ll have to perform in order to do it justice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t work out that much,\u201d he said as he held my chair away from the table.</p><p>I sat down, glaring up at him. \u201cWell, then clearly, you have discovered some sort of magic testosterone tree in the back garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take it off if it bothers you,\u201d he offered, peeling the hem away from a tanned expanse of stomach.</p><p>Please, I prayed, don\u2019t let there be such a thing as a magic testosterone tree.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d I yelped, a laugh bursting from my chest as he dropped his shirt back into place. \u201cWhy do you think all situations can be improved by the removal of clothing?\u201d</p> <p>He snickered, taking his own seat and offering me a slice of bread. \u201cWell, first\u2014nah, that\u2019s too easy. Anyway, I do it because it freaks you out, and that\u2019s pretty damned adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an altogether bizarre personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back atcha, honey.\u201d</p><p>I giggled. I couldn\u2019t help it. This strange, thrown-together meal was the first opportunity I\u2019d had to relax since I\u2019d arrived in the States. And here was a beautiful, peculiar man sitting in front of me, who didn\u2019t know anything about me or my family or what we could do. I could be normal with him, or what seemed to pass for normal between the two of us. It was lovely.</p><p>\u201cSo, I noticed the quote-unquote \u2018car\u2019 in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s transportation,\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd when I find a job, it will get me there, so I will eventually be able to pay for an upgrade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat brings you down to the Hollow, if you don\u2019t mind my askin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed a change of scenery. Too many northern winters,\u201d I lied smoothly. \u201cWhat about you? How long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months,\u201d Jed said, taking a large bite of dumplings. \u201cI\u2019m from a little town in Tennessee, just a few hours\u2019 drive from here. I do carpentry work and general construction, especially in older buildings where the restoration work can be delicate. Jobs in my area were dryin\u2019 up. A contractor from the Hollow put an ad in the paper, lookin\u2019 for people who could handle that sort of work, so I moved. My boss, Sam, was hired to renovate this house. I needed a place to stay, so the owner agreed to give me a break on rent while we completed the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your family think of your moving here?\u201d I asked, trying to avoid questions about potentially angry girlfriends who might not appreciate his constant state of shirtlessness in my presence.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not happy about it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty close-knit, and I\u2019m the first one to move away in a long time. But it was just somethin\u2019 I had to do. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, yes, I do,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice here, so far. The people seem friendly. A little strange sometimes, but I think that\u2019s expected anytime you move somewhere new. That reminds me, have you seen anything weird around the house at night? Like a big dog in the back garden?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of surprise warped his features for just a second, before he tamped it down. \u201cNo, nothing weird. Unless you count our neighbor Paul, who\u2019s built a full-size wrestling ring in his backyard. He and his friends have \u2018matches\u2019 on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>Well, that did qualify, I supposed. \u201cDo they wear the spandex and tights?\u201d I asked, struggling to keep a straight face.</p> <p>Jed nodded. \u201cIf he invites you over this Saturday, just say no.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, and we fell into companionable silence as we ate.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your deal?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour deal,\u201d he said again. \u201cMarried? Boyfriend? Vow of celibacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always pose personal questions so abruptly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get more honest answers that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIs he gonna be movin\u2019 here anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, picturing Stephen attending the monster-truck rally scheduled at the McLean County fairgrounds that weekend. As much as the \u201cwoo-woo supernatural shite\u201d irked Stephen, his apprehension around my family had a lot to do with our \u201cearthiness.\u201d Living in the Hollow would be the equivalent of a permanent migraine for Stephen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t see him moving here.\u201d</p><p>Jed shrugged. \u201cI give it six months.\u201d</p><p>I choked on a bite of bread and downed a large gulp of water to clear my throat. I spluttered. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong-distance relationships don\u2019t work. And you said yourself, you\u2019re makin\u2019 a life here, and you don\u2019t see this guy movin\u2019 out to the Hollow. So you either didn\u2019t think this move through, which is doubtful because you seem the type to think everything through. Or you did it on purpose, because you knew that movin\u2019 out here would eventually kill off the relationship. You broke up with him without havin\u2019 to be the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my spoon frozen halfway to my mouth. \u201cAre you on medications I should be aware of, or is this some sort of personality disorder at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I just don\u2019t like it when ladies use the long-distance boyfriend as a human shield,\u201d he retorted. \u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to determine whether this dinner is good enough to put up with your nonsense or if I should abandon my bowl and storm out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took another bite. \u201cCome to a decision yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurse Carol-Anne Reilly and her devil dumplings,\u201d I grumbled into my meal. Jed laughed. \u201cBut honestly, you can\u2019t say that sort of thing to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bounds of common courtesy?\u201d I proposed. \u201cConversational filters that most people grasp by the time they\u2019re ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour prim Yankee voice sayin\u2019 \u2018common courtesy\u2019 while you look over the top of your little wire-rim glasses is doing strange things to me,\u201d he said, grinning impishly. \u201cDo you think you could put your hair up in a bun when you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou have a librarian fetish.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, all innocent brown eyes and choirboy smiles. \u201cNot a fetish, more like a fascination. So what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to ruin our burgeoning friendship by reacting honestly to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he said, offering me another slice of bread and none too subtly moving the knife to his side of the table. \u201cSo where do you think you\u2019ll look for work?\u201d</p><p>And that was the end of the confrontational portion of our conversation. Jed seemed to sense how far he could push me. All discussions of Stephen were off-limits from then on. We talked about his hometown of Hazeltine and about his family, which seemed almost as large and \u201ccolorful\u201d as my own. I got the impression that there was a lot of information he was leaving out. That was fine, since I gave him a heavily edited version of my own childhood\u2014growing up in Boston, the only child of Anna McGavock and her physician husband, moving in with my grandmother after my father died.</p><p>Jed was a good listener, although there was a lot I couldn\u2019t tell him. I could have said that my parents had divorced but not that when my dear departed mother met Martin Leary, an American medical student touring through Dublin, she assumed she would be marrying into money. In her mind, \u201cdoctor\u201d equaled \u201crich,\u201d although Dad was traveling as cheaply as possible. Dad\u2019s parents, who had died when I was a baby, had saved for years to send him overseas as a graduation present.</p><p>Getting pregnant with me as quickly as possible seemed like the best way to secure her future, or so she thought. She wasn\u2019t counting on marrying a student who was working his way through medical school while bartending. Dad said the look on her face when he brought her home to his tiny walk-up apartment over a pizza shop had been priceless.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell Jed about my mother\u2019s meager magical gifts, how she saw them as a natural advantage over regular people. That she would take the neighbors\u2019 wives for their pin money by offering tarot readings, telling them what they wanted to hear, even if she saw trouble in the cards. I couldn\u2019t tell him about the irresponsible fertility rites, the love spells on Dad\u2019s coworkers, just for her own amusement, or the money spells my aunts and uncles were smart enough not to try that she did two or three times a year. Her \u201cprayers\u201d always created a windfall, but then we would end up with a major car repair or a cracked foundation at our new house or some disaster that sucked up whatever money she\u2019d gained and then some. I couldn\u2019t tell him about her abandoning us, about the years of absence and that final explosive argument before she left for good. This was definitely not appropriate getting-to-know-you banter.</p><p>Clearly, being irritated and sharing personal history were not a good combination. I hadn\u2019t thought about my mother this much in months. But now that I knew a bit more about Nana Fee, it was ironic that my mother did just as Nana had, seducing the first American tourist she came across. Mother just did it a bit more permanently.</p><p>Dinner was followed by pecan pie, prepared by yet another church lady. I helped Jed clear the table and looked up at the clock on the microwave. How could it be eleven o\u2019clock already? Between my confessions to Jane and Andrea and trying to keep up with Jed\u2019s abrupt directness, I was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dinner,\u201d I said, moving toward the door. \u201cIt was an experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he said, throwing a dishtowel over his shoulder as he followed me through the living room. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019m sorry if I threw you with the questions about the boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there questions?\u201d I chuckled, opening the door wide. The moon had risen, bright and full, casting silvered light across the dark expanse of lawn. \u201cI thought it was mostly insulting assumptions and forecasts of impending doom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did feed you,\u201d he noted, eyeing the door warily. He stepped back toward the kitchen. \u201cThat has to count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d I assured him. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll make dinner, so I can demand extremely personal information from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m an open book.\u201d</p><p>An open book who seemed to have some serious issues with being outdoors after dark. He seemed absolutely incapable of stepping closer to me as long as the front door was open. What was his issue? Was he phobic? Did he owe vampires money? I opened the door a bit wider, and he immediately took another step back.</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think so. Good night,\u201d I said, slipping into the moonlight and closing the door behind me.</p><p>5</p><p>Dream journeys are rare and beautiful gifts. If you are blessed with a spirit guide, it\u2019s best not to sass him.</p><p>\u2014Have You Ever Seen a Dream Walking:</p><p>A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Otherworldly Travel</p><p>The judgmental panda bear was not amused by my rich fantasy life.</p><p>I was in the middle of one of my usual \u201cDaniel Craig is hypothermic and needs your body heat to survive\u201d dreams when, suddenly, Daniel morphed into Jed. And in my subconscious, a low-core-temperature Jed is a randy Jed. Sadly, my neighbor and his pouty, slightly blue lips disappeared before things could get interesting. I was left wearing some strange, quilted clothing, walking up the foothills of a densely forested mountain. But instead of trees, I was carefully picking my way through bamboo stalks two and three stories high. The air was cool and fragrant with the green scent of growth and turned earth. To my left, a fat panda sat hunched against a rock, munching on a stalk of his favorite green treat and giving me a look that said, \u201cLike you would have a shot with Daniel Craig, you silly twit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought panda bears were supposed to be all sweet and cuddly,\u201d I muttered, stepping carefully around an outcropping of jagged rock.</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, they can be nasty little sneaks,\u201d a slightly creaky voice said. My head snapped up, and I found a thin, elderly version of Mr. Wainwright sitting before me on the outcropping. He was sitting cross-legged, wearing the same sort of quilted pajama-style jacket and trousers I\u2019d donned. \u201cEspecially if they think you have something edible on your person. Lost a pair of pants to a panda once. Lesson learned: do not keep beef jerky in your front pocket.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped, and my eyes flicked toward the panda, whose baleful expression now said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m only here for the buffet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis is a dream,\u201d he said, stretching a cool, dry hand toward mine. And when I was unable to respond, he shook it gently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m your grandfather, or at least, your subconscious\u2019s idea of what your grandfather would look and sound like. Can I just say it\u2019s wonderful to meet you? I have to say I\u2019m a little surprised it took you this long to show up. But no matter, we\u2019re here now, and we can get to know each other under the watchful eye of that gluttonous panda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought\u2014I never dreamed I would have this opportunity.\u201d As he smiled broadly, his eyes disappeared. \u201cDo you think you could call me Grandpa?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I said, my face still frozen in an expression of shock and confusion. \u201cCan you tell me where you stashed the Elements, so I can pick them up and can go home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I told you, I\u2019m not really your grandfather. I\u2019m a figment of your subconscious. I don\u2019t have any answers or information that you don\u2019t already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s supremely unhelpful.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright frowned. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you\u2019d like to ask me that\u2019s not related to the Elements?\u201d</p><p>I stared at this sweet-faced old man with his conical straw hat. There were a lot of questions running through my head at the moment, most of them more hostile than I\u2019d anticipated. How could he have abandoned my grandmother, who loved him? Did he realize how different my mother\u2019s life would have been\u2014how different she would have been\u2014if he\u2019d stuck around? Did he really want to know me, or was this only his way of socializing now that he was dead?</p><p>I kind of wanted to slug him, which was just confirmation that the panda was right to judge me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for a family reunion. I came here because Nana left the task to me. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Wainwright eyed me speculatively. \u201cWell, I see Fiona passed her obstinate nature on to you. Good for you, I suppose. I guess I wouldn\u2019t want you to make this too easy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is \u2018this\u2019?\u201d I asked, gesturing at the rural Chinese landscape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever you want it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your dream. It\u2019s your way of processing all of the information and emotions you\u2019re absorbing. Sometimes people know the answers to their own questions, but they\u2019re either unable or unwilling to express them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re my id\u2019s bitchy spokesman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that label,\u201d he said, wincing.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my label, and I\u2019m sticking with it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright lifted a bushy gray eyebrow. \u201cJust to annoy me?\u201d I nodded. \u201cGood girl. Now, since you seem single-minded in your line of conversation, I have a piece of advice for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned impishly, hopped to his feet with surprising spryness, and slung a heavy rucksack over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re trusting the right people, for the most part.\u201d</p><p>I turned toward the panda, who was shaking his head at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d I cried. \u201cHow has this been helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Nola?\u201d Mr. Wainwright was already yards away, but I could hear him clear as a bell\u2014an advantage, I supposed, to dream logic. He winked at me. \u201cWe always have a choice, dear.\u201d</p><p>True to her word, the moment Jane opened the shop the next night, she welcomed me into the storeroom and helped me sort through the last of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s dirty, much-abused cardboard boxes. Jane told me of the first night she wandered into the shop after a disastrous flirtation with a career in telemarketing. The store was crowded with messy, decrepit bookshelves, one of which nearly collapsed on top of Jane. The former librarian was in physical pain at the sight of such disorder and began organizing the titles. Mr. Wainwright found her like that, surrounded by neat stacks of books, and hired her as his assistant on the spot.</p><p>\u201cUntil I was hired, the storeroom was like that village in Brigadoon. Wainwright would find something\u2014a book or artifact\u2014and shove it in here, and then a bookshelf would fall against the door, and he would lose track of it for a decade or so. I\u2019m sorry. I wish I could remember more details of what I sorted through, but to be honest, the weeks after your grandfather\u2019s death were a blur. I could have chucked Excalibur into the recycling bin, and I wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d Jane said, carefully lifting what looked like a mummified monkey\u2019s paw from its cardboard tomb. My shoulders slumped as we sifted through the remaining boxes and found nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep these, if you don\u2019t mind my asking? There doesn\u2019t seem to be much of value here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSomething in that box over there bit Jane\u2019s hand, so she gave up and declared that she was done,\u201d Andrea said from the doorway of the storeroom.</p><p>I dropped the box I was holding.</p><p>Jane winced, grabbing at her head. \u201cNola! Jell-O shield! Panic makes your brain sound like a car alarm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are spiders in these boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say spiders,\u201d Jane muttered. \u201cYour grandfather collected a lot of bizarre artifacts. Some of them were \u2018interactive.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t look up at me while she said this. In fact, she hadn\u2019t looked me in the eye since I\u2019d arrived earlier in the evening. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that she and Andrea were a bit off-kilter. They kept glancing at the door and then at the clock, and they seemed to be having quiet, quick arguments whenever I was out of earshot. And every time I tried to ask them what was wrong, they asked me random questions about magic. Did I have a familiar? (No, but I did have a lovely tank full of tropical fish.) Could I really cast a love spell? (Yes, but relationships based on love potions or spells were notoriously fickle and required nearly constant contact with the subject to maintain the \u201cthrall\u201d of the caster.) What did witches do on Halloween? (In my case, stayed home and tried to avoid the costume party at my uncle Jack\u2019s.)</p><p>The interrogation was becoming rather annoying, a compounding factor on top of my \u201cpanda dream\u201d tension. I didn\u2019t know what to make of my grandfather\u2019s presence in my dreams. It had been easier, I supposed, to think of Mr. Wainwright in terms of his faded photographic image. Talking to him, having him ask me to call him Grandpa, was a strange mixture of getting what I\u2019d wanted for years\u2014a grandfather\u2014and confronting feelings I wasn\u2019t quite ready for.</p><p>With the storeroom search at a standstill, Jane sent me out to my car to retrieve the sketches of the Elements while she made me some tea. I was in such a tizzy to start the search that I\u2019d left them in my passenger seat. When I returned, a tall, handsome man with dirty-blond hair was standing behind the bar, making some notes in a ledger.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello there,\u201d the man drawled. \u201cDick Cheney. What can I do for you this fine evening?\u201d</p><p>Dick Cheney, my landlord. It was odd that I hadn\u2019t seen him enter the shop, but Jane said she and the rest of the staff often used the back entrance. I didn\u2019t particularly care for Mr. Cheney\u2019s impish grin or his insinuating tone, which, now that I knew Jed, I recognized as a classic flirtatious opening. Considering that he was married to Andrea, I did not find this flattering in the least. He seemed so . . . not quite trustworthy. The tacky \u201cCome to the Dark Side\u2014We Have Cookies\u201d T-shirt, the shaggy hair, the smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nola Leary. Jane\u2019s helping me with some research,\u201d I said coolly. \u201cAnd if you have time, I\u2019d like to talk to you about a not-so-small pest-control issue at the Wainwright house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the new tenant,\u201d Mr. Cheney said, a wide, friendly grin breaking through that smirk. He set his bottle of synthetic blood aside, took my hand in his, and pressed it between his cool ones. \u201cA marked improvement over your predecessor. Cranky old woman with a lot of cats. Awfully fond of mothballs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what the smell is?\u201d I asked as Jane and Andrea emerged from the back of the shop. Both stopped in their tracks and exchanged significant glances when they saw that I was talking to Dick. What was with the two of them? Was I in danger? Was Mr. Cheney in the habit of dragging renters into dark alleys and making snacks of them?</p><p>\u201cUm, Dick\u2014\u201d Andrea started, but Jane stopped her.</p><p>\u201cIris said you were from Ireland!\u201d Dick exclaimed, the soul of cheerfulness. \u201cI only detect the slightest bit of an accent, but it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>There was a pregnant pause. Andrea clapped a hand over her face. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to come up with a good Lucky Charms joke and/or nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeprechauns are also an option,\u201d Jane told me.</p><p>I gave the vampire my sweetest smile. \u201cMr. Cheney, are you interested in a debilitating crotch injury?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should probably keep those jokes to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Dick beamed at his wife. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>Andrea sighed. \u201cDick, sweetheart, Nola claims to be Mr. Wainwright\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>The news seemed somehow to stun my landlord. He nodded slowly, his face sagging and blank, as if he\u2019d just been struck by a frying pan. \u201cWell, of course, she is.\u201d And suddenly, the vampire threw his arms around me in a spine-cracking hug and lifted me off the floor. \u201cOh.\u201d He sighed, giving me a long squeeze. \u201cI am so happy to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe,\u201d I wheezed into his shoulder, and he loosened his grip immediately.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what a surprise this is,\u201d he said, a pleased smile breaking through the shell-shocked expression. \u201cI thought Gilbert was the last, you see. But now here you are, and you\u2019re just so beautiful. Look at you!\u201d He took my face between his hands and scrunched up my cheeks. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019ve got Gilbert\u2019s eyes. And his nose! Look at that, Andi! She has his nose! Isn\u2019t she gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>Jane cleared her throat. \u201cDick?\u201d</p><p>Dick gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cCrossing a line?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my eyes wide and alarmed, like one of those upsetting anime characters.</p><p>\u201cDick and Mr. Wainwright were really close,\u201d Andrea told me, carefully removing Dick\u2019s hand from my face.</p><p>Dick looked in Jane\u2019s direction and seemed to be thinking furiously at her, which was rather funny to watch. Dick would squint. Jane would make a vague gesture. Dick would squint even harder. Jane would shrug.</p><p>Meanwhile, Andrea retrieved the sleeve of sketches I\u2019d dropped on the floor during Dick\u2019s hugging tirade. \u201cThese are beautiful, Nola. Even if they weren\u2019t of historical value, your nana had a wonderful eye for detail.\u201d She carefully shuffled through the old papers. \u201cSo each of the artifacts represents one of the four elements?\u201d she asked, while Jane tried to give a Dick a brief summary of why I was in the Hollow and what the hell Andrea was talking about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took out the sketch of the object Nana had called \u201cSea,\u201d which was your typical silver bell, dotted with intricate Celtic designs that spiraled out like ripples on the surface of water. Nana described it as heavy and \u201cflat,\u201d meaning it never quite rang with the delicate, resonant note it was meant to have. The next sketch showed a circular clay altar plaque, \u201cEarth,\u201d which was vaguely shaped like an acorn. Then there was \u201cAir,\u201d the long, thin ritual knife used to direct energy flowing through the air. Ritual knives were also associated with fire, but I suppose my ancestors wanted to be as obvious as possible by using a magically preserved candle\u2014\u201cFlame\u201d\u2014to represent fire.</p><p>Jane joined us, poring over the sketches to see if she recognized anything. When her gaze landed on the rendering of Flame, she gasped. \u201cOh, no!\u201d She clapped her hands over her face and began cursing vehemently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you threw it out, Jane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, nothing like that,\u201d she promised, looking up at me with a distinct grimace. \u201cI may have given that candle to my mama for Mother\u2019s Day last year.\u201d</p><p>Dick broke out of his near-catatonic staring-at-me state and let out a loud, barking laugh. \u201cYou regifted your mama something from the shop for Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever gave it to me as a gift; therefore, it is not a regift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pay for it!\u201d Andrea protested.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the storeroom before I got here?\u201d Jane demanded. \u201cTrust me, I paid for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan we focus on the fact that Jane\u2019s mother may be using my family\u2019s magical heritage to decorate her guest bath? We need to get to your parents\u2019 house before she decides to light it!\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, followed by Jane and Andrea laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you two find this so amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Andrea giggled, wiping at her eyes. \u201cJane\u2019s mama would never put something that Jane gave her as a gift in a public area of the house. Someone might see it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeptical Nola is skeptical.\u201d Jane snickered. She was very good at reading human facial expressions. \u201cTrust me, I couldn\u2019t have put it in a safer place.\u201d</p><p>When we arrived at Jane\u2019s parents\u2019 perfect little brick house, a woman with a pert brown bob practically ran out the front door to greet us. I was introduced to Sherry Jameson and immediately smothered with hugs, which were only half as intrusive as the hugs Dick had showered on me when I attempted to leave the shop. Andrea threatened to \u201ctranq-dart\u201d him when he insisted that he would come with us, that he didn\u2019t want to let me out of his sight just yet.</p> <p>I thought she was kidding right until the moment Jane\u2019s handsome husband, Gabriel, showed up at the shop and asked why Andrea had wanted their tranq gun. Personally, I was curious as to why Jane and Gabriel had their own tranq gun.</p><p>Mrs. Jameson was so pleased to meet a young person she could feed that she sat me down at the table and heated up a plateful of chicken pot pie. Mr. Jameson, a quiet, academic sort of man, sequestered himself against the counter, by the stove, and shared commiserating glances with his daughter. There was something off about the way he was standing. He seemed a bit pale, as if he wasn\u2019t at his full strength.</p><p>\u201cIs your father all right?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had that same pinched expression on his face ever since he retired. He spends a lot of time at home.\u201d Jane sent a significant look at her mother.</p><p>\u201cCome on, now, Nola, take a great big bite!\u201d Mrs. Jameson chirped, sliding the plate in front me with near-maniacal glee.</p><p>\u201cI actually had a really large lunch, Mrs. Jameson, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m hungry enough to eat again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shush, you need some meat on your bones,\u201d Mrs. Jameson said, nudging the plate toward me.</p><p>If you can hear me right now, Jane, I am going to smack you later, I thought while glaring at her. And despite a clear expression of discomfort on her face, she was still smirking. She could hear me.</p> <p>Stop smiling like that, or I\u2019ll do the Emergency Broadcast System beep again.</p><p>Jane\u2019s lips twitched, but she said nothing. Still, it was very convenient having a mind-reader around. It was far more efficient than text-messaging.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some sweet tea, Nola?\u201d</p><p>I sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019d love a good cup of tea, Mrs. Jameson, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Jameson fairly flitted to the refrigerator, pulled out a tall pitcher of brownish liquid, and poured a tall glass over ice. I tamped down the small flare of disappointment. I\u2019d forgotten that hot tea wasn\u2019t exactly the beverage of choice in Kentucky. It was no problem, really. My dad had enjoyed the odd iced tea now and then, so I accepted it graciously when Mrs. Jameson handed me the glass. I took a long sip, and a sickeningly sweet, near-syrup concoction flooded my mouth, making me choke and sputter.</p><p>Mrs. Jameson fussed and cooed, patting me on the back while I coughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I wheezed.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Jane said, pouring me a glass of water. \u201cI forgot to warn you about sweet tea. It\u2019s basically liquid cotton candy, equal parts sugar and tea. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, wiping my mouth with my napkin. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d Mrs. Jameson fretted. \u201cFrom now on, you should probably stick with unsweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with coffee,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>My attention was drawn to Mr. Jameson, whose shoulders seemed hunched while he stirred a pan of sauce on the stove. I could sense a painful red buzzing somewhere in the vicinity of his head. A nagging, throbbing ache. It was almost powerful enough to distract me from the burgeoning tooth decay in my own mouth.</p><p>Can we ask your mother about the candle before she feeds me something that causes violent hives or vomiting? I thought to Jane.</p><p>Jane cleared her throat and seemed to compose the question carefully in her head before speaking. \u201cMama, do you remember the candle I gave you for Mother\u2019s Day? It was a white candle with pretty symbols carved into the wax? Do you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s mother blanched but managed to cover it quickly. She chuckled, waving in an offhand manner. \u201cOh, well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s around here somewhere. Why don\u2019t you give me a few days to look around, and I\u2019ll call you when I find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Mrs. Jameson, it\u2019s really important for us to find it straightaway,\u201d I said. \u201cWould you mind if we looked for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I can\u2019t imagine where it is,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cMama, it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Jameson cleared his throat. Mrs. Jameson snapped her head up to glare at him. \u201cSherry, you need to show them the closet,\u201d Mr. Jameson told her.</p><p>\u201cJohn, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry,\u201d he said in a stern, warning tone.</p><p>Mrs. Jameson sighed. \u201cCome with me, girls.\u201d She pulled me gently from my chair and led us toward the stairs. \u201cJohn, stir those peas,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Mrs. Jameson led us upstairs, past an impeccably decorated master bedroom done in mauves and creams, into a smaller guest bedroom. Jane informed me that this had been her room until she left for college. Her mother had only removed Jane\u2019s boy-band posters and unicorn figurines the year before when Jane got married.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jane, I don\u2019t want you to think I don\u2019t appreciate the things that you give me,\u201d her mother said, standing as a human shield between us and Jane\u2019s old closet.</p><p>\u201cJust open the door, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Jameson cringed as she turned the doorknob. The closet was packed floor to ceiling with various gift boxes. It was like that scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, where the Ark of the Covenant was packed away with rows and rows of other priceless treasures. Jane was looking at the preserved remains of every gift-giving occasion since her elementary-school days.</p><p>And given the way her mouth was hanging open, I don\u2019t think that made her very happy.</p><p>\u201cWe just have different tastes in d\u00e9cor,\u201d Mrs. Jameson offered weakly.</p><p>Instead of throwing a box-pitching tantrum, as I expected, Jane burst out laughing. She bent at the waist and guffawed like a deranged hyena. \u201cWhen I think of all the time I spent in Pier One!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re on a strict diet of gift cards from now on.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Jameson bit her lip and nodded. \u201cI think that would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just sell them at a garage sale? Or give them away?\u201d Jane demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be rude!\u201d Mrs. Jameson cried.</p><p>\u201cBet you don\u2019t put Jenny\u2019s gifts in a closet,\u201d Jane muttered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that,\u201d her mother warned her.</p><p>\u201cOK, so are these in chronological order?\u201d Jane sighed. \u201cIf I dig deep enough, will I find the clay handprint I made for you in kindergarten?\u201d</p><p>Since Jane seemed to find the situation funny, Mrs. Jameson had relaxed a bit and stopped trying to wedge herself between us and her trove of rejected treasures. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no order to it. It was sort of like playing Jenga with gift boxes. I just stacked it however it would fit.\u201d</p><p>Jane shot an amused glance my way and rolled up her sleeves. \u201cI hope you like tedious stacking games, Nola.\u201d</p><p>I bloody hated Jenga.</p><p>We\u2019d been through nearly every box in the closet, and so far, we\u2019d found tea towels, sets of bath products in various smells, and a frightening number of angel figurines.</p><p>\u201cI thought you collected these!\u201d Jane exclaimed, chucking another reject over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo, your grandmother used to give them to me every year, and I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that I found them downright creepy,\u201d Mrs. Jameson confessed with a shudder. \u201cAnd then you girls got to the age when you started buying us gifts, and you sort of latched onto the angels. And by then, it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to take a break,\u201d Jane muttered. \u201cMama, do you still keep the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaux Type O, red label, in the vegetable crisper,\u201d Mrs. Jameson assured her. \u201cNola, can I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore water, please?\u201d I asked, smiling despite the fact that my teeth still tingled a bit from the sucrose assault on my dental enamel.</p><p>I heard their voices fade as they descended the stairs. I flopped back onto the guest bed and closed my eyes. My head felt cloudy, and my nose itched from all the dust in the closet. How in the bloody hell did I get here? I wondered. Lying in some strangers\u2019 guest room, rifling through their unwanted knickknacks. Just a few weeks ago, I\u2019d had a normal life with a normal job. Well, seminormal. I was able to pretend well enough that Stephen hadn\u2019t run for the hills.</p><p>Aw, hellfire, I\u2019d forgotten to call Stephen again.</p><p>He was going to be furious with me! And rightly so. I\u2019d been in town for days, and I had only called him once. Even after my shirtless Neanderthal neighbor mocked our relationship, I\u2019d just sloughed off to bed and fallen asleep. This did not bode well. It boded . . . very badly.</p><p>I was starting to realize how little Stephen really fit into my life. I tried so hard to compartmentalize our time together so it wouldn\u2019t overlap with my family life. That wasn\u2019t healthy. I could imagine Jed sitting around with my uncles at the Black Sheep, sharing horrid, manly stories. I could see him charming my aunts in a way that didn\u2019t make them feel condescended to. I shook off these thoughts, as they were neither likely nor productive. Nor were they fair to Stephen.</p><p>Squirming on the purple quilted bedspread, I dug my cell phone out of my jacket pocket and dialed Stephen\u2019s number. It was ungodly early by Dublin time, but I thought perhaps I could blame exhaustion and time difference for my lack of communication. I sat up slowly as the call went to voice mail. I yawned loudly and tried to sound addled and sleepy. It wasn\u2019t that much of a stretch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHullo, darling, I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called already. I think I\u2019m still a bit wiped out . . .\u201d I trailed off as I caught sight of a box at the very back of the top shelf. It was about the size of a shoe box and just the right size for the candle with a swatch of Specialty Books\u2019s signature blue wrapping tissue. Realizing that this soundless voice-mail message was costing me a fortune, I hastily added, \u201cI\u2019ll call again soon. Love you. Bye-bye!\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Americans believed in building impossibly high closet shelves. Even with the help of a small stepping stool, I had to lean a bit on the shelf to brace myself up. It was at times like this I wished I was telekinetic instead of a witch. Then again, I already had the unstable mother. I didn\u2019t want to risk falling into Carrie territory.</p><p>No, wait, I was falling anyway.</p> <p>\u201cYipe!\u201d I shouted as my weight shifted forward. Yanking the shelf down with my weight, I tumbled off the stool and onto the piles of boxes, crushing several of them as I landed. Just when I thought I could sit up, the box I was reaching for slid off the tilted shelf and landed on my head. \u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Jane cried, running back into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI believe I broke a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Mrs. Jameson told me, helping me to my feet. \u201cIt gives me an excuse to throw them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d muttered Jane.</p> <p>The box that had clobbered me was half open on the floor, the blue tissue spilling over the lid. I crouched over the box, removing the lid carefully. Inside was a long, creamy-white pillar candle, carved with ancient symbols for fire. I checked it over carefully. But I could tell from the pleasant, nearly electric hum I felt coming from the wax that this was the candle in question.</p><p>\u201cI found it!\u201d I exclaimed, beaming up at my companions.</p><p>I hugged the box to my chest as Jane and Sherry Jameson clapped and cheered for me. I felt like crying and laughing and screaming all at the same time. It was such a relief to know that I was one-quarter of the way to my goal, that the Kerrigans were that much farther away from it. And I\u2019d done it without spending any of the buy money, leaving me that much more to work with for the other three.</p><p>Suddenly, the goal of finding all four objects didn\u2019t seem so impossible. It was a bit like fishing. You got one little taste of success and lost all perspective regarding the amount of time or frustration that had led you there. I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to the shop and look for the others.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy for you,\u201d Jane told me, throwing an arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jameson, I\u2019m going to have to take this candle away from you.\u201d</p> <p>Jane snorted. \u201cMama, if you let Nola have this candle, I will forget all about the Closet of Misfit Gifts. Also, I will write the remaining thank-you notes for the wedding gifts.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Jameson cried, \u201cYou haven\u2019t finished all the thank-you notes yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama.\u201d Jane\u2019s face was passive as she nodded her head toward the mountain of unappreciated presents.</p><p>Mrs. Jameson sighed. \u201cDone.\u201d She turned on me. \u201cNow, Nola, are you still hungry? Because I have some leftover pot pie, smothered pork chops, smoked chicken, Salisbury steak, and some other goodies in the fridge. Would you like me to fix you a plate? Or I can just make up a little leftover care package to take home!\u201d</p><p>I shot a frantic glance Jane, thinking, Jane, your mother seems to think I\u2019m some sort of goose for the gorge. Could you please tell her that your dad is suffering from a serious toothache? He\u2019s trying to ignore it, but he could end up needing a root canal if he doesn\u2019t get it treated. It might distract her enough to get me out of here.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what that is?\u201d she whispered, while her mother rattled on.</p><p>Jane frowned at me, arching an eyebrow. I added silently, I\u2019ll explain later.</p><p>\u201cActually, Mama, I was hoping to talk to Daddy,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI noticed he was awfully pale earlier, and he wasn\u2019t eating. Has he said anything about his teeth?\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Jameson fell on the information like a bloodhound on scent. \u201cNo, is he all right? Is this something you picked up using your . . .\u201d Jane\u2019s mother paused and made a face that was half squinting, half constipation.</p><p>Jane studied the expression for a moment longer than necessary, I would think. It seemed \u201cFunny Faces with Sherry Jameson\u201d amused her. Finally, she said, \u201cOh, yes, the mind-reading thing. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s how I picked it up. And he\u2019s trying to hide it from you, hoping it will go away on its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man.\u201d Mrs. Jameson sighed. \u201cI swear, you\u2019d think he would be more mature about something like going to the dentist. I had two babies, including Jane and her big ol\u2019 pumpkin head, without drugs, and you didn\u2019t hear me complaining.\u201d She took a deep breath and called, \u201cJohn, I need to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou complain about that all the time!\u201d Jane exclaimed as she followed her down the stairs. \u201cOtherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have already come up with the phrase \u2018Jane and her big ol\u2019 pumpkin head.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>While Mrs. Jameson started in on poor Mr. Jameson and his dental phobias, Jane turned on me. \u201cI hope we just threw my dad under the bus for a good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your mother not smothering me with Southern cuisine is an excellent reason for your dad to get the dental attention he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to explain that later,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAll I could hear him thinking was that his drink was \u2018too damn cold\u2019 but if he said anything, my mom would fuss at him. You owe information, witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, \u2019cause psychic powers are clearly something you\u2019re uncomfortable with, mind-reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeprechaun,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cCow.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>When you are invited to partake in the rituals of supernatural creatures, it\u2019s best to follow the lead of the closest human\u2014if that human seems sane and somewhat likeable.</p><p>\u2014Miss Manners\u2019 Guide to Undead Etiquette</p><p>Using Jane\u2019s computer, I sent a short e-mail to Penny reporting on my progress: \u201cFire\u2019s lit. Update soon.\u201d</p><p>The problem was that now that I had one of the Elements, I didn\u2019t have a place to store it safely. My uncle Jack had built a canny little storage cabinet to keep the items \u201cclean\u201d once they\u2019d been found and purified. The cabinet had arrived in Seamus\u2019s shipment earlier that afternoon, along with what Penny called an \u201cemergency witch kit\u201d: an athame, incense burners, candles in various colors, tiny vials of herbal oils, a silver altar pentacle, and a carved wooden box (also Jack\u2019s handiwork) that doubled as an altar.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t have a safe location to store said cabinet. Considering its vulnerabilities to local angry wildlife, I didn\u2019t think I could trust the house.</p><p>Jane\u2019s shop had an old-fashioned heavy-duty safe. After I completed my \u201cdance of joy\u201d in her mother\u2019s guest room, she offered to let me store my things there. Although I\u2019d only known her a few days, I trusted Jane. She didn\u2019t have to tell me her mother had the candle. She seemed content helping me complete a task that was important to me, because I would have been important to Mr. Wainwright.</p><p>Penny had highlighted purification rituals in Witchcraft for Total Morons for me, which I would have found insulting if not for the fact that it had so many helpful illustrations. After enclosing the candle in its compartment full of sea salt and securing the cabinet in Jane\u2019s safe\u2014along with Nana\u2019s sketches\u2014I went back to the Wainwright house and collapsed.</p><p>Jed\u2019s windows were dark, and for that I was grateful. The man was an unpredictable, sexy storm cloud. I never knew if he was going to make pretty shapes or rain all over my parade.</p><p>I climbed into my bed and slept soundly for the first time in weeks, without benefit of herbal tea or soothing pharmaceuticals. I slept deep and dreamless for about an hour before my mobile rang. Grumbling murderous threats against humanity at large, I slapped my hand around on my nightstand until I closed my fingers around my phone.</p><p>\u201cJane, if this is you, I am not responsible for your father\u2019s dental bills. I merely pointed out a problem. I never told your mother to take him to an all-night dentist,\u201d I growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cDarling, how are you? Why are you threatening random callers? Is it that awful and primitive there?\u201d</p><p>I bolted upright. \u201cStephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised. I have left messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called, Stephen. I just didn\u2019t expect the travel to be so hard on me,\u201d I said, allowing a yawn to escape through and emphasize my \u201cdelicate\u201d constitution. \u201cDelicate\u201d was a far more desirable quality in a girlfriend than \u201cdeceitful and forgets to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are a bit of a homebody,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how are things there in the wilds of America? Do you need me to send you anything? Soap? Magazines? Cigarettes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen, I\u2019m overseas, not in prison! And Boston is one of the largest cities in the country,\u201d I reminded him. Of course, I wasn\u2019t actually staying in Boston, but that was beside the point. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very pleasant, actually. Warm, nice people, interesting tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting as in strangely prepared, or interesting as in that time your aunt Maisie gave me tea that made me see butterflies fluttering out of my own arse?\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a giggle. Aunt Maisie had never warmed to Stephen, but she did love creative herbalism.</p><p>\u201cThe first one,\u201d I said, remembering that Bostonians had probably never heard of sweet tea. \u201cThey steep it right in the cups, can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019ve just been busy. That\u2019s all. New apartment, new job, remembering to drive on the right side of the road.\u201d</p><p>Again, I judiciously edited, because I didn\u2019t think Stephen would be impressed by my finding long-lost vampire relatives or making friends with mercurial construction workers.</p><p>\u201cWell, I miss you terribly,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is fun without you. There\u2019s no one to put her ice-cold feet on the backs of my legs while I\u2019m sleeping. No one keeps up a steady stream of trivia and interesting facts while I\u2019m watching films. I actually had to resort to watching a DVD with the director\u2019s commentary. It was demoralizing. And the bread! I\u2019m wasting the heels of my bread loaves shamelessly without you around to toast them.\u201d</p><p>A pleased, sweet warmth flooded my chest. Stephen was always noticing little things like that, which gave him considerable skill when it came to date planning. He knew exactly how far to push the gooshy romantic factor before it became too saccharine to tolerate.</p><p>\u201cThe heels make the best toast,\u201d I told him, my tone soft and amused. \u201cThe outside crust forms a protective layer to hold more jam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d I promised him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few months; it will be up before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to put our lives on hold for that long, Nola. I\u2019m holding off on this move for you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do that,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cYou could pick a flat, move in, and get settled. I\u2019ll meet you there when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make those decisions without you there. What if I pick the wrong place? I don\u2019t know why this fellowship was necessary.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cYou could have earned the same credentials here at home if you\u2019d only looked. Every time we get close to moving in together, you find some way to sabotage it. Or your family does. I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re happy living in that backward little town.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not without its charms,\u201d I insisted. \u201cOnce you get past the driving issue and the strange tea. I told you, the people are quite nice here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking about Kilcairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why wouldn\u2019t I want to live there? My whole family is there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, your family,\u201d he said in a tone he might have used if he were saying, \u201cYes, toe fungus.\u201d It was difficult for Stephen to understand how large families worked. He saw his own parents for holidays and the occasional fly-by dinners, and that was the extent of their relationship. He had no siblings, no uncles or aunts or cousins, and his grandparents died when he was in primary school. It was easy to understand why my family overwhelmed him. Although it didn\u2019t hurt my feelings any less.</p><p>\u201cStephen, I need to get off the phone. It\u2019s late here, and I need to get some sleep. I have work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call you in a few days. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I rolled over, tucking my pillow over my chin, feeling vaguely sick to my stomach. How had the conversation gone from sweet to sour so quickly? How could Stephen seem to know me so well one minute and then not at all the next? How was I going to fix this? I couldn\u2019t go running back home, abandoning a sacred duty because my boyfriend was peeved.</p><p>Stephen was just going to have to deal with it.</p> <p>I awoke to the sounds of pounding and hammering on the walls outside my bedroom. I started awake, rolled out of bed, and landed on my face. \u201cOh, what in the\u2014\u201d After stumbling to my feet, I shoved the window sash up and shoved my head outside. Men on ladders seemed to be ripping off the wooden siding in places, while others were climbing on the roof and tossing damaged shingles into the yard, where yet another man scooped them up and threw them onto an open-top wagon. At the edge of the yard, I could see a woman (who I later learned was the much-beloved Iris Scanlon) directing the delivery of several hydrangeas and rosebushes.</p><p>Jed was on the ladder just a few feet from my window, yanking a rotten shingle away from its moorings. And, of course, he was shirtless, his tanned skin glistening as he moved under the morning sun.</p><p>So far, this was a mixed bag in terms of a wake-up call.</p><p>\u201cWhat in bleeding hell is going on?\u201d I called to him.</p><p>He grinned brightly . . . or perhaps he was amused by my bed hair. \u201cMornin\u2019! I don\u2019t know what you said to Mr. Cheney, but he had Sam hire four new daytime guys to come out and put a rush job on the renovations. He said, and I quote, \u2018Fix everythin\u2019 up. Make it nice for her. No detail is too small. And don\u2019t skimp on the flowers in the front flower beds.\u2019 Also, there\u2019s an exterminator coming out this afternoon. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m gonna come in tomorrow and paint the downstairs rooms. Dick said you can stay with him for a few days if the fumes bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d It was a brilliant, eloquent response, I know. Dick had explained the night before that Mr. Wainwright had sold his family home sometime in the 1970s and, for convenience\u2019s sake, moved into the apartment above his shop. The new owners had divided it into apartments and neglected the house terribly before selling out to Dick the year before. Because of what Dick would only call \u201cJane problems,\u201d he hadn\u2019t had time to fix it up before now. Why the sudden rush after meeting me? And what did he mean, I could stay with him and Andrea if the paint fumes were too much? I barely knew these people. Why would I impose on them in that way?</p> <p>If I\u2019d had the energy, I would have whacked my head against the window frame.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s married, right?\u201d Jed said.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean, yes. I\u2019ve met his wife. I just guess I\u2019ve made a good impression on him, is all,\u201d I said, frowning while I recalled his inappropriately friendly greeting at the shop.</p><p>First, the hugs and face squeezing, and now this? What was with Dick Cheney? Had I developed my very own vampire stalker? I wondered if it was a good idea to stay in this house. Dick had keys. As my landlord, he had to give me notice before he entered, but I doubted fair rental laws would do much to protect me from an obsessive vampire. I would have to talk to Jane about this.</p><p>And if I ever woke up to find him watching me sleep, like that creepy Edward What\u2019s-his-name, I would not be responsible for my actions.</p><p>\u201cDid you meet him wearing just a towel, too?\u201d Jed asked sourly, yanking me out of my reverie. When I shot him a filthy look, he appeared vaguely contrite and added, \u201cWell, you got me job security for the next few months, so thanks for that. You go on back inside; we\u2019ll be done with the loudest work by the end of tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Mumbling indignantly, I backed into my room, searching for my robe. There was a scraping noise against the outside wall and a series of metallic clangs. Suddenly, a disembodied tanned hand slipped through the open window and dropped a small sprig with a fist-sized cluster of hydrangea blossoms onto the sill, then disappeared. I laughed, retrieved the offering from the sunny sill, and pressed my face into the velvety blue petals.</p><p>Construction time estimates being what they were, the job went on for weeks. I would wake up in the early morning to the sounds of men scraping off the outer layer of the house. Before leaving for Jane\u2019s shop, I\u2019d make breakfast and coffee, which I magnanimously offered the work crew, since they were decent enough not to look into my windows while I was in the house. Then again, Jed did imply that Dick had threatened the crew within an inch of their \u201cmiserable mortal lives\u201d if they were anything less than courtly.</p> <p>After a week or so, I established a sort of schedule. Each day, I would spend the afternoon searching through Jane\u2019s shop and sales records, looking for any sign of the Elements, under the watchful eye of Zeb Lavelle, Jane\u2019s best friend since childhood. Jane made this concession after a few nights of my research being interrupted by customers who thought I worked at the shop. Using the store\u2019s off hours allowed me to concentrate on my task, and I didn\u2019t mind Zeb serving as my babysitter. He was a kindergarten teacher, after all, and seemed fit for the task. When he wasn\u2019t reading comics or sorting through school-supply catalogues, he offered me random, sometimes sensible tips on how to survive interactions with supernatural forces. His first and foremost tip: walk softly and carry an econo-sized can of vampire pepper spray.</p><p>Whether that pepper spray was used against loved ones and acquaintances was a matter of discretion, he told me.</p><p>Strangely enough, Jane happened to have a large rolling whiteboard, like the sort used on Law &amp; Order, in the stockroom. I used to it record any potentially germane receipts, addresses, or notations I found in Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s records. Well, officially, I didn\u2019t find any of those things, but Iris was impressed with the way I divided the board into four sections and created a graph for cross-referencing. Iris was a girl who appreciated the obsessive need for order.</p><p>By turns, Dick, Andrea, Jane, and sometimes Jane\u2019s husband, Gabriel, or Zeb\u2019s wife, Jolene, would rotate into the shop to inquire about my day\u2019s progress. Zeb was sunny and adorable, like a man-sized Labrador puppy. Jolene, on the other hand, was intensely beautiful and seemed surrounded by this odd crackling energy, as if she was always on the verge of becoming something else. When I turned my powers to that mystery, all I could discern in her was an all-consuming, gnawing hunger.</p><p>They were an odd and motley crew of humans, vampires, and whatever Jolene was, but all very nice people. And they didn\u2019t seem fazed by the odd and urgent circumstances of my situation. Apparently, they had considerable experience with the odd and urgent. They simply divided the store by sections, rolled up their sleeves, and helped me sort through the stock.</p><p>I discovered an unexpected joy in spending time with Jane and Andrea. It was a bit like spending time with Penny, only they had less tact and restraint, if that was possible. They had an unnatural obsession with seeing me do magic and wouldn\u2019t accept my \u201cwonky powers\u201d excuse or the fact that I didn\u2019t want to do damage to the shop. I was considering pulling a rabbit out of a hat just to get them off of my back.</p><p>Both women were slightly left of center, looking at the world from a skewed but extremely funny perspective. They didn\u2019t fall into hysterics when there were obstacles or emergencies. They cracked a joke, made a plan, and moved on. And after Jane dropped by my house to deliver a casserole from her mother\u2014ogling Jed shamelessly, I might add\u2014teasing me about my comely shirtless neighbor became a regular source of humor for them.</p><p>They loved fiercely, from their spouses to their friends, and yes, even Jamie, the irritatingly beautiful teenage boy Jane had been forced to turn the previous year. Once you were accepted into the \u201cpack,\u201d you were in for life, and woe betide the fool who crossed you. Zeb told me it was a bit like the Mafia, only with snarky insults instead of cement shoes.</p><p>Now that I\u2019d found one of the Elements, a bit of the pressure I was under eased. I was far more aware of my surroundings, the sultry heat of late afternoons, the sunshine. Clothes that I had previously worn once, on holiday in Spain\u2014tank tops, sundresses, light sweaters, and sandals\u2014were now the main staple of my wardrobe. My skin, previously an insistent milky white, was now lightly tanned. I made sure to get some out-of-doors time each day to recharge my internal batteries with vitamin D. But I missed the wind. While I enjoyed the novelty of the heat, I missed the constant stirring of air, the whisper of the sea.</p><p>Still, I felt at home. Most people were friendly, if slightly baffled by my accent. I found myself having to repeat things, not because they didn\u2019t understand me but because they wanted to hear me say certain phrases with my inability to properly pronounce Rs. And the more time I spent around vampires, the more I could focus on fine-tuning which parts of my brain interacted with living tissue in other people. With Dick or Jane, I could feel parts of my mind reaching out to their energetic bodies, seeking out injuries and illness. When I felt my mind \u201cpinging\u201d off empty space, I found I was able to turn off the reaching. It made going to Walmart on crowded Saturday mornings a lot less painful.</p><p>Jed was an unabashed morning person, singing off-key country songs and letting the sunlight soak into his skin as he worked. He continued his cheerful, ladder-bound flirtations at my bedroom window each morning, usually teasing me about my \u201cepic\u201d case of bedhead or asking me about my agenda for the day. I would have taken offense, if not for the sprigs of hydrangea that found their way onto my windowsill, wrapped in a damp napkin and foil and tied with a white ribbon. I kept the bouquets on my nightstand, in a sweet blue pressed-glass bud vase I\u2019d found in a thrift store down the street from Specialty Books. By the third bouquet, I was beginning to worry for our poor hydrangea bushes and their impending baldness. But they were still lush with blooms. I did notice that our neighbors\u2019 bushes were looking a little patchy.</p><p>It\u2019s the thought that counts.</p><p>Late nights were blissful experiments in prolonged sleep. I was so used to being on call, just in case some medical emergency came up, I hadn\u2019t realized I was down to four or five hours of sleep per night. Here, I outfitted my bed in thin summer-weight quilts and lush cotton sheets. I built myself a veritable fort out of pillows, fluffing them into the most comfortable configuration possible before entering a semicomatose state.</p><p>It was odd, living for myself for the first time. For years, I\u2019d taken care of Nana and run the clinic. I never realized how much energy I expended diagnosing people\u2014intentionally or otherwise\u2014and the additional stress of keeping the clinic running. In her e-mails, Penny kept me updated on patients and assured me that everyone was fine, the clinic was running smoothly, and it was her turn to take care of things for a while. Still, it pricked my conscience not to be there helping her.</p><p>At this point, who knew when I\u2019d be returning? After another week of searching, I\u2019d found nary a clue to the other three Elements. I\u2019d composed a list of pawn shops and noted which were closest to the bookstore. I\u2019d contacted the list of buyers Jane described as Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s \u201cwhales,\u201d but they seemed interested primarily in books. We hadn\u2019t managed to find the ledgers that listed any specific items sold, although it seemed unlikely that Mr. Wainwright would not have kept a record of such sales. The early success of finding the candle had made me cocky, I suppose. Now my lack of progress was a bit unsettling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dick\u2019s strange attentions were another sore point. I\u2019d tried to talk to Jane about the renovations to my house and whether Dick\u2019s intentions were honorable. But she only assured me that I was perfectly safe, but she\u2019d promised Dick that she\u2019d let him talk to me himself. I found this to be cryptic and unhelpful.</p><p>If I were home, I would have taken a walk down to the cliffs to clear my head with cold sea air and blessed quiet. In the Hollow, I had only the somewhat decrepit area surrounding the shop. So I wandered the streets in the late-afternoon sun, worrying over my problems like a surreal jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>What was I doing wrong? Did the magical world smell the stink of desperation on me? Generations before me had found the Elements. But they\u2019d searched as pilgrims, with open, curious hearts. Was I so slow to progress because I was too businesslike in the approach? Or should I be even less sentimental? Approach the issue like one of those crime procedural programs with spreadsheets and forensics and such?</p> <p>Early one evening, after I cleared the block, I turned right and slowed my pace. The light was warm and pleasant. And the fresh, book-dust-free outdoors was a definite plus. I couldn\u2019t say I was comfortable with the neighborhood, all darkened storefronts and abandoned streets, but I was wearing sturdy shoes and jeans. I could outrun a bloody cheetah if startled properly.</p><p>It was interesting to see how the dividing line of commercial success ended at Paxton Avenue. On the opposite side of the intersection, I could see a prosperous town square, with restaurants and quaint little shops. But in this area, there was little bustling besides Jane\u2019s shop. The consignment shop on Prescott was flanked by a defunct comic-book store and an empty barber shop. The one business with lights blazing was a corner store that looked as if it had once been an eyewear shop. It now displayed a sign advertising \u201cHalf-Moon Hollow Community Walk-In Clinic. Services Free.\u201d</p><p>I walked closer to the door, where a small yellowed sign read, \u201cHelp Wanted,\u201d in bold red letters. I pushed the door open to find . . . complete feckin\u2019 chaos. I was bombarded by the sensations of nausea and chills rolling off of the crowded waiting room. There were women lined up five deep at the registration desk, with no nurse to check them in. Children sat slumped against chairs lining the walls, listless and pale, scratching halfheartedly at reddish spots on their arms and legs. One boy had stuffed his head into the wastebasket and was puking for all he was worth. It took me a minute of deep breathing to keep myself from rushing to the wastebasket and tossing my own breakfast.</p><p>It was after eight P.M. Every single child in this room had chicken pox. Everybody was talking at once, demanding answers, demanding that someone come out and help them. And no one seemed to be in charge.</p><p>Finally, a situation I was prepared for.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I rolled up my sleeves and slipped in past the door marked \u201cStaff Only.\u201d</p><p>Down the hall, I could hear an older man\u2019s voice as he told a Mrs. Loomis to keep Tyler hydrated and covered in calamine lotion and to give him a cool bath if his fever spiked. I assumed this was the doctor, so at least we had that going for us. I rummaged through the mess of papers until I found a sign-in sheet. At the sight of someone who seemed to know what was happening, the would-be patients and their mothers surged forward, surrounding me like something out of an itchy zombie movie.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I called over the din of questions and complaints. \u201cExcuse me, if everybody would please just\u2014\u201d No one was listening to me. They were too busy attempting to storm the registration desk. Finally, I yelled, \u201cOy!\u201d over the noise. \u201cOy! If everybody would just shut it for a moment and line up like good boys and girls, we will be able to get everybody signed up to see the doctor as quickly as possible. Now, if you haven\u2019t filled out an intake form, I suggest you do so right now.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, everybody just stared at me as if I were speaking Greek.</p><p>And then one mother handed her son off to a woman I assumed was his grandmother, marched over to a desk behind me, and found some clipboards. Two more mothers searched through their enormous purses until they found ink pens and distributed them to the others. Eventually, a single-file line was formed, and I managed to determine which kids were worst off. Every time a patient emerged from the doctor\u2019s office, I sent another kid down the hall.</p><p>This was a different, more frustrating experience than working in my clinic. Despite cousin Ralph\u2019s illegal efforts, I wasn\u2019t licensed in the state of Kentucky and couldn\u2019t practice there. I wasn\u2019t covered by the clinic\u2019s malpractice insurance. So I could not ethically make any sort of judgment calls regarding patients. I couldn\u2019t so much as slap a Band-Aid on a boo-boo. I could, however, place my hands over some of the lesser cases\u2019 foreheads when their parents registered them, and if their fevers happened to drop before they went back to the exam room, what a wonderful coincidence that would be.</p> <p>Eventually, the waiting-room crowd dwindled to a half-dozen children. A frazzled-looking elderly man in a white coat wandered behind the registration desk. Well, his coat was white once upon a time. There was a distinct orangey splash across the breast pocket, almost obscuring the swirly embroidery that read, \u201cR. Hackett, MD.\u201d</p><p>The good doctor was what Penny would have called a silver fox, or he would have been, if he\u2019d had a full head of hair. He had a perfectly trimmed salt-and-pepper Van Dyke and a head as bald as an egg. He was wrinkled and wizened but cute as a button, with steely-gray eyes and a tanned face with distinct laugh lines.</p><p>Dr. Hackett\u2019s eyes narrowed when he saw me sitting behind the desk, sorting the various reports into piles. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Maybe those weren\u2019t laugh lines.</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d I said, reaching out to shake his hand. \u201cLeary. I am a nurse practitioner, and I run a small family clinic in my hometown. I\u2019m here on an extended visit. But I know how to move people through a waiting room. You were drowning. I threw you a lifeline. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hackett cast a glance around the desk and scowled. \u201cDid you move things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, looking around at the neat stacks of files and papers. \u201cLots of them.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me. \u201cAre you mentally unstable, a drug user, a gossip, or looking for a senior-citizen sugar daddy to keep you in spray tanning and designer purses?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, to all of those,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been open this late in ten years, but one of the local day cares had a chicken-pox outbreak like a biblical plague. I\u2019ve been on my feet for sixteen hours, and I\u2019m too damn old for that, let me tell you. We normally open at eight A.M. and close at five P.M. Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you. It won\u2019t be much. We\u2019re funded through donations from different civic groups, but the budget does provide a small stipend for clerical support. In the future, try not to move things without asking first,\u201d he griped, and called for his next patient.</p><p>Did he just hire me? Did I even want to work here? Would I treat patients, or would I stick to administrative work? What would my hours be? Would it interfere with my search for the Elements? Exactly how much was not much in terms of payment?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see some references?\u201d I asked as he moved down the hall. \u201cSome identification? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to it later,\u201d he said, waving me off.</p><p>I sat back in the half-padded office chair, which was apparently mine now.</p><p>\u201cFirst, Jane falls into her job at the bookshop, and now, this,\u201d I muttered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone do job interviews in this town?\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>No happy story has ever included the words \u201cOuija board.\u201d</p><p>\u2014A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm</p><p>Although I was sweaty, disheveled, and drained, I was serenely happy as Miranda\u2019s car rolled up the driveway to the Victorian just before one A.M. I\u2019d stayed at the clinic long after the last patient had been released, clearing off the front desk and putting the waiting room back to rights. Dr. Hackett had given me keys after I filled out my employment paperwork. After informing me that everything valuable or prescribable had been locked up tight and that this was a test of my character, he marched out the front door at midnight.</p><p>And then, because I\u2019d left my car keys on the counter in the bookshop and was embarrassed to admit such a blunder to an exhausted Dr. Hackett, I\u2019d called Miranda. To my surprise, my favorite chauffeur to the undead was already awake. She\u2019d done the \u201clost keys/embarrassing emergency walk of shame\u201d enough times that she was happy to help out another damsel in frequent distress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just lucky I keep vampire hours,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that Collin is in the middle of a History Channel marathon on the War of 1812 on his TiVo. I love him dearly, but I will use any excuse to get out of watching that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ever so grateful to serve as that excuse,\u201d I told her, closing my eyes and resting my head against the seat rest.</p><p>My bones ached. My feet were screaming. There were substances I preferred not to think about on my clothes. And I was dozing off in the front seat of Miranda\u2019s SUV. All I wanted to do was shower and crawl into bed.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I heard Miranda say from the driver seat. I opened my eyes and saw her staring through the windshield, her expression one of delighted awe.</p><p>My own mouth fell open in astonishment. It was the first time I\u2019d seen the house in its fully refurbished state. My home looked like something out of a fairy tale. The siding had been replaced and painted a fresh, vibrant yellow that shone in the weak light of the fingernail moon. The roof had been reshingled. The porch had been painted to match the trim. Dick\u2019s work crews had added flower boxes to the railing, bursting with a profusion of pansies in yellow, purple, and white.</p><p>I knew about the changes to the interior. My rooms had been painted a cheerful pale pink. The dark wood and gothic wall sconces had been replaced with what Andrea called comfy farmhouse chic. The huge bank of cabinets in the kitchen was gone, and in its place was an old-fashioned tin-front pie safe. The appliances were new, and the tub upstairs no longer threatened to fall through the ceiling. The remaining cabinets had been painted white and artistically distressed. I\u2019d drawn the line at Dick buying me new bedroom furniture. I was truly frightened by the prospect of what he would choose.</p><p>I climbed out of the car, marveling at the changes Jed\u2019s crew had made. \u201cThanks, Miranda!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, babe,\u201d she called. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole series of specials on the Spanish American War next week. Call anytime.\u201d</p><p>I waved at her as she backed out of the driveway, then returned to staring at the house in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you keep your mouth open like that, you\u2019re gonna catch mosquitoes.\u201d</p><p>My jaw snapped shut. I turned to find Jed, wearing an actual shirt with sleeves, standing in his front door.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was flies.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cNot around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do beautiful work,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s just gorgeous altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, his smile boyish and pleased as we circled each other. \u201cWe\u2019re finished here and movin\u2019 on to Dick\u2019s house. Andrea saw some of the things Sam did here and wants them for their house, too. It\u2019s roofin\u2019 tomorrow, which means an early start before the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s a shame. I liked being able to take my coffee breaks in my own kitchen. So what have you been up to? I haven\u2019t seen you in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accidentally started a new job tonight.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAccidentally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was totally unintentional. I fell right into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you didn\u2019t answer one of those ads on Craigslist, did you?\u201d he said, his eyes wide and intentionally shocked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, the nice man in the unmarked panel van said the nudity will be tasteful!\u201d I exclaimed, making him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations on your new Internet porn job,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to come over for dinner tomorrow night to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plans tomorrow night.\u201d</p> <p>I really did have plans. I had to retrieve my car keys and make up for lost research time. But he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cPlans.\u201d He frowned. \u201cLike a date? So the very serious boyfriend crashed and burned already?\u201d</p><p>I had to bite my lip to keep from smiling. Why would he be worrying over whether I was dating? Unless . . . \u201cYou like me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Like you?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like like me,\u201d I singsonged.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being ridiculous,\u201d he said, scowling as he stepped forward, trapping me between his body and the wall. I could smell that forest-and-field scent rolling off of him, and the heat of his skin made me feel as if his hands were rubbing against my arms. He bent his face toward mine, and warm, minty breath feathered over my cheeks. \u201cIf I like liked you, trust me, you would know it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes locked with his, light meeting dark, and I couldn\u2019t move. This was completely unfair. He was a human thought scrambler, sent to make me lose all semblance of dignity. His lips were just a few heartbeats away from mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a date. I\u2019m working,\u201d I told him softly. Sorting through the contents of an occult shop to find magical knickknacks could be considered working, right?</p><p>The crescent moon rose slowly over his shoulder, giving him a faint halo around his shadow-cast face. I shivered. He looked down at me for a long, silent moment. I could feel his breath moving against my cheek like a caress. I honestly thought he was going to kiss me. And then he gave me one of those warm molasses smiles. \u201cWell, good luck to you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away and sauntered back to his door. He knew what he was doing, walking like that. It was patently unfair to leave a girl high and not quite dry and then walk away with his buns twitching under skintight denim. I called after him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand over his shoulder without even looking back at me.</p> <p>Completely. Unfair.</p><p>Over the next week or so, I fell into a routine. I worked at the clinic each day until five and then researched at the shop until just before sunset to avoid uncomfortable interactions with certain vampire landlords. Then I hightailed it home, leaving Jane detailed notes on what I\u2019d searched through that day and any materials I\u2019d taken home for the night. Occasionally, Jolene would drag me out of the shop to Southern Comforts, the vampire-friendly restaurant she managed with her friend, chef Tess Maitland. Jolene was apparently worried that I wasn\u2019t getting enough smoked pork in my diet. I\u2019d discovered that this was a grave concern for Kentuckians.</p><p>I enjoyed working at the clinic. I\u2019d tamed the chaos of the front desk and organized the patient records into a more user-friendly configuration. I wore scrubs for the first time since nursing school, as Dr. Hackett didn\u2019t believe jeans were a professional look for a medical setting. I had to pass a background check, which was disturbingly easy considering that I hadn\u2019t lived in the country for more than ten years.</p><p>I explained my dilemma to Dr. Hackett, and he helped me apply for the paperwork I would need in order to help people rather than just run the office. Until my papers came through, I would not be responsible for patient care. It was just too risky. In the meantime, he was happy to listen to my \u201cinstincts\u201d about a patient\u2019s condition based on my observations and the intake questionnaires. After hearing him referring to some of his contemporaries as hippies, I decided not to bring up my diagnostic abilities. But if I noticed something about a patient, say, black radiating pain flaring out from his stomach, I would advise Dr. Hackett that the patient was most likely suffering an ulcer.</p><p>It was a little bit of a relief, not being entirely responsible for treatment. And I found I had a talent for the administrative duties that I wasn\u2019t allowed to do back home.</p><p>After hearing so many \u201cfree clinic\u201d jokes over the years, I expected to see nothing but patients with questionable rashes. But each day was much like the first: sick kids and overwhelmed adults. There were a lot of young mothers with children who didn\u2019t have health insurance. And seniors who couldn\u2019t afford to see doctors without the free services Dr. Hackett provided. Like any other doctor, he had \u201cregular\u201d patients he saw frequently, and their files were kept in a special filing cabinet separate from those of the walk-in patients. It was a sad commentary on the state of the health-care system, but I was glad that the patients were getting the help they needed.</p><p>The job was tiring, and Dr. Hackett was right when he\u2019d told me he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me much. But it was rewarding, and it was nice to take my mind off of the Elements for a few hours each day.</p><p>I arrived home around the same time Jed did nearly every evening. Sometimes he was waiting on the porch with a beer for each of us. (I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that we would call that stuff water back home.) Other times, we just had some brief conversation about the house or work before retiring to separate corners. He was always flirty and mildly inappropriate, but he never took it past that level. He moved in close but didn\u2019t touch beyond the occasional casual brush of the arm. He spent half of our conversations staring at my mouth but never so much as kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>And it was driving me bloody insane.</p><p>Jed was an enigma. He was a prime specimen, but he never dated. He was clearly intelligent, although he tried to play it down with Southern-fried, aw-shucks-ma\u2019am charm. He was friendly and warm, and then, when he decided our conversation was over, he ran. What sort of man flirted like that and then managed to turn it off completely and walk away? Was there something wrong with me? Was I too much of a Yankee? The wrong size? The wrong gender? Was he doing this on purpose? And if he was, was he aware that he was the biggest tease in the world? Was he trying to drive me round the twist?</p><p>I knew this wasn\u2019t really my problem. I had more pressing matters to worry about. It was a waste of time to spend my nights wondering what the hell was going on inside Jed\u2019s head. His dense, beautiful head.</p><p>One not-so-special evening, I was searching through Jane\u2019s sales records from two years ago and found a thread of old ritual items sold to a collector in upstate New York that looked promising. Gabriel was hanging another photo on the wall, a shot of a Halloween party in which Jane and Tess Maitland were dressed as Elvira and Wonder Woman, respectively. The Mistress of the Dark herself sat discussing new titles at the coffee counter with Andrea. Dick was absent. The girls claimed he was on another business trip, but given the way Jane\u2019s mouth quivered when she said it, it seemed a little suspicious.</p><p>Neither Jane nor Andrea was thrilled with the news about my hiring at the clinic. The idea of my working seemed to make Jane feel guilty. She twisted a tea towel between her hands and shot Gabriel distressed looks as I described my evening at the clinic. \u201cYou\u2019ve got too much on your plate already, Nola. What if I gave you an allowance from your fair share of the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take money from you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>Jane scoffed. \u201cWhy not? This is money I wouldn\u2019t have had without Mr. Wainwright leaving me the shop. And if he\u2019d known about you, I\u2019m sure he would have wanted you to have a stake in the store. I thought about it when your great-uncle Emery came to town, but he was a gigantic douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned him before,\u201d I said as Andrea\u2019s lips peeled back from her teeth in a growl. And after hearing Jane\u2019s succinct explanation of my great-uncle\u2019s time in the Hollow, I couldn\u2019t blame her. The moment Emery had rolled into town, he\u2019d started sifting through the stock, stalking Andrea, and generally annoying the hell out of Jane. They\u2019d found later that he was a mole sent by another vampire trying to steal an important book from Jane\u2019s collection. This vampire had turned him in exchange for his service, and he had kidnapped Andrea and turned her against her will. Jane had taken great pleasure in turning Emery over to the Council for punishment.</p><p>\u201cHell, if that was the precedent set, I\u2019m surprised you let me through the shop door.\u201d</p><p>Jane gave a sincere shudder, her mouth crimped into an expression of distaste. \u201cThe point is, you\u2019re here doing something I\u2019m sure Mr. Wainwright would have wanted you to do. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let you spend valuable time waiting tables when you could be looking for these artifact thingies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working at a medical clinic. I\u2019m hardly slinging drinks,\u201d I protested.</p><p>Jane gave me an expression she called the \u201cstink-eye.\u201d I returned it with the bitch-brow. And we sat back and let the two expressions battle it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Andrea whispered to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cStay still and try not to attract their attention?\u201d Gabriel whispered back.</p><p>Eventually, Jane won the staring contest, because I\u2019m pretty sure she never had to blink. I hated to admit it, but Jane had a point. I wouldn\u2019t be making much at the clinic. In fact, I would make more money waiting tables, but it made me feel better to know that I was doing something I was (sort of) qualified for, and I was helping people. Also, it gave me something to think about besides the search. It couldn\u2019t be healthy for me to obsess over it every minute of the day.</p><p>But I knew I would probably have to get another part-time job, in addition to the clinic, to make ends meet. It would be terribly convenient to spend those working hours here in Jane\u2019s shop. I blew out a breath and thought about what Nana Fee would say. McGavocks had their pride. But if she thought that my pride was keeping me from fulfilling my purpose, she would probably whack me one with her walking stick and tell me to stop behaving like the back end of a mule.</p><p>I growled in defeat, holding up one hand and giving her a stern glare. \u201cAgreed, but I\u2019m keeping my job at the clinic and you\u2019re not giving me anything. I\u2019m earning a wage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do for you, but it will be an honest day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I hereby appoint you director of magical artifact location.\u201d Jane shook my hand, her tone prim.</p><p>She gave me a \u201cjob\u201d doing exactly what I was doing anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart-ass, Jane Jameson.\u201d</p><p>I barely noticed Andrea\u2019s grumbled \u201cI will never be as smart as Jane Jameson-Nightengale\u201d from the end of the bar.</p><p>\u201cSee, you\u2019re adjusting to the corporate culture already,\u201d Gabriel said brightly, tossing me a midnight-blue Specialty Books T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we have that settled.\u201d I sighed, leaning back in my chair. Jane gave my shoulder a little squeeze and handed me a cup of chamomile tea. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t get me any closer to finding the other Elements. And I\u2019m running out of places in the shop to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about that,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI thought we might try asking Mr. Wainwright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deceased Mr. Wainwright?\u201d I asked while Jane cringed and nodded. \u201cI swear to all that\u2019s holy, you lot, if I find out that Mr. Wainwright is a vampire, or in the witness-protection program, or any condition other than dead, I will throw a hissy and destroy that very expensive display of crystal figurines over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you hire people without a background check?\u201d Andrea asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cShut it, you,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>Jane was back to twisting the tea towel between her hands. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to tell you this, but your grandfather only moved onto the next plane a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext plane?\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded, clearly trying to choose her words carefully. \u201cHe died here at the shop. I found his body a few hours later. His spirit was already haunting the shop. He said that he was far too interested in what was happening here on earth to move on just yet. Of course, I didn\u2019t know at the time that part of \u2018what was happening\u2019 was his dating my aunt Jettie, who was also a ghost.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wouldn\u2019t quibble with a vampire about the existence of ghosts. It seemed like a doomed argument. And Nana Fee had all but told me she would come back to haunt me if I didn\u2019t accept her task. I sincerely hoped that she\u2019d run out of postmortem steam with her otherworldly reminders and had moved on to the next plane.</p><p>\u201cWait, ghosts can date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThe pair of them stuck around for almost a year. Until they both decided that it was time for them to move on. They couldn\u2019t define it, and I don\u2019t want to try to explain it, but wherever that is, we aren\u2019t supposed to be able to contact them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t \u2018supposed\u2019 to be able to contact them, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t tried yet because I wanted to respect their wishes. But I figured between a vampire mind-reader and a witch, we might have enough mojo to make a connection for an emergency call.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, thinking of my surreal chat with Mr. Wainwright in the panda dream. If that was the sort of conversation I could expect, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to make that call. Of course, it might be different, since, ostensibly, we would be speaking to Mr. Wainwright and not my imagination\u2019s version of him. I hoped it would be different. I didn\u2019t think my imagination was being very kind to him.</p><p>Then again, Ouija boards weren\u2019t something my family toyed with. We respected the life cycle. While it was often devastating, death was as much of the process as life, so it didn\u2019t make sense to bother a spirit after the person had moved on. For Nana Fee\u2019s sake, I hoped she\u2019d moved on. I didn\u2019t like the thought of her hovering around semirural Kentucky just in case I needed her. \u201cSo, what, we\u2019re going to break out a Ouija board and leave him a voice mail?\u201d</p><p>Jane shook her head vehemently. \u201cNo, no Ouija boards. The channel is too wide open. You don\u2019t know whom you\u2019re inviting into your emotional space. Plus, every scary story that ever started with a Ouija board ended in bloody, grisly death. Or getting in touch with Jim Morrison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes this conversation seem circular to you?\u201d I asked Andrea. She shushed me.</p><p>\u201cI think we need this.\u201d Jane held up an oddly shaped hunk of red plastic.</p><p>Andrea tilted her head. \u201cIs that a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA twenty-sided die from my parents\u2019 Scattergories game, yes,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI figured we would ask questions while we roll the dice. We would have just as good a chance of getting a message spelled out this way, maybe without the spooky ironic death messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this different from a Ouija board?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to keep our hands in constant, sustained contact with this. Less chance of the wrong spirits getting a connection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just pulled that explanation out of your bum, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a total rationalization,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s all I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving before one of us gets possessed by the spirit of an evil prom queen,\u201d Andrea said, turning on her heel toward the door. Jane and I caught her through the elbows and dragged her back. Jane flipped the sign on the door to \u201cClosed,\u201d which made sense. I would hate to walk into a bookstore and find the staff trying to commune with the dead.</p><p>As we sat around one of the coffee tables, prepping the \u201cboard,\u201d Jane turned off the lights and lit a few candles for the right ambience. Gabriel shared a commiserating look with me. \u201cI\u2019m only here because Jane thought it would be strange to leave a seat open at a four-person s\u00e9ance table. Which only goes to show that some of the etiquette lessons her grandma tried to hammer into her skull took root.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue,\u201d Jane warned him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would like to go on record as saying this is a stupid idea and will only lead to trouble,\u201d Andrea said.</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Jane said, handing her a notebook. \u201cNow, you take down the messages. You have the neatest handwriting.\u201d</p><p>Andrea grumbled, \u201cYes, because penmanship is going to make a huge difference when we accidentally contact that demon from The Exorcist.\u201d</p> <p>Jane ignored her. \u201cOK, Nola, have you ever done any meditation or visualization exercises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re for hippies. What we\u2019re going to do is close our eyes and clear our minds.\u201d</p><p>Andrea rolled her eyes but complied with Jane\u2019s instructions. I exhaled slowly through my nose. I tried to picture myself standing in a bright, white room, empty of people, colors, and sound. But I kept thinking about Jed, about my grandmother, about the Elements.</p><p>Jane cleared her throat. \u201cClear your head, Nola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I can tell, remember?\u201d</p><p>I harrumphed, which made Andrea snicker.</p><p>\u201cI want you to picture Mr. Wainwright. His gray hair is all frizzy and standing off of his head like he\u2019s been struck by lightning. He\u2019s smiling, because he thought he\u2019d lost his glasses again, but they were just stuck on top of his head. Can you see him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel silly,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright has seen us do far stupider things than this,\u201d Andrea muttered. \u201cSomeday we\u2019ll show you all the pictures from the Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGilbert Wainwright,\u201d I called. \u201cThis is your granddaughter. I need your help. Please, wherever you are, please come closer to this place, where you used to spend so much time, and speak to your friends.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and rolled the dice several times. The letters spelled absolute nonsense. Sheepishly, I told Jane, \u201cI feel ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cG.R.F.K.B.,\u201d Jane said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a Klingon ghost?\u201d</p><p>Andrea buried her face in her hands and dropped her forehead onto the table. I giggled and took the die. \u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered, completely sincere. \u201cI really need help. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Anything I\u2019ve managed to accomplish is the result of blind stinking luck. I could really use a clue or a hint or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cK.J.O.W.P.L.,\u201d Jane said as I rolled the die.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I cried. \u201cMy grandmother made a glowing moon appear against my ceiling. You can\u2019t play a silly word game with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS.O.R.R.Y.,\u201d Jane read, grinning widely and jostling Andrea\u2019s arm while she bounced up and down in her seat. \u201cMr. Wainwright? Thanks for talking to us. We miss you. Is Aunt Jettie OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cL.O.V.E.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Jane said. \u201cTell her I love her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sweet,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to, uh, meet you. Mr. Wainwright, I\u2019m sorry to cut to the chase, but I\u2019m afraid we could lose this connection any second. I need to find the objects Nan\u2014Fiona gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN.O.T. G.I.L.B.E.R.T.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows shot up, his hand gripping Jane\u2019s even more tightly. \u201cNot Gilbert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you!\u201d Andrea hissed. \u201cThis way leads to pea-soup vomiting and madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cN.A.N.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNana Fee?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t seem to find words or air. I\u2019d missed my grandmother so much, and here she was, talking to me through a silly party game. Even though I\u2019d had time to prepare for her death, there were still so many things I wanted to say to her. I felt the tears trail down my cheeks. Jane slipped her arm around my shoulder and squeezed me against her side.</p><p>Jane rolled the die again. \u201cM.O.T.H.E.R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s dead,\u201d I whispered to Jane.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s mother as in my mama?\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cWell, your mother had the candle. Maybe she\u2019s referring to that,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, Nana, we know Jane\u2019s mother\u2019s had the candle. Do you know where we might find the other three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM.O.T.H.E.R.,\u201d I said after we rolled the dice and it spelled the same word.</p><p>\u201cG.\u201d Jane said. \u201cA.G.A. Was your nana a Lady Gaga fan?\u201d</p><p>Glaring, I took the die and rolled. \u201cD.E.S.K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Gaga desk?\u201d I said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL.O.V.E.,\u201d Andrea said, after rolling the die. \u201cAw, that\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd please, don\u2019t stick around this plane for me. I need to know that you\u2019ve moved on to a better place. And that you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled nothing but As over the next few minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem your grandma took your advice,\u201d Andrea said, nudging it with her pen.</p><p>We tried rolling the die again but ended up with more nonsense Klingon words.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to get out of her. I\u2019m sorry I put you through all this, Nola. I don\u2019t think we got a lot of usable information,\u201d Jane said, pushing up from the table.</p><p>Andrea grabbed her wrist and dragged her back into her chair. \u201cSit down!\u201d Andrea yelped. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave the table without closing the circle, the portal, the connection, or whatever. Otherwise, the spirit can attach itself to you like a parasite and hitch a ride to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat movies have you been watching?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are on a strict regimen of the Oprah network after this,\u201d Jane told her. \u201cNo more Celebrity Ghost Stories for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Andrea pleaded.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jane sighed, then called, \u201cOK, spirit world, we are hereby hanging up, closing the channel. Don\u2019t call us. We\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>I asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you own a whole section of books on appropriate ritual language? And it\u2019s not true, what you said earlier. We did learn quite a bit tonight. We learned that Nana was a closet Gaga fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she meant? Love. Mother. Gaga. Desk. Those words don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Andrea complained.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I need to look through your desk again, Jane,\u201d I said, returning some of the candles to the display shelf.</p><p>\u201cYou looked through my desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe refinished Jane\u2019s desk before we moved it into her office. There were no papers or anything left in the drawers,\u201d Andrea said, squinting when I turned the lights back on.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure your mother hasn\u2019t taken any other objects out of the shop?\u201d I asked, my voice trailing off as I noticed one of Jane\u2019s photos hanging over the shelf where the candles were displayed. It showed Jane\u2019s mother, wearing a black T-shirt with two white triangles on the chest and a logo that read, \u201cFFOTU.\u201d Was this more Klingon nonsense? She was standing next to the cash register with this thunderstruck expression on her face. Jane\u2019s mama was a funny little thing. It seemed odd that Nana would mention her twice, when we\u2019d already located the candle. What did Nana want us to know about Jane\u2019s mother?</p><p>I looked at the picture more closely. \u201cHey, Jane, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a picture of our first meeting of the Friends and Family of the Undead. It was the first time my mother saw the shop, and Andrea wanted to capture my mother\u2019s stunned expression when she saw how nice everything was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible,\u201d I told Andrea.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fair. The moment she stepped inside, she said Andrea must have worked very hard to organize and decorate everything.\u201d Andrea snickered when my face drooped in disbelief. Jane added, \u201cMama and I used to have a pretty rocky relationship.\u201d</p><p>I poked at the photo, my hands shaking. \u201cAnd that little brown blob by the cash register? The one vaguely shaped like an acorn? The one I\u2019m pretty sure is the altar plaque representing Earth?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur take-a-penny dish?\u201d Jane asked, peering around the maple and glass counter, as if she were looking for it.</p><p>\u201cTake a penny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, when you get pennies back as change, you leave them in the take-a-penny dish, so when other customers are trying to give exact change, they don\u2019t have to dig around for them,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cPennies are basically the redheaded stepchildren of the currency world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were using my family\u2019s centuries-old altar plate as a change dish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed the Irish accent gets a lot stronger when she\u2019s angry?\u201d Jane asked her husband.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was. I found it lying loose in Mr. Wainwright\u2019s storage room!\u201d Andrea exclaimed. \u201cIt looked a lot more acorn-like in your sketch, by the way. In reality, it\u2019s just blobby with a stem hanging off of it.\u201d I glowered at her. She threw up her hands. \u201cOK, you\u2019re right. Not the appropriate time to criticize your family\u2019s prowess at arts and crafts.\u201d</p><p>I looked toward the register, but the spot to the left of it was being used to display copies of a book called The Guide for the Newly Undead. \u201cWhere is the dish now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was right here,\u201d Jane said, looking under the counter and behind the promotional supplies, just in case the plaque had fallen.</p> <p>Andrea\u2019s expression was a mix of confusion and guilt. \u201cJane, when I think about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that thing for months. I thought you\u2019d moved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you remember seeing it?\u201d</p><p>Andrea chewed her lip. \u201cA month or two ago. The day Mama Ginger came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger?\u201d I said. \u201cAnother mother? Starting with a G?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger is Zeb\u2019s mother. She and Jane have a checkered history,\u201d Gabriel told me quietly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Jane?\u201d Andrea asked. \u201cShe \u2018dropped by\u2019 before opening hours to give you your extremely late wedding present . . . and you kicked her out of the store . . . and banned her for life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, kicking her out was part of my New Year\u2019s resolutions,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThe lifetime ban was because I caught her swiping some of our fairy figurines and shoving them into her purse. She was standing right by the register, like I was too dumb to see . . . oh, hell. The plaque was right here next to the register. She must have taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t prove that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mama Ginger,\u201d Jane said with some emphasis, as if Andrea was missing some important and obvious point.</p><p>\u201cOK, but we can\u2019t just go into someone\u2019s house accusing them of theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mama Ginger,\u201d Jane said again. \u201cThat happens to her at least once a week.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Vampires are expert travelers. Because of the many perils that traveling poses for the undead, they prepare for all contingencies.</p> <p>\u2014A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm</p><p>Mama Ginger was a bizarre, bulbous woman with bright bottled-red hair and an unfiltered cigarette permanently attached to her bottom lip. She did not welcome us into her house, and not just because it was after midnight and we\u2019d awoken her from her \u201cbeauty rest.\u201d There was apparently some ugly history between Jane and Mama Ginger, something about Mama Ginger\u2019s attempts to sabotage Zeb\u2019s wedding to Jolene and subsequent attempts to make Jane\u2019s life more difficult after she realized that Jane (a) would never be her daughter-in-law and (b) was a vampire. It took Jane using something she called the persuasion voice for her even to let us through the entryway.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Jerome!\u201d I cried, backing away from a side parlor entirely populated by Precious Moments figurines. No matter where I went, their sinister oversized eyes followed me. I desperately wanted to turn my back, but I knew the moment I did, one of them would attack me from behind with a tiny porcelain machete.</p><p>Mama Ginger had a multitude of health problems that set off my alarm bells. Her heart was under stress, and her lungs were damaged from what I imagined was years of steady smoking. The conditions combined were enough to make me lean against the wall, Precious Moments be damned, so I could construct a shield between Mama Ginger\u2019s energy and mine.</p><p>By the time I was able to focus on the conversation around me, Jane was questioning Mama Ginger in earnest.</p><p>\u201cHow could you just walk into my shop and take something from me?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger sniffed. \u201cWell, if you hadn\u2019t been so rude, I might not have taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your criminal behavior is my fault?\u201d Jane asked frostily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you take on airs with me, Jane Jameson. I knew you when you were still in pigtails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for a while, too, Mama Ginger. You need to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting nowhere,\u201d I shouted over their shouts of \u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me, missy!\u201d and \u201cCalm down, you thieving whackaloon!\u201d \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care that you took it, Mrs. Lavelle. I just want it back. Could you please tell me what you did with it after you took it from the shop? If your information leads to my finding the plaque, I am willing to make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>Jane protested rewarding Mama Ginger\u2019s larceny\u2014loudly\u2014but I shushed her. Suddenly, Mama Ginger\u2019s wounded dove persona melted away. Her eyes narrowed, her expression calculating. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t discuss specifics until you either produce the plaque or share your info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I show my hand early? How do I know you\u2019ll pay up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman of my word, Mrs. Lavelle. I\u2019ll give you what you\u2019re owed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of an enticement.\u201d Jane snorted. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s owed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d I hissed, shaking my head vehemently. I turned pleading puppy-dog eyes on Mama Ginger. \u201cPlease, Mrs. Lavelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know some young people still have pretty manners.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cMy Zeb should have married a nice girl like you. Not that redheaded hussy . . .\u201d</p><p>Jane growled. \u201cWatch it, Mama Ginger. You\u2019re already on thin ice. Now, what happened to the blobby acorn thing?\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger made a study of her talon-like fire-engine-red nails. \u201cI may have mailed it . . . to Georgia . . . as a wedding present to my cousin Hubert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used a shoplifted item as a wedding gift?\u201d Jane exclaimed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think Jane had much room to judge, regifting-wise, but I also didn\u2019t think this was the appropriate time to point that out. And suddenly, I realized. \u201cGeorgia,\u201d I said. \u201cAs in the abbreviation GA? Georgia.\u201d But Jane was too busy staring holes in Mama Ginger\u2019s head to note my amusement. \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to know my nana wasn\u2019t a Gaga fan. Life makes sense again. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHubert loves squirrels!\u201d Mama Ginger exclaimed. \u201cHis wife, Mindy, wrote the sweetest thank-you note. Well, it was e-mailed. But they loved it, you could tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are double-banned!\u201d Jane exclaimed.</p><p>I persuaded Mama Ginger to give me Cousin Hubert\u2019s phone number for a small fee and on the condition that Jane had to leave her house while I conducted my business with Hubert\u2019s wife. Mindy was sweet as peaches and clotted cream about the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with her wedding gift, until we started discussing a price for its safe return. Let\u2019s just say that any buy money I saved locating the candle for free had been spent. But I was grateful that Mindy had simply chucked the gift box containing the plaque into a closet and forgotten about it, instead of disposing of it or regifting it, as seemed to be the secret custom around here. Jane, by the way, called through the window that I should demand that Mindy text-message a digital picture of the plaque and a dated newspaper to my phone, to prove that she still had it, before I promised any money. Mindy huffily complied and then informed me that I had until five P.M. the next day to come pick it up before the price doubled.</p><p>Before Jane could object, I handed Mama Ginger the cash I\u2019d promised her and lit out for Jane\u2019s car. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m pleased that you gave the thieving she-troll money, but at least you\u2019ll have another Element in your hands by tomorrow,\u201d Jane said as I buckled my seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cThe only problem is that my car is held together with duct tape and prayer,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt would never make the drive to Georgia and back. Do you think Miranda would be willing to take me? I could pay her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda is out of town on an assignment,\u201d Jane said. \u201cShe\u2019s driving some Council member to California. I would loan you my car, but it\u2019s with one of Dick\u2019s people, getting fitted with fireproof seats. I\u2019m relying on Gabriel\u2019s car for transportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is what shit creek feels like, and me without my paddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s, what, one A.M., now? I\u2019m completely knackered. The drive to Georgia will take at least seven hours, so if I want to make Mindy\u2019s deadline, I\u2019m going to have to find a car within the next nine hours and make the drive. The only good thing I can say about this situation is that at least it\u2019s Saturday and the clinic is closed, so I won\u2019t have to call in \u2018flaky and unavailable.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jane patted my hair, but I believe it was to keep me from whacking my head against the seat. \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t a big deal. Dick and I will find a solution. You need some rest before you leave tomorrow. I\u2019ll drop you at home, and by the time you wake up, we\u2019ll have worked something out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, are you ever going to tell me what the hell is going on with Dick?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place. All I can tell you is that Dick is absolutely mortified that you think he\u2019s an obsessive pervert, which is why he is trying to \u2018give you space\u2019 right now. Well, to be fair, he is a bit of an obsessive pervert, but not when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is making me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will say that when he tells you, you\u2019re going to laugh,\u201d she said. I snorted derisively, closed my eyes, and tilted my head against the seat. Jane reached across and clicked my seatbelt into place. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you home and tucked into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would protest that I am an adult and capable of doing this myself, but as I mentioned, I am exhausted,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I just don\u2019t have the energy for false displays of independence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone asks, I\u2019ll swear you put up a mighty protest,\u201d Jane promised.</p><p>I opened one eye, giving her a sideways glance. \u201cBy the way, fireproof seats?\u201d</p><p>Jane rolled her eyes. \u201cI have a teenage vampire living in my house. It\u2019s best not to ask questions.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, I had showered and felt vaguely human as I scrambled to pack a bag for the mini-break to Georgia. It was late, and I was desperate to get enough sleep that I wasn\u2019t entirely addled for the drive. But then I looked at my mobile and saw that Stephen had called twice while I was at Mama Ginger\u2019s. I dialed his number, hoping I could keep the conversation quick and get to bed. That was the appropriate attitude when calling one\u2019s lover from a long distance, right?</p><p>Stephen\u2019s tone when he picked up did not bode well for the quick, light interchange I\u2019d hoped for. \u201cOh, so you finally decided to call me, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Stephen, I\u2019ve just been so busy. I was really thrown into the trenches on my own today, and I\u2019m exhausted. I wish I could tell you all about it, but I\u2019m on my way out of town. I have to leave first thing in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOut of town? For what? Are you telling me you can\u2019t be bothered to call, but you\u2019ve had time to book a holiday?\u201d</p><p>The flinty tone to his voice had my stomach rolling. The weight of fatigue and frustration pressed against my chest, and I just wanted to lie across the bed and curl into a ball. I hadn\u2019t meant to say anything about the trip, but I had no filter when I was tired. If he pressed too much more, I would tell Stephen all about the trip to Kentucky, the Elements, and the shirtless neighbor I may or may not have flirty butterfly feelings for.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s for . . . work. I can\u2019t tell you much about it. Just boring old clinical stuff, really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s just boring old clinical stuff, why can\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>I was sincerely regretting that I\u2019d backed myself into a corner with this line of lying, because he had a good point. \u201cLook, let\u2019s just talk about something else, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to over there that you\u2019re not telling me about, Nola?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cI mean, this sudden offer of a mysterious job you\u2019d never mentioned before, the urgency of leaving right away, the fact that this hospital you claim to work for doesn\u2019t have you listed among its nursing fellows. I want to know what you\u2019re really doing over there and who you\u2019re spending your time with!\u201d His voice rose to an angry shout. That shocked the hell out of me, because at that time of day, he was at the office, where he rarely ever showed emotion, much less lost control of it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been checking up on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me no choice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did have a choice. You could have believed me.\u201d I should have dialed down my righteous indignation, the logical part of my brain knew that. But somehow the fatigue and the fact that he was accusing me of something I had successfully resisted so far\u2014cheating on him with Jed\u2014fueled the irrational portion of my brain and its control over my verbal faculties. Ignore the fact that he\u2019s right not to believe you, Nola, it told me, and that you were quite tempted to kiss Jed the other night. You have every right to be virtuously indignant! Virtuously!</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re like this,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust me, that\u2019s your problem. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of coming last in your life, Nola. You need to make our life together more of a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a life together, Stephen. We have your life and my life, and occasionally they intersect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can to lure you away from that circus you call a family. And you fight me at every turn! I\u2019m only doing what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>The use of that phrase and his superior tone, as if I were a naughty child he had to steer, struck a long-buried nerve deep within me. A hot, angry bubble burst forth from my throat in the form of \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019m going to sleep now, because I am exhausted. You would know that if you asked me one single question that had to do with my day or my work or even how I am. All you ever ask is why I had to come here in the first place and when I\u2019m coming home. I\u2019m sick of it. Don\u2019t call me anymore. If I decide that I want to talk to you again, I might call you.\u201d</p><p>On the other end of the line, he gasped. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t.\u201d And then I hung up.</p><p>I clapped my hands over my mouth, shocked at the words that had just spilled from my lips. Their tone, the sound of my voice, had sounded so much like hers that it frightened me to my soul. The wretched, angry altered state of it, as if I was barely hanging on to the faculties that kept me from strangling the nearest bystander. I let out a stifled little sob and swiped my hands across my eyes. The memory of that voice sent waves of panic and distress through my belly, to the point that I bent at the knees and worked sincerely at not running to the bathroom and throwing up.</p><p>I focused on breathing in through my nose and out of my mouth. I pictured that spare white room that hadn\u2019t been so successful with Jane\u2019s Ouija die experiment and willed a feeling of peace and calm to spread from my chest to my arms and legs, to steady my hands. I exhaled loudly, forcing my fingers to scoop up the neatly stacked pile of clothes and stuff them into my overnight bag. Then I added toiletries and a Dakota Cassidy paperback I\u2019d picked up at the shop.</p><p>Satisfied that I\u2019d completed the task, I stripped and slid into bed without bothering to shower. My stomach was still roiling. I pressed my face into the pillow and prayed for it to settle. The dark room and exhaustion finally led me to an uneasy sleep, with thoughts of my mother creeping into my head.</p><p>I was twelve. I was running home from school, my \u201cgrown-up\u201d plain Jansport backpack bouncing against my spine as I kept my face tilted to the late-afternoon sun. Pretty, popular Katie Jordan had asked me to her big sleepover birthday party at school that day, and I desperately wanted to go. I was already coming up with a logical, well-constructed argument for why Dad should allow this, even though he didn\u2019t know Katie or her parents very well and was pretty strict about that sort of thing. My ace in the hole was that my best friend, Allie Noonan, was going, and Dad often caved to parental peer pressure when it came to Allie\u2019s privileges.</p> <p>Just thinking about that afternoon, I could feel the warm rays of light on my face. I could feel the weight of the backpack against my shoulders and the way the sun caught my long dark hair, much longer than it was now. I was so happy, giddy at the possibility of being Katie Jordan\u2019s friend, of climbing the social ladder a bit and escaping the dreaded curse of \u201cmiddle-school nobody,\u201d that my chest ached with it.</p><p>I nearly tripped coming up the steps to our house, which was a frequent occurrence, what with my coltish limbs and oversized feet. I called out to my dad before I even got the door open, but the moment I walked in, I could sense a chill in the house, a weight to the air that made it harder to breathe. My good mood deflated immediately. My mother was back.</p><p>A silly, babyish part of me wanted to drop my backpack and run for Allie\u2019s house. My mother had been bouncing in and out of our lives for years, coming back every once in a while when she ran out of money or just forgot how little use she had for Dad and me.</p><p>For a few weeks, everything would be roses. She was \u201ccentered\u201d now, she\u2019d promise, and she had gotten her priorities straight. But after a few weeks, that desperate edge would come back to her voice, the wild look in her eyes, and she would disappear again. Usually with whatever pawnable objects we had lying around the house. After three years of losing it, I learned to stuff all of my birthday money into a sock in my laundry hamper. She never looked there.</p><p>Having recently graduated from my school\u2019s DARE program, I thought my mother was a drug addict, but Dad swore she\u2019d never had that problem. He just said Mom was restless and confused and didn\u2019t know what she was missing, not being able to watch me grow up. Even then, I knew he didn\u2019t believe it, either.</p><p>As I came in, I stumbled over the little pink rolling suitcase by the front door. It was my suitcase, the one I used when Dad and I took summer trips to Cape Cod. For a terrifying moment, I thought Dad had decided to give me over to her, and I considered grabbing the bag and running for Allie\u2019s house after all. Then I heard my dad yelling. I\u2019d never heard Dad raise his voice to my mother before, even when she pawned his mother\u2019s brooch. But now he was giving her what for.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to let you walk out the door with my daughter?\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot this time, Anna. I\u2019ve put up with your bullshit for years, hoping you\u2019d come back and be a decent mother to our child\u2014that sweet, smart little girl, who still loves you despite the fact that you checked out as soon as she could walk. No more, do you hear me? I won\u2019t let you drag her down with you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for my father. Dad hadn\u2019t seemed to catch on to the fact that any remaining daughterly adoration I had for my mother had faded several \u201creturns\u201d ago. My dad was my whole family. He was the one who sewed the patches on my Brownie uniform. He made sure my lunches were packed and learned to French-braid my hair. He suffered the indignity of shopping for my first training bra. I\u2019d figured out my mother\u2019s limitations a long time before that.</p><p>To my surprise, my mother\u2019s voice was even, calm. I\u2019d never heard her so casual and cool before, and that scared the hell out of me. Her being sure of her \u201crights\u201d in any situation was not a good thing. \u201cYou have no say in this matter. This is her birthright. She may be your daughter, but she\u2019s a McGavock first. Really, Martin, you can\u2019t keep her from me.\u201d</p><p>What was she talking about? I didn\u2019t know much about my mom\u2019s family. All Dad would tell me was that they lived in Ireland and they believed in things that not everybody believed in. He\u2019d liked the McGavocks when he\u2019d met them, he said, but Mom didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with them when she moved to the States to be married. And now my mother seemed to want to haul me away to some sort of McGavock indoctrination camp?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like I shut her off from your family!\u201d Dad exclaimed. \u201cI was all for traveling to see them, making sure that Nola at least got to meet her grandmother. But you haven\u2019t exactly fostered an open relationship with them. Don\u2019t blame me that she\u2019s been cut off from her heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I said, stepping into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d he said, schooling his features into a loving, untroubled expression. \u201cHow was school?\u201d</p><p>My parents were so different, it seemed impossible that they had been married. Dad was tall and trim, with thick dark-blond hair and warm blue eyes. He was wearing his work clothes for Boston Medical Center, a crisp white shirt with the red-and-blue checked tie I\u2019d given him for Father\u2019s Day. My mother looked as if she was ready to head out to a club, in too-tight jeans and a clingy, silky red shirt that was cut low in the front. Silver bangles clanked against both wrists. Her eye makeup was heavy and dark, making her already large brown eyes appear even bigger. Her mouth was painted a bold bloodred.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She frowned, that lovely motherly energy fading like mist. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in almost a year, and that\u2019s the hello I get?\u201d</p><p>I ratcheted up my voice to a level of cheer only my father would recognize as my \u201cdealing with an annoying babysitter\u201d voice. \u201cHello! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a mother come see her daughter without a special reason?\u201d</p><p>I looked to my dad, who was glaring at my mother as if he could make her explode with the power of his mind. I returned my own gaze to her face. Underneath the makeup, I could see the signs of aging. Her lipstick was feathering into the network of tiny wrinkles around her mouth. Permanent dark circles had begun to form under her eyes. Those eyes were sharp and calculating as she looked me over.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me all about school,\u201d she said, her lyrical voice ingratiating and saccharine sweet. \u201cAre your grades still good? Are you still playing soccer?\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, long and hard, without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine, I do have a reason for coming to see you. I just thought it was time for you to come live with me!\u201d Mom said, smiling brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been staying at this beautiful place in Florida. We\u2019re right on the beach, and it\u2019s so lovely and warm. And there\u2019s enough room for you. I mean, I know you\u2019ve never liked Boston, Nola. Your dad told me you don\u2019t have any real friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said anything of the sort!\u201d Dad protested.</p><p>Mom rolled her eyes and shared this weird little wink with me, as if we were conspirators. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to spend some time with me? You\u2019ve been living with your dad for so long. Don\u2019t you think I deserve some time, too? A girl needs her mother, Nola. You need me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pointing out that she didn\u2019t get any time with me because she\u2019d left us to go \u201cfind herself\u201d would have been pointless, so I just said, \u201cI\u2019m not moving to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Nola, there\u2019s nothing to keep you here.\u201d Mom sniffed. \u201cNow, I already packed your bag while your father was at work. He\u2019ll post the rest of your things to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, this is ridiculous. No matter how you try to strong-arm me, I won\u2019t allow you to take her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe quiet, Martin,\u201d she said, without even looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving to Florida,\u201d I said again, my voice louder this time, begging my mother to hear me just this once.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Mom said, giving her patronizing little sneer as she pushed me toward the foyer. \u201cStop being silly and get in the car.\u201d</p><p>I planted my feet, and for the first time, I defied my mother. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My mother leaned in close, her dark, glassy eyes threatening to draw me in as she hissed, \u201cNow, you listen to me. I\u2019ve put up with your spoiled little arse for years, and now it\u2019s time for me to collect my due. Get out to the car right quick, before I give you something to fuss over. You\u2019d think I was trying to bloody kidnap you, the way you\u2019re carrying on. I\u2019m only doing what\u2019s best for you. Now move it.\u201d And with that, she grabbed me by the shoulders and shoved me toward the door, hard.</p> <p>\u201cNo. No. NO. NO. NO!\u201d I screamed, so loudly I felt something in my throat tear. An enormous pressure squeezed my temples, and all I could think was that I wanted that pressure out of my head. I felt a snap between my eyebrows. The lightbulbs in the fixtures above my mom\u2019s head flickered and burst, pelting her with shards of glass.</p><p>Mom\u2019s face went paper-white, and she scrambled back away from me, against the wall. I stared back at her\u2014she looked like a little mouse cowering in front of a snake\u2014wondering if I could make that pressure build back up somehow. And then an angry red flush crept up my mother\u2019s neck. She grabbed at me, nearly closing her grasping, clawlike fingers around my wrists before my dad swept me behind him.</p><p>\u201cGet away,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t touch her. Leave, and don\u2019t ever come back. I\u2019m not going to let you do this to us anymore, do you hear me, Anna? Don\u2019t come back again.\u201d</p><p>Mom snarled at us both, her face twisted and ugly like some awful Halloween mask, and shoved past him to the front door. She slammed it behind her, and both of us let loose breaths we hadn\u2019t realized we were holding. With my mother gone, my brain could finally process the bits of broken glass scattered around our feet, the faint smell of ozone, the small cut on my father\u2019s cheek, presumably from the bulbs exploding over his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to be sorry about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about the lights? And your face?\u201d I sniffled. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, honey,\u201d he said, putting his arm around my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>I never made it to Allie\u2019s sleepover. We moved to a different neighborhood a few weeks later. My mother wasn\u2019t able to find our home address, and it was years before I saw her again.</p><p>That summer, Dad made more of an effort to contact my mother\u2019s family. We flew to Ireland to meet them just before my fourteenth birthday, and I formed a special bond with Nana Fee. We flew home, and two months later, my dad was dead, the victim of a heart attack at forty-four. Nana Fee took me in and raised me, which was fortunate, considering that the number of bizarre lightbulb explosions only increased, what with teen hormonal changes and my damaged emotional state.</p><p>I was grateful to be completely immersed in the McGavocks\u2019 loud, loving madness. I\u2019d wanted so badly just to disappear into the family, to blend in, so no one would see me as the Yank cousin brought home to foster. It seemed easier to forget that I had a life before Kilcairy. But Nana Fee had insisted on saving a few of my father\u2019s things when she and Aunt Penny had flown over to help me settle his affairs. It hurt so much to see his Red Sox cap, the bottle of his aftershave, and his wallet. Nana Fee had hidden these things away for me in her hope chest, for when I was ready. I\u2019d only found them after she died.</p><p>Nana did her best to teach me to control what I could do. And I loved her for it, but I wanted no part of it. I shut myself up in logic, what I could see and control. I only accepted my natural ability because I had no choice. After seeing what my mother had become after years of practicing witchcraft, desperate and bitter, greedy for what she couldn\u2019t have\u2014from money to youth to power\u2014I could live without magic.</p><p>9</p><p>Negotiation is a very important process to some supernatural creatures, such as gnomes, trolls, fairies, and brownies. The intricacies of this process are likely beyond the capabilities of the average human and should not be attempted. Yes, this means you.</p> <p>\u2014From Fangs to Fairy Folk:</p><p>Unusual Creatures of Midwestern North America</p><p>I woke up with stiff, sticky eyes, which was fairly typical after nights spent thinking of dear old Mum. I walked into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. I looked like hell, with dark circles under the aforementioned eyes and an unhappy slant to my mouth. It was a disturbingly familiar arrangement of features that I blotted out with some blush and wide \u201cbuying these after binge drinking seemed like a good idea\u201d sunglasses.</p><p>My magic was bottled up and restless. Considering the timing\u2014so close to a dream of my own blessed mother\u2014I was beginning to suspect that the binding was less a result of Penny\u2019s actions and increasingly because of my own emotional instability. I could feel the magic itching below the surface like a phantom limb. I was completely drained of energy, listless, practically hungover from the lack of magical spark. I couldn\u2019t so much as stir the air at the moment. And I had no idea what sort of situation I was heading into and how long this magical constipation would last.</p><p>What a wonderful time for a road trip.</p><p>I pulled my dark hair into a sloppy twist. I threw on jeans and a red tank top with some cute sandals. I grabbed my mobile and overnight bag and trudged down the stairs. I had about two hours before I had to leave town, and I was extremely curious to know how Jane and Dick planned to get my depressive arse down to Georgia.</p><p>Just as I\u2019d reached the landing, there was a loud pounding on my door. I opened it to find Jed, wearing faded jeans, a short-sleeved button-down plaid shirt, and a contrite expression, while holding out a travel cup of coffee as if it was a shield.</p><p>\u201cI was told keeping you caffeinated would be an important part of my survival,\u201d he said, pressing the cup into my hand and stepping away quickly. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have told Jane that story about punching Uncle Seamus in the throat when he tried to wake me during a fire drill at the clinic.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked, sipping the coffee and willing the caffeine to flood my brain with sense and energy.</p><p>\u201cAndrea Cheney called me late last night and said you needed someone to drive to Georgia with you. And unlike your car, my truck has a good chance of makin\u2019 it past the town limits without the engine fallin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you agree to this?\u201d I asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have better things to do with your Saturday?</p><p>Jed shrugged. \u201cWhy not? I like to drive. I think Andrea liked the idea of you having someone around to keep Zeb\u2019s family in line if things got rough. And when my landlord asks a favor of me, I hop to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow rough could his family be?\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI saw the video from the Lavelle twins\u2019 christening. Don\u2019t even joke about it.\u201d</p><p>I was fairly average in height, and it still took a boost from Jed to crawl into the cab of his truck. There were moving vans in Ireland that weren\u2019t this large. When had American vehicles become such an . . . overcompensation? Still, the interior smelled pleasantly of pine air freshener and the woodsy aftershave Jed used. The seats had been recently vacuumed, and the dashboard shone. Had he gone out and cleaned the truck because he knew I would be riding in it all day . . . or because Dick had threatened him when he made his \u201crequest\u201d and told him to treat me with kid gloves? I wasn\u2019t sure which was the preferable, less invasive alternative.</p><p>I slid my sunglasses up on my nose, sipped my coffee, and rested my head against the seat, willing the vague headache located just above my eyebrows to go away. Jed seemed to sense that I needed quiet, so he remained silent as we coasted smoothly out of town, over the Tennessee River, and into central Kentucky. He eventually switched on a country-western station playing old Loretta Lynn songs. He asked about working in Boston, and I had to scramble for an answer. From what I remembered, my dad worked a lot of night shifts, and the morning commutes were a bear.</p><p>I repeated stories Dad had told me about working in the hospital where he practiced emergency medicine. Unfortunately, most of these stories had been edited for younger audiences, so they weren\u2019t terribly interesting. But the more I talked, the more I was able to focus on the world rolling past the truck windows. We rolled through towns that were barely towns at all, just a few buildings cobbled together on a street, usually situated around railroad tracks. And then we drove through Nashville, bustling and alive with traffic and noise. And as soon as you adjusted to the urban landscape, boom, back in farm country.</p><p>The landscape was so different from the hills and seascape surrounding Kilcairy. Instead of the relentless emerald I was used to, there were dozens of shades of textured green. Instead of rolling, gentle hills that eventually rose into peaks, mountains seemed to spring up from nowhere. There were sections of road that took my breath away, random patches of bright-red poppies growing between the lanes, rushing creeks, and the occasional random monument in the middle of a cow pasture. Throughout this landscape were little neighborhoods of house trailers, long metal boxes with windows.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever seen them before?\u201d Jed asked as I stared at another configuration of trailers on a hill.</p><p>\u201cOn television, maybe, but never up close. They look so small from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I grew up in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowded,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI have this huge family: three brothers, a sister, and myself. We played outside just so we could breathe our own air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you all get along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part. I\u2019m closest with my oldest brother, Jim. Sometimes the extended family was a different story. We argue over the usual stuff, you know, who borrowed whose lawnmower, who pinched whose wife\u2019s ass at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t believe ass pinching comes up in normal family discourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a Yankee. Who knows what y\u2019all talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe moved from Louisiana to Tennessee about three generations ago, and my grandpa never quite got over it. He\u2019s still pissed about it, to be honest with you, says he misses the bayou. It\u2019s funny, \u2019cause he was a baby when the family moved away. He never really lived on the bayou. We\u2019re the only family in Hazeltine with semi-Cajun accents. Anyway, we all settled on this farm in the 1920s. There was a main house, where my great-grandparents lived, and then we built a sort of complex of trailers around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sympathize,\u201d I told him. \u201cMy family lives close together, too. Do you miss them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut there are other times when I appreciate having all those rooms to myself in the Hollow. Not being able to see the inside of my house from one end to the other is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGets a little lonely, though,\u201d I mused. \u201cDo you have a young possum enthusiast waiting for you back home? I have noticed the distinct lack of Hollow girls doing the walk of shame from your front door.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask if I\u2019m seeing someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet better answers this way,\u201d I said, smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t dated anyone seriously in years. I haven\u2019t had a real girlfriend since high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said, his lips pressed together in a frown. \u201cWhy are you asking me all of these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve arrived, I\u2019ve been subjected to nothing but questions. Now it\u2019s your turn. So why no girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust never found someone I thought could handle all of this,\u201d he said, making a broad gesture down to his toes.</p><p>\u201cDefensive and secretive, the Southern male deflects the personal question with posturing and a sexual reference intending to make the inquisitor uncomfortable,\u201d I said in my best nature documentary narrator\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cOK, fine. My family is sort of nuts, right? There are a lot of traits I don\u2019t want to pass along to kids. And most women, if they\u2019re the nice, marrying sort of girl you want to date seriously, are going to want kids. I have learned from experience that if you leave that little detail out in the first couple of dates, it only ends in tears and thrown drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a refreshingly honest answer,\u201d I told him. \u201cSee what happens when you\u2019re forced to keep your shirt on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>We stopped somewhere in northern Georgia so we could eat a late lunch of fried bologna sandwiches at a Huck\u2019s convenience store. I had never before experienced the delicacy of fried bologna, but I can\u2019t say it was anything worse than what Penny came up with for some holiday meals.</p><p>After answering several questions about defensive driving and basic auto maintenance, I was \u201callowed\u201d to take over driving to give Jed a chance to rest. I filled the gas tank, since it was my errand we were running. While I was pumping the gas, he emerged from the convenience store with a bag filled with beef jerky, Corn Nuts, Twizzlers, and other culinary delights.</p><p>\u201cWe just ate,\u201d I reminded him, although I hated to do anything to jeopardize the broad white grin on his face.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have an American road-trip experience, you should have all the trimmin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you promised Andrea I would receive the full-service package?\u201d I asked, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>He buckled his seatbelt, clearly less comfortable sitting in the passenger seat. \u201cHow can you say things like that and not expect me to turn them into a filthy joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully expect you to turn them into a filthy joke. Sno-Balls!\u201d I cried, snatching the pink package from the bag and diving into coconut-covered goodness. \u201cI haven\u2019t had these since I was a kid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have a road trip without them,\u201d he said solemnly as I pulled the truck into traffic. He winced as I carefully changed lanes and pulled to a stop at a yellow light. Men were such babies when it came to their vehicles.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a baseless concern, as it turned out. The farther south we drove, the heavier traffic got. I noticed there seemed to be more lanes, transitioning from two to three to six. The road department seemed to be doing random experiments in how to frustrate drivers, because I could see no rhyme or reason in the way they chose to repair the roads. My fellow drivers and I would move at a reasonable rate until I came screeching up to a car parked in the middle of the bloody lane. I would switch lanes, sometimes looking over my shoulder beforehand. And on occasion, Jed\u2019s head would end up smacking against the window.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you can pull over anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good to drive again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Atlanta city limits. Every exit I\u2019ve seen is either closed for construction or blocked by idiots.\u201d</p> <p>A semi-truck swept past us, changing lanes and nearly clipping us. I was so worried about that I barely noticed that the car right in front of us had slowed to a near stop. I yelped, whipping the wheel to the left and pulling past, only to have another car slide into the lane ahead of us, honking like mad and zipping around a bus full of schoolchildren.</p><p>\u201cI am not prepared for all this traffic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019s always like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine. I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown! Which is a problem, because we are moving at eighty bloody miles an hour!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust breathe, baby. Just breathe, and try to focus on one thing at a time, make one decision at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m a mentally challenged toddler. And this is not because I\u2019m a woman driver. This is because I am used to living in a place where traffic jams are caused by truant sheep!\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAre there a lot of sheep in Boston?\u201d</p><p>Just then, the rather large tanker truck marked \u201cexplosive\u201d stopped to avoid stalled traffic ahead of us. I saw an opening between two cars and switched lanes, then switched again and made a sudden turn into the last before screeching to a halt on the shoulder of the road. I was shaking so badly it felt like shivering. Jed had to put the car in park, because my fingers were clamped around the steering wheel in a death grip. His fingers gently pried mine from the wheel, and my hands wound their way around his neck. Once again, I was clinging to him like a frantic primate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d He chuckled, rubbing my back.</p><p>\u201cNo, these people are crazy, and they are trying to kill us,\u201d I said, sniffing. He laughed, threading his fingers through my hair and pressing my face against his neck. How could someone who spent so much time sweating in the sun smell so good and clean? He was a one-man fabric-softener commercial.</p><p>Jed kissed my temple, my cheekbone, an innocent gesture. I tilted my face toward his and let his breath wash over my skin. A strange, giddy excitement fluttered through my chest, making me grip his shirt even tighter. My nose nudged against his, and I could feel the tips of his eyelashes against my brows.</p><p>I surged forward, pressing my lips against his. He made a shocked murmuring sound before sliding his hands against my back and pressing me closer. He pulled my bottom lip into his mouth and nibbled at it. I tried to move closer, but my seatbelt yanked me back against the seat. Grunting, he fumbled for the belt release, cupped my face between his hands, and hauled me to him. I was this close to crawling into his lap when a truck passed by and blared its horn.</p><p>I jumped, backing away and leaning against the window. My lips were tingling. Why were my lips tingling? I\u2019d never had tingly lips before. I touched my fingertips to them, tasting the salt of Jed\u2019s skin and my own peach-flavored lip gloss. Jed relaxed back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d he asked, looking straight ahead at the lanes of traffic whipping by us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I got all confused by the multiple lanes. I still haven\u2019t figured out the whole driving-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-road thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean the kissin\u2019. What happened to \u2018I\u2019m seeing someone, I\u2019m not available\u2019? Not that I\u2019m complainin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>My hand whipped up to smack the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cOw! Hey, you kissed me. Why am I gettin\u2019 hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry. Instinct. I will keep my lips and my hands to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s not go crazy. Anytime you want to make out with me in a panic, feel fr\u2014Ow! Stop hittin\u2019 me!\u201d</p><p>I did not make out with him again that afternoon. We made it to our destination a few hours later, and I was still sorting out whether I\u2019d officially broken things off with Stephen the night before, or if I had been at all ambiguous. But it was very difficult to concentrate on driving and relationship status when my lips were still tingling with the memory of Jed\u2019s.</p><p>I simply did not do things like kiss men in a panic on the side of a crowded roadway. Well, there was that one time with Neal Dunnigan after our graduation dance, but that was an aberration. A delicious aberration. What the hell was Jed doing to me? I was a mature, educated woman with the livelihoods and health of a whole village on my shoulders. And yet every time he got near me, I behaved like an addled, horny teenager. I had to nip this in the bud. I had to gain control of the situation.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t think this was the place to do it.</p><p>Helton, Georgia, turned out to be a tiny village. There were no major retailers or restaurants. All of the homes and businesses were on one long stretch of street intersecting with a railway, with a box-shaped white church nearby. The houses ran the gamut from sturdy brick bungalows to dilapidated shacks.</p><p>Of course, we were heading for one of the shacks.</p><p>Jed had been told that I was reclaiming a valuable piece of merchandise that had been \u201cmisdirected\u201d from Jane\u2019s shop, but I hadn\u2019t given him specifics. As we got closer to the address, I could feel the waves of concern rolling off of him, as if we were walking into a bad situation. Frankly, given the number of NRA bumper stickers on the early-model truck parked in the driveway, I was getting a little nervous myself.</p><p>\u201cI think you should stay in the car,\u201d he said, looking the house over.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look I can only describe as \u201cfocused\u201d and said, \u201cDo as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. No one had ever talked to me like that before and walked away without a limp. Jed had never shown signs of this sort of command. He\u2019d always struck me as the funny, goofy sort. But here he was giving me orders, and I wanted to do exactly what he told me to do. The tone of his voice and the smoldering expression on his face made me want to give him whatever he wanted.</p><p>Of course, I couldn\u2019t tell him that. Instead, I exclaimed, \u201cI beg your pardon! Like I\u2019m supposed to fall to my knees at the sight of your freakishly large muscles? Who the hell do you think you\u2019re talking to?\u201d</p><p>Jed seemed to snap out of whatever bizarre alpha-male haze had prompted such a speech. \u201cRight, sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the truck door open and slammed it in his face, or at least near his face.</p><p>\u201cOK, so that was the wrong way to go about it,\u201d Jed admitted. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014I don\u2019t like the look of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he huffed. \u201cBut at least let me do this.\u201d Jed hooked an arm through my elbow and led me forward. \u201cI\u2019m about to devolve into some pretty serious Bubbaness. Don\u2019t judge me based on what I am about to say or do. And no offense meant, but it would be best if you didn\u2019t say anythin\u2019 over the next few minutes. And try not to make those faces, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaces?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018I am an alien explorer in a strange world, and I don\u2019t like what I see\u2019 faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I protested, but cut myself off when he gave me that grave, serious look. I grumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s not supposed to offend me,\u201d just as the door opened.</p><p>Hubert Lavelle towered over even Jed\u2019s tall frame. He had some sort of handlebar mustache and was dressed in camouflage from head to toe. He was the most terrifying person I\u2019d ever met. And I had several cousins who would head-butt complete strangers over a soccer match.</p><p>\u201cHi there! We\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a Mr. Lavelle,\u201d Jed said, his accent far more pronounced than I\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cMy girl here talked to your wife on the phone last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sentcha?\u201d Hubert asked.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt Ginger,\u201d Jed said.</p><p>Hubert\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cShe say anything about the credit cards? \u2019Cause it\u2019s not our fault she left that application on the counter. Anybody could have picked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just the wedding present,\u201d Jed assured him.</p><p>After establishing that we were not door-to-door evangelists or salesmen, Hubert ushered us through the front door and pushed us onto the green velour couch. The key design element of the living room seemed to be the deer\u2019s head mounted on the wall, with some sort of cheap garter around its nose. The garter had a little tag that read, \u201cHelton High School Prom, 1992.\u201d This seemed disrespectful both to deer and to cheaply made underwear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hubert\u2019s wife, Mindy, was a tiny powerhouse of a woman with a halo of wild blond hair and eye makeup so complex it took me a while to locate her pupils. She was clearly the brains of the operation, such as it was. And I was distinctly uncomfortable with the way she was eyeing Jed. But I was starting to think her threats to sell the plaque on eBay were a bluff, because they didn\u2019t appear to have a computer. And given the length of Mindy\u2019s nails, I doubted she spent much time typing sales information.</p><p>\u201cCan I get y\u2019all anything?\u201d she drawled, her voice smooth and silky as custard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate a sweet tea, ma\u2019am,\u201d Jed said, plucking at the hat in his hands. Mindy turned to me, expectant.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please don\u2019t go to any trouble,\u201d I said, trying like mad to keep the grimace from crinkling my face at the thought of liquid diabetes.</p><p>\u201cNo trouble at all, shug,\u201d she said, teetering toward the kitchen on see-through plastic wedge heels. Hubert gave us an awkward smile, settling back into his Barcalounger.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she call me?\u201d I muttered out of the side of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cShug,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s short for \u2018sugar\u2019; it means she likes you. Or, at least, she likes the money you\u2019re about to pay her. If she called you by your first name, she\u2019d be indifferent. If she called you Miss Leary, she\u2019d have already written you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p> <p>Mindy came toddling back into the living room with two hot-pink plastic tumblers of iced tea. She put a little extra wiggle in her step when she served Jed\u2019s. He offered her a bland smile and took a long drag from his glass. How was he able to do that without gagging? But I was ever so grateful that her attention was directed otherwise, because it meant no one noticed when I poured my tea into her potted plant. Which turned out to be plastic.</p><p>Mindy shot a sultry look over her shoulder as she disappeared into the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re real grateful to you for being so understanding about Mama Ginger\u2019s wedding gift,\u201d Jed said carefully as Mindy carried a gift bag with a cabbage rose pattern into the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you called when you did, \u2019cause we were going to use this as a backup ashtray when Mindy\u2019s mama comes to visit,\u201d Hubert said, his tone magnanimous.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI appreciate your restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse, I couldn\u2019t just hand it over,\u201d Mindy said pointedly. \u201cNot without some sort of fair trade. After all, it was a wedding present. There\u2019s sentimental value.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d I said, digging into my purse. I handed her the envelope of cash I\u2019d prepared to save myself the awkwardness of counting it out. I pressed the envelope into her hand. Meanwhile, Jed started a conversation with Hubert about \u201cthe Dawgs\u201d and their chances in the playoffs. I didn\u2019t know what sport they were referring to, but Hubert lit up at the chance to discuss his beloved Dawgs and engaged in a spirited debate. Mindy\u2019s attention could not be swayed.</p><p>\u201cOf course, with you payin\u2019 us, that would only mean we broke even. Still leaves us without a wedding gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to buy you a blender?\u201d I asked. I was grateful to get the plaque back, but these people were getting on my last nerve.</p><p>\u201cNo, at this point, we\u2019ve got the whole house set up,\u201d Mindy said. \u201cIt would be nice to have a little extra cash, in case we wanted to splurge a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould a hundred be enough?\u201d I asked flatly as I plucked a bill from my wallet.</p><p>\u201cWell, we are pretty close to Aunt Ginger,\u201d Hubert hedged. \u201cShe\u2019d probably want to give us at least two hundred.\u201d</p><p>I slapped the two extra bills into Mindy\u2019s hand with a humorless smile and took the bag from her hand. The plaque tumbled into my hands, wrapped in a wad of pink tissue paper. I had a hard time containing my giggle. I didn\u2019t want Mindy to decide I was too happy with my purchase and owed her another hundred.</p><p>The cool weight of the plaque was wondrously solid against my palm. Jane was right; it was rather blobby. The acorn-cap pattern barely stood out under the patina of aged clay. But even if it smelled of old pennies, it was unchipped and intact. That was all I cared about. I whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHappy to help.\u201d Mindy smiled, tucking the cash into her bra. \u201cY\u2019all are welcome to stay for supper, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at the display of cleavage and the implications of staying for \u201csupper.\u201d Oh, I could only imagine the extravaganza of hospitality that would await us, right down to Mindy changing into something \u201cmore comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mighty kind of you, ma\u2019am. But we have to drive home yet tonight,\u201d Jed said. \u201cWork, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the next time you\u2019re in the neighborhood, then.\u201d She simpered, batting her eyelashes for all they were worth.</p><p>Having wrapped up the \u201chappy to meet yous,\u201d Jed and I booked it out to the truck before Mindy decided she wanted a matching dinette set, too. My blood thrilled in my veins as we climbed into our seats.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I have it.\u201d I sighed, pressing the tissue-covered bundle to my chest. \u201cTwo down, two to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d he asked, starting the engine.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a project I\u2019m working on with Jane. Personal interest.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a long speculative look. \u201cWell, I am too tired to drive any farther,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a motel just outside of town. Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have proven myself to be untrustworthy driving on the right side of the road, so yes,\u201d I said, clicking my belt into place as we roared onto the main street. \u201cYou really went full-on Bubba, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could have prepared me.\u201d I chuckled, shaking my head. \u201cThat poor deer.\u201d</p><p>I was not familiar with motel tourism. When I\u2019d lived with my dad, we were strictly Holiday Inn or Ramada travelers. The few times I\u2019d traveled overseas, I\u2019d stayed in smallish historic hotels with \u201ccharacter.\u201d (Read: water damage and manky carpet.) And still, the damp-flooring issues were preferable to the comforts of the Sleep-Tight Inn. This was beyond the Bates Motel. It was a brick block building with rusty stains dripping down under the window air-conditioning units. There was a pool . . . and it was full of sludgy green water and leaves.</p><p>But the Sleep-Tight was the only motel for the next fifty miles, neither of us had another hour of driving in us, and after paying Mindy off, it fit my cash-on-hand budget. That was the only positive thing I could say about the Sleep-Tight. Jed insisted on being the one to go into the office to rent the rooms. I was concerned that he might have ulterior motives and would come back claiming that there was only one single-bed room available for the night. But it turned out he was concerned that the motel clerk might see a woman alone and \u201cget the wrong ideas.\u201d</p><p>It was a manly, almost cavemanly, gesture, but I could see the value in it. Nana Fee would have told me to stand up straight, make direct eye contact, and demand respect. And as healthy as that was, in this environment, demanding respect would have probably resulted in the clerk slapping the \u201cbitch\u201d label on me and doing something weird to the truck. I appreciated the direct caveman approach if it meant circumventing all that.</p><p>I dragged our overnight bags out of the back of the truck as he returned with the room keys. \u201cIf I am stabbed to death in the shower, I will come back and haunt you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI will come and watch over you while you are in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou completely misinterpreted that.\u201d</p><p>My room was connected to Jed\u2019s through an adjoining door. It was spare and outdated, but at least I didn\u2019t see anything crawling across the threadbare orange carpet. Of course, the first thing I did was pull the comforter off of the bed, because there was no way I was going to sleep under that. I pulled out my travel sleeping bag and spread it over the sheets, with a prick of regret for Stephen and his practical gift-giving habits.</p><p>I\u2019d showered (without being stabbed) and was seriously considering just going to bed, when Jed knocked on the adjoining door. He yelled through the door, \u201cHow do you feel about barbecue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean hamburgers?\u201d I yelled back. \u201cI have no particular philosophy about hamburgers.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend you didn\u2019t just say that.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>There is no such thing as magical glue. Any witch who tries to sell you magical glue is a lying hag.</p><p>\u2014A Witch\u2019s Compendium of Curses</p><p>We went to a restaurant called High on the Hog. It was careworn but well populated. The green pleather booths were sprung and peeling. The napkin dispensers consisted of paper-towel racks mounted against the oak paneling. Pictures of people holding up large fish and neon beer signs decorated the walls. I could barely see the kitchen through the smoke, but I could make out a huge brick pit in the middle of the space.</p><p>It was a bit like a pub, with the same happy, boisterous crowd, people drinking more they were supposed to and most likely flirting with people they weren\u2019t supposed to. Loud country music blared from an old jukebox in the corner. The smell should have been revolting, nothing but smoke and grease and beer. But my mouth was watering to the point where I felt like wiping at it with my sleeve.</p><p>Jed ordered for me, because after the hamburger comment, I couldn\u2019t be trusted to do it myself. While the meat was smoky and delicious, it was the side dishes I gorged on. There were things I remembered from my childhood. Corn on the cob and macaroni and cheese. But then there were hash brown casserole, collard greens, and hush puppies, which I had never tried.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are just throwing yourself into that plate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jed marveled.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s probably revolting. You\u2019ve probably spent your adult life dating women who eat the cucumber from their salad and proclaim they\u2019re just too full to go on, but I am starving. And this is really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, hell, I was going to offer you my black-eyed peas if it means you\u2019ll keep makin\u2019 those little sounds in your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making little sounds?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf you stop, I\u2019ll cry. A lot.\u201d</p><p>I drank the watery-but-no-one-knew-any-better beer, and I ate my fill. And when a stocky man in a Georgia State T-shirt asked me to two-step, I politely declined. He almost argued, but Jed gave him sort of a no-doubt-terrifying-to-the-male-of-the-species territorial glare, and Mr. Georgia State scampered away.</p><p>Two more, I thought. Two more, and I could go home. With the plaque locked up tight in Jed\u2019s truck, I was well and truly relaxed for the first time in days. It was the same relief and euphoria I\u2019d felt after finding the candle. I was getting a little bit addicted to that feeling, and it was leading to some dangerous thoughts.</p><p>Those thoughts focused on Jed\u2019s lips and how they\u2019d felt against mine earlier that day. And how relatively easy it was to sit here in this crowded bar and talk about nothing at all with him. I didn\u2019t feel that constant nagging pressure to say the right thing or use the right fork. Because Jed had seen me having a possum-fueled panic attack wearing nothing but a towel. After that, there was nowhere to go but up.</p><p>After a bit too much Hank Williams, Sr., and far too much good food, Jed drove us back to the motel. The car park was dark, the night moonless under a cloudy sky.</p><p>\u201cI had a really nice time,\u201d I told him as we walked to the doors.</p><p>\u201cTry not to sound so surprised,\u201d he chided gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised! All right, I\u2019m a little surprised. Thank you for driving me down here and helping me. Thanks.\u201d I leaned forward and meant to kiss his cheek, but he turned his head at the last minute, and I managed to catch his mouth instead. I gave an exasperated little huff. \u201cReally, again?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou kissed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as accidents, only things you mean to do and put off until a moment of panic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s awfully philosophical,\u201d I mused.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talkin\u2019 about all mankind, just you in particular.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, long and hard. I watched as the smug little grin faded from his expression. And he was just a man, looking at a woman, as if he wanted her desperately. I don\u2019t think anyone had ever looked at me that way.</p><p>I was not drunk. The beer we\u2019d had was barely enough to give me a pleasant buzz. I was making a decision without thinking, for the first time in a very long time. It felt really good, but in the morning, I was probably going to regret it. At the moment, I did not care. I wish I could blame it on the drink or being tired or homesick or under the influence of some bizarre magical ritual. But I just wanted him. His skin was warm and smooth under mine. He was solid and strong, and he was looking at me as if I hung the moon and stars. I wanted to feel his skin against mine, to have him drag that stubble across my collarbone and bite at my throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d I sighed, shoving him against the door and attacking his mouth. I didn\u2019t even care when our teeth clacked together. His tongue slipped past my lips, tangled with mine. Hands that had hesitated with uncertainty at my sides now curled around my back.</p> <p>I hitched my leg over his hip, rising against him. Once again, his hands found purchase under my rear as he lifted me. He pushed into my room and whipped me around, pushing me against the door. He yanked my shirt over my head. I pushed him back onto the bed and unbuttoned his shirt, grinding down on the growing bulge of his lap. He moaned.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d he asked, lightly pulling at the ends of my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not drunk, are you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo! On that beer? Don\u2019t be silly!\u201d I kissed him again. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure about it. But I\u2019m going to do it anyway. It\u2019s a new thing for me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, thank you for experimentin\u2019 on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty!\u201d I exclaimed as I pulled his shirt away. \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair. I mean, really. You\u2019re just . . . so damned pretty! Do you get that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He pushed my hair from my face and grinned up at me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re pretty, too.\u201d He kissed the tip of my chin, nuzzling my neck. \u201cThe first time I saw you, I couldn\u2019t look away from your face.\u201d</p> <p>I slipped my fingertips up the length of his spine, twisting them into his hair and pulling his head back, so we were eye-to-eye. \u201cYou mean, when I was naked?\u201d</p><p>He grinned wickedly. I jiggled my hand slightly, forcing him to nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, keeping my head tilted even as he turned and lowered me to the mattress. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a compliment that you could only look at my face when I was naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stare at your breasts right now if it will make you happy.\u201d</p><p>I considered it for a long moment. \u201cI think it would.\u201d</p><p>He helped me unclasp my bra and threw it over his shoulder. He sat back on his heels, pursing his lips and squinting as if he was considering my nipples very carefully. After a few moments of this, I became uncomfortable and tried to cross my arms. He caught my wrists, shaking his head. He dipped his head to mine as he pressed my wrists to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI still like your face,\u201d he muttered, making me laugh as he nuzzled my cheek.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could stop you if I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk myself out of this. I am going to have sex with you. Like the dirty, nasty, make-the-priest-drop-his-Bible-during-confession sort of sex. I am very bendy. You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at me, but . . . very bendy. And if I start talking again, I will talk until you lose interest or I start snoring. And if I start snoring, you definitely won\u2019t have sex with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou snore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor has it.\u201d</p><p>He unzipped my jeans and tugged them down my hips. \u201cI like snoring.\u201d Suddenly, he was back at face level and drawing his cheek along the width of my collarbone as my panties seemed to disappear into thin air. \u201cLove it.\u201d I wrapped my legs around his hips, and he planted a kiss on the hollow of my throat. \u201cThink it\u2019s the sexiest thing ever.\u201d</p><p>As I was laughing, he closed his lips around mine and slowly, but surely, slid between my thighs. I could feel him smiling against my mouth as he rolled his hips. I giggled shamelessly, nuzzling against his neck until he ducked away.</p><p>\u201cTicklish,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Every nerve, every cell in my body seemed to sizzle to life. I could feel everything\u2014skin, lips, hands, warmth, comfort, home. This was right where I should be. I could feel it in my bones, the magic working its way loose from my marrow and warming me down to my toes. It wound around the two of us, like a golden ribbon only I could see.</p><p>That was new.</p><p>Our legs wound together under the rough sheets as we moved. An aurora of sunny light drifted around the bed while I was trying to concentrate on the slow, steady pace Jed was setting. It was a bit of a distraction, taking on a life of its own, flashing and moving as we did, sharing Jed\u2019s playful energy as he nibbled at my jawline. But somehow we managed to slide along until Jed\u2019s chest was heaving and my skin felt too hot and tight.</p><p>Every part of me pulsed, and the light pulsed with me. Jed moaned over me, tilting his head against mine. Just before I closed my eyes, Jed\u2019s skin changed in my light, rippling into scales, golden oval scales like you\u2019d see in medieval illustrations of dragons. I blinked rapidly, eyes wide, running my hand down his shoulder. And with that, it was his normal, smooth skin again.</p><p>Jed chuckled and rolled to his side, dragging me with him. The golden ribbon faded from sight as I slumped against his ribs, slightly boggled.</p><p>Clearly, mind-blowing sex combined with hash brown casserole had hallucinogenic properties.</p><p>We lay there in the dark, wrapped around each other, Jed\u2019s chin resting on my shoulder. I was so relaxed and content that I was drifting on that line between sleep and waking. And Jed suddenly nudged my cheek with his nose and said, \u201cWhat were you going to ask me?\u201d</p><p>I yawned. \u201cBefore you so rudely interrupted me with sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I turned over to face him, balancing on my elbows as my hair fell back over my shoulders. \u201cWhy are you so weird around me?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and paused midnuzzle. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice one minute, and then the next, you\u2019re running into your house like your arse is on fire to avoid me. When we do talk, you\u2019re funny and charming and sweet, but then I haven\u2019t been able to talk to you that often over the last few weeks, because you hide out in your side of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to ask me if they looked real,\u201d he said, nodding toward my chest. \u201cWhich they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I ask you anything the least bit personal, you deflect with a dirty joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForce of habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cut it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to having my family living on all sides. I\u2019ve never had a hot neighbor before. I don\u2019t know how to act when I like someone and she\u2019s living so close. I figured if I was always at your door, asking you over for dinner, I would come across like a crazy stalker.\u201d His face was suddenly so serious, little worry lines forming around his mouth in an expression like regret. \u201cI like you, so much more than I expected, and it\u2019s made things more difficult than they should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like me too much?\u201d I asked, skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he said, his tone surprised, as if he hadn\u2019t thought about this until now.</p><p>Well, it was a reason. It wasn\u2019t a good reason, but I would accept it.</p><p>He shifted on the mattress, running a hand down the length of my side to curve over my hip. He ran the tips of his fingers over the small of my back, stroking the base of my spine. \u201cNow I have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it about my snoring?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you here?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy would a girl move from the big city to Middle-of-Nowhere, Kentucky? And don\u2019t tell me change of scenery. Because no scenery could be that bad that you\u2019d move to the Hollow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a witch on the hunt for magical artifacts that will guarantee our continued magical domination over an evil former branch of our family.</p><p>Well, I should probably phrase it some other way.</p><p>I looked up at him, tracing the contours of his cheekbones with my fingertips. I\u2019d omitted or outright lied to him about so many things. Lying to Jed weighed on me more than I\u2019d expected. I wanted to tell him the truth for once, about this one little thing. I didn\u2019t have to tell him about witchcraft or where I was really from, but I could give him this tiny bit of truth.</p><p>\u201cI have family in the Hollow,\u201d I said, carefully lacing my fingers through his. \u201cI only found out about them a few months ago. My mother never knew her dad. It was always this big family secret we were never even supposed to ask about. My grandmother died recently, and right before she passed, she shared his name with me. Have you heard of Gilbert Wainwright, the man who owned the house before Dick?\u201d</p><p>Jed\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt turns out my grandfather died a while ago but left behind other relatives. Aunts and uncles and cousins,\u201d I said, thinking of my vampire friends and the more trustworthy branch of the Lavelle clan. \u201cAnd I wanted to get to know that side of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you never knew this whole section of your family existed, and bam, instant aunts and uncles?\u201d he asked, propping his head against a pillow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBizarre,\u201d I admitted with a sniffle. He was quiet for a long moment, staring at me and running his fingertips down the length of my cheek.</p><p>\u201cFamily can be that way. Bizarre, I mean. Have I ever told you about the time my brother Jim threw a dart at my head and put me in an eye patch for two months?\u201d he asked, rolling me onto my side and pulling my back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow would you have possibly told me about that?\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh. I made that eye patch look good,\u201d he grumbled, jostling me. \u201cHad to wear the damn thing on school picture day. So this is the story of how Jed learned when Jim says, \u2018Duck,\u2019 to take him seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me an absurd, painful story about your childhood to make me feel less awkward about this postcoital confessional?\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d I said, turning and nestling my forehead against his collarbone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t remember falling asleep. I remembered Jed telling his eye patch story (I found out later this was one of several incidents involving his brother that ended in Jed wearing an eye patch), and then I was walking along a fern-choked trail in a jungle with a figure in front of me, chopping through vegetation with a machete. The air was sticky and hot, smelling of rotting plants. And in the distance, I could hear church bells over the din of a thousand squawking tropical birds.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d Mr. Wainwright called over his khaki-clad shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAw, hell, again?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you know how off-putting it is to fall asleep in the arms of a naked man and wake up on a field trip with your grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, dear,\u201d he admonished, leaning against a tree for a breather. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at the Sleep-Tight Inn, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s adventure enough for me.\u201d Glancing up the trail, I saw a decrepit whitewashed church in the distance. Its bell clanged loudly, although there was no one to yank the pull.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked as he adjusted his dark-blue neckerchief.</p><p>\u201cSouth America?\u201d he guessed. \u201cI hate to belabor the point, but it\u2019s your dream.\u201d</p> <p>I hissed as a banana leaf snapped back and thwacked me across the face. \u201cSo what nonhelpful advice do you have to offer me this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever trust a man with the middle name Wayne,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, hacking his way through a clump of banana leaves. \u201cYou never said the advice had to be related to the Elements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I even bothering?\u201d I sighed, following him. \u201cYou know, I managed to find two of the Elements on my own. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d he said as a large yellow butterfly fluttered past his shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who keeps bringing me back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright,\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not going to call me Grandpa, are you?\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>\u201cNot for a while,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know you that well yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped that spending time at the shop would help you get to know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a figment of my imagination. Do figments hope?\u201d</p> <p>He snickered. \u201cTouch\u00e9. You know, this might go a bit faster if you used a little . . .\u201d He waggled his fingers as if casting a Las Vegas magician\u2019s spell.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cYou want me to use magic because you\u2019re having trouble with some landscaping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to use magic because it can be fun,\u201d he said, gesturing to building-scale trees towering over our heads. \u201cMaybe just peel all the greenery back like curtains. Or make the trees dance around like those \u2018Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice\u2019 mops in Fantasia. I just want to see what you can do. It\u2019s not like I ever got to watch you perform in a ballet recital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never took ballet. And didn\u2019t Nana tell you anything about our magic?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said your family\u2019s talents were a gift, not that you were only allowed to put them toward practical purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cJust think of how boring life would be if you received gloves and car-detailing kits every Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to my grandmother\u2019s many, many lectures on magic. She had never told me that magic wasn\u2019t supposed to be fun. In fact, I remembered several lessons in which she taught me to create shapes in colored smoke through concentration. Or to make fire dance. But the fire-dancing lesson had ended in tears and damaged drapes. So we\u2019d stuck to the area in which I excelled, which happened to be healing. There aren\u2019t a lot of laughs to be had in curing rashes and boils.</p><p>Come to think of it, in addition to the motel sleeping bag, Stephen had also given me gloves and a car-detailing kit for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said. \u201cI think the search for your Elements is a bit like keeping a grip on that altar plaque. If you try too hard to hold on to it, you\u2019ll break it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I need to relax.\u201d I snorted. \u201cIn the face of an impossible task and a looming deadline, I\u2019m supposed to relax and have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Thanks, Mr. Wainwright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not budging on that \u2018Grandpa\u2019 issue, are you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head but grinned at him and squeezed his hand. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright squeezed my hand tightly, then turned on his heel and commenced chopping through the jungle plants again.</p><p>\u201cNola?\u201d he called as he pushed into the brush. \u201cTake it easy on Dick. He means well.\u201d</p><p>Muttering to myself about unhelpful figments, I woke up with my head propped on my arm and the bare expanse of Jed\u2019s back turned toward me. He was up on one elbow, holding something, shifting it back and forth in his hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked. Startled, he turned, and there was a strange, unfamiliar expression on his face. Sadness, regret, a touch of anger. I\u2019d never seen those emotions on Jed\u2019s sunny, open face. He looked down at me, a quick grin spreading across his features, chasing the sad expression away. \u201cYeah, just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is incredibly awkward,\u201d I said. I sat up, with the sheets pressed to my chest. I looked over Jed\u2019s shoulder to find that he was holding the altar plaque in his hands, turning it over and over. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t get a very good look at it last night,\u201d he said, turning onto his back and pulling me with him so I was splayed across his chest as he toyed with the plaque. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chunk of clay. I was tryin\u2019 to figure out what was so special about this that Jane Jameson would send us all the way down here for it.\u201d</p><p>I carefully retrieved the plaque from his hands and wrapped it in the unbleached cloth I\u2019d packed for just such a purpose. \u201cI think it was the principle of the thing. Jane got really pissed at the idea that Mama Ginger had not only stolen from her but had also used ill-gotten goods to get out of shopping for a present. Reclaiming the gift would embarrass Mama Ginger, so the effort was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why send you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time at the shop lately, and I haven\u2019t stolen anything from her yet. It fostered a sense of trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan on pattin\u2019 you down after you get out of my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was also one of the few people she knew who could make the trip down here,\u201d I said. There was a pause, not awkward, just pleasant. I pressed a finger into the little divot in his chin, making him dip his head and bite down on my fingertip. I laughed and drew it away, but not before his rasping tongue on the ridges of my skin sparked some rather pleasant tingles between my thighs. \u201cSo last night . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . Was not a one-time occasion,\u201d he informed me. \u201cThat was new for me. The whole talkin\u2019 and actually tellin\u2019 you what I think, instead of what I think you want to hear\u2014I don\u2019t do that with everybody. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done that before. This is a beginning, not a brush-off, understood?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cStill, it is incredibly awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time?\u201d He leaned across the sheets and pushed my hair back from my face. I nodded. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m easy?\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re easy, either. I think you\u2019re sexy and fun and bendy in all the right places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, \u2018bendy\u2019 is a selling point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I saw all kind of potential in you last night.\u201d</p><p>The drive back was pleasant enough. I ended up sleeping for a good portion of it, which made Jed snicker about having worn me out. I snarked back that I was just trying to avoid further trauma from Atlanta traffic. We only made a few stops for coffee and Sno-Balls, and by midafternoon, we were rolling back into town.</p><p>I liked that despite the fact that we\u2019d seen each other naked, nothing seemed to change. He still made inappropriate jokes. I made vague threats to his manhood. It was lovely, relaxed. But I felt strange that I didn\u2019t feel worse. I\u2019d fought with Stephen, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d broken it off with him officially. He\u2019d left me ten voice-mail messages, most of which I\u2019d ignored. As far I knew, he was ordering bloody apology flowers and sending them my way. If so, I was a terrible girlfriend. But what bothered me the most was that I didn\u2019t actually feel bad. Physically, I felt good\u2014balanced, limber, and untroubled. The last time I felt this loose was after getting a massage at one of those day spas when Penny got married and insisted on a girls\u2019 do.</p><p>I was a morality-free zone.</p><p>Still, it was hard to feel bad, knowing that the plaque was resting comfortably in my overnight bag. Jed pulled the truck into the driveway and slowed to a stop. \u201cSo, frankly, I\u2019m sick of the sight of you,\u201d he told me with a distressingly straight face. \u201cGet out of my truck, and definitely do not come to my side of the house for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are truly a bizarre man,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cIs pizza OK?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cFine, pizza, with a potential side order of repeat sex.\u201d</p><p>He climbed out of the truck and craned his head back through the door. \u201cIf I place the order that way at Pete\u2019s Pies, the lady who answers their phones will pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she will remember the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the bags,\u201d he called from the truck\u2019s tailgate. \u201cCan you grab my mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><p>I was halfway to the door-mounted mailbox when I heard Jed yelp, \u201cShit!\u201d and then a crunch. When I rounded the truck, I saw him standing over my suitcase, which was lying on its side in the gravel.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, fumbling with the zipper. I\u2019d placed the plaque inside a zippered pocket on the outside of the bag. I could only hope that Jed hadn\u2019t dropped the bag on that side.</p><p>Jed\u2019s expression was stricken. \u201cIt just slipped out of my hand.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled through my overnight bag to find the cloth bag I\u2019d wrapped around the plaque. My heart sank as the bag tinkled and crunched in my shaking hands. The clay was shattered. There were three or four pieces the size of my thumb, but everything else was practically dust. It wasn\u2019t surprising, I supposed, considering how old the clay was. I took deep breaths and tried to keep myself centered. I couldn\u2019t risk having a meltdown and blowing up Jed\u2019s porch lights.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, his face ashen. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d I told him, holding up the clay shards. I took a deep breath and forced my voice to stay steady. \u201cAccidents happen, Jed. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>Jed bent to examine the bits in my hand. The outsides of the larger pieces were distressed and old, but the interiors were just as bright and fresh as a new penny. Maybe the hum of magic that had cloaked the plaque all those years had formed some sort of stasis?</p><p>\u201cHow angry is Jane going to be?\u201d he asked, taking one piece and turning it over in my palm. \u201cI can tell her it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane won\u2019t be angry at all,\u201d I told him honestly. I tried to manage a smile for him, so he wouldn\u2019t beat himself up over this. \u201cIt\u2019s just an ashtray.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening, I tried to piece the plaque back together like a jigsaw puzzle. I managed a flat, vaguely round shape, but that was it. I even tried to use the plaque\u2019s own magic to get the pieces to call out to one another, to re-form to its original state, but it didn\u2019t respond the way I thought a magically infused item would. They were just bits of clay. Instead of contaminating those bits with the fumes of Super Glue, I decided I would take them to the shop, put them in an unbleached cotton bag, and close the lot up in a drawer full of good Kilcairy soil. That was the extent of what I could do.</p><p>I heard Jed walk out his front door and listened for the sound of his truck, but I got distracted when the phone rang. My dear Penny didn\u2019t have an opinion about whether the plaque would \u201cwork\u201d when it was broken. It was possible it wouldn\u2019t work, but at the same time, I felt sort of free. The Kerrigans couldn\u2019t get all four items. They couldn\u2019t bind us, which would ease my family\u2019s anxiety and keep the clinic running smoothly. Of course, we couldn\u2019t bind them, but that was another problem entirely. Still, I\u2019d failed to protect centuries of family history. And I was depressed beyond the telling of it, and Jed was embarrassed. The evening I\u2019d hoped would be spent having the aforementioned bendy-straw sex was spent in separate quarters. I sat in the kitchen, staring down at the dust, trying to figure out what to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Penny did, however, think it was rather hilarious that of all the people in the family, I\u2019d been the one who inadvertently destroyed our heirloom.</p><p>\u201cYou are hereby the worst witch in the family!\u201d she hooted. \u201cI mean, clearly, it\u2019s a tragedy, but the fact that you did it, and not me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo soon, Penny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStephen came by the clinic,\u201d she said, in a quick change of subject. \u201cIt was rather shocking, him just showing up out of the blue. I know he avoids coming here unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Anyway, he seems to think you\u2019ve lost your mind. Did you really break it off with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. The conversation didn\u2019t end with kissy noises, that\u2019s for certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you did, I, for one, am glad. I was getting tired of talking to him. And I didn\u2019t even have to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, other than casting doubts about my mental capacity, what did Stephen have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing memorable; it was a conversation with Stephen. You know I only pay attention half the time he\u2019s speaking. But do us a favor, and call him to settle things, so he stops pestering us? Uncle Seamus\u2019s hexing hand is getting itchy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him and clear things up,\u201d I promised. \u201cJust not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who, may I ask, is the person you are choosing to spend time with instead of our dear Stephen?\u201d As I made an indignant squawking noise, she added, \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to deny it, I can hear that \u2018I just did naked things\u2019 quality in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do naked things,\u201d I said primly. \u201cWe were only seminude.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Jed had left his socks on.</p><p>Penny gasped noisily. \u201cSeminude as in shirtless?\u201d she cried. \u201cAs in your shirt-hating neighbor? You got seminude with the gorgeous, shirt-hating neighbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will neither confirm nor deny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time you started making stupid decisions. It was getting lonely out here on the \u2018screw-up\u2019 limb of the family tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who told you that getting your boyfriend\u2019s name tattooed on your ankle was a good idea? You were limited to men named Dave until you saved up enough to have it removed. Now, if all you\u2019re going to do is mock my not-so-youthful indiscretions, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d she cried. \u201cJust tell me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time you saw him, was he wearing ripped jeans and a muscle shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaimed, before adding, \u201cNot today . . . Did you know they call them \u2018wifebeaters\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s off-putting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pressed me. \u201cYou tell me about it. What\u2019s this Jed like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a nice man who lives next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s good-lookin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculously so.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut nothing serious is going to happen, because that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, the whole family expects you to shut yourself off from the waist down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m pretty sure Stephen would want me to,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, that would be the only way I would survive sleeping with Stephen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Penelope.\u201d</p><p>After several very expensive minutes\u2019 worth of harassment from Penny, I hung up on her. But she did ask whether I would qualify Jed\u2019s arse as \u201csqueezable.\u201d The woman had it coming.</p><p>Eager to shake off the images of Penny sexually harassing my neighbor, I went to the sink to start tea. There was a squarish window over the sink, with a pretty blue flower box outside overflowing with white impatiens, thanks to the work crews. I was loath to admit it, but I was afraid to look out the window into the back garden. The clouds had cleared, and even the half-moon was bright. And I was convinced that the moment I looked up, I would see a Chupacabra pressed against the window like a suction-cup Garfield doll. But damned if I didn\u2019t accidentally look up anyway.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Near my brand-new arbor, I could see something moving. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. It stood on two feet and seemed human. The shape seemed thinner than last time, larger, but I was viewing it from another angle. It crept past the arbor toward the house. Gasping, I dashed toward my kitchen door and flipped the lock. I fumbled for the light switch, and the room plunged into darkness. The outlines of the trees stood in sharp relief without the interference of the kitchen light. The shape stilled, swinging its head toward the house. I backed away from the door, wondering if it was smarter to run upstairs or out the front door. Of course, this had to happen on one of my \u201cpowerless\u201d days, so I couldn\u2019t even work up the juice to neutralize whatever it was if it broke into the house.</p><p>A voice sounded behind me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Shrieking, I pivoted on my heel and swung my fist as hard as I could.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Jane cried, dropping to her knees and clutching her chest. She glared up at me and wheezed, \u201cWhy did you punch me in the boob?\u201d</p><p>Jane and Jolene were standing in my kitchen. Well, technically, Jolene had collapsed to her knees, cackling with laughter. And Jane was crumpled on the floor, hit by friendly fire. I looked toward the back garden, but the shape had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHow does \u2018startled\u2019 end with me getting punched in the boob?\u201d she griped as I helped her to her feet. \u201cIf this is about Jed driving you, that was Andrea\u2019s idea, not mine. Personally, I don\u2019t really like the guy. His thoughts are all cloudy. Makes me uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have vampire strength and speed. How could I hit you in the first place?\u201d I countered while Jolene continued to hee-haw.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use my vampire speed when I\u2019m around human friends, whom I expect not to punch me in the boob. And how is superstrength supposed to make this hurt less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even get in here?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYour front door was unlocked,\u201d Jane said, wincing as she settled into a kitchen chair. \u201cWe came by to see how your little dip in Mama Ginger\u2019s freaky gene pool went and to give you hell over spending twenty-four hours in a truck with your hot neighbor. Andrea would have come by, but I think she was afraid you\u2019d be mad at her for setting you up. We knocked. We called for you, but I guess you were so busy staring out your back window that you didn\u2019t hear us. What are you staring at, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going crazy,\u201d I groaned, pouring a cup of tea for Jolene.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I saw someone in my back garden,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it before. I think it\u2019s a Yeti or a werewolf or something.\u201d</p><p>Jolene cleared her throat. \u201cYeah, that would be . . . nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep seeing this weird shape outside in the yard,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems to be watching the house but never comes close enough for me to get a good look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just an animal,\u201d Jane assured me. \u201cWe get all sorts of weird critters around here. And some animals, like deer, don\u2019t think twice about coming close to a house. Hell, if you\u2019re not careful, they can end up in your house. Just ask my cousin Junie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on two legs. It looked human. Just dark and hairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then.\u201d Jolene squared her shoulders and pushed the back door open.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jolene, wait!\u201d I hissed as she stepped onto the back porch. Jane put a hand on my shoulder and shook her head. I heard Jolene take a deep breath through her nose and hold it. She looked back at Jane and shook her head.</p><p>What in the hell was going on?</p><p>Jane turned to me. \u201cThe Kerrigans. Those people you were talking about before. They wouldn\u2019t know to look for you here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I mean, they have more resources than we do, financially. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t take much to track me through customs, though it wouldn\u2019t explain how they would know I\u2019m renting this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no more jaunts out of town without vampire escort. And no jaunts into the backyard after dark. Basically, you will do no jaunting of any kind. And we\u2019ll talk to Dick about putting some extra security lights back here.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cMust we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jane insisted. \u201cAnd you two are going to have a long, clarifying chat. He\u2019s let you stew about this too long. He\u2019s wasting precious time being afraid of freaking you out.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other bruised boob owes you an explanation,\u201d Jane deadpanned.</p><p>11</p><p>If you stumble upon a family ritual involving vampires, move along. They\u2019re too odd and twisted to get involved with safely.</p><p>\u2014Miss Manners\u2019 Guide to Undead Etiquette</p><p>The next night, I secured the plaque dust in Jane\u2019s shop safe. I opened the drawers in Uncle Jack\u2019s cabinet, as if I could make the other two Elements appear by force of will. Two left. It had taken me nearly a month, but I\u2019d managed to find two. I knew this was a minor miracle, and that I should have been thrilled. But the fact that Earth was broken into bits was more than a little disheartening. It had certainly taken the shine off being halfway to my goal.</p><p>I had another month. I didn\u2019t know where to begin looking for the other two Elements. I didn\u2019t know whether I could try contacting Nana through the die again. There had been ridiculously few clues in Jane\u2019s sales records. So far, I\u2019d skated by on chance. And I didn\u2019t know how to kick-start chance.</p><p>\u201cNola!\u201d Jane called. My favorite vampire\u2019s head suddenly appeared in the doorway to her office. Her lips were twitching a little. I was so glad she could find amusement in my abject discomfort. \u201cCan you come up front?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right, the heart-to-heart with Dick.</p><p>That sounded wrong, even in my head.</p><p>\u201cI would really rather not.\u201d</p><p>Jane laughed lightly. \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019re thinking. Literally. And I promise you, this situation is absolutely nothing like the disturbing worst-case scenario that\u2019s going on in your head. Could you please just come and talk to Dick?\u201d</p><p>I peered up at her over my reading glasses, skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, if you\u2019re propositioned in any way, I will serve as your getaway driver,\u201d she said, holding up her hand in a mockery of the Girl Scout promise.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled, following her to the coffee bar.</p><p>Dick was a vampire the worse for wear. In the weeks since I\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d developed little worry lines where the undead weren\u2019t supposed to get lines. He looked tired and pale, like a man who\u2019d been beating himself up night after night, only to stay up half the day to do it some more.</p><p>This was about as comfortable as one of those intervention shows, when the clueless alcoholic walks into a hotel room to find a circle of friends with tear-jerking letters. When I stopped, Jane prodded me to keep walking. I walked around the bar and stood at the point farthest away from Dick, which Andrea seemed to find really amusing for some reason.</p><p>Dick was making a study of the ceiling and would not look at me. Jane cleared her throat. Dick shifted his eyes to the track lighting.</p><p>\u201cDick!\u201d Jane exclaimed. \u201cOut with it.\u201d</p><p>Dick cleared his throat. \u201cUm, Nola, Jane tells me you seem to have some misconceptions about my intentions toward you. I just wanted to apologize for any occasions on which I made you feel uncomfortable or objectified in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone write that speech for you before you came?\u201d I asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cI think he cobbled together portions of those \u2018leaving to spend more time with my family\u2019 speeches given by disgraced politicians,\u201d Andrea said, sipping fresh blood and coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jane snickered.</p><p>\u201cYou both suck,\u201d Dick told them. \u201cOK, look, Nola, I didn\u2019t want to just throw this out at you when you first showed up. I wanted you to get to know me better so it wouldn\u2019t come as a shock. But I guess I got a little over-enthusiastic, and instead of being friendly to you, I came across like a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy stalker?\u201d Jane suggested cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cSex predator?\u201d Andrea added. \u201cWhich made me an accessory to said predator.\u201d</p><p>Dick pointed a finger in their direction. \u201cThat.\u201d He cleared his throat and reached toward my hand. Thinking better of it, he awkwardly changed directions and wiped his hand on his jeans. \u201cGilbert Wainwright, he was my great-great-, well, a couple of times great-grandson,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWhich would make me your great-great-, several more times great-grandpa.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. The room seemed to list like a ship\u2019s deck under my feet. I studied his face closely. I could see the slope of my mother\u2019s nose on his face, the irregular bow to his lips. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d</p><p>Behind me, Andrea slapped Jane\u2019s shoulder and hissed, \u201cI told you so!\u201d</p><p>Jane yelped and said, \u201cI thought she would find Dick being a relative a preferable alternative to him wanting to sleep with her. Damn it, Andrea, get a cold rag. I think Nola\u2019s going to faint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Panic attack,\u201d I wheezed. \u201cMy whole life is one long series of barely averted panic attacks. I\u2019m going to sit down.\u201d</p><p>My knees buckled as I leaned onto the bar stools. My face seemed so cold all of a sudden, and my stomach roiled. Jane exclaimed something about wanting the news to be \u201ca surprise, not a bad talk-show reunion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Dick asked as my head swam.</p><p>Dick was my ancestor? Mr. Wainwright may have been a little disheveled, but he seemed respectable. But Dick? Sometimes I had to fight the instinct to clutch my purse to my chest to keep him from snatching it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep taking shocks like this. I\u2019d lived for years believing that my life was arranged in a specific, if slightly bizarre, way. And now these little bombs of revelation kept dropping on my head and changing the way I saw myself, my family, my whole damned life. Part of me wanted to throw that stupid bottle of synthetic blood at his head and tell him not to speak to me again.</p><p>And yet there was the curve of my cheek and the odd long line of my mother\u2019s nose in this man\u2019s face. And I felt the loss of my nana all over again. She would know exactly what to say in this situation, and here I was as stunned as a half-dead fish. Whatever momentum I\u2019d built toward the stool shifted, and I knew I was on a collision course with the floor. A pair of cool, strong hands caught my elbows and held me upright. And the next thing I knew, my face was pressed against the worn, clean cotton of Dick\u2019s T-shirt.</p> <p>Andrea appeared at his side with a bottle of water and pressed the cool plastic into my hand. Dick apologized over and over as he helped my bum locate the seat.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, for weeks, Dick has been running himself ragged, fussing over stuff like \u2018Is that chair safe enough for Nola to sit in?\u2019 and whether he should baby-proof his house,\u201d Jane mused. Dick glared at her. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re a wide-open channel when you receive emotionally charged news.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Dick. \u201cBaby-proofing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to spend much time around my kin while they were living,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cAnd you look so fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so fixing up the house I\u2019m living in now . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs a much-needed business investment,\u201d he assured me. \u201cWhich just happens to ensure your safety and comfort. While we\u2019re talking about the house, you can take your rent checks back. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to charge my own granddaughter to put a roof over her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to pay my own way . . . what do I call you now? It seems wrong to call you Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrampy?\u201d Jane suggested with a wry grin. Andrea threw a coffee filter at her head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dick said, and if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, the slightest bit of pink-tinged moisture was gathering at the corners of his eyes. \u201cYou could call me Grandpa if you want. Or Papa. Whatever makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable with any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for everyone to adjust,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure it all out. But if you call me Granny, I will smack you so hard your eyes will cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually sound quite a bit like my granny,\u201d I mused, ducking when Andrea tossed another filter my way. \u201cThough I think if anybody has to the right to smack anybody, it\u2019s me. I can\u2019t believe you two kept this from me! I thought\u2014well, Jane knows what I thought. How could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our place,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAndrea wanted to let Dick find his own way to tell you, which was clearly a mistake. And I\u2019m not related to you, and no good has ever come of me blabbing secrets that don\u2019t belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, it wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as funny,\u201d Andrea said.</p><p>\u201cShut it, Granny,\u201d I said as Andrea made rude and unladylike gestures. \u201cAnd while I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re fixing up the house, none of this is necessary.\u201d</p><p>Andrea snorted and gave me a wink. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even seen the Christmas presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I go out back and find out you\u2019ve bought me a pony, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do, Dick.\u201d</p><p>Ruffling my hair, Dick gave me an even better gift. He handed me a family tree he\u2019d diagrammed on graph paper, including birth and death dates, marriages, and children. It showed that Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s father, Gordon Wainwright, was the son of Albert Wainwright, son of Eugenia Wainwright, a laundry woman who had worked on the Cheney family farm when Dick was human. She had Albert in 1879 but died a short time later.</p><p>\u201cWhen Eugenia had the baby, I was young and mortal . . . and stupid. I let my parents talk me out of claiming him, even when his mama died,\u201d he told me, a sheepish, forlorn expression wrinkling his handsome face. Andrea rubbed his back and nudged him a little, encouraging him to continue. \u201cAlbert grew up, and I was able to watch him from a distance. He married, had a son. His son married, had a son. And I watched over them, all of them, watched them live their lives, enjoy their successes, make their mistakes. I never made contact with them,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you make contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen his father died and his mother was having troubles making ends meet, I came forward. I didn\u2019t tell his mama who I was, exactly, just a distant cousin who was interested in making sure the family was well taken care of. I made sure Gilbert and his sister had new clothes, enough to eat, money for college and books, and whatever else they needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What was so special about my grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the first in our family who looked like he might amount to something. He was such a good boy, and he was so interested in learning more about, hell, everything. He turned everything he did into an opportunity to understand more about the world. He was the first man in our family to start college, much less finish it.\u201d Dick smiled proudly. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s you. Look at you. You went to college. You\u2019re a nurse. You help people. You\u2019re just like him. And you\u2019re a girl. Our family hardly ever gets girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the pink roses you planted outside my door.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re part of a pretty long line, over there in the old country. But the line you have here? It\u2019s just as long. Maybe not as distinguished, but we\u2019re colorful. Please believe me, if Gilbert had known about your mama, about you, you have no idea what it would have meant to him. He was fond of Jane, but knowing that you were out there would have made him so happy. Hell, I\u2019m happy to know you. Now, sit down and tell me all about yourself.\u201d</p><p>So we talked. The more he talked about his love for his descendants, the more I felt sick and guilty for assuming that Dick was a polyamorous lecher. It was sweet that he was trying so hard, even if some of his gestures made me extremely uncomfortable. And he seemed to be operating under the assumption that I was both a preadolescent and an innocent flower. He was not happy that his wife had arranged for me to go on an overnight trip with \u201ca man composed entirely of testosterone and aftershave.\u201d I felt that was unfair.</p><p>When I\u2019d first moved overseas, my uncles had tried to make up for the loss of my father when I was growing up, making sure that I had someone to escort me on the school\u2019s awards days, to teach me to drive and where to strike first if my date got fresh. But they had their own children to attend to. Even if Dick was . . . unconventional, he was doing his best to show me how glad he was that I existed. And really, that\u2019s all any kid hopes for.</p><p>Stephen called. A lot. He begged me to reconsider ending things between us, which helped settled the debate about whether I\u2019d broken up with him. I called him back once to tell him to stop calling, but all I got was his voice mail. Unfortunately, that seemed to encourage him to double his calls. I was considering buying a new phone, but that would mean reprogramming my entire address book. I had a lot of cousins.</p><p>In less conclusive dating news, my pizza date with Jed was postponed by several nights. Jed had to work overtime on a vampire\u2019s home theater, and then I ended up getting caught in the middle of a stomach-flu epidemic at the clinic. I came home from the clinic the following Friday smelling strongly of Lysol but determined to spend some prearranged time with him.</p><p>I did bathe first.</p><p>For some reason, discussing various aspects of witchcraft with me had inspired Jane to stock more \u201cCrafty\u201d items, including incense and bath oils. I was experimenting with said oils tonight\u2014neroli, a citrus extract that was supposed to, er, stimulate one\u2019s partner, and sunflower for creative thinking. I\u2019d never bothered before, but it couldn\u2019t hurt and smelled downright delicious. I sank in the warm, frothy water up to my chin. Now that I knew that Dick was trying to do something nice for me as his descendant and not draw me into a creepy love web, I could enjoy the tub.</p><p>As much as I\u2019d come to appreciate Dick\u2019s improvements to the house, it had made the place feel different. When I came home from work, the house felt off. Shoes that I thought I\u2019d left in front of the closet showed up by my dresser. The furniture I\u2019d purchased from different thrift stores around town seemed to have moved a few inches. A carnelian necklace that belonged to Nana Fee disappeared from my bathroom drawer. The house even smelled different, a strange musky note over the soft green and floral scents I preferred.</p><p>I wondered whether it could be a ghost. Jane had mentioned that my grandfather remained on the earthly plane for more than a year after he died. And this house had belonged to several generations of Wainwrights before him. But Jane insisted that Mr. Wainwright had moved on. And Nana Fee wouldn\u2019t waste her time moving my shoes and retrieving her costume jewelry.</p><p>The examples were so minor I felt silly bringing them up to anyone. But it was making me edgy. Between my house possibly being haunted by a furniture-moving ghost and my ex-boyfriend issues, if anyone needed a bubble bath at the moment, it was me.</p><p>I closed my eyes, tipped my head back, and let my arms float to the surface. I hadn\u2019t made any progress in my search for the two items left, the athame and the bell. The bell represented water and was usually rung to mark the beginning and end of rituals. It made sense, on a certain level. The ripples of sound waves weren\u2019t that different from the undulating surface of water. And although some Wiccan groups disagreed over whether air was best represented by a wand or an athame, McGavocks had always favored blades to direct energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I always found it amusing that sweet little old Nana Fee had so many knives around the house: ritual knives, small blades for taking cuttings from her garden, and, of course, kitchen knives. This also explained why no one broke into our house. Ever.</p><p>The warm water lapping over my skin had my mind drifting from image to image. The athame sliding through the air, pulling energy from one edge of the circle to the other like thick ropes of viscous blue taffy. The ropes thinned and curled, becoming ocean waves flowing past the shores near my village. I blew out a long breath, taking in the sweet scented air. I imagined the waves rolling and ebbing, creating a continuous glowing white line over my head. The line looped into circles, pulsing and growing in strength. I flexed my hands under the water, moving them like a conductor leading a symphony. I pulled that glowing line in my mind with a turn of my wrist, strumming it against my fingertips.</p><p>I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. My eyes popped open with a start. The small funnel stream of water that had formed on the surface of the bath, a tiny hurricane I\u2019d created during this impromptu meditation exercise, collapsed on itself with a splash. I blinked rapidly.</p> <p>That was new.</p><p>And suddenly, the spout exploded toward the ceiling, taking most of the bathwater with it as it grew. Panic had my ears buzzing as the footsteps grew closer and the water covering my body dropped to nothing. What if whoever it was saw this unnatural bathtub weather phenomenon? Worse, what if the the person saw me naked?</p><p>Another footfall sounded in the hallway. My head whipped toward the sound, and the water spout collapsed on itself, dumping buckets of water over my head and splashing all over the floor.</p><p>Bollocks.</p><p>But I had more pressing problems than a flooded bathroom. I knew I\u2019d locked the front door. The only person who had a copy of the key was Jed, in case of emergencies. But what if it wasn\u2019t Jed? I eyed the heavy pewter candlestick I\u2019d placed near the sink. As the steps came closer to my bedroom, I slid down the length of the tub and picked up the candlestick.</p> <p>Moving quietly, I rose to my knees. I wondered if I could jump out of the tub and get to my robe before whoever it was got to my door. The noise stopped just outside my door. My arm froze over the edge of the tub, tensed for a swing.</p><p>Suddenly, Jed\u2019s head appeared in my bathroom doorway.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a picture,\u201d he said, grinning down at me. \u201cYou know, conventional wisdom says you should keep the water inside the tub.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, relief flooding my chest as I set the candlestick aside. \u201cI was just making room for you.\u201d</p><p>Jed grabbed some towels, got on his hands and knees, and mopped up the water I\u2019d spilled. I groaned, and not just because his delicious jean-clad bum was in view. \u201cThat is the hottest thing I have ever seen. A man cleaning up after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sexist.\u201d Grinning wickedly, he slipped out of his boots and rolled up the legs of his jeans, sliding behind me, balancing his bum on the lip of the tub while he settled his feet on either side of me. He settled my temple against his thigh and carefully massaged my neck as I refilled the tub with warm water.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one who got the master bed and bath.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m jealous. I think my part of the house was the servants\u2019 quarters. And just so you know, the tub in this room is twenty percent longer than the standard tub. Apparently, Mrs. Wainwright was a large woman.\u201d</p><p>It would have hurt my feelings that he just called my great-grandmother fat, but he was doing an awfully nice job with the neck rub. It pricked at my conscience that I still hadn\u2019t told Jed why I was in the Hollow. I mean, the man had seen me naked, but I wasn\u2019t willing to tell him about my family\u2019s unorthodox history? I ached to tell him about the recent development with Dick, but it would have involved an excessive amount of explaining, when all I wanted to do was sit quietly with someone who knew nothing about magic or centuries-old magical yard-sale finds. (And had abdominals you could use for laundry.)</p><p>With recently ended relationships, cultural differences, and as-yet-undisclosed vampire relatives, we were dealing with enough issues without adding magic into the mix.</p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI learned a lot,\u201d I said as he brushed the wet hair out of my face. Like the fact that I could create tiny storm systems with my mind. That was a life lesson if there ever was one. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take off those clothes and join me in this big old tub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re all wet and slippery and I\u2019m all wet and slippery, one of us might get hurt when I do this.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me softly on the lips. I rose to my knees, plucking at the buttons of his shirt with my wet fingers. I threw it onto the floor, and before I could get to his jeans, he pulled me against him. He was right, it was slippery. My skin slid against his, and he nearly dropped me as he dragged me out of the tub and wrapped a towel around me, although he didn\u2019t give me time to dry off as we fumbled toward the bed.</p><p>I looped my ankle around his, pushing him back onto the bed so I could yank the jeans and boxers away. He chuckled. \u201cWell, this is an exciting new side to you.\u201d</p><p>Grinning wildly, I climbed up on the bed, hovering over him, and settled my hips over his. I tucked my feet under his calves and stretched down the length of his body.</p> <p>\u201cSoooo bendy,\u201d he murmured, threading his hands through my hair and pressing his lips to mine.</p><p>\u201cReally, Jed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wantin\u2019 to tell you for a while now,\u201d he murmured against my lips.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He gently pinched my lips shut with his fingertips. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes as he smirked. His hips surged forward with a snap, and my whole body sang.</p><p>12</p><p>Never trust a werewolf when life is on the line.</p><p>\u2014When, What, Witch, Were, and Why?</p><p>The Five W\u2019s of Safe Interactions with the Paranormal</p><p>Dr. Hackett took a week off to go trout fishing in Arkansas, leaving me with time to throw myself into searching Specialty Books. The solstice deadline was looming in three weeks. I tried to use the die to contact Nana Fee (without Andrea\u2019s help), but all I managed to do was make contact with one of Jane\u2019s former step-grandfathers. He just wanted to say hello and tell her that \u201cGrandma Ruthie is still secured,\u201d whatever that meant.</p><p>As I had officially scoured every inch of the shop space, including searching for the athame in the utensil drawer of the coffee bar, I called or e-mailed Mr. Wainwright\u2019s contacts in the artifact market, anyone who might have supplied him with items for the shop, on the off chance that Mr. Wainwright had traded the athame for stock. Giving them a sob story about my grandmother accidentally selling a family heirloom to Mr. Wainwright, I asked if they would mind sending me a picture of any athames they\u2019d bartered through the shop. If it was the item I was looking for, I offered to buy it back for fifty percent more than they\u2019d paid for it.</p><p>A buyer in California told me to mind my own damn business and hung up on me. A buyer in Canada was only too happy to help, but the handle of his athame was blue enamel with a dark onyx stone. And the buyer in Spain . . .</p><p>\u201cI know my Spanish is rusty, but I\u2019m pretty sure cuadros desnudos means \u2018naked pictures,\u2019 \u201d Andrea said, handing me a printout as we sprawled around my living room, sorting through these e-mails. Jed, who had been spending more and more time in my half of the duplex, was perched on a ladder in the middle of the room, replacing the old globe light fixture with a ceiling fan. Because I still wasn\u2019t ready for the whole witchcraft confession, we\u2019d told him we were searching for some antiques to complete a collection for one of Jane\u2019s customers.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to see what he has, he wants to see what you have. It\u2019s your classic tit-for-athame scenario.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are enjoying this far too much,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said, nodding. Behind her, Jane gave me a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cI am not comfortable with this line of conversation,\u201d Dick muttered, walking away. \u201cIf I see you with a camera, young lady, you\u2019re grounded.\u201d</p><p>Jed, who seemed wary of my protective vampire great-great-great-grandpa, raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m with Mr. Cheney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I sighed, tossing the e-mail in the trash.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to call him Mr. Cheney,\u201d Andrea assured Jed as he made the last adjustment to the ceiling fan.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Jed responded.</p><p>Dick nodded as Jed climbed down the ladder. \u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, making a paper ball from the other e-mails and tossing them, too. Jane watched me closely as Jed climbed down the ladder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this far too well,\u201d Jane observed as Dick and Jed carried the old fixture and the ladder out of the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really relaxed the past few days, despite the fact that you\u2019ve struck out with those buyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, with the Earth plaque broken, it feels like the pressure is off a little bit,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep looking, because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but I don\u2019t know if the binding will work, even if I do find all four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it,\u201d Jane said, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYou\u2019ve had sex. With Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d I hissed at her. \u201cDick will hear you. We haven\u2019t actually told him that Jed and I are involved, for Jed\u2019s sake. And we haven\u2019t told Jed that I\u2019m related to Dick, because explaining my whole twisted family backstory is not something I\u2019m ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why is Jed all nervous and twitchy?\u201d Jane asked, glancing out to the backyard shed, where the menfolk were putting away tools.</p><p>\u201cBecause Dick keeps glaring at him and muttering under his breath,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd don\u2019t poke around in my head; we\u2019ve talked about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to poke around in your head,\u201d Andrea protested. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over your face. You might as well get \u2018recently banged\u2019 tattooed on your forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be friends with someone who sleeps with a \u2018Jed,\u2019 \u201d Jane pondered, pointing at her friend. \u201cAndrea, you set them up on that drive to Georgia; I blame you for this. Nola was such a nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Stephen is no more?\u201d Andrea asked, slapping Jane\u2019s accusing finger away from her face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t murder him,\u201d I said. \u201cI just stopped taking his calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen when you have to go back home?\u201d Andrea asked. \u201cAre you going to try to keep seeing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve made any big commitment to each other,\u201d I said. \u201cI like Jed. And he clearly likes me, or, at least, parts of me. He\u2019s a very nice man. He\u2019s sweet and funny and smart. And he doesn\u2019t ask a lot of questions about the amount of time I spend with vampires in an occult bookshop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he looks good naked,\u201d Jane added.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSooo good. But there are so many things I can\u2019t tell him. As much as I like him, how could I have a real relationship with someone I have to lie to and omit huge portions of my life? How could that ever work?\u201d</p><p>And that was what had been missing in my relationship with Stephen, I realized. I couldn\u2019t share my life with him, because there was so much he couldn\u2019t accept. He never directly asked me to give it up, but the message had been subtly clear. If I wanted Stephen, I would have to give up the connection with my family. I felt like an idiot now for not having seen that. He wouldn\u2019t have made demands. He wouldn\u2019t have forced me. He just wouldn\u2019t have been happy otherwise. He wasn\u2019t a bad man, just a \u201cnormal\u201d one. And normal was something I was never going to be, no matter how hard I tried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But where did that leave me with Jed?</p><p>I\u2019d told myself I was keeping things from Stephen to keep the peace and to protect him. But that was based on that fact that I\u2019d known he couldn\u2019t accept the witchcraft or the weirdness. I thought perhaps Jed was just quirky enough that he could. At the very least, I could tell him about Dick. Or warn him about Dick.</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t told him about the witchy stuff or the Elements or anything?\u201d Andrea asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to fit into a conversation,\u201d I told her. \u201cHow did you tell people that you were a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell people, really, until I told my parents,\u201d Jane offered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>Jane frowned. \u201cMy mother asked me if I could try not to be a vampire anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents disowned me way before I was turned,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cBut they did get really indignant when I didn\u2019t invite them to our wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s remarkably unhelpful,\u201d I said, covering my face with my hands. I was going to have to talk to Jed about some of these things. And the small matter of my returning to Ireland in a few weeks\u2019 time. Otherwise, we were doomed to end up just like Stephen and me. And that wasn\u2019t fair. If anything, I should let my personality and emotional baggage doom the relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go back to talking about sending that Spanish guy the naked pictures?\u201d Jane asked, nudging me with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It took a while to pry my vampire friends out of my living room. Jed had given up hours before, finding some excuse to retreat back to safe quarters on his side of the duplex. Jane and Andrea finally persuaded Dick to leave before he could try to replace other fixtures by reminding him of a Dukes of Hazzard marathon starting at midnight. I waited until I saw the taillights clear the driveway before sprinting across the porch. Before I could knock, Jed opened his door, yanked me into his foyer, and pinned me against the wall. Without saying a word, he pressed his lips against mine in a searing kiss. I moaned, twisting my fingers in the light cotton material of his long-sleeved workshirt as his hands slipped around my waist. Breathless and dizzy, I pulled away from him.</p><p>\u201cYour family scares me,\u201d he said.</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u201cFamily?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re obviously not blood-related, what with the opposing accents and pulse differences, but I know family when I see it. Those people love you. They\u2019re happy to spend time with you. And Dick spends most of his time glaring at me and making crotch-specific threats when you\u2019re not around. That\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Were they my family? Was I ready for any sort of family beyond the McGavocks? The clan and the clinic had been the focus of my life for so long. Did I have room for anything more in my head or my heart? I liked them all so much\u2014Dick, Andrea, Jane, the whole company. They\u2019d made me feel welcome and warm when I had no clue how to go about my search. They\u2019d done all they could to help me, sometimes crossing the line of what was appropriate or sensible. I wasn\u2019t a leader. I wasn\u2019t expected to know what to do every moment of every day. I made an absolute fool of myself when necessary, and nobody panicked. It was lovely. If I could somehow blend the two groups\u2014the overwhelming love of my living family with the unquestionable acceptance of my undead relatives\u2014I might turn out to be a somewhat normal person.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>I kissed Jed again\u2014Jed, the man who\u2019d done nothing but help me without demanding details or even questioning whether driving me across three states was a waste of time. And I felt a prick of guilt for keeping so much from him. How could he really like me when he only knew such a small part of me? No magic, no mission, no crazy vampire family. Maybe he would find those \u201cquirks\u201d charming and attractive.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d I said, kissing him one last time. \u201cSeveral things, actually.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, the flirty, sweet energy draining from his face. \u201cThere are some things I need to tell you, too.\u201d He kissed me again, and there was a strange air of finality to it. As if he was bracing himself for bad news. Did he know something was \u201coff\u201d about me? Was he more comfortable wondering than not knowing? A buzzing noise sounded from the kitchen, making me break off the kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cDinner,\u201d he said. \u201cI noticed you don\u2019t eat much around the vampires, so I warmed up a chicken pot pie. We\u2019ll eat, and then we\u2019ll talk, all right?\u201d</p><p>We gorged ourselves on pot pie and watched some silly Chuck Norris film Jed had insisted on, after I told him that I\u2019d never seen The Delta Force. Apparently, this was a felony in some states.</p><p>We cleaned up the dishes, then settled in for discussion, coffee, and the most feared beard in the universe. And for about twenty minutes, I was content and relaxed. Of course, it was all downhill from there.</p><p>\u201cHey, could you take this into the living room for me?\u201d he asked, handing me a bowl of rocky road ice cream. \u201cI\u2019m having a fistfight with the coffeemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone in this town have an adversarial relationship with coffeepots?\u201d I muttered as I carried the ice cream into the living room, carefully balancing the bowl to keep it from sliding off onto the floor. Penny never had forgiven me for the \u201cChristmas trifle\u201d incident.</p><p>But the television blaring Chuck Norris\u2019s all-around badassery was too much of a distraction, and I wasn\u2019t watching where I was stepping. Just as I passed the farthest edge of Jed\u2019s blue rag rug, my shoe caught on the fringe, dragging it back. I grumbled about my own clumsiness as I settled the bowl on the coffee table. I knelt to straighten the rug and noticed that one of the floorboards was loose, set slightly higher than the rest. I shot a guilty look toward the kitchen, where Jed was humming tunelessly. I hadn\u2019t damaged the floor, had I? I didn\u2019t remember dragging anything but the rug. I pushed on the board, trying to slide it back into place, but it listed and slid down into empty space.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I whispered, tilting forward as my weight shifted. I grabbed at the board, and my hand brushed against a cloth-wrapped bundle tucked away in the space underneath. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>There was a stack of photos under the bundle . . . and one of the buildings in the corner of the photo looked awfully familiar. I pulled on the bundle, but it wouldn\u2019t come up without pulling up more boards. I popped another board out of place and pulled the cloth up, bringing the stack of photos with it. They showed long-range shots of me, walking away from the clinic in Kilcairy. There was another one of me out to dinner with Stephen in Dublin. And another, with Penny, just before I\u2019d left for Kentucky.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The cloth slid out of my hand and to the floor with a dull clunk. My hands shook as I pulled the cloth loose to find the plaque\u2014the acorn-shaped plaque I\u2019d believed was smashed and stored in pieces in Jane\u2019s shop.</p><p>Jed had taken it. He must have switched the bundles when he took my bag out of my truck and then \u201caccidentally\u201d dropped my bag to make me think the plaque was broken. I was so stupid. I knew something was off with the age of those clay bits, but I\u2019d wanted so badly to believe that I held two of the Elements, that I could trust Jed, that I shut down any doubts I should have listened to.</p><p>\u201cI lost the fight with the coffeemaker,\u201d Jed said, carrying two mugs into the living room. \u201cJust think of the loose grounds as \u2018sprinkles.\u2019 \u201d He saw me on my knees, with the plaque in my hand. He dropped the mugs to the floor with a clash of broken pottery. \u201cNola, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I ground out. \u201cThere\u2019s no trying to convince me that \u2018this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u2019 Just explain to me, why the hell do you have this? Why would you make me think it had been destroyed? Why would you even want it?\u201d</p><p>Jed blanched, and his gaze immediately shifted downward. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for an apology, I want a goddamn explanation!\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here. You had pictures of me in your hidey-hole. You knew who I was as soon as you met me, didn\u2019t you? You knew I was a McGavock, about the witchcraft, the Elements, all of it. And you\u2019ve been pretending all this time to be this clueless, sexy, himbo neighbor man. Why? Who the hell are you, Jed? Is Jed even your real name, or did you pick it out of the Redneck Alias Handbook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word you\u2019ve ever said to me was a lie.\u201d I seethed. \u201cHere I was feeling guilty for keeping things from you\u2014my family, the vampires, my boyfriend\u2014and you were outright lying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every word,\u201d he said, shaking his head. I shoved him away, cradling the bundle against my chest. \u201cPlease, Nola, you have to understand. There\u2019s a good reason for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, what\u2019s your reason?\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you right now,\u201d he said, wincing. \u201cThere are things you need to understand first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft as a breeze as he said, \u201cI never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d I yelled, pushing past him toward the door, the plaque pressed to my chest.</p><p>\u201cNola, please.\u201d He grabbed my arm. At first, I thought he would grab for the plaque, but he was only trying to keep me from leaving. \u201cThe Kerrigans\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a rage I could only describe as volcanic bubbled up from my belly and surged through my arm to my hand. He knew the Kerrigans? Was he working for the Kerrigans?</p><p>And suddenly, Jed\u2019s arm was on fire.</p><p>He yelped, waving his flaming sleeve back and forth, feeding the fire oxygen and making a small situation much worse.</p><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d I exclaimed, I shoved him into the kitchen and pushed his sleeve into the sink. I picked up the sprayer and shot an arc of water toward him. After briefly dousing Jed\u2019s face, I aimed the stream at his arm and put the sleeve fire out. His face was pale and dripping wet as we stripped him out of his sodden shirt. While the flames hadn\u2019t left a mark on his flesh, the outline of my hand was clear, as if my palm had given him a contact burn. I jerked my hand away, unable to see anything but the blistered, bright-red handprint I\u2019d left on his arm.</p><p>Backing away, unable to take my eyes from the mark of violence I\u2019d left on his skin, I told him, \u201cDon\u2019t come near me again.\u201d</p><p>I marched out of Jed\u2019s apartment and drove directly to the shop.</p><p>How could I have been so stupid? How was it possible that Jed was some sort of witchcraft spy? Who was Jed, really? Was he working for the Kerrigans, or was there some new third party involved in the feud? How would the Kerrigans know someone from Tennessee? Was Jed really from Tennessee? Was the accent fake, too?</p><p>Oh, good night, I\u2019d let that man see me naked.</p><p>I\u2019d been had. I was the dumb henchman in the Bond movies who was distracted by female sidekicks with overtly sexual names who eventually strangled the henchman with their thighs. I\u2019d been used. He\u2019d never liked me. He\u2019d never found me \u201cadorable\u201d or \u201csweet\u201d or any of the little endearments he\u2019d tossed about so casually. And I think that was what hurt so much. I\u2019d really believed he liked me just for me. Not because of what I could do, because I was Nana\u2019s heir, or because I fit conveniently into his life as his lovely normal girlfriend. For me.</p><p>I do not remember anything about the drive, other than that I skipped going to the store in favor of pulling over in the Half-Moon Hollow Baptist Church car park to scream and beat on my steering wheel. And at the BP station. And the Bait-n-Beer.</p><p>It was a long drive.</p><p>Maybe, on some level, I\u2019d known. Maybe that was the root of whatever had kept me from telling the truth about why I was here, about the search. Some part of me must have known he wasn\u2019t trustworthy, too good to be true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, that was a rationalization. I\u2019d been completely taken in. I was a moron, a moron who would be taking a voluntary moratorium on dating for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Wherever Jed was, I hoped that burn mark on his arm really stung.</p><p>Yes, I was committed to doing no harm first, but screw it, Jed had taken advantage of me. He\u2019d known exactly what he was doing. If anybody had some magical blistering coming, it was him. If that meant I was sending bad energy out into the universe, so be it.</p> <p>I worked. I sulked. I searched. After I finally cooled off, I spilled my sorry tale of floor busting and betrayal to my vampire friends. While Jane stroked my head, Gabriel practically had to climb onto Dick\u2019s shoulders to hold him back from marching out of the shop and \u201cwhipping that boy\u2019s ass!\u201d It is really difficult to explain to your vampire ancestor why it\u2019s not OK to smash your sort-of-boyfriend\u2019s lying face in for betraying you to another magical family. It\u2019s even more difficult to explain that it is not a legal reason to evict someone from the house he\u2019s renting from you.</p><p>Dick settled for showing up later at my side of the house with a copy of The Notebook, a pint of Ben and Jerry\u2019s Phish Food, and a bottle of wine, dropping them off on my doorstep, patting me on the head, and departing without another word. I was really starting to love that man.</p><p>Jed\u2019s proximity didn\u2019t seem to be much of an issue, as I hadn\u2019t seen him since the \u201chandprint incident,\u201d as Jane had dubbed it. His windows remained dark and the driveway empty, other than my car. The house felt empty, too, as if I could sense the absence of his energy from the other side of the walls. I tamped down the sense of loss and longing I felt. It didn\u2019t make any sense to miss someone I barely knew, someone who had only been sent to track me. With the Kerrigans clearly close on my trail, I needed to focus on my efforts to find the athame and the bell\u2014not tracking down my erstwhile neighbor and shaking answers out of him.</p><p>The one person who seemed thrilled with this situation was Penny, who answered the news that I\u2019d recovered the intact Earth plaque with a whooping cry that woke up her husband, Seamus. She even took back her previous mockery. She was concerned to hear about Jed\u2019s part in it, however, and insisted on sending some reinforcements to the Hollow.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got all of the help I need here,\u201d I told her as I parked my car in front of the house. \u201cIndestructible vampire help that won\u2019t end up being used against me as some sort of bargaining chip.\u201d Over Penny\u2019s protests, I added, \u201cJust keep an eye on the Kerrigans still in country, let me know if they start traveling in large groups or stockpiling spell supplies. Speaking of which, how go the preparations for the binding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have everything we need except for the Elements,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone here is very proud of you, Nola. I know it\u2019s difficult, spending all of your time searching for something that you don\u2019t believe makes a difference, but it means a lot to us that you\u2019re trying so hard.\u201d</p><p>I made a noncommittal noise as I walked across the yard. Could I deny the validity of the Elements or the magic my relatives practiced, now that I was creating mini\u2013water spouts and setting sleeve fires with my mind? Something inside my head, the logical, resistant way I looked at the world, was shifting. And I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I was comfortable with that.</p><p>\u201cAnd look how far you\u2019ve come!\u201d Penny exclaimed. \u201cTwo down already. We know you\u2019ll be able to find the next two before the deadline. You just need to stay focused, keep your eye on the ball, stay on target, follow through the swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough of a pep talk, Pen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness. I was running out of cheerful sports metaphors.\u201d</p><p>I bid Penny good-bye as I approached the front porch. As was usual lately, my side of the house was lit, but Jed\u2019s half was dark. I was actually a bit nervous about walking across the darkened steps. But I made it to the front door unscathed and was in the process of unlocking the new new locks when a sleepy voice mumbled, \u201cNola?\u201d from the porch swing.</p> <p>I cried out at the familiar voice, turning toward the porch swing, hands raised. \u201cStephen? What the bloody hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Never sneak up on an irritated witch, sorceress, or conjurer.</p><p>\u2014A Witch\u2019s Compendium of Curses</p><p>At least I avoided punching anyone\u2019s breasts. I did, however, blow up the glass globe on the porch light. This time, it was not my fault. People really had to stop sneaking up on me.</p><p>Stephen was sitting on my porch swing with his raincoat folded over his suitcase and flowers clutched in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI just had to come see you, darling,\u201d he said, his voice sleepy and hoarse from the strain of his long flight. \u201cI know we left things in an awkward place. I wanted to apologize in person.\u201d He pressed the flowers into my hands, a pretty but generic arrangement of roses, the sort of thing you could buy in one of those airport vending machines by the arrival gates. \u201cAren\u2019t you happy to see me, at all?\u201d</p><p>I offered him a stilted smile, accepting the flowers. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p> <p>That was the feckin\u2019 understatement of the century. I felt guilty. I\u2019d expected to feel annoyed and embarrassed if I saw him again. But the interesting thing was that I wasn\u2019t embarrassed at the thought of Stephen meeting my friends and judging them. I didn\u2019t want them to meet him. He no longer fit into my life, which had expanded and changed and become so much more complex since the last time I\u2019d seen him.</p><p>It would have been so easy to relent, to apologize for having been harsh with him, to go back to him and reclaim some sense of normalcy. Clearly, things weren\u2019t going to work out with Jed, and I didn\u2019t have a talent for being alone. But I couldn\u2019t do that to Stephen. I was still angry at him, on some level, but he was a good man. I didn\u2019t want to make him a consolation prize. At one point, I\u2019d seen our future together, bright and clear, but I couldn\u2019t look at him that way anymore. We were just too different. I\u2019d spent so much of my time working to make him happy so he would stay with me and give me the kind of love I wanted so badly. I didn\u2019t think about whether that made me happy or not.</p><p>Now I sincerely doubted it would.</p><p>\u201cPenny told me all about you discovering your grandfather and your family here. I\u2019m sorry you felt like you had to lie to me about it. I suppose that I deserved it, though, after the things I said.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. Why didn\u2019t Penny tell me she\u2019d told Stephen where I was? It wasn\u2019t like her to share information with him at all. I stared him right in the eye as I said, \u201cYes, you did. But I am sorry for the things I said. If I had been thinking clearly, I would have hung up and called back the next morning.\u201d I opened the door and ushered him into the living room. \u201cTea?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPlease, and then I\u2019d like you to explain a few things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will; I just need something to do with my hands.\u201d</p><p>I put the kettle on to boil and pulled out the bags of oolong, which he preferred. As my hands moved, I tried to figure out exactly what I wanted to tell Stephen. My chronically unhelpful brain was coming up blank. So I went with the \u201clet it all just tumble out of your mouth\u201d method.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you about coming here to meet relatives because I didn\u2019t want you to have one more thing to hold against my family. I could almost hear you in my head. \u2018Here we go, another dramatic debacle, courtesy of the McGavocks.\u2019 You say those things so often I don\u2019t think you even realize you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even you make jokes at your family\u2019s expense,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m not serious when I do it,\u201d I said, trying to think of a way to explain the principle of \u201cit\u2019s OK when I pick on my family, but no one else should try\u201d to someone whose parents used an intercom to communicate dinner plans. \u201cYou know there are large portions of my life that I hold back from you\u2014hell, I hold them back from myself\u2014because I am afraid that you can\u2019t handle them. And it\u2019s not fair to either of us. I\u2019ve only given you a partial, watered-down version of myself, and you shouldn\u2019t want that. I want better than that for you, better than a half-relationship with a half-person. I just don\u2019t think what we have works anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I thought you were just angry on the phone. Are you really breaking it off with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stephen,\u201d I said, rethinking the wisdom of handing him a cup of boiling-hot tea.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you wondered why I haven\u2019t introduced you to my parents?\u201d he sputtered. \u201cI kept waiting for the weird shit I had to put up with to bottom out. I wanted to know how bad it could get. But it just kept getting worse! You want to know why I wanted to move with you to Dublin? Because I wanted to know whether you were someone I could consider proposing to. But you just kept putting me off! It doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIf you could just draw some boundaries with that band of loonies, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize you\u2019re actively making my point for me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling, I\u2019m just upset. I don\u2019t want to lose you. I will learn to watch my tongue, but you have to make some changes, too. We can make this work. Don\u2019t you see how easily we could fit into each other\u2019s lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not about fitting into each other\u2019s lives but making one life together. I shouldn\u2019t have to feel like I should hide things from you. I can\u2019t keep compartmentalizing and tucking away the bits of my life I\u2019m afraid will upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I came all this way to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to. And I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>And round and round we went, until I lost track of the time and our tea grew cold. We hashed through every angle of our relationship, my inability to separate from the family, his unwillingness to take my job seriously or meet my family halfway. Stephen got more and more upset as the conversation went along and I didn\u2019t budge on splitting.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to accept this,\u201d he spat. \u201cWe love each other. If we\u2019re not going to be together, it won\u2019t be caused by something so silly. Lots of people don\u2019t get along with their in-laws.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to his cold tea. \u201cWould you like me to warm that up for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep worrying about tea at a time like this?\u201d he asked, exasperated.</p><p>I cupped my hands around the mug, closed my eyes, and thought of what I\u2019d thought and felt right before burning Jed. I dredged up that hurt, the red-hot singe of anger, and pictured the energy flowing from my heart down to my hands. I imagined heat traveling from my skin, through the mug, and into the liquid, moving the water molecules around at such a pace that the water boiled. I could see the surface rippling, steam rising from the cup. I could feel the energy building, gathering, pushing through my flesh and bone to do my will.</p><p>I opened my eyes and saw Stephen, mouth agape, horror-struck, as he watched his tea bubble and boil. It popped and hissed merrily even after I moved my hands away, the steam curling up toward us like misty fingers. I jerked my hands away from the ceramic before it split or exploded.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I am; this is what I can do,\u201d I told him. \u201cTo pretend to be anything else would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI knew your family claimed that they had mystical whatnot, but I never imagined. Have you always been able to do that? All this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you still want me, Stephen? Do you? Because I\u2019ve been twisting myself into knots trying to keep this from you, but I can\u2019t anymore. The people I\u2019ve met here, they\u2019ve shown me that you can\u2019t shut yourself up and pretend to be something that you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve acted shamefully toward my own family because I was afraid of disappointing you or scaring you. You believe in facts and figures, and that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t disagree that algebra exists. But you\u2019re missing a whole big world out there. You\u2019re blind to it because you\u2019re afraid of what you might see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, softly, stepping back out of range. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I can barely deal with it. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back to the kitchen table, slumping against it. \u201cNo, no, I should have guessed, I suppose. Your family took this far too seriously to be faking it,\u201d he said, staring off into space.</p> <p>A long, heavy silence hung in the air between us.</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d he started. \u201cAs far as breakup stories go, this will be different from my friends\u2019 tales of sad-face text messages and requests that we \u2018still be friends.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still want to be friends?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen had questions, lots of them. I answered as many as I could without telling him about the Elements or the Kerrigans. I had the feeling that might make his head explode. By the time we finished talking, it was two A.M., and I felt guilty asking him to leave. He was calm and collected. He was Stephen, Lord of Rational Thought. So I made up the couch for him to sleep on.</p><p>The next morning, I heard him up before I rose. He left without saying good-bye. Not that I could blame him. This was an awkward way to end a relationship. I will say that he was classy until the end. He folded up the blankets and placed them at the foot of the couch. Nothing in the house was disturbed. We were over.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what I thought.</p><p>Without the distraction of Jed and with no leads at the shop, I threw myself into working at the clinic. I learned all of the patients\u2019 names, their family histories, how they fit into the puzzle that was the Hollow community. It was nice interacting with normal people in a normal way, no magic, no intrigue. Dr. Hackett was no friendlier than he\u2019d ever been, but he seemed to respect my skills.</p><p>Jed didn\u2019t return to the house for nearly a week. He didn\u2019t call. I didn\u2019t see his truck parked outside. One might think this would be a good thing, that his absence would help me forgive and forget. But the less I saw him, the angrier I got. And then, of course, he did come home (to find a less-than-legal eviction notice on his door), and he was careful to avoid me. But every morning, I would find on my doorstep beautiful spherical bunches of little blue flowers\u2014hydrangea\u2014with a note that said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I took an inhuman amount of glee in practicing my mental firestarter powers on the flowers and leaving the wreckage on his doorstep. Efforts to confront him directly were met with silence and darkened windows. The man was far sneakier than I gave him credit for.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my floral abuse resulted in overexerting myself, and I ended up draining myself completely for a few days. I was out of balance in so many ways, and it was definitely affecting the reliability of my powers. Some days, I nearly set the porch aflame with Jed\u2019s floral offering, and others, I could barely warm a mug of water.</p><p>I redirected my anger into cleaning rather than pyromania, so the shop and the clinic were spotless. Well, the lobby and the reception area were spotless. Dr. Hackett didn\u2019t need me to clean his office. Why he could keep that room perfectly organized but not the rest of building, I had no idea.</p><p>My energy continued to alternate between bottoming out and spiking at inopportune moments, like water sloshing over a dam. No lightbulb, ceramic cup, or window was safe around me. Jane informed me that destroying one shop window in a fit of witchy temper was written into my employment contract, but I would have to pay for the next one. This was odd, considering that I didn\u2019t remember signing an employment contract. In hopes of finding some way to rid myself of Penny\u2019s binding, I started reading more books from Jane\u2019s shop on magic and psychic senses, faith healing, and holistic medicine. I read about magical bindings and how to undo them, noting how important psychology was to the process. I found several location spells, but they involved darker magic than I was willing to attempt. Whoever first looked at baby teeth and thought, \u201cYou know what, these could have magical applications,\u201d was a sick, sick person.</p><p>I decided to try something counterintuitive. I stopped actively searching for the Elements. So far, Fire and Earth had fallen into my lap through bizarre coincidence, the latter accompanied by a sort of life lesson. (Never trust attractive, shirtless men in pickup trucks.) So instead of trying to force the issue, I was going to go with the flow.</p><p>For three days. And then I would go right back to my obsessive ways.</p><p>I had two weeks left. Two weeks, and I could go home. I missed my family with an ache so acute it sometimes stopped my breath. I would never take them for granted again. I would never again wish for Uncle Seamus to be struck dumb during football season. Or for Penny to stop trying to charm me into a happy love life. I wouldn\u2019t wish for silence or solitude, because I\u2019d had plenty of both since I\u2019d arrived in the Hollow. They weren\u2019t all they were cracked up to be. And I wouldn\u2019t wish to be normal, because that was something I would never be. I was a witch. And as soon as I accepted that, my life would get easier\u2014or whatever qualified as easier for a girl with magical powers and vampire relatives.</p><p>Of course, in keeping with the rules governing lost car keys and remote controls, the moment I stopped looking so desperately for the Elements, one of them fell right into my lap.</p><p>It had been a long day at the clinic, involving everything from stitches to psoriasis to a six-year-old who had managed to lodge a tiny Lego component in his ear. I locked the front doors to the lobby, shut down my computer, and shuffled my way back to Dr. Hackett\u2019s office on tired, aching feet. Still, there was a smile on my face. I was happiest when I was working with patients, and I\u2019d worked with a multitude that day.</p> <p>Tugging a pen from my loosely twisted hair, I knocked on the door and poked my head into his office. \u201cDr. Hackett, I have those supply forms ready for your signature. By the way, some of the things you were trying to order are no longer manufactured. We\u2019ve come a long way since leeches and quinine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass,\u201d he muttered as I handed over the files.</p><p>\u201cAnd the mail,\u201d I added, placing the scant stack of letters on the lovely green leather blotter. Dr. Hackett was definitely old-school in terms of desk accessories. On one side of the blotter, he had arranged an aged Montblanc pen and a large glass globe paperweight. On the other, he had an antique silver picture frame, holding a picture of four young men sitting around a card table.</p><p>He reached into his drawer and pulled out a letter opener.</p><p>A letter opener with a long silver blade, a black enamel handle, and a milky blue stone set in the hilt.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch!\u201d I cried, staring at the athame as it flashed in the light.</p><p>Dr. Hackett jumped at my oath, dropping the blade onto his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working down the hall from it all these weeks?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Dr. Hackett raised an eyebrow. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cDr. Hackett, where did you get that letter opener?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hackett glanced down at the athame, and his papery cheeks flushed. I glanced at the photo and realized that I recognized one of the figures in the photograph. \u201cDr. Hackett, did you know Gilbert Wainwright?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hackett grinned sheepishly. \u201cYes, we were classmates at Half-Moon Hollow High. We played cards every week with our buddies, Jimmy Mayhew and Bob Puckett.\u201d He nodded toward the framed photo. \u201cI found the letter opener at Gilbert\u2019s shop, mixed in with some antiques, right after he died,\u201d he said. \u201cMiss Jane was clearing out the storeroom at the time, and there were boxes all over the store. It seemed like something that someone should hold on to, that it was special to Gilbert, or should have been. So I offered Jane a good price for it. I don\u2019t think she wanted to sell it to me. She wasn\u2019t finished with her inventory, and she wasn\u2019t sure where the knife had come from. And I may have played the \u2018old friend\u2019 card a little bit. To be honest, I haven\u2019t felt right about taking it since the moment I walked out the door, but I thought returning it would seem silly. I hardly ever take it out of the desk.\u201d</p><p>She said she\u2019d never seen it before! I was going to kill Jane Jameson-Nightengale.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I took it back to the shop? It\u2019s part of a personal collection, and we\u2019ve been looking for it for some time. I can reimburse you whatever you paid for it,\u201d I said.</p><p>He pursed his lips into a frown. \u201cWhy would you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal reasons.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long time, studying my face. \u201cConsider it a thank-you gift,\u201d he said, pressing the hilt into my hand. \u201cYou have been a great help to me here in the clinic. And now I don\u2019t have to get you flowers when you leave.\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around him in a fierce hug.</p><p>\u201cYou must really like knives,\u201d he said, patting my back hesitantly. \u201cGo on, have a good night.\u201d</p><p>I raced to my desk, pulled an unbleached cloth out of my purse, and wrapped it around the blade. Three down. I\u2019d found three Elements. Maybe if I wandered through random car parks in the Hollow, I would eventually trip over the bell.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Hackett!\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Nola,\u201d he responded, sticking his head out of his office doorway. \u201cAnd Nola?\u201d</p><p>I paused on my dash to the front door.</p><p>Dr. Hackett grinned at me. \u201cYou have his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane! You\u2019ll never believe it!\u201d I called, racing into the shop. The door was unlocked, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone on the sales floor, which was unusual. It was only 10:20. Someone had turned off all of the lights, with the exception of the track lights over the coffee bar. \u201cHey? What\u2019s with the lights? If you close up shop, it\u2019s a good idea to lock the door, you know!\u201d</p><p>No response. I glanced down at the security-system panel over the light switch. It was scorched black, as if someone had zapped it with a cattle prod. In the darkened shop interior, the brass fixtures of the coffee machine dully reflected the street lamps. I reached for the light switch, and the hair on my arms rose. Before my fingers could make contact with the switchplate, I was nearly doubled over at the sudden throbbing pain in my head. It felt as if someone had kicked me across the temple with a steel-toed boot. Dizzy and sick, I swayed into the shop, bracing myself against the surface of a coffee table.</p><p>I heard a soft, wet moan from behind the coffee bar. I struggled to move my feet forward. There was someone here, someone in pain. I mentally shielded myself to keep from being incapacitated by the person\u2019s pain.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d I whispered, dropping the athame on the bar.</p><p>I turned the corner to find a slim male form with sandy hair.</p><p>\u201cZeb!\u201d I shouted, dropping to my knees next to his crumpled body. He lay on his side, curled inward. His face was battered and bloody. His knuckles were bruised and swollen, as if he\u2019d managed to fight back. I placed gentle hands on his shoulders, and suddenly, he was coughing and heaving, blood dribbling from his lips.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I pressed my hands gently against his ribs, trying to discern cracks or breaks. The blood appeared to be from a smashed lip and not any rupture to his lungs. \u201cTry not to move too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody hit me from behind,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cBut I got a few swings in. One. I got one swing in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone hit you over the head? How many times?\u201d I asked. I crouched over him, examining him thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p><p>I closed my eyes and concentrated on his body, bones, heart, lungs. He was bruised and battered, but nothing seemed torn. Still, I wanted him to be checked over. I could be missing something. I pulled out my cell phone and dialed 911, barking out the address and a brief description of Zeb\u2019s injuries.</p><p>I placed my hand over his head and tried to picture his brain, the tiny networks of nerves and veins, the bones of his skull. I pictured smooth, solid bone and healthy tissue, but I couldn\u2019t seem to settle long enough to send any energy his way. I could feel the heat gathering underneath my skin, but I couldn\u2019t direct it outward. I shook my hands, as if they were faulty cigarette lighters, and tried again. But the magical signature was even weaker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis would be so much easier if you were a vampire,\u201d I told him. \u201cI could feed you some blood, and everything would just fix itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane says that all the time,\u201d he mumbled as I tried to focus.</p><p>A bell tinkled toward the front of the shop. We both cowered against the sudden intrusion of light in the room. I sprang to my feet and grabbed the athame from the counter, brandishing it at whoever had just walked through the door.</p> <p>I squinted against the light, but I could see now that the shop had been ransacked. Books were scattered on the floor, their pages ripped. The glass of the display cabinets had been smashed, and anything of value had been taken.</p><p>\u201cZeb? Nola!\u201d Jane called as she came in, with Gabriel close at her heels, his face filled with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why does your brain sound like a car alarm, Nola? And when did we decide to electrocute the security system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d I yelled. \u201cBack here!\u201d</p><p>Jane found me crouched over Zeb, trying to stabilize his head and prevent further injuries. Whatever color remained in Jane\u2019s face drained away, and she seemed frozen to her spot on the floor, staring down at her friend\u2019s battered body.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she cried, dropping to her knees next to Zeb and pulling out her cell phone.</p> <p>\u201cHe said he was attacked,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, fix him!\u201d she commanded me.</p><p>\u201cI tried. It\u2019s not working,\u201d I told her, my voice cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I checked him over, and his injuries seem minor. But I want a doctor to look at him. The trick now is keeping him awake and still. Why was he here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s childe, Jamie, had a meeting with his parents, trying to mend fences,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>Jane\u2019s face went even paler as she surveyed Zeb\u2019s injuries. \u201cWe went for moral support. Then we were supposed to meet Zeb here to talk about some plans he had for his and Jolene\u2019s anniversary.\u201d She glared up at me. \u201cDid you see anything strange when you came in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I came in and found him like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about sounds, a weird smell, a car parked out front, anything?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cLook in my head if you want, Jane. The shop was dark and unlocked, and the security system was toast. But I didn\u2019t see anyone there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, calm down,\u201d Gabriel told her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Nola\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jane grunted. \u201cIt just feels too much like before, with Mr. Wainwright and Andrea and . . . Gabriel, please call Jolene. She\u2019s going to want to meet him at the hospital. Tell her Jamie will watch the kids if she wants to leave them at our place.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded and turned away to dial his phone. Jane was edgy and protective, hovering over Zeb, waiting for the ambulance to arrive. She asked him silly questions about his mother to keep him agitated enough to stay awake. I took the opportunity to look around the shop. The framed pictures were moved but intact. The register had been pried open, the cash taken out. Every single athame had been swiped from the display case. Most of the ritual candles had been knocked around.</p><p>Jane insisted on riding in the ambulance with Zeb, threatening dire consequences for the paramedics if they tried to stop her. As the ambulance pulled away from the shop, I marched to Jane\u2019s office and checked the safe. Her desk was overturned, the papers and bits of glass tossed about on the floor. The safe door had been gouged and scratched, but it was closed. I spun the lock to the combination and yanked it open. The little wooden case was still inside, with the plaque and the candle intact. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>I opened the drawer packed with white cloth and wrapped the knife, saying a quick and dirty version of the purification ritual. I didn\u2019t have the time or the energy to do anything else. I secured the safe door and walked back to the coffee bar, surveying the damage with hot, wet eyes. Gabriel had said we had to stay so I could give my statement to the police.</p><p>All I wanted to do was go home and hit something. The shop had been torn apart with a purpose. The athames, the candles, the safe\u2014all connected to the Elements. Had Jed done this? Was he so desperate to help the Kerrigans that he\u2019d hurt someone I knew and liked? He\u2019d been next door to me all of this time; why would he suddenly become aggressive?</p> <p>Should I tell the police about him? What would I say? I believe my neighbor may have broken into this shop to steal ancient magical artifacts, but he assaulted my friend instead? I would end up answering a lot of uncomfortable questions, and I didn\u2019t know if I could lie to the police. And what would I tell the others? If I told Jane or Dick about my suspicions, Jane would probably separate Jed\u2019s head from his shoulders before she asked him any questions. I didn\u2019t want to know what sort of creative revenge Dick would come up with, given even more ammunition against Jed.</p><p>I needed to handle this on my own. I didn\u2019t want anyone else to be in harm\u2019s way. Vampires or no, my friends were still vulnerable. I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone else get hurt on my behalf. I leaned my head against the coffee bar. Zeb could have been hurt, badly. He had a wife and two beautiful little kids. Was it worth this? Was the power my family used worth the risk? The hurt?</p><p>What was I preserving, really? This stupid feud? Maybe my family deserved to lose its magical heritage if this was the cost. Maybe I needed to locate the bell just so I could burn the whole deal.</p><p>The arrival of Half-Moon Hollow Police Sergeant Russell Lane interrupted this self-pitying train of thought. He flipped open his notepad, ready to take a lackadaisical stab at recording my version of events. Gabriel stood at my side, giving Sergeant Lane the evil eye every time he questioned my motivation or ability to relate the story honestly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see anything?\u201d Sergeant Lane asked. \u201cNothing? Not even someone walking out of the shop right before you walked in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you I didn\u2019t. Three times,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Sergeant Lane closed his notebook with a snap. \u201cLook, ma\u2019am, I make quite a few calls at this shop, and the case files rarely get closed. That reflects against my productivity. And that makes me cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m so sorry to inconvenience you,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you have information, you need to share it. Now, let\u2019s go over it one more time.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, prompting Gabriel to nudge my arm. Long pauses while Sergeant Lane scribbled down my answers left me plenty of time to think. I knew I was overreacting, thinking of destroying the Elements. I was shocked and hurt and felt guilty, and it was clouding my thinking. I\u2019d come too far to give up now. The problem was that I\u2019d resorted to lazy tactics to find the Elements. I would be much more proactive in finding the bell. Once I left town, no one here would be at risk.</p><p>Right. I shoved my sleeves to my elbows and crossed the room to the magic section. Jane had an interesting stock on darker magic, written from a purely academic perspective. Stuff that I\u2019d never seen before, because, frankly, no one in my family would dare try some of the rituals involved. There had to be some sort of magic LoJack spell here somewhere. I didn\u2019t care if I had to sacrifice a small goat or a car or something, I was going to find that bell. I was through with this bizarre journey through other people\u2019s problems and past deeds. I flipped through the pages of Most Potente Magick, looking for keywords such as \u201clocation\u201d and \u201clost object.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I dropped the book to the floor. And another, when it didn\u2019t give me the answers I wanted. And another. I tossed books over my shoulder, one after the other. Sergeant Lane was ignoring this erratic behavior while staring at a painting of a naked wood nymph.</p><p>Gabriel quietly stepped to my side. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I snapped, tossing another book aside. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t actually do anything. I can\u2019t keep people from dying. I can\u2019t keep them from being hurt. I can\u2019t keep them happy or safe. I\u2019m this walking time bomb of potential disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he ground out, grabbing my wrists. \u201cNola, just stop.\u201d</p><p>I whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so tired of this, Gabriel. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Gabriel assured me as Sergeant Lane wandered out of the shop without bidding us good-bye. \u201cThis sort of thing happens a lot around here. One of us is always being sprayed with silver or shot with arrows. You know, when I turned Jane into a vampire, it was because a local drunk mistook her for a deer and shot her. Jamie had to be turned when he was run over by a car right in front of the shop. Our little family is a magnet for trouble. The remarkably underwhelming attentions of Sergeant Lane are the result of his repeat visits here at the shop. And Jane\u2019s come a bit unglued because Zeb\u2019s never been hurt before. He\u2019s her oldest and dearest friend. She\u2019s not angry with you, understand that. If anything, as soon as Zeb is recovering, she\u2019s going to throw herself into the search for the final Element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, nodding as I grabbed my purse from behind the bar. \u201cI\u2019m heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me drive you,\u201d Gabriel offered.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou go on to the hospital, be with Jane and Zeb. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Dick!\u201d he shouted after me as I walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I called back, entering the darkness on full steam, almost wanting something to attack me just so I could strike back at it.</p><p>14</p><p>When all else fails in polite conversation with any supernatural creature, just smile and nod.</p><p>\u2014Miss Manners\u2019 Guide to Undead Etiquette</p><p>I came home to find that whoever had broken into the bookstore and attacked Zeb had made a night of it. My living room had been thoroughly trashed. My kitchen windows had been smashed with my own tea kettle. Upstairs, my bed was torn to hell, my soft sheets and quilts ripped to ribbons. My books were burned and torn.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I growled, walking out the back door. I threw open the storage shed, the light of the full moon shining over my shoulder and bathing the complement of gardening tools in silver. I grabbed the first shovel I saw. Jed\u2019s windows were dark, but I didn\u2019t care at the moment. I got a cricket grip on the shovel handle and smashed the glass in Jed\u2019s kitchen door. Gingerly, I put a hand through, but without cutting my arm to ribbons, I couldn\u2019t reach low enough to get at the lock. I took a step back and swung the shovel at the doorknob, hoping to disengage the lock by brute force.</p><p>The shovel blade struck the metal knob with a deafening clang. I grunted, swinging again, the blade only glancing off the doorknob. \u201cI really need to start going to the gym.\u201d</p><p>As I once more raised the shovel over my shoulder like a bat, I heard a shuffling noise behind me and turned to find a hulking, dark shape looming in the darkness. A huge monster towered over me, with the legs of a man, a gray leathery torso, and a long, curved, and tapering snout. In the light of the full moon, I could see small, bright eyes and wide paw-like hands with razor-sharp claws. I screamed and swung the shovel wide, whacking the creature in the face with the broad side of the blade.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Ow? Did the evil, drooling creature before me just yelp, \u201cOw?\u201d I didn\u2019t expect that.</p><p>Was this the strange shape I\u2019d seen lurking in my back garden all this time? A creature that seemed to be covered in gray leathery skin and . . . was that an armadillo\u2019s head? I\u2019d watched a nature special on armadillos once with Nana. She called them \u201cthe sport-utility animal,\u201d because nothing that ugly could go without purpose. The shovel\u2019s handle slipped through my hands, the blunt blade edging my palms. I turned and swung for the fences, bringing the wood down across the creature\u2019s thighs.</p><p>The thing dropped to its knees. \u201cOw!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I whacked it again like a big monster pi\u00f1ata.</p><p>\u201cStop hitting me!\u201d it yelled. \u201cThat hurts!\u201d</p><p>Wait, I knew that smooth, honeyed-whiskey voice. \u201cJed?\u201d I cried.</p> <p>The creature struggled to its knees, glaring at me with glassy black eyes. I raised the shovel again. It held up its paws. \u201cTruce! Truce!\u201d it yelled.</p><p>With the doorknob smashed, the Jed monster simply nudged the back door open and limped into the kitchen. Mouth hanging open, I choked up on the shovel handle and followed. The moment the creature lumbered across the threshold, out of the moonlight, the shape morphed back into human Jed. His face bore a purpling bruise where I\u2019d whacked him, along with a sheepish expression.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>It took several moments of shocked silence for me to process what had just happened before my very eyes. And I once saw my Aunt Lizzie set fire to her own eyebrows with a curling iron. After the sheer spectacle of Jed\u2019s shape-shifting passed, I found my voice. And my voice was pissed off.</p><p>\u201cYou arsehole!\u201d I shouted.</p> <p>\u201cDrop the shovel!\u201d he yelped as I advanced.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid, no-good arsehole!\u201d I yelled, smacking him repeatedly with my shovel-free hand. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? You lie to me. You lead me on. You trick me into giving you information. And now you\u2019re an armadillo monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Jed grunted as I struck out at him. He smacked the shovel out of my hand, knocking it to the floor with a clatter. He caught one wrist, but I managed to poke him in the eye with the other hand. He cornered me against the counter, pressing his hips against mine and catching both of my wrists. I wriggled an arm loose and popped him on the chin.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d He hissed, cradling his injured face. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Were you raised by freaking ninjas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have protective uncles,\u201d I growled. \u201cLots of them. But I\u2019m sure you knew that already, didn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you get that information in your Kerrigan spy orientation packet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d He groaned as I dug a knuckle into the sensitive hollow between his armpit and his ribs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d I demanded as he finally released my arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cursed,\u201d he said, and when I didn\u2019t respond, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll make some coffee.\u201d</p><p>Jed stepped away from me, and his eyes widened at the sight of blood on my shirt. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t been able to see it in the dark. He pulled my arms away from my sides, looking for damage. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. I suspected him of assaulting Zeb.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your hands,\u201d I demanded. Frowning, Jed showed me his unmarked palms. \u201cOver.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles were unmarred. There were no gouge marks or defensive wounds on his arms, although it was clear that Zeb had done damage to somebody. And Jed\u2019s ability to change form didn\u2019t seem to promote speedy healing, because the hand-shaped burn I\u2019d left on his arm was still there, and that shovel smack to the side of his face was bruising nicely. So Jed wasn\u2019t the one who beat Zeb.</p><p>That was something, at least.</p><p>\u201cSomeone came into Jane Jameson\u2019s shop earlier tonight and hurt Zeb Lavelle. I found him on the floor, all bloody and battered. They had to take him to the hospital. This is probably a rude way to approach this, but it\u2019s been a long night, and I\u2019m all out of patience. I was pretty sure you did it. And I was trying to figure out a way to report it to the police without them hauling me away to the loony bin. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his hand along the back of his neck. \u201cWell, that was mighty decent of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you. You have some explaining to do.\u201d I pulled a chair away from the kitchen table and sat watching while he made coffee.</p><p>\u201cI told you before. My family is Cajun, really, really Cajun. At least, we were before the move to Tennessee. Stilt shacks, deep-fried alligator, zydeco music . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cThere was a local voodoo woman. And my great-great-great-grandfather pissed her off somethin\u2019 awful, left her at the altar and ran off with some other woman. She declared that he\u2019d been a two-faced cheater the whole time they\u2019d been together. And that if he wanted to have two faces, she\u2019d give him a thousand. He wrote it off as the ravings of a crazy woman, until the full moon a month later. Family legend is that he turned into some sort of two-legged gator creature. Scared the hell out of his wife. And from that moment on, every time he stepped out into the light of the full moon, he turned into something. Nearly every adult in the bloodline has been cursed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d He sighed, putting a coffee cup in front of me and sliding into the opposite chair. \u201cThat would mean just one form. We can become anything. Scales, fins, fur, gills, bat wings. Every time it happens, it\u2019s something different. We can\u2019t control it. It just happens.</p><p>\u201cFor my family, this curse controls everything we do. It controls where we go, how we work, who we get close to. My dad had a big family, but I have relatives who refuse to get married because they don\u2019t want to pass this along to their children. Do you know what that\u2019s like, to see people you love choose to live alone for their whole lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t stand it. I couldn\u2019t stand having my father apologize to my brothers and sisters every time the moon rose because he was so wrapped up in guilt. I couldn\u2019t stand the look on my mother\u2019s face every time I changed into some new monster. So I started doin\u2019 some research. I joined some Internet forums where people discussed myths and legends as if they were real. And I learned a lot about the different were-creature mythologies and curses. But no one could explain how it happened or what could be done to stop it. Until I stumbled into this chat room for witches, that is. I started askin\u2019 some questions, makin\u2019 contacts, and then next I know, some guy named Kerrigan is private-messagin\u2019 me, tellin\u2019 me he can solve my problem for me, lift the curse from my whole family. All I had to do was find some stuff for him, track down some valuables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he ask you in particular?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy user name is redneckcreature95. He said he needed some things from a Southern town, and after talking to me on the phone a few times, he guessed I could fit into the area better than he could. All he gave me was an address for this house. It seemed too good to be true when I showed up and it was for rent. And then, a few weeks later, he sent me a description of the objects and those pictures of you. He told me to keep an eye out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you moved here with nothing but a couple of clues and pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was desperate for help,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a few weeks, I started thinkin\u2019 I\u2019d been bunked. I wasn\u2019t makin\u2019 any headway with Jane, who doesn\u2019t seem to like me much. I couldn\u2019t break into the shop to look around. Have you seen the security system on that place? What kind of bookstore has laser sensors on the doors, windows, and ceilin\u2019? And then there you were, running out of the house in nothing but a towel.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, and it seemed so sincere it made my chest ache. I had to bite back the urge to smack him. I would not be manipulated by pearly whites and puppy eyes.</p><p>\u201cI tried telling myself that spending time with you, distracting you, was only helping myself, giving myself time to beat you to the Elements. And then you were just so damn sweet. Well, not sweet, exactly, but funny as hell, with generally good intentions. I wasn\u2019t lyin\u2019, that night at the motel, when I said I liked you more than I expected to and that it made things difficult for me. I sent Kerrigan a bunch of e-mails, callin\u2019 him an asshole and tellin\u2019 him to get some other monkey to dance for him. That didn\u2019t go over well, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Zeb\u2019s attack at the store made more sense. The Kerrigans had received Jed\u2019s kiss-off e-mails, if he indeed sent them, and they had come looking for the Elements at the shop. Zeb had the bad fortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>\u201cBut how could you just keep lying to me?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou knew me. I thought you were\u2014well, I don\u2019t know what I thought you were, but at least a friend. And you just kept lying. Our whole friendship is a palace of lies! And keeping the plaque? How am I supposed to trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat mornin\u2019 in Helton, I sat on the bed, and you were lyin\u2019 there all sleepy and beautiful. And I just panicked. I wanted to be the kind of man who could go out with a girl like you any night he wanted, with no strings, no concerns. And I was willin\u2019 to do anything to make that happen. I\u2019m not proud of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they tell you what would happen when you gave them the Elements?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cKerrigan told me that they were just a collection of old magical artifacts, that the value was sentimental, but that your family was looking for them, too, because you have a shared ancestor. He promised me that he could remove the curse if I helped him find the items before your family did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow? How could I possibly bring this up in conversation? \u2018Hello, darlin\u2019, how was your day? By the way, every once in a while, I turn into some monster from Scooby-Doo. Oh, and that mission that your family sent you on? I am doin\u2019 everything I can to undermine it and find the Elements first.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I conceded, \u201cThat would be a date ender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that you didn\u2019t exactly give me the whole story. You didn\u2019t tell me you were Wainwright\u2019s granddaughter, or a witch, or anythin\u2019. You gave me that bullshit story about coming from Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, that\u2019s true. And really, you\u2019re going to criticize the white lies I told to protect me from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when you put it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I took it from you, I wanted to give that stupid plaque back to you so badly, but then I would think of my parents and all of my younger cousins who are just now going through the changes. I\u2019m sorry, I had to put them first. What would you do, to help your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I groused. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t said that, I probably would have been able to stay pissed at you\u2014which I still am, by the way, and will be for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>I lifted his wrist, inspecting the burn mark on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cIt still hurts as bad as it did the day you gave it to me,\u201d he said, wincing. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really did,\u201d I told him.</p><p>I was tempted to leave his arm in that state. I hadn\u2019t been able to heal Zeb earlier in the evening, after all, and it felt as if Zeb deserved my help more than Jed did. But hearing Jed\u2019s explanation seemed to shift the energy within me. I felt I was back in balance and might be able to make my energy follow my intentions in ways that would help him.</p><p>I curved my hand around the burn mark and closed my eyes. However irritated I might be with Jed, that mark was my fault. I needed to fix it. Nana had told me to think of the healing magic as if my cells were reaching out to the other person\u2019s and fixing all imperfections. I put my hand over the burned skin and pictured it bright and pink and new as a baby\u2019s. I saw cool, soothing waves of energy flowing over the burned tissue and taking away the sting. And when I opened my eyes, I was relieved and grateful to see that his skin indeed was pink and healthy.</p><p>I would visit Zeb\u2019s hospital room as soon as I could.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, twisting his hands and admiring his newly repaired flesh.</p><p>\u201cThat thing I can do, healing you with my hands? If the Kerrigans get the Elements, that goes away. My whole family\u2019s magic goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d I said, toying with my coffee cup. \u201cSo you\u2019re a giant armadillo monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda wish you would stop putting it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to stop me from saying it,\u201d I shot back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why your status as a supernatural creature should change my plans to keep you as far away from the Elements as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I can help you find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>He dragged an old-fashioned trunk into the kitchen and opened it. It was filled with small leather-bound notebooks, covered in dust. I gaped at the sheer number of volumes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re travel journals,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Wainwright seemed to travel a lot. I found this trunk while we were fixing some pipes in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in addition to lying to me, you stole family heirlooms. You are just a charmer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cOK, yeah, but I would have returned them to you eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a comfort,\u201d I muttered. \u201cJane said Mr. Wainwright spent a lot of time looking for were-creatures and vampires, after he came back from World War II. She said he actually knows Sasquatch, who is Canadian, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>I opened the first one I touched. The paper was dry and brittle, and tiny grains of sand actually shook out of the pages as I moved them. Here and there, pictures of a young Gilbert Wainwright in a pith helmet were tacked onto the pages. And the entries were carefully, meticulously written in\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre these hieroglyphics?\u201d I asked, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYour grandpa seemed to take learnin\u2019 the local languages pretty damn seriously when he traveled.\u201d He handed me journals, pointing out the language used in each. \u201cSanskrit, Chinese, Greek, and what I think is Old Norse. Other than looking at the photos and making a guess, I can\u2019t tell where he was or what he wrote. He switches languages a few times in each journal. I\u2019ve been through a dozen of them with different language guides, and I can\u2019t make heads or tails of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you showing me these for a particular reason or just to give me fresh reasons not to trust you? Why didn\u2019t you just turn these over to the Kerrigans?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf I just gave them the information, I couldn\u2019t trust them to keep their word. I figured if I found the items first, I had a better shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally nice people you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018desperate cursed man\u2019 are you not getting? But I think you\u2019re more likely to meet the terms of our agreement. And I want to help you, to show you how sorry I am about how things have worked out. I\u2019m sorry, Nola,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I betrayed your trust. And I\u2019m so sorry that I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want from me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, really. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. I don\u2019t know if you can help me. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s right to ask, considering what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really hurt me,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t trust people very easily. And I thought you liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I do!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so sweet or so funny. I thought you\u2019d be a crazy, wild-haired old chick with a million cats and a black muumuu. And you show up, and you\u2019re no-nonsense and terrified of small mammals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsupials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ever trust you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no reason to lie now. You know everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have something to make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He opened the fridge and took out a large green mixing bowl, displaying it with a flourish. \u201cBanana puddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think a little pudding is going to make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve had real homemade banana puddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch-lady harem again?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his full lips and gave me the puppy-dog eyes again. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you about that.\u201d</p><p>I gave him an exasperated look. \u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made all of the food,\u201d he said, cringing.</p><p>\u201cPalace of lies!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhy\u2014why would you lie about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what you liked in a man, and I didn\u2019t want to come across all domestic and feminine. I happen to be a very good cook. My mama insisted that all of the boys learn to take care of the house, so when we found nice girls to marry, we would stay married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw you bring home groceries or smelled cooking from your side of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a pretty regimented schedule,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cIt was easy to work around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your name really Jed, or is that a lie, too? Are you really Gary Horowitz from Hoboken, New Jersey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said so, several times. I feel I\u2019ve been very honest about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>Vampires are slow to trust and quick to attack. Do your best not to piss them off. And if you\u2019ve already done so, run.</p><p>\u2014A Smart Girl\u2019s Guide to Living with the Undead</p><p>It turned out it took a lot for me to trust him again. But it took even more for my friends to be willing to give him license to breathe in their presence.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelped as Jane attached her hands to either side of his head, yanking out a bit of hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, if your brain wasn\u2019t so patchy, I wouldn\u2019t have to get so close,\u201d Jane admonished. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky we\u2019re not calling Sophie the lie detector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, wincing as she dug her fingers against his scalp.</p><p>Even with his\u2014frankly, delicious, but I would never tell him so now\u2014banana pudding, I held Jed at arm\u2019s length until we could hold what Zeb called a \u201cfamily meeting\u201d at Specialty Books as soon as he was released from the hospital. Zeb was bruised and battered, his arm in a sling. I offered to take care of it for him, but he declined. He said it was good for him, to feel human, to remind him to pay better attention when he was in the shop alone. Jolene, who was now left to care for their twins while Zeb was on the injured list, objected to this strongly. But when Jane offered to take care of the hospital bills since the injury had occurred on her property, she seemed mollified.</p><p>It was strange spending time with Jed again with this new perspective. I\u2019d missed him. It seemed strange to admit that. I missed the version of Jed I thought I knew. I didn\u2019t know if that Jed really existed. He did his best to make it up to me. He helped me restore order to my ransacked living room and replaced my windows. The problem was that if it wasn\u2019t Jed, who had broken into the shop? Who had gone through my things at the house? Had the Kerrigans sent another operative into our area?</p><p>Gabriel and Dick asked those questions and many more after I insisted that Jed confess his part in the Kerrigans\u2019 plot. The vampires made it clear that they did not like or trust Jed. Zeb was confused about exactly who Jed was. But once he realized that he was once considered a suspect in his ass-whupping, he chilled considerably. Jolene was careful to stand between them at all times and appeared to be baring her teeth. Jane picked Jed\u2019s brain over with a mental fine-tooth comb. She couldn\u2019t detect any dishonesty, but she added that didn\u2019t mean anything if Jed was good at covering up.</p><p>Dick also \u201coffered\u201d to let Jed stay in one of the other properties in town. Well, actually, Dick waited until Jane had Jed by the hair and leaned in close, growling like a jungle cat. \u201cJust so you understand, that little girl over there is very important to me. If you hurt her again\u2014I mean, if she\u2019s the least bit unhappy, if she returns from any outing with you with so much as a hangnail\u2014I will fix it so if people ever find your body, they won\u2019t be able to tell if you\u2019re human or a raccoon that got caught in a mulcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick!\u201d I shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not a little girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, compared to Dick,\u201d Andrea began.</p><p>I pointed a finger in her face. \u201cQuiet, you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t get to do this when you were younger, so I\u2019m making up for it now,\u201d Dick said.</p><p>\u201cI had lots of uncles who did this when I was younger, and I hated it then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is being a little overprotective, but that\u2019s sort of a thing with him and Gabriel,\u201d Jane told me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jane turned to Jed and gave him a grim smile. \u201cYou do realize, of course, that none of us trusts you, and we reserve the right to whack you over the head with various blunt objects if the mood strikes us?\u201d</p><p>Jed nodded after a moment\u2019s consideration. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that better?\u201d I demanded. Jane shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBefore the head bashing begins, could I make a peace offering?\u201d Jed asked before disappearing out the front door. He returned, hefting the heavy trunk full of journals under one arm. Suddenly, his ability to haul around paving stones made more sense. Did shapeshifters have above-average strength? Seeing Mr. Wainwright\u2019s name stamped on the trunk, Jane was immediately intrigued. She knelt before the collection of old books and stroked the covers reverently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still on probation,\u201d she reminded Jed, who smirked at her.</p><p>She opened one and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . in gibberish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d Andrea admonished her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised at you. This isn\u2019t gibberish. OK, who here speaks Mandarin?\u201d Gabriel grinned broadly and raised his hand. Andrea handed him a journal. \u201cAnd . . . Latin?\u201d Dick raised his hand and accepted another. \u201cI happen to read some Old Norse, thanks to a horrible ex-boyfriend whom we will not mention because it makes Dick pull his angry face. Which leaves us with old Gaelic, Sanskrit, and hieroglyphics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take the Gaelic portions, or at least muddle through them,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if you have some books on Sanskrit and hieroglyphics or, even better, Mr. Wainwright\u2019s guides to those languages, we can get to work on them. Maybe we can find something in the journals that will give us some clue about the bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Zeb sighed, shifting his arm uncomfortably while he and Jolene settled into the comfy purple chairs with their assignments. \u201cHomework.\u201d</p><p>It was a relief to have something to do, something we could all focus on for the week before the deadline. Although I found nothing to do with Mr. Wainwright\u2019s trip to Ireland, the journals were pleasant and interesting reading. I did learn that I should consider the possibility that every animal I saw was actually a middle-aged man named Wally. Nana had told me that Mr. Wainwright was looking for were-deer, but it was still a bit shocking to find out that there were people out there who turned into skunks and weasels. Think of the dry-cleaning involved.</p><p>Using the journal dates, we constructed a timeline of where he had traveled when. To give our eyes a rest from Mr. Wainwright\u2019s small script, we took turns contacting his favorite buyers, asking about bells, just in case. We visited every pawn shop in the surrounding two counties, but bells didn\u2019t seem to be frequently pawned items. I continued working at the clinic, but each afternoon, I left earlier than my previously established routine, something that Dr. Hackett frowned on. He knew, though, that I\u2019d be leaving soon and he would have to adjust to running the clinic without me.</p><p>I sent scans of the Gaelic portions to Penny, a swipe to my pride, considering how often she\u2019d told me to study the language more faithfully, as I would need it someday. Her translations were interesting but ultimately unhelpful. Eventually, we were able to determine which journals were the volumes written just before and about two years after the Ireland trip, but we couldn\u2019t seem to find the Ireland volume. The only bright spot, Gabriel observed, was that Mr. Wainwright never referred to selling or giving away the Elements in subsequent journals. We were sitting around the shop again, going over the journals, when Dick suddenly dropped to his knees in front of the trunk and knocked on the interior of the lid. Jane watched him warily, but as he tested the lid, she seemed to pick up on his line of thinking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cMr. Wainwright, you crazy, adorable old bastard.\u201d</p><p>Andrea raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd the award for abrupt and inappropriate statements goes to . . .\u201d</p><p>Grinning at me, Dick peeled away the fabric inside the lid. A sort of shell popped out of the lid, and two books fell out into his hands.</p> <p>\u201cA false top?\u201d I laughed as he handed me the two journals. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that one before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019ve never met my cousin Junie.\u201d Jane snorted.</p><p>\u201cGilbert was a good boy, but he wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Dick said proudly.</p><p>The first thing I saw when I opened one volume was a sketch of each of the Elements. The writing surrounding the sketches was a mix of Gaelic and Old English. I could pick up words my family used regularly: \u201cmagic,\u201d \u201cfire,\u201d \u201ctradition,\u201d and \u201cmother.\u201d But everything else was nonsense. \u201cI\u2019ll send this to Penny, too, which means I will have to put up with more of her \u2018I told you sos.\u2019 Fortunately, we won\u2019t be on video chat, so I\u2019ll miss out on the accompanying dance.\u201d</p><p>Tucked inside the journal, I found pictures of Nana and Mr. Wainwright. It was nice to see them from his perspective. In his pictures, he was smiling down at Nana, pulling her close to his side. She was grinning widely at him, a look of complete adoration on her face.</p> <p>Andrea picked up one of the pictures. \u201cHey, the inscription on this one is in English!\u201d</p><p>I plucked it from her hands and read aloud. \u201c \u2018Fiona is a beautiful, intelligent woman who shares my open view of the world. I could easily see myself spending every day happily with her. But I don\u2019t think she will ever be ready to leave Kilcairy. And I would never be ready to stay. She is needed here, and I would not make her choose between myself and the people she cares for. But I cherish our time together and hope that our paths may cross again.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that would make you feel better,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut you look like you\u2019re ready to burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d I said. \u201cNana loved him. And if he\u2019d asked, she might have followed him home to America. My mother would have grown up with a father. She would have had an entirely different life. It sounds like they were held back by bad communication skills and fear. Mostly fear.\u201d</p><p>Jane ran her hand over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nola.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel carefully thumbed through the other journal. He grinned broadly at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to contact Penny. This is the last journal, Mr. Wainwright\u2019s daily journal from seven years ago, which he tucked into the lid along with the Ireland volume \u2018to protect Fiona.\u2019 \u201d This section is in Latin, which I speak just as well as Dick, thank you very much. And he says he entrusted the bell to a friend. He says he couldn\u2019t bear looking at the bell because it reminded him too much of what he left behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gabriel grimaced. \u201cHe apparently meant someone named Bridget, whose father was a silversmith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s less sweet,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather was a bit of a man-whore,\u201d Andrea informed me.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, I blame genetics,\u201d I said, eyeing Dick.</p><p>\u201cThose are your genes, too,\u201d Dick reminded me sternly.</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cWould you two like to know who he gave the bell to, or will this uncomfortable family moment continue for the rest of us to enjoy?\u201d</p><p>My palms were sweating as Jed and I waited outside the outdated offices of James H. Mayhew, Esquire. It was late in the afternoon. The reception area had certainly seen better days, with its worn leather chairs and battered tile floors. The secretary\u2019s desk had long been abandoned, so we were left to wait while Mr. Mayhew finished up a phone call. Jed was amusing himself by sorting through six-year-old copies of Ladies\u2019 Home Journal and Newsweek.</p> <p>This was what a last resort felt like. I had no idea what our next move would be if this didn\u2019t pan out. And the depressing thing was, I was sure it wouldn\u2019t. Jed tried keeping a more optimistic perspective . . . until I threatened to smack him with a rolled-up magazine.</p><p>Jimmy Mayhew was exactly what I expected in a small-town lawyer. Elderly, with a full shock of pure white hair and out-of-control matching eyebrows. His suit was a dapper if unfashionable blue silk, with a tie that set off his clear cornflower-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the appointment Miss Jane referred to me?\u201d he said, flashing some very respectable dentures at me.</p><p>Having long since tired of subterfuge, I introduced myself as Mr. Wainwright\u2019s granddaughter. Mr. Mayhew\u2019s white eyebrows shot up to his hairline. He sat back heavily in his club chair while I gave him a brief summary of the events that had brought me to his door. A parade of conflicting emotions crossed his handsome face as I told my story, ending with shocked resignation as I concluded with, \u201cSo, we were hoping, Mr. Mayhew, that you might still have that bell he gave you all those years ago and, if so, that you would be willing to part with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really had a daughter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou can ask Dick Cheney,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll vouch for my story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Jane\u2019s shifty friend know anything about it?\u201d</p><p>I offered him an easy smile. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do favor him. And if Miss Jane believes you, that\u2019s enough for me . . . Gilbert having descendants would have drastically changed his will, you know,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cAre you here to challenge it? Because he was very fond of Miss Jane, and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI think the shop is in very good hands. I was just curious about the bell.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Mayhew blew out a long breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t got it.\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped somewhere near the location of my feet. Jed gave my hand a squeeze, but at the moment, I couldn\u2019t find it in me to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cGilbert did give me a bell, about twenty years ago,\u201d Mr. Mayhew said. \u201cHe asked me to put it in my safe, something about not feeling right about keeping them all together. And then, five years ago, right before Miss Jane started working there, he took it back. Said it was time and that he was going to hide it in plain sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you where that might be?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>Mr. Mayhew shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about your friend Bob Puckett? He was one of your card circle. Would Mr. Wainwright have given it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Puckett died ten years ago,\u201d Mr. Mayhew said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss, but if Gilbert said he was going to hide it in plain sight, then you should look in the most obvious place first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kind of covered those,\u201d Jed told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more help,\u201d Mr. Mayhew said, shaking his head.</p><p>I stood, my knees shaking, and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cAfter all this time,\u201d Mr. Mayhew said. \u201cGilbert has a grandkid. He would have gotten such a kick out of you, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have something for you,\u201d he said, crossing to his bookshelf. \u201cWe started playing poker together about fifty years ago. And one night a few years back, your grandpa ran out of cash. He had a lot of confidence in his hand, so he threw this into the pot.\u201d He took an old linen-bound edition from the shelf and handed it to me. \u201cIt was one of his prized possessions.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers over the cover, stamped in gold: A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm. Mr. Mayhew grinned sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s a first edition. He read that book I don\u2019t know how many times when we were kids. An uncle gave it to him when he was home sick once with a cold, and it sparked his interest in the paranormal. From that moment on, all he could talk about was traveling the world to look for werewolves and vampires. I didn\u2019t really want to take it. He had four of a kind, but I had a straight flush. He never could spot a tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily failing, apparently,\u201d I muttered, turning the book carefully in my hands.</p><p>\u201cI held on to it,\u201d he said, guilt tingeing his voice. \u201cTo teach him a lesson about bringing enough cash to the games. I always meant to give it back . . . I\u2019m sorry. I think he would want you to have it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him. \u201cThank you, Mr. Mayhew.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head back against the car\u2019s seat, clutching Mr. Wainwright\u2019s book to my chest.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey.\u201d Jed slid across the seat and tried to put his arm around me. Instinctively, I pressed my hand against his chest to push him away, but my arm went limp. I let him wrap an arm around my shoulders and pull me close. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. We knew it was a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do now,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to look. And I looked closer at those locator spells. You\u2019re right. That is definitely some Dark Lord, point-of-no-return sort of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried one of them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I held up my thumb and forefinger, measuring a tiny amount of evil. \u201cJust a little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since we just harassed a perfectly nice old lawyer, I\u2019m assuming it didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and buried my face in his shoulder. He stroked my hair away from my face to press a kiss against my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. Let\u2019s get you home, honey.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and stayed quiet for most of the ride home. What the hell would I do now? I had used up all of my luck, all of my happy coincidences and convenient clover patches.</p><p>What had I missed? Although I\u2019d already done it a dozen times, I reviewed each find in my head and the steps that led up to it. Could anything be repeated? Mined for more information?</p><p>And I was back to blind luck again.</p><p>I must have dozed off, because I woke to Jed carrying me up the porch steps and using my keys to unlock my door. I should probably have objected to this. He was still the guy who had lied to me for months and stolen priceless artifacts from me. But he also smelled like the forest and fresh laundry, and every time his chin brushed my forehead, a little thrill zipped up my spine.</p><p>I let him stretch me across my bed, opening my eyes long enough to catch his hand and drag him down next to me. Jed scooted in behind me, pulling my back against his chest, and laid his face against my hair.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep all that sad to yourself, it\u2019s going to leave a bruise,\u201d he murmured against my neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as emotional contusions,\u201d I whispered back, wrapping his arm around my waist as I rolled onto my back, facing him.</p><p>\u201cI meant here,\u201d he said, drawing a finger over my heart.</p><p>I stared intently at the ceiling, willing away the anxious despair that seemed to have a choke hold on my throat. \u201cWhat was Nana Fee thinking, leaving this task to me? I never showed any interest in being the family\u2019s leader. No one ever asked me if I was ready or even wanted the job. It was just shoved in my lap because I happened to be a good nurse. And I am drowning here. Why didn\u2019t Nana send Penny or Uncle Jack or someone who actually embraces their abilities and might have gotten through this with some dignity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she knew you needed it more,\u201d he suggested gently, playing with a lock of my hair. \u201cYou needed to come here so you could get to know your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she was that concerned, she could have sent me here before Mr. Wainwright died. She could have told me about him, let him know me,\u201d I shot back, my tone more than a little bitter. \u201cShe could have let my mother know him. Then maybe she wouldn\u2019t have turned out to be such a . . .\u201d</p><p>Jed propped himself on his elbows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna McGavock wasn\u2019t a good mother. She wasn\u2019t even a good person.\u201d I smiled to cover the odd little sob that escaped through my nose. \u201cEverything she touched was tainted by her bottomless need for whatever she thought she deserved but wasn\u2019t getting. Nothing was ever enough. Maybe if she\u2019d known her father, she wouldn\u2019t have felt like she had some missing piece she had to make up for. Or maybe she was always meant to turn out to be a cancer on the backside of humanity. Who knows?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Kerrigans told me she died a while ago,\u201d he said quietly, and the mention of his former employers didn\u2019t exactly calm the little storm of nerves brewing between my temples.</p><p>I took several deep breaths, nodding and concentrating on slowing my heart rate. The last thing I needed was some magical spike that took out the bedroom windows. \u201cI got a call from the Florida State Police about three years ago. They said that her remains had been found in some burnt-out fleabag motel in Sarasota. It\u2019s a wonder they were able to contact me. We hadn\u2019t spoken in more than ten years.\u201d</p><p>Jed tilted his forehead against mine, tucking my body against the curve of his hip. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I admitted, in a voice so soft it was a wonder that he heard me. \u201cIt was a relief.\u201d And now the tears were slipping down my cheeks in earnest, gathering in the hollow of my throat. \u201cIt was a relief to know that she wasn\u2019t coming back, that she couldn\u2019t hurt us anymore. She had a particular talent for hurting Nana, who always seemed to think she could just love Mom out of being bat-shit crazy. Every time she hurt us, it only proved that I was right not to trust her. For Nana\u2019s sake, I pretended I was just as shocked as she was when Mom was arrested in Jacksonville for soliciting or that time she took Nana\u2019s money for rehab, only to spend it on a three-day bender in Atlantic City. But I\u2019d come to expect it. I feel guilty for not loving my own mother, but I feel even worse for letting Nana believe that I did.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cI feel like so much of my relationship with Nana was a lie now. I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I\u2019ve known all my life that my grandmother didn\u2019t want to discuss my grandfather. And I thought I understood it. I\u2019d been angry at my grandfather for years, imagining him as some sort of cad who fathered my mother and ran. But I realize now the part Nana played in all this, and I didn\u2019t realize how angry I was at Nana Fee until I came here and saw what I had missed, not knowing him. She sent me on this wild-goose chase to the middle of nowhere, after giving supposedly sacred objects to a man who was some sort of book hoarder. What if Jane wanted nothing to do with me? What if his shop had burned down? What was she thinking?\u201d That last bit was muffled by a hiccuping sob, which was mortifying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to bein\u2019 angry with her, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, wiping at my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m also not used to crying in front of some man while lying in bed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just some man.\u201d His tone was indignant. I chuckled, but he cupped my face in his hand and forced me to look at him. \u201cLook, you know my secrets. You know things I\u2019ve never told a soul outside of my family. And I gather you\u2019ve never told anyone about your mother or your grandmother. That means something, Nola. I don\u2019t take it lightly.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and tucked my face into the crook of his neck. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I settled my weight against Jed\u2019s side and breathed in his spicy woods scent. I closed my eyes and let that scent soak into my skin. I knew Jed didn\u2019t take this sort of admission lightly. This was an intimacy he was sharing with me, an emotional bond one didn\u2019t forge with a convenient fling. The question was, how was I supposed to take it? How was I going to walk away from someone who knew so much about me? Did I really want to?</p><p>Hours later, the room was dark, and the windows were open. I turned over toward Jed. Bright beams of moonlight poured through the window, highlighting the smooth planes of his face. Jed\u2019s completely normal, human face. I sat up, my fingers pressing against his cheeks.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, sitting up. The moment his eyes opened and he caught sight of the windows, his face shifted. His skin was blue and smooth. Inky black markings highlighted the sharp cheekbones and arched brows over a leonine nose. He had fangs, long, shiny, and white. His eyes were wide and round and an electric, unearthly green.</p><p>I reached out to touch the strange blue flesh but felt only Jed\u2019s warm, smooth skin. I traced my fingertips along his long nose, over the ridges of his cheekbones. He purred, the vibrations of the rumbling sound traveling down my arms to my heart. It was an illusion. He was still Jed underneath. I could feel his eyebrows under my fingertips. I leaned forward and kissed the blue, feline nose.</p><p>Jed flinched, drawing back from me as if I\u2019d slapped him. The only thing I felt against my lips was Jed\u2019s plain old human nose. I chuckled, making the blackened eyebrows crease. I leaned forward, taking one of the soft lips between my own. He jerked away. I sighed, pushing up to my elbows so I could thread my hands in the inky black hair and pull him down to me. I claimed his mouth. This was my mouth. No matter what form it came in, it was mine.</p> <p>Outside the windows, a cloud passed over the crescent moon, and the room was dark again. Under my fingertips, Jed\u2019s skin became his regular golden peach. His features shifted back to human. I laughed aloud, kissing him again. He dove for me, attacking my mouth with a zeal that made me glad he didn\u2019t have real fangs. He threw my leg over his hip and thrust forward, grinding his hard length against flesh that was already warm and wet for him. I cried out, the first tense pulse of pleasure seizing through me as he tugged my jeans away. He growled, nipping and biting down the length of my throat as he tore the material at my hips and threw it over his shoulder.</p><p>My nails bit into his shoulders, welting the skin, and I was rewarded with a pleased rumble. He knelt over me, and I moaned at the broken contact. He trailed his hand between us, sliding it over my breastbone, down the line of my stomach, and between my legs. I shrieked when his thumb stroked over that little hard nub. He chuckled, so I reached up and tweaked his nipple in retaliation. He yelped and grinned down at me, redoubling his efforts.</p><p>When he finally plunged between my thighs, I was already coming. I pulsed and rolled underneath him, my breath too short to scream his name properly. All I could manage was a series of exhausted whimpers. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back, trusting him with my body as I had before, and let myself float away.</p><p>We stretched across the couch, Jed\u2019s legs sprawled across mine. My hand trailed down a back that was still a pleasant human tone. Jed was breathing, deep and even at my side, while we both enjoyed a long, comfortable moment of silence. Of course, I couldn\u2019t leave things alone.</p><p>\u201cAm I crazy, or did you just shift into one of those things from Avatar earlier?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA Na\u2019vi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were blue, and you had this weird tail and a cat lip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw that movie?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was flipping past HBO earlier this morning and stopped on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTree of souls scene?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBloody pervert. So you see a sex scene between two otherworldly creatures, and then we\u2019re all snuggled up together, and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I turned into a Na\u2019vi because I watched Avatar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. And the first thing we\u2019re going to do is remove Aliens, Predator, and all zombie movies from your DVD collection, because I am not prepared to deal with that. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cursed, Jed. I think you\u2019re some sort of were-creature. Only you\u2019re not limited to one form. You can have any form you choose. But because you never learned to control it, the form is determined by whatever is happening in your subconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do you explain the moonlight factor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t think it applies. For one thing, that wasn\u2019t the full moon. And second, the moon was shining on you earlier while you were asleep, and you didn\u2019t shift until you woke up and saw that the curtains were open. I think it\u2019s psychosomatic. If the witch all those years ago was some sort of sensitive, she might have been able to tell when your ancestor was getting ready to shift for the first time. She may have been able to use that, saying she was cursing him with \u2018a thousand faces.\u2019 When he shifted into some animal form for the first time, he was convinced it was a result of the witch\u2019s curse. I would imagine he did it under the light of the full moon, making that connection in his mind. The next time a family member shifted, he blamed the curse, and the next, and the next. You were going to shift no matter what, but the witch just used the power of suggestion against your ancestor to a devastating effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to explain what that means, right? In much smaller words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it this way,\u201d I said, sitting up. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been told all of your life that you\u2019re allergic to peanuts, that everybody in your family is allergic to peanuts, you\u2019re probably going to believe you\u2019re allergic to peanuts. Especially if you frequently see your relatives having allergic reactions to peanuts. So when you\u2019re exposed to peanuts, even if you\u2019re not really allergic, you\u2019re probably going to at least hive out a little bit. Which would reinforce your belief that you\u2019re allergic, and that will start the cycle all over again. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and now I really want a Nutty Buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brain has tricked you into thinking you\u2019re allergic to moonlight. You can probably shift anytime you want, into anything you want. Frankly, I\u2019m amazed that no one in your family has accidentally shifted during the day or fallen asleep outside before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t something we talk about a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you run around your village telling everybody about your witchy stuff?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAmong my family members, yes. We talk about it all the time. Soccer and magic, those are the main topics of dinner conversation. Sometimes both together, which would be my aunt Penny making comments about David Beckham that make the rest of us uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t talk about it. On full-moon nights, we shut ourselves inside our houses and pretend it\u2019s because we want to watch TV or play cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re poorly adjusted, I get it. Try shifting now.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t just change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about whatever form you\u2019d like to assume, and change. Feel the energy flowing up from the ground, into your legs, and spreading up through your body. Picture that energy filling in all the places between your cells and changing your shape into whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>Jed rolled his eyes. \u201cHippie.\u201d He squinched up his face, as if he was concentrating, but then his features relaxed. Nothing. He squinted again, seeming to try harder. But nothing.</p><p>I patted his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I hear this happens to a lot of guys.\u201d</p><p>He whacked me over the head with a pillow. \u201cShut it, you!\u201d</p><p>For the next three days, the hours in which I wasn\u2019t retracing every step I\u2019d taken since I\u2019d arrived in the Hollow were filled by working with Jed on his shifting. And by that I mean I called out random animals and monsters to see if he could change on the fly. It took some concentration, overcoming decades of belief in how the shifting worked, but eventually, he was able to see it as a biological function and not something that happened to him.</p><p>Jane, of course, saw this as an opportunity to research. She looked into shape-shifting from every culture. She brought over books by the barrow load. Jed was overwhelmed. After watching the process a few times, we came to the conclusion that Jed\u2019s ability worked like a hologram. He never actually changed shape. The cells realigned to project an image, a defense mechanism against predators, like a chameleon, only in Jed\u2019s case on a much larger scale. He could change size and shape entirely, but beneath the image, he was the same adorable redneck.</p><p>Jed was faster and stronger than the average person, which was helpful. While his physical form didn\u2019t change, there were limits to what Jed could do. As long as the size and shape were close to his own and humanoid, he could master them. But he couldn\u2019t become an actual animal or another person. The image of the other person\u2019s face flickered back and forth over his own until it made bystanders vaguely ill, like an unsteady picture on TV. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jed spent a lot of time on the phone with his parents, asking questions, informing them of our discoveries. It took him a few days to grasp that there was no cure for his \u201ccondition,\u201d because he wasn\u2019t actually cursed. He was a genetic anomaly, like were-creatures or people who could curl their tongues. Understanding that potentially he could eventually control it, he seemed to be more accepting of it.</p><p>I was sure there was an object lesson in there somewhere, but I chose to ignore it.</p><p>At this point, it shouldn\u2019t have surprised me when I found myself with Mr. Wainwright, floating down a canal in Venice in one of those old-fashioned gondolas. A man in a ridiculous straw hat and a red-and-white-striped shirt was guiding the boat along, singing a throaty song of lost love and heartbreak. The canal water smelled rusty and pungent, certainly not somewhere you\u2019d want to swim. But it provided a beautiful backdrop for the tidy rows of aged, fading-pastel houses.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Grandpa.\u201d I sighed, easing against his side as the water lapped lazily at the hull of our boat. He patted my shoulder in a sort of half-hug made awkward by the fluffy red-and-yellow cushions of the gondola seat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finally comfortable with calling me Grandpa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems rude not to,\u201d I said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cSo it has nothing to do with any sort of fondness you may feel for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I said, shaking my head while my lips twitched.</p> <p>\u201cSo how goes the search?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill no luck,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t anything to be sorry for,\u201d he admonished me, tapping a finger against the tip of my nose. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve given up. Have you given up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI am nothing if not obnoxiously persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get that from my side,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong with a healthy dose of bravado. Now, tell me, how are you feeling, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m running out of time and ideas and places to look,\u201d I told him. \u201cOh, and I\u2019ve some inconvenient feelings for a man who can transform himself into various sorts of wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeelings can\u2019t be inconvenient,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone I\u2019m not entirely sure I should trust,\u201d I added grumpily as the gondola bobbed in the currents of the canal.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t entirely trust him,\u201d he said. \u201cGive him a chance to prove you right or wrong. At least you\u2019ll know you\u2019re making an informed decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m taking dating advice from my dead grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass,\u201d he scoffed, elbowing my ribs. \u201cYou spend a lot of time trying to make things come to you, Nola. Maybe it would best to sit back and relax and let something come of its own accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the opposite of everything I hold dear?\u2019 \u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you tried to force finding the Elements, did it work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAre you sure you couldn\u2019t just drop me a hint or two about where you left the bell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the subconscious versions of my relatives mock me.\u201d I sighed, resting my head back on the fluffy pillows.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes up and open, Nola. You never know what you might find.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>Magic is a living, breathing cycle. In other words, everything you do will come back to bite you in the end.</p><p>\u2014A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm</p><p>Despite Mr. Wainwright\u2019s assurances, in the wee hours of June 21, I\u2019d lost nearly all hope. The shop was a mess. We\u2019d overturned nearly every shelf and sorted through every box, just in case we\u2019d missed something. Jane and Andrea and I were sprawled across the few chairs not covered in boxes and books. Dick and Jed had gone out to visit one of Dick\u2019s less-than-reputable contacts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I actually fooled myself into believing I would find it.\u201d I thumped my head against the chair. \u201cI actually thought I\u2019d be able to track down all four. How insane is that? I mean, how arrogant could I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you got three out of four,\u201d Jed said, patting my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a majority,\u201d Jane added. \u201cAnd hey, even if you can\u2019t bind the evil ice skaters, at least they can\u2019t bind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Kerrigans are going to have their powers returned to them for the first time in two hundred years. That\u2019s like giving an angry toddler an espresso and a box full of matches. You don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to turn out, but it\u2019s probably going to end in flames and tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, I think Tonya Harding would be considered the evil ice skater,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cNancy Kerrigan, no relation, was the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never liked her,\u201d Jane said. \u201cShe reminded me a little of my sister. Big teeth, bigger ego.\u201d She shrugged when Jed frowned at her. \u201cSorry, back to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family can\u2019t leave Kilcairy.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThe whole point of my coming here was to make sure we kept everyone safe so we could continue serving our neighbors. The McGavocks would never want to leave the farm, anyway. We\u2019re going to have to get tougher, I guess, more aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have my Taser,\u201d Jane offered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet Iris knows where you can get them at a bulk discount. You could get one for every man, woman, and child in your village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might do it,\u201d I said, chuckling. \u201cThank you both for all your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t mind, Andrea and I are going to retire for the morning.\u201d</p><p>Andrea pushed to her feet and hugged me with a tenderness that had my eyes misting a bit. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to leave you, but if we stay out much longer, the sun will come up, and we\u2019ll, you know, burst into flames. Which most people find very upsetting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help her clean everything up,\u201d Jed assured them. \u201cYou\u2019ll be ready to open this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I spend a little more time looking around?\u201d I asked Jane. \u201cIf nothing else, I can pick up some of this mess. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be sleeping anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jane said, sifting through her purse and handing me her key ring. \u201cLock up when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a key?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>Jane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI think we\u2019ve established that I can trust you. I\u2019m sorry to run off on you, but again, spontaneous combustion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m just moping. If nothing else, I know the Kerrigans haven\u2019t found the bell, either. Maybe I should just set fire to the other three and end this stupid feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire has been mentioned way too often in this conversation,\u201d Andrea said, shoving Jane toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m switching you both to decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night!\u201d I called after them. I sighed and let Jed wind his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know of any magical tricks that would clean this room for us, huh?\u201d he murmured into my neck.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDoes knowing the number for the Magic Maid Service count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>Jed and I slowly, but surely, set Jane\u2019s shop back to rights. I put the knickknacks back in their little cubbies. I put the boxes of random stock back in the stockroom. Eventually, it began to look like the respectable establishment it was, and not a supernatural yard sale. I grabbed a bottle of juice from the fridge and plopped into a chair, propping my feet up on a table.</p><p>\u201cBig. Fat. Failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, baby, I still love you anyway,\u201d Jed said, pushing my hair out of my face. \u201cOr I can see myself in that particular predicament pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open. \u201cLove me? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the confession I had in mind for this moment, but yeah, I do. You pulled me in with your wily, witchy ways. I don\u2019t see any other woman kissin\u2019 me after seein\u2019 me turn into a giant alien Smurf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first man I\u2019ve brought down.\u201d I laughed, closing my eyes as he stroked a hand down my face.</p><p>\u201cYou just sit here a minute, OK? I\u2019m gonna take these out to the garbage.\u201d He hefted up two large bags of debris we\u2019d cleaned out of the store. He winked at me and transformed into a sort of man-raccoon hybrid. \u201cJust adjustin\u2019 to my environment. Raccoons love garbage cans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowoff,\u201d I muttered as I sat back in the chair.</p><p>A giant raccoon-man loved me. How many girls could say that?</p><p>Jane hadn\u2019t bothered to close the sunproof shades before she left. Orange-gold sunlight flooded through the windows and the glass transom, giving the shop a cozy glow. I picked up Mr. Wainwright\u2019s copy of A Guide to Traversing the Supernatural Realm, running my fingers over the embossed gold title. I opened the book and was surprised to find that the title page was signed by the author: \u201cThe point of any quest is not the prize but the lessons learned along the way. Keep your eyes up and open. You never know what you might find.\u2014Warm regards, Jacques LeMoir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ambiguous messages prove unhelpful once again.\u201d I sighed, remembering the last thing Mr. Wainwright said to me just the other night. \u201cSo the lesson is that failure is OK as long as I come out of it feeling like I\u2019ve learned something. That\u2019s a little condescending.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and yawned.</p><p>\u201cI tried, Grandpa, Nana,\u201d I whispered to the empty room. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I sat there a long time, trying to figure out what would be the best course of action from here. If I asked very nicely, I wondered if the flight attendant would let me drop the Elements out of some sort of hatch while flying over the ocean. It would be safer than leaving them out in the world where the Kerrigans could get hold of them and make trouble.</p><p>I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyelids, wishing I could make time go back so I could relive this whole journey over again without making any silly mistakes. I would have confronted Jed earlier and pulled him over to our side. I wouldn\u2019t have reacted so badly when Dick paid attention to me and spent more time getting to know him. I might have brought Penny with me.</p><p>Keep your eyes up and open. A soft, warm voice whispered over my ear like a spring breeze. I jumped. You never know what you might find.</p><p>I blinked blearily around the room. The sun shifted through the window, bouncing off of a mirror on the wall and reflecting in a bright silver circle over the door. I wiped at my tired eyes and blinked a few times. That wasn\u2019t a silver circle. It was a bell, the old Indian cowbell Jane said had been hanging there since before she worked at the store.</p><p>I pushed to my feet, studying the battered silver shape.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be that simple.</p><p>I grabbed a footstool and dragged it over to the door to get a better look. The designs I\u2019d assumed were Indian were tiny rows of Celtic knots.</p><p>It was that feckin\u2019 simple.</p><p>This was the bell. This was the Sea bell. I\u2019d been searching this stupid shop all this time, and the bell had been hanging over the door the whole time.</p><p>\u201cIf there is a Goddess out there, you have a really mean sense of humor,\u201d I griped.</p><p>I\u2019d found it.

I jerked the safe open and eased out the little carrying case.</p><p>Behind me, a footstep sounded at the entrance to the office. I turned to find a familiar figure standing just behind me.</p><p>\u201cS-Stephen?\u201d I stammered, confused about why someone who was supposed to be in Ireland would be three feet away, holding what looked like a rather large handgun. What was happening? Why would Stephen come here at all, much less armed? He wasn\u2019t even looking at me; his eyes were focused on the little wooden cabinet. Gooseflesh rose on my arms as I stood.</p> <p>Heart hammering, I nudged the heavy safe door shut with my leg.</p><p>\u201cAh, ah, ah,\u201d Stephen said, smiling blandly as he stopped the door with his arm. He edged me away from the safe, trapping me between him and the bookshelf behind me. He gave me a sly, condescending grin as he surveyed the contents of Uncle Jack\u2019s cabinet. \u201cShe knew you would find them. You are such a clever girl, Nola. You know that, don\u2019t you? Far too clever to shut yourself away in that stupid little village for that godforsaken clinic. I meant that. I want you to know that not everything I told you was a lie.\u201d</p><p>Realization, cold and heavy, settled against my heart. \u201cSonofabitch! Did you sleep with me just so you could find the Elements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the lovely sex wasn\u2019t about the Elements,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a special side benefit.\u201d I raised my hand to slap him, but he shoved the gun toward my face, making me cower back. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep those fire-starting hands to ourselves, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ransacked the shop, didn\u2019t you? You hurt Zeb.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the meathead out by the Dumpster.\u201d He chuckled as I made a strangled gasping noise. \u201cAnd I strolled into your house anytime I felt like it. Old houses are never quite as secure as you think they are. There\u2019s always a window or door that can be jimmied. It doesn\u2019t take much to slink around this town unnoticed. All it takes is a T-shirt with an inappropriate slogan and a John Deere baseball cap. I\u2019ve been here for weeks, watching you, keeping track of your progress. She wanted to intervene, but why do the work when you\u2019re doing it for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this? And who is \u2018she\u2019?\u201d</p><p>There was that wintry smile again. \u201cI wish I could say I was special, like you, that I was trying to restore balance to a family that\u2019s been denied its magic for too long,\u201d he said, his lips twisted into a mocking smile. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be honest. It\u2019s the money. The Kerrigans are going to pay handsomely for the contents of this cabinet. I couldn\u2019t have gotten a mint for just one or two of the Elements, but all four together, in a handy carrying case? I\u2019ll be set for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long do you think that life will be,\u201d I asked, \u201conce my family hears about this? Hell, when I tell Jane it was you who hurt Zeb, your life won\u2019t be worth living. You\u2019re going to spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder for an entire family of pissed-off vampires, not to mention angry witches. I\u2019d almost feel sorry for you, if you weren\u2019t such a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re just going to have to make sure you don\u2019t tell anyone, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Stephen\u2019s hand tensed around the gun, raising it to my eye level. Panic constricted my throat, but my hands flew up, at the ready. I have no idea what they were ready to do, but it startled Stephen enough to flinch. I snatched up a heavy amethyst geode from Jane\u2019s desk and smashed it against his temple. He yelped, slumping against the wall, swinging the gun toward me. I darted to the side and beat his wrist against the shelves, over and over, until he dropped the gun to the floor. He growled, shoving me back against the desk so my head thunked against Jane\u2019s laptop. The pain of my back colliding with the sharp edge of the desk had me howling. I swung my booted foot up in a vicious arc, connecting with his chin and knocking him back into the shelf, which collapsed, dumping heavy leather-bound books on his head. He sank to the floor, limp and unconscious.</p><p>Slowly, I sat up, turning my aching head side-to-side. Stephen was working for the Kerrigans all this time? I felt so completely stupid. How had I fallen for this twice? From now on, I would have to ask Penny to prescreen all of my dates. I cradled my face in my hands, praying for the throbbing to stop. I had to get up. I had to go check on Jed, get him help if he needed it. I just had to make my head stop spinning long enough to stand.</p> <p>Somewhere in the distance, I heard the floor creak. My head snapped up, making me wince. A woman stepped into view, tall and willowy, with dark hair. For a moment, I wondered if it was a ghost.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d she said, smiling sweetly . . . right before she smashed a statue of Bast against my temple. I collapsed to my knees and fell on my face.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>17</p><p>Some relationships cannot be fixed, no matter what you do.</p><p>\u2014Love Spells: A Witch\u2019s Guide to</p><p>Maintaining Healthy Relationships</p> <p>I woke up with my hands tied behind my back. I was outdoors, in a forest clearing, tied to a tree near a campfire. The full, pregnant moon hung overhead. I could see Uncle Jack\u2019s little cabinet propped against a tree near my head, the drawers spread wide in dramatic \u201cdisplay\u201d fashion. My mother was standing close by, examining the athame in the light of the moon.</p><p>\u201cAll this fuss over such a little thing,\u201d she mused, holding the athame in her hand.</p><p>The years had not been kind to Anna McGavock. The once delicate beauty had a face like a road map, lined and craggy. She tried to hide the damage with heavy makeup, but the eyeliner had smeared and bled into her crow\u2019s feet. Deep, unhappy lines bracketed her mouth, giving her a permanent expression of disdain. Her skin was sallow and had a cheesy sort of sheen. I immediately suppressed any instinct to diagnose what was wrong with her. I didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cOh, good, you\u2019re awake.\u201d She tittered, tucking the athame back into the cabinet and draping the box in a white sheet. She wiped her hands on too-tight jeans that exposed everything between her belly button and her bony, protruding hips. She\u2019d paired those with a thin black tank top and a lacy red bra. Her hair fell in a dark tangle down to her waist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into a little trouble in Florida. I needed to disappear, and there are plenty of disposable people when you know where to look. My business associates stopped looking for me when the body turned up, and no one was the wiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let your own mother think you were dead. She mourned you. She thought about you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, spare me. I came to your stupid little dirt patch a few weeks before the old lady died,\u201d Mom spat. \u201cI was going to confront her, once and for all, to demand answers. But she wasn\u2019t there. So I looked around. I figured everything in that dinky little cottage should have been mine, anyway, so what was the point in leaving it there to rot?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, the silver that had come up missing shortly before Nana\u2019s death made so much more sense. \u201cShe saw you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t exactly serve me tea. She saw me coming out of the house. I was in my car and down the road before she put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to the night just before Nana died, how she\u2019d urgently whispered, \u201cYour mother,\u201d before drifting off to sleep. And then, when Nana was speaking through the Ouija die, she\u2019d said, \u201cMother.\u201d She was trying to tell me my mother was alive.</p><p>When this was all over, I was going to contact Nana through the Ouija die, and we would discuss her cryptic and unhelpful postmortem transmissions.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you come to the house but not see me? Did you consider for one second that I might like to know that you were still alive?\u201d</p><p>Wait, this was my mother I was talking to. Normal maternal, or even human, standards didn\u2019t apply.</p><p>She smirked at me. \u201cI dropped by to look through the papers she kept buried under that mattress. I found the address for the Wainwright house. And I was able to make a deal with the Kerrigans. I bring them all four Elements, I get paid. Handsomely. I am finally going to get my due, after putting up with so much bullshit over the years. Wainwright didn\u2019t give me anything in life, not even his name. Now he owes me the Elements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t his to give!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I have them?\u201d Mom demanded. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I decide what to do with them? They\u2019re mine, by blood and by right. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s only child. I\u2019m the heir, the rightful matriarch of our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never Nana\u2019s heir. And you couldn\u2019t get the family to follow you out of a burning building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d She sneered. \u201cAlways the favorite, always kissing up to my mother. You think I didn\u2019t know what you were up to? You wanted everything for yourself; you wanted to shut me out, starting with your father. I got tired of being second best, second fiddle, so I got out, but oh, it was like I was some sort of demon for leaving you. My own mother never forgave me for it, did you realize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever forgave you? Why do you think she gave you money every time you asked? Never reported it to the police when you robbed her blind? She loved you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not like she loved you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I loved her in return!\u201d I shouted back. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know what that is. You\u2019ve never loved anyone as much as you love yourself. Nothing was ever as important as what you wanted, what was best for you. How could you do this? Do you know what\u2019s going to happen to your family if you do this? To the village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I owe loyalty to that bunch of lunatics?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019re no more my family than your father was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who the hell is your family?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI would really like to know. Dad wasn\u2019t enough. I wasn\u2019t enough. Nana, the aunts and uncles. Is there anybody in this world you care more about than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said, placidly examining her manicure. She stopped suddenly, giving me a satisfied smirk. \u201cDo you want to know what I find funny in all of this? It was your boyfriend Stephen who was so helpful. I told him all about you, you see. I arranged for the two of you to meet. I even provided him with a little liquid love potion to slip into your tea when you didn\u2019t respond the way a normal woman would.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a long moment. Love potion. That explained the ambiguous distaste I\u2019d felt for \u201cideal boyfriend Stephen\u201d since I moved to the States. He wasn\u2019t around to refresh the potion or maintain the thrall. It explained why I couldn\u2019t seem to remember all of the things we had in common or the reasons he was so bloody perfect. I wasn\u2019t a bad girlfriend. I just had a fecking terrible mother.</p><p>Who was still monologuing, it seemed. \u201cHe\u2019s been here all this time, didn\u2019t you realize? He followed you just a few days after you arrived. We\u2019ve been inside your house, rifled through your sad clothes and your sensible shoes. The only time he\u2019s been in Ireland in the last few weeks was to pump your idiot cousin for information. Thanks to some herbal additions I put in a box of chocolates, your darling Penny spilled every secret she\u2019s ever held in that empty head of hers. And I helped him ensure that she would never remember talking about you.\u201d</p><p>I deeply regretted not whacking Stephen harder with that geode. Suddenly, my spontaneous nude snuggling with Jed didn\u2019t seem so bad by comparison.</p><p>\u201cStephen was a tool,\u201d she said. \u201cA useful tool but a tool all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue with you there,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know you, but I do. You want normal. You want to pretend you\u2019re just like everyone else. It\u2019s a criminal waste of talent. You didn\u2019t think twice about meeting some nice little broker at a business meeting. You wanted that so badly you didn\u2019t even question it. I would pity you if it wasn\u2019t so damn pathetic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pathetic?\u201d I started laughing. \u201cWell, at least I\u2019m smart enough to recognize that you\u2019re about to be screwed. The Kerrigans didn\u2019t trust you enough to leave the job to you. They hired someone else to look for the Elements. Your dear friends the Kerrigans are trying to cut you out.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was just as lightning quick as I remembered it, striking me across the cheek with a flick of her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t be smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m smart enough to know that the Kerrigans don\u2019t think of you as anything but a slaggy pawn. If you think you\u2019re going to waltz away from this as lady of the manor, you\u2019re even more deluded than I thought.\u201d</p> <p>In the distance, we heard a sharp crack, as if someone had just stepped on a limb. My mother began fussing with her hair and straightening her clothes. And then reached into her bra cups and pulled her breasts into proper alignment. Classy.</p><p>\u201cMom. You need to understand that if you continue with this, if you make this choice, you will be dead to me,\u201d I warned her. \u201cTruly dead. There\u2019s no coming back from this. I\u2019m not a little old woman you can twist and manipulate. I know exactly what you are. This is your last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo shut up and let the grown-ups talk, sweetie,\u201d she cooed, pinching my cheek with a bit more force than necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou better have the goods this time, Anna,\u201d a voice growled from the trees. Three shapes emerged from the treeline, materializing in front of my mother. A tall, gaunt man in dark posh clothes, with a teenage boy and a woman at his side. There was a lean and hungry look about them, as if they hadn\u2019t had a proper meal in the last few years. They were well heeled and sleek but looked tired and unsatisfied. I supposed living without magic when you were genetically conditioned for it would make you feel that way.</p><p>I recognized John Kerrigan, the head of the family, which would make the other two his wife, Melinda, and his son, Cameron. McGavock children whispered about the Kerrigans as if they were bogeymen, the baby-eating ogres who made us check under our beds. But up close, they didn\u2019t seem so threatening. They were just like me, with an essential part of them bound up and unhappy about it.</p> <p>\u201cNo more tricks,\u201d John grumbled. \u201cNo more false hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, John,\u201d my mother purred. \u201cI\u2019m about to make you very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is the famous Nola,\u201d Melinda said, sniffing and running her dark, empty eyes over me. \u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tied to a tree,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou try looking your best when you\u2019re tied to a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have them here?\u201d John asked, ignoring me.</p><p>My mother smirked and unveiled the Elements with a flourish. It was like the prize showcase on a witchcraft game show. John stepped forward, his hand hovering over the case reverently. My mother cleared her throat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, we set a price of two hundred fifty thousand dollars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fair price, to be sure,\u201d John Kerrigan said, while his wife\u2019s mouth twisted into an unhappy line.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was before my expenses and the unfortunate emotional trauma of having to strike and truss up my own offspring. So the price has doubled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubled?\u201d Melinda spat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay it,\u201d John said absentmindedly as he pored over the detailing on the bell. My mother made sure to stand in John\u2019s immediate line of sight. Melinda Kerrigan hissed indignantly while my mother preened. The reality of what I was witnessing hit me full-force. I\u2019d lost the Elements. Centuries of heritage and tradition were at that moment slipping right through my fingers. Because I sucked at scavenger hunts. My family had only a few minutes more as viable witches. I would lose my magic. Permanently this time. That strange, occasionally annoying energy that I\u2019d taken for granted for so many years would be gone. I would be able to adjust, but what about the others? Penny, Seamus, the cousins who hadn\u2019t come into their talents yet\u2014they would lose everything. Silent tears began to slip down my cheeks, soaking my collar.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here, Mom?\u201d I asked as John Kerrigan closely examined the candle. His son looked mildly bored, and when I questioned the necessity of my being present, he shot a commiserating look my way. \u201cYou could have just left me at the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to miss this,\u201d she said, sneering. \u201cAnd neither did the Kerrigans. They wanted to do the binding right away. They need you here for that. You are, after all, the McGavocks\u2019 representative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize that they\u2019ll bind you, too,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you have money, you don\u2019t need magic,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou never knew how to use it in the first place,\u201d I muttered, before getting another taste of my mother\u2019s backhand. Frankly, I was lucky she hadn\u2019t used the hand that was holding the athame. My lip split under the blow, and the hot, coppery taste of my own blood filled my mouth. The tears stopped. And misery made way for the cleaner burn of anger.</p><p>How dare my mother do this? How dare she put me through this, have me thinking she was dead for so many years because she was too selfish and too lazy to be a decent human being? She\u2019d terrorized me, belittled me, stolen from me, for most of my life. Why was I letting her get away with it again? Why was I just sitting there like a lump?</p><p>From the eastern edge of the clearing, something was tickling my brain. I shook my head, wondering if I was imagining it. The nudging turned into all-out poking. Impatient and persistent. Jane. My friends\u2014the supernatural cavalry\u2014were here.</p><p>I opened my mind fully, letting Jane see everything that I was seeing\u2014the number of people, their placement, a special admonition not to hurt the boy, and my suspicion that there could be more Kerrigans hiding in the woods. I would apologize for the headache this gave Jane later. The nudging retreated, and I looked up at my mother, looking so smug and sure of herself while she sold out her family.</p><p>I felt Jane\u2019s mental nudging again, closer this time. The head poking was more urgent now. What would she want? Would she want me to shut up? To stop provoking my mother? Unlikely. If anything, she would probably want me to cause distraction. She and the others would want the Kerrigans and my mother distracted so they could sneak up on them.</p><p>Magic had to work for me this time. Forget the binding. Forget inconsistency and random explosions. I was more powerful than Penny\u2019s binding. I was no longer ambivalent about my own talents. It simply had to work. There was no other option.</p><p>I focused on the energy around me, the light and heat coming off the campfire. I drew that into my mind, focusing on the nerves and muscles of my hands. I pictured a spark growing between them, the heat traveling along my fingertips and feeding that spark until I could feel the flame glowing pleasantly against my skin.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I called out while she flirted shamelessly with John in front of his wife and child. I called louder. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to me, exasperated. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to say to you for a long time,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She simpered, as if this was some warm Hallmark moment between mother and daughter. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never a proper mother. Despite having the best example in the world, you never managed to learn about loving someone or caring for someone more than you cared for yourself. You\u2019re selfish, cruel, and unable to see anything past your own wants and needs. You were never a mother to me. And you were never the daughter Nana Fee deserved. You want to know why you were never Nana\u2019s heir? It\u2019s because you\u2019re weak. Your soul is weak, your spine is weak, and your magic is weak. You feel so little emotion, so little real energy for anything except for what you think you\u2019re missing out on, that you\u2019re barely human enough to qualify as a witch. I think that\u2019s why the magic seems to have passed you by. It\u2019s a living, breathing thing, Mom, and you can\u2019t be trusted to care for a goldfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, you little bitch!\u201d she hissed, her grip tightening around the blade in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot about me.\u201d I chuckled, squirming against the tree in an attempt to stand, to no avail. \u201cAll those years when I thought you were out there trying to fix your problems so you could come home to us. You\u2019d just conveniently forget about the fact that I existed, until you needed money, of course, or something from Nana Fee. You forgot that I needed you, that I loved you, that I would have forgiven you anything if you\u2019d only asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCue the violins,\u201d Melinda Kerrigan huffed. \u201cWe\u2019re on a schedule here, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, madam, we don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d John insisted, although I wasn\u2019t sure if he was talking to me or my mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I ever done to need your forgiveness?\u201d my mother demanded, ignoring them. The athame glinted in her hand as she gestured wildly, the blade coming closer and closer to my face. \u201cYou ruined my life, not the other way around. Always needy. Always noisy. And when I needed you, when I came to see you, all you did was scream and turn to Daddy.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of my father, my anger spiked, from a minor blaze to volcanic in the space of a second. Instead of trying to fight it off, I embraced it. I could feel the last of Penny\u2019s restraints fall away and the spark of proper energy flowing through my body. I took a deep breath, feeding that spark, picturing it growing into a flame, larger and hotter, until it caught the ropes binding my wrists. It wasn\u2019t burning me; it was as harmless and welcome as sunlight. I was in control. I was a McGavock. This was who I was. And no one was going to take this from me. Not even another McGavock.</p><p>I leaned away from the tree as the rope smoldered and smoked. \u201cNever mind the fact that you tried to snatch me out of Dad\u2019s hands and kidnap me. Another thing you\u2019ve conveniently allowed yourself to forget,\u201d I scoffed as the ropes\u2019 hold on my wrist weakened.</p><p>Just beyond the ring of trees, I could hear movement. Fallen leaves crackling and branches moving as something large made its way through the trees. John\u2019s and Melinda\u2019s heads turned toward the noise, while my mother\u2019s overbright eyes stayed focused on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d John demanded.</p><p>\u201cProbably just a deer,\u201d my mother assured him without even looking up. \u201cThey\u2019re thick as rats around here.\u201d</p><p>But the crackling sounds grew louder, closer. I could hear distinct footsteps now, lumbering, heavy footfalls that had John standing in front of his wife and child in a protective stance. And still, my mother was entirely focused on sneering down at me, the point of her blade hovering carelessly close to my eyes. I had no doubt she would use it, if just to intimidate me into shutting up. She was too far gone. And I was embarrassing her, which was something Anna McGavock could never abide.</p><p>Still, I continued. \u201cI guess that\u2019s how you survive, right?\u201d</p><p>I could hear beastly, laboring grunts as the branches just beyond our circle bucked and swayed. My mother\u2019s attention wavered as she glanced toward the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot about me. You forgot about my dad.\u201d</p><p>An enormous hairy shape emerged, with long furry arms and a twisted, apelike face. I couldn\u2019t help but grin at Jed\u2019s choice of creature projection. He\u2019d made himself a Yeti for me. My mother gasped and stumbled back from the approaching Sasquatch, closer to me. The athame fell from her hand.</p><p>\u201cMom, there\u2019s one more thing you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Her head whipped toward me, a menacing snarl half-formed on her lips.</p><p>I yanked hard and freed my wrists. I grinned at her and wiggled my free hands. \u201cI\u2019m a witch.\u201d</p><p>I sprang to my feet, tossing the burning remnants of rope at the Kerrigans, who instinctively ducked away into Jed\u2019s path. I pressed my palm against my mother\u2019s chest, and a strange, enormous energy surged through my arm and sent her flying back against a tree. I stared down at my hand, stunned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John moved toward us, but Jed picked him up by the shoulders and tossed him into the trees like a rag doll.</p><p>Melinda Kerrigan shrieked and lunged for me. I cranked my fist back and swung for her face, just as Dick had instructed. My knuckles connected with her jaw. She yelped, flailing back toward the fire.</p><p>I heard a loud whooping at the edge of the clearing, and dark shapes emerged from the trees. Suddenly, the clearing was filled with vampires. Jane and Gabriel, Andrea and Dick, even Jamie. But there were others, more dark-clad Kerrigans, waiting to get their licks in on a McGavock. Jane was engaged in a hair-pulling contest with Melinda. Andrea and Gabriel were chasing the nameless Kerrigan men into the trees. Jamie and Cameron were slugging it out. Jed had shifted into what looked like a Minotaur and was charging a Kerrigan henchman alongside Dick. And from nowhere, a weight crashed against my ribs, throwing me to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cYou little bitch!\u201d my mother howled, her face white and skeletal, hovering over mine as she clawed at me. \u201cYou think you can use magic against me? I made you! You\u2019re nothing without me. You\u2019re nothing!\u201d</p><p>I yanked my hand loose and swung at her chin. She shouted, covering her face with her hands. I swung again, letting the heel of my hand collide with her sternum. I took both hands and popped them against her ears. She howled, falling to her side. I shoved her off of me, jumping to my feet and kicking her in the ribs.</p><p>With my mother on her knees, wheezing, the woods seemed incredibly quiet. I turned to see that the Kerrigans were subdued, their hands secured behind their backs with zip ties that Andrea had pulled from her purse. Suddenly, Jed appeared at the edge of the clearing, tossing two more strange men into the firelit circle.</p><p>My mother used this moment of distraction to punch me in the face. I stumbled back and punched her in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cKeep your guard up!\u201d Dick yelled.</p> <p>\u201cLet her do it on her own,\u201d Gabriel admonished. \u201cShe\u2019s never going to learn if you\u2019re hovering all the time.\u201d</p><p>My mother and I grappled, wrestling back and forth, her hands wrapped around my wrists. My muscles were starting to burn from the extended use of magic and the effort of fighting her. She had to be getting tired. I shoved her against the large oak, Uncle Jack\u2019s cabinet bumping against my shins. I felt sparks at her fingertips. She was actually trying to use magic against me. She barely had enough power to sting me. Even with her study of dark spells, she was weak. She was a weak woman, a weaker witch, and a shameful mother. I\u2019d spent years being afraid of this woman, and she couldn\u2019t even sting me.</p><p>Ouch. She had a hell of a right hook, though.</p><p>Rather than stumbling, I threw my momentum forward, knocking her to the ground. Gasping for air, wiping at the blood dripping from her mouth, she glared up at me. \u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of you? Little Miss Perfect? The Half-Assed Witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. I\u2019m done letting you walk all over me. I\u2019m done with your games. I\u2019m done with forgiving you and giving in to you because you\u2019re the only mother I\u2019ve got. Give me that cabinet, and get the hell out of my face.\u201d I nodded toward Jane, giving her a mental picture of what was about to happen. I placed my hands on my mother\u2019s shoulders and used every bit of the authority I had to say, \u201cI bind you, Anna. I bind you in the name of your mother, in the name of our ancestors. I bind you from doing harm, from doing magic. You spent every day of your life abusing the magic in your blood. You will live the rest of your life without it.\u201d</p><p>I felt it leave her body before I spoke the last syllable. The spark of my mother\u2019s energy fizzled out like a doused candle. She was dead space, cold and empty\u2014which wasn\u2019t much of a change, really.</p> <p>My mother stared at her hands as if she were suddenly missing a few fingertips. She flicked them as if trying to spark a lighter. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she spat. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jane gasped, but before she could move, my mother had grabbed the athame from the ground. She lurched to her feet, swinging the blade directly at my stomach. A force from my left knocked me out of the way like a wrecking ball, throwing me into the ground so hard that I left a trench in the dirt. I removed my face from the forest floor, looking up to see a giant armadillo creature standing over me, a black enamel handle sticking out of its chest.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I howled.</p><p>She\u2019d stabbed Jed in the heart. His life was over. I couldn\u2019t even feel his pain. Jed was going to die, and it was my fault. We would never have the chance to figure out the weird relationship between the two of us. I would lose the only man who had ever loved the real me. I would lose Jed.</p><p>As Jed stumbled back, I pushed to my feet, roaring, and head-butted my mother in the face, soccer-hooligan-style. My forehead collided with the bridge of her nose with a sickening crunch. She shrieked, her head slamming back against the trunk. She dropped like a stone at my feet, unconscious. And if the throbbing pain in my face was any indication, her nose was broken in several places.</p><p>Despite my mother\u2019s unconscious state, Andrea swooped in to zip-tie her hands together. Dick was helping Armadillo Jed sit up, attempting to draw the blade out.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, if it\u2019s lodged in his heart, we\u2019ll want to leave it until he can get to surgery.\u201d I dropped to my knees in front of Jed, feeling his pulse at his wrist, his fast but incredibly steady pulse. I pressed my ear to the leathery gray flesh of his chest; his breathing was quick but untroubled. I peeled the shirt away from his chest and frowned. There wasn\u2019t nearly enough blood flowing for a chest wound. \u201cWhat the?\u201d</p> <p>Jed\u2019s armadillo features squinched up as he concentrated on his form. The gray body armor faded away, and he slowly transformed back into human. And fortunately, what appeared to be the chest of an armadillo creature was only the shoulder of a shirtless man. The wound would hurt like hell, but he would live.</p><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d I yelled, smacking his good arm. \u201cYou wonderful, stupid idiot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelped, protecting his injured shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m a wounded man, here!\u201d</p><p>He cried out again as, together, Dick and I drew the knife from his shoulder. I placed my hands over the wound and concentrated hard. I visualized the tissue knitting itself back together into healthy muscle and skin. I could feel the warmth of the healing energy emanating from my palm. Dick grinned widely as Jed\u2019s shoulder repaired itself.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d John Kerrigan murmured, before a stern Melinda elbowed him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get the actual form, remember? Just the appearance of it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not, in fact, have natural body armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that part. I just thought of the biggest, toughest shield possible, and there I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you picked a form, and you got it!\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I had to contribute somehow,\u201d he grumbled, flexing his arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry my family is nuts,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMy aunts and uncles are actually really nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so bad. Wait until you meet my family. At Thanksgiving, we kill everything we can find, put it into a pot, and call it \u2018holiday gumbo.\u2019 \u201d He grinned down at me and kissed my forehead.</p><p>A bored but sullen voice called, \u201cPardon me, as fascinating as I find your vulgar backwoods canoodling, I would like to be untied.\u201d</p><p>We broke apart, turning to see an irritated John Kerrigan staring us down. In fact, all of the Kerrigans were both irritated and staring us down. I had several Kerrigans under my control. What the hell was I going to do with them? I could hold them hostage for enough money to put a new roof on the clinic and restock our dispensary until doomsday. I could bind them for another hundred years and continue the family tradition. Or . . .</p><p>I squeezed Jed\u2019s hand and knelt down in front of John and his wife.</p><p>\u201cI give up,\u201d I told him.</p><p>John clearly expected something else, because he frowned at me as if he\u2019d heard wrong and said, \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of this?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis started as a policy debate who knows how long ago, and it\u2019s still biting us on the collective arse. I think we can all agree that the \u2018do no harm\u2019 debate is settled. It\u2019s a bad thing to remove parts of people using the power of your mind. If nothing else, it leaves behind a big mess to explain to the authorities. Let\u2019s just split the objects. Two for you, two for us. That way, there\u2019s a balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s fair?\u201d Melinda demanded. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived without our birthright for centuries, and you want us to just forget what you McGavocks did to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019ve lived without your magic for forty years. And I am very sorry that happened to you as a result of our families\u2019 troubles. But it didn\u2019t start with us. We can\u2019t let the decisions of people who lived centuries ago continue to control us. In a hundred years, your son\u2019s great-grandchildren would be the ones in charge of protecting the objects. Is this what you want for them? Years of worrying about magical war and protecting your family from mine? Or would you rather they live out their years exploring the gifts that your family is blessed with?\u201d</p><p>Melinda cast a sidelong look at her son, her lip trembling. \u201cShe makes a point,\u201d she murmured to her husband.</p><p>\u201cOur ancestors agreed years ago to the binding,\u201d I said. \u201cNow we can agree to abandon it. It doesn\u2019t work anymore. Forcing you to give up your magic was wrong. And I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>John and Melinda whispered in hushed tones, their exchange growing heated, until John seemed to relent. Finally, Melinda gave him a curt nod, and they both turned to me.</p><p>\u201cWe would have to discuss this at length,\u201d John said sternly.</p><p>A relieved smile broke out over my face. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>John eyed Jed carefully. \u201cYou seem fairly accepting of the fact that we lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no cure for what I am,\u201d Jed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a disease or a curse. I can\u2019t change it. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d John told him, sounding very nearly sincere. \u201cBut in our defense, you did betray us and help our rivals locate the items first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about your mother?\u201d Melinda asked me. \u201cA number of us have matters to discuss with her.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my mother. I had no idea what the Kerrigans had planned for her. I did know that whatever it was, she probably deserved it. Anna hurt, stole, or defiled almost everything she touched. She\u2019d all but admitted to murdering some unfortunate because she needed a body to throw her \u201cassociates\u201d off her scent. I was finished with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who that woman is,\u201d I told them blithely. \u201cShe\u2019s not bound to me or mine through magic or blood.\u201d</p><p>Melinda\u2019s eyes widened at my wording as she recognized its significance. I understood her surprise. Binding was one thing, but she\u2019d probably never heard someone magically disown her own mother before, abjuring her from family and coven. From that moment on, Anna really would be dead to us, even if she showed up on our doorsteps. We wouldn\u2019t see her or hear her or even smell her. It was one of the coldest, cruelest things a witch could do to her own kin. And I\u2019d done it to my own mother.</p><p>In terms of negotiating tactics, it was a heck of a way to establish one\u2019s position.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s settled, then. We\u2019ll take her home with us. You\u2019ll not hear from her again. And I\u2019d like the use of my hands, if you please,\u201d John added, a little prim. \u201cThis is demoralizing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to Dick, who snapped the plastic tie on John\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd Melinda\u2019s?\u201d John asked, rubbing his purpling wrists.</p><p>\u201cNo, just you,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI said I was open to negotiations, not that I was stupid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melinda\u2019s face was thunderous, but John conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision.\u201d</p><p>Several hours later, after outlining a basic but fairly historic interclan treaty, the Kerrigans were left somewhat mollified with my offer of Flame and Air, while I kept Sea and Earth. Of course, they also had to take my mother with them, so they may have considered the whole experience a wash. We agreed to hold a full meeting at home to iron out the details. But for now, we\u2019d split the elements, and by dawn the next morning, the Kerrigans\u2019 magic would be restored. That would be the true test of whether they took this peace seriously or not.</p><p>I figured I should probably leave town as soon as possible.</p> <p>Jed stroked his hand down the length of my hair and gave me a blithe grin. \u201cSo how was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical.\u201d I sighed. \u201cMy dead mother conked me over the head with an Egyptian idol. I made fire with my mind, confronted some upsetting lingering parental issues. And I negotiated a peace treaty in a centuries-old witch war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s getting milk and cookies when we get home,\u201d Andrea said sweetly, patting my head.</p><p>I smiled nastily. \u201cThanks, Granny.\u201d</p><p>The patting turned into a light slap.</p> <p>\u201cSo how did you know how to find me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, earlier tonight, we did find your ex-boyfriend locked in my office, next to some damaged equipment and a smashed, extremely rare geode,\u201d Dick said, lifting his eyebrow. \u201cAll we had to do was shake him a couple of times, and he sang like the proverbial canary. He gave up your mom, the meeting location, everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrick,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Gabriel messed with his memory,\u201d Jane chirped. \u201cStephen won\u2019t remember anything from your time together, other than that you were the best thing that ever happened to him, but he let you get away through his own sheer stupidity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Gabriel, I didn\u2019t know you cared,\u201d I said, nudging his elbow.</p><p>If vampires could blush, Gabriel\u2019s face would have been rosy pink. He cleared his throat. \u201cFrom now on, every time Stephen hears the word \u2018tea,\u2019 he will soil himself.\u201d</p> <p>I marveled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re on my side.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel mussed my hair while Jed jostled my shoulder. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Just remember, there is no adventure without risk, no magic without payment, and no such thing as a boring journey with the right partner.</p><p>\u2014A Witch\u2019s Handbook of Kisses and Curses</p><p>Packing away my Half-Moon Hollow life into little boxes was more difficult than I ever imagined. I couldn\u2019t pack up Jane or Dick or Andrea. I couldn\u2019t pack up the clinic or the shop. I couldn\u2019t pack up what was left of my furniture, books, and clothes . . . well, I could, but they took up a lot of space, and the shipping prices would kill me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this, honey?\u201d Dick asked as he helped me tape over the last of my luggage. Gramps was not adjusting well to the looming separation. \u201cYou could stay. I talked to your uncle Seamus earlier. He said everything\u2019s running as smooth as silk over there. They can survive a few more months without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Seamus would never use the expression \u2018smooth as silk,\u2019 and it\u2019s more likely that he told you to tell me to get my bony arse back where I belong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did say that,\u201d Dick admitted. \u201cAnd then I told him to watch his mouth in front of his elders.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. It was an interesting time for the McGavocks. Distant vampire relatives, my mother coming back from the dead, unexpected declarations of peace. My family had not been pleased when I explained the new treaty with the Kerrigans. I believe Uncle Seamus\u2019s exact words were, \u201cHave you lost your feckin\u2019 mind, girl?\u201d It would take time for them to adjust to the idea that we no longer had mortal enemies. But so far, the Kerrigans had held true to their word. They had their powers back, and they hadn\u2019t attempted to harm anyone in Kilcairy. Most of their efforts seemed to involve nurturing rose specimens into prize-winning blooms for village f\u00eates. I took this as a good sign.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard back from Jed. After our ordeal in the woods, we were so happy to escape unscathed that we hadn\u2019t made any plans or promises\u2014and that hurt more than it should. He healed overnight and by the next morning was halfway to Tennessee. He needed to talk to his family about why he\u2019d basically run away for months and about my theories regarding their shifting. I\u2019d been putting off leaving for days, hoping that he might come back so we could talk. But I had to get back home.</p><p>I would have a bit of a mess on my hands when I returned to Kilcairy. The McGavocks were going to have to learn new ways to live, to get over old prejudices. And I was going to have to stop messing about and actually study the Craft in earnest. I would need the help of my family to do so. And I was going to be taking some serious guff from each and every one of them for changing my tune. There would be groveling. A lot of groveling.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to the McGavocks,\u201d I told Dick. \u201cThere are things that need to be said, explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only just found you.\u201d Dick groaned, wrapping his arms around my shoulders. \u201cAnd I just convinced you that I\u2019m not a creepy stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not losing me,\u201d I promised. \u201cI\u2019m just going where I\u2019m needed right now. I\u2019ll be back to visit. You can\u2019t get rid of me that easily. And the plane routes work both ways, you know. You\u2019ll see me before you know it. You could come to visit over Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAndrea and I never did take a proper honeymoon. We just need to make sure we fly separately from Jane and Gabriel, though. They travel like something out of a Mad Max movie.\u201d</p><p>Dick did another one of his loving face squishings. \u201cYou\u2019re the last and best of our line, you know that? Gilbert was something, but you? You\u2019re more than I ever could have hoped for. I love you, very much. And I don\u2019t take the words lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you, too.\u201d I hugged him. \u201cGrampy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot budging on the nickname, huh?\u201d he asked without moving away.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I would miss them all so much, my little vampire family. I had not had any more dream vacations with my grandfather, but I expected any night to wake up in Machu Picchu or on top of the Tower of London. And I was looking forward to it.</p><p>But life would be very different for me when I got home. In Half-Moon Hollow, I\u2019d gotten used to being myself instead of what was expected, to saying what I felt rather than what was best for the feelings of all involved. I wasn\u2019t eager to take on the mantle of leadership when it had been so lovely just to be a link in a chain of trust and love. I would miss Jane\u2019s sarcastic intelligence and Andrea\u2019s unexpected and inappropriate humor. I would miss Zeb and Jolene\u2019s sunny enthusiasm and Gabriel\u2019s bemusement with us all. I would miss my ancestor, Dick Cheney, and the unquestionable, unshaking love he\u2019d given me, even when I didn\u2019t want it.</p><p>I was also sorry to leave Dr. Hackett. But I\u2019d found him an eager volunteer in Jane\u2019s father, who was more than willing to spend a few hours out of the house every day. Mr. Jameson didn\u2019t have my hand at healing, but he was organized and knew how to help people without making them feel beholden. And that was a skill set all its own. He would be taking over my shifts starting next week.</p><p>The real problem was Jed \u201cI Am Incapable of Returning My Voice-Mail Messages\u201d Trudeau. I didn\u2019t want to leave him. We\u2019d only just figured each other out, or the closest we would ever get to it. I\u2019d been well on the way to genuine feelings for the man even before he saved my life and my family and my magic by throwing himself on a sword. Well, a knife, but it still bloody counted.</p><p>I loved Jed. I didn\u2019t like that he\u2019d deceived me, but I\u2019d come to understand it. I\u2019d done worse\u2014to my own mother\u2014in defense of my family. After a few days apart, I forgot about the lies and the hurt, only remembering that he\u2019d defended me in the end, and that he made me laugh, and that he could turn into a giant armadillo creature. That was fairly rare in terms of boyfriend qualities.</p><p>I loved him, and if he didn\u2019t come back within the next few hours, it would be ages before I\u2019d be able to tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the phone doesn\u2019t work just by staring at it,\u201d Andrea told me. I blushed and ducked my head. I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d taken it out to check for missed calls . . . again. \u201cYou have to actually dial for the call to go through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes a smart-ass.\u201d I hugged her tight before adding, \u201cGranny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to smack you as soon as you let go,\u201d she told me, patting my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s abuse.\u201d</p><p>Andrea shook her head. \u201cThe courts won\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><p>A knock at my door prevented any step-descendant battery that might have occurred without intervention. I opened it to find Jed standing there, a massive bunch of hydrangeas in his hand. I grinned, but before I could speak or fling myself at him, Dick thundered down the stairs glaring at him.</p><p>On his way out, Dick passed by, pointing at his eyes, then pointing at Jed as he mouthed the words, \u201cI\u2019m always watching you,\u201d followed by an epithet I couldn\u2019t quite make out. I figured that was for the best.</p><p>I rocked back on my heels. \u201cSo welcome to being threatened by vampire relatives . . . super-awkward.\u201d Jed chuckled. \u201cAnd by the way . . .\u201d I threw myself forward into his arms. He made an uhf sound and wound his arms around me. I wrapped my legs around his waist, much in the same way I\u2019d crawled up his body the day we met. He fell back against the door as I pressed my mouth to his.</p><p>\u201cHi there, Judith.\u201d He laughed as I ran kisses up his throat, right up to the point when I bit his ear. \u201cOw! Crazy woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, you bloody well love me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He thought about it for a long moment. \u201cYep. I do.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sunny smile. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He watched me expectantly, and when I didn\u2019t follow up, he jostled me. \u201cOh, come on. Don\u2019t play it all cool and collected.\u201d I laughed until he threatened, \u201cI\u2019ll start calling you Judith again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Very much. You idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still, my beatin\u2019 heart.\u201d He sighed, his gaze dropping to my boxes and suitcase. \u201cSo you\u2019re really leavin\u2019, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I stuck around here as long as I could. But I have to go. I\u2019ll be able to come in a few . . . months, maybe? I will miss you. A shocking number of people in Kilcairy insist on wearing shirts full-time. Disheartening, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. It took me a while to explain everything to my family. Fair warning: when you walk into the middle of the family barbecue and announce, \u2018Oh, the curse thing was just a witch\u2019s practical joke,\u2019 the reactions are gonna be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they OK?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, the news that they could shift into anything they want, anytime they want, has led to some . . . security issues. All of my uncles are turning themselves into werewolves and giant turtles and frost giants. In broad daylight. Sometimes in the Little Debbie aisle at the Piggly Wiggly. They\u2019re like little kids. My dad is spending a lot of time trying to keep them in line so they don\u2019t blow our cover. Normally, that\u2019s the sort of thing I would help him with, but I told him I had urgent business to get to up here. He said I\u2019ve earned a little time off.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow, a smile playing on my lips. \u201cAnd what do you plan on doing with that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking, and I\u2019m just throwing this out there, that you\u2019ve learned pretty much all you can, and should, about our culture. But I know absolutely nothing about Ireland other than Lucky Charms and Saint Patrick\u2019s Day. And I don\u2019t think that thing about leprechauns is for real.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to come to Ireland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Kerrigans helped fast-track my passport application process by way of a goodwill gesture,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They used bribery, not magic.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, bouncing a little in his hold. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it there. If we try hard enough, we might find someone who knows about shifters. And you could meet my family, which isn\u2019t so much a selling point as a disclaimer.\u201d</p> <p>They would love him, I was sure, because he loved me. And he wasn\u2019t Stephen, which would be enough for Penny.</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice if we had a more normal \u2018meeting\u2019 story to tell them, though. I mean, even when we did meet without all of the paranormal claptrap, there was a possum involved, so that can\u2019t be typical. I\u2019m going to catch hell from my aunts for the possum bit; they\u2019ll laugh for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want something normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love a little normal,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>He grinned, set me on my feet, and kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>A few minutes later, he came to the door in a pressed plaid work shirt. He bobbled a foil-wrapped pan and a much bigger spray of hydrangeas while he knocked on the screen.</p><p>\u201cJed, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve never met before. I\u2019m your new neighbor, and I\u2019m comin\u2019 by to introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, a naughty grin spreading across my lips. \u201cHello, handsome stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a porn.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHello, annoying person I may not want to meet after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, new neighbor. I\u2019m Jed Trudeau. I live next door, and I wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood with lasagna and flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you, Mr. Trudeau. I\u2019m Nola Leary. I just moved here to the Hollow with absolutely no agenda whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, well, I happen to have no agenda myself. But I do have some issues with body image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning your body\u2019s image changes at a moment\u2019s notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said brightly. \u201cSo do you have anythin\u2019 planned for this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual, a little cleaning, maybe some laundry, stripping my new neighbor down to nothing and demonstrating various positions I found in some of Jane\u2019s more obscure antique marital guides.\u201d</p><p>His eyes popped in surprise, but he quickly schooled his features back into blithe indifference. \u201cSounds very normal.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cA new guy just moved in two houses down. Good-looking, really flexible. I think he\u2019s into yoga.\u201d</p> <p>His face fell into a dark expression. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to cancel on the yoga guy, because you\u2019re going to be busy. We have just enough time for that naked demonstration thing before I have to pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got an invitation to Ireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re coming with me?\u201d I squeaked, throwing my arms around his neck.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSomeone has to keep an eye on me while I figure out how to control my skin. Havin\u2019 my own personal nurse seems like a good idea. You know, for watchin\u2019 my vital signs . . . and sponge baths.\u201d I bit his ear again, making him hiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to pay for the sponge-bath thing later in some small way, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a small way, no.\u201d I shook my head before kissing him deeply. \u201cLet\u2019s get you packed.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
