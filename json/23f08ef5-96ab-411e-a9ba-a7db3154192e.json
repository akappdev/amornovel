Especially us women.</p><p>But the Midwinter Miracle... Oh, gosh, can you even imagine? Not that we were surprised that Jack was wonderful\u2014of course he was! First of all, he\u2019s John Holland\u2019s son, the only boy in the family, though I guess we\u2019d have to say \u201cman\u201d now, of course. And he was in the navy, too, just in case he hadn\u2019t already won us over by being the nicest thing ever. Not to mention handsome! Those blue eyes... Even Cathy and Louise were talking about those eyes the other day!</p><p>Jack\u2019s just about royalty around here, since the Hollands are a founding family of Manningsport, and Jack\u2019s the head winemaker at Blue Heron, the Hollands\u2019 vineyard. Guess we won\u2019t have to worry about them selling their land to a developer, not with all those kids in the family business. And then there\u2019s the way Jack treats those three sisters of his, and his stepmother! A prince, that\u2019s what he is! Don\u2019t get us started on that ex-wife of his. She never deserved him.</p> <p>Anyway, what we were saying? Oh, yes, the Midwinter Miracle! Well now, sure, it was a group effort. Levi Cooper, our police chief, he was wonderful (no relation to Anderson, and don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t ask). Levi and his deputy, Luanne Macomb\u2019s granddaughter, what\u2019s her name again? Emily? Emmaline? Anyway, they did the CPR. And that handsome Gerard Chartier, him, too.</p><p>But mostly, it was Jack.</p><p>Which was no surprise to us.</p><p>It was quite...well, exciting isn\u2019t quite the right word, is it? But it was remarkable, no disrespect meant to that poor family, of course. Manningsport just about shuts down in the winter, just us year-rounders left, no tourists until spring when the wine tastings start up again. So the Midwinter Miracle brought all sorts of media celebrities here\u2014Brian Williams stayed at the Black Swan; did you know? So charming! And just about everyone and their brother had to drop by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s when Anderson Cooper was in there.</p><p>That night put our little lakeside town on the map, and given that it happened in January, well, we could all use the distraction. Laney Hughes even opened up the gift shop off-season, there were so many people flocking to town. Unloaded plenty of Keuka Lake T-shirts, she sure did. Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery sold out of everything by 8:00 a.m. that entire week.</p> <p>What\u2019s that? How\u2019s Jack doing? He\u2019s fine! He\u2019s wonderful! A true hero. Anyone will tell you that.</p><p>Why would you even ask?</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>NOTHING KICKED OFF Emmaline Neal\u2019s weekend like using a Taser.</p><p>Okay, okay, she hadn\u2019t used the Taser yet and she probably wouldn\u2019t get to (dang), but the tiny thrill of anticipation didn\u2019t lie. If indeed there was an intruder in the McIntosh house, it would be deeply satisfying to apprehend him. Barb McIntosh suspected a sex offender, and, if she was right, Em knew exactly where she\u2019d target the electrodes.</p><p>Granted, Barb had already admitted to being addicted to Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (\u201cThat Christopher Meloni! So handsome!\u201d). But she\u2019d heard strange noises in the utility part of her basement, and her grandson, the notoriously creepy Bobby, wasn\u2019t home.</p> <p>\u201cApproaching cellar stairs,\u201d Everett Field whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can tell that, Ev, since I\u2019m right behind you,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to whisper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Everett whispered.</p><p>Despite the fact that Emmaline had only been on the job for nine months and Everett was more senior, they both knew she was a better cop. Ev wasn\u2019t the crunchiest chip in the bag.</p><p>\u201cYou sure Bobby\u2019s not here?\u201d Em asked Barb over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo. I called him on the phone and yelled down there, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Everett said, reaching for his holster. \u201cAlert for incoming hostiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your hand off that gun, Everett,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cAnd where do you get this language?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall of Duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just calm down. We\u2019re not shooting anyone.\u201d Taser at most, and only then if there was a struggle.</p><p>The crime rate was pretty low in Manningsport, New York, population 715, a tiny town at the base of Keuka Lake. Everett and Em made up two-thirds of the police department; their boss, Levi Cooper, was the other third. Traffic patrol, the occasional DUI, vandalism, parking tickets... That was about as exciting as it got around here. Em ran a group for at-risk teenagers, of whom there were four. In the summer and fall, when the tourists came to taste wine and swim and boat on Keuka Lake, they were busier, but this was January, and things were quiet. In fact, this was their first call in three days.</p><p>Something thumped, and Everett squeaked. Chances were that it was a malfunctioning furnace. Possibly a raccoon. Levi always said if you heard hoofbeats, expect to see horses, not zebras.</p><p>They were in the cellar now; in front of them was Bobby\u2019s apartment; to the right was the door to the other half of the cellar, which housed the furnace and water heater and, Barb had told them, several dozen jars of pickled vegetables she\u2019d put up this summer.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Okay, something was in there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably an animal,\u201d Em murmured, taking the Maglite off her belt. The utility room wasn\u2019t accessible from the outside, so a person would\u2019ve had to come in through the house. And Barb always locked up (again, the mighty influence of Law &amp; Order).</p><p>Everett put his hand on the doorknob and looked at Em, who nodded. Then he flung open the door, and Em flashed the light, and something moved inside, and Everett screamed and, before she could stop him, drew and fired.</p><p>Damn! The noise slapped her eardrums hard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cat! Everett, it\u2019s a cat!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHolster your weapon!\u201d</p><p>Everett obeyed. As he did, a ball of black and white leaped on him, hissing, and sank its teeth into his thigh. Apparently Puss in Boots didn\u2019t appreciate being shot at.</p><p>\u201cOfficer down, officer down!\u201d Ev yelled, swatting at it. \u201cTen double zero, officer down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Em ordered. \u201cYou deserve it.\u201d He\u2019d missed the kitty, of course. The guy was a terrible shot.</p><p>She lifted the cat gently by the scruff of the neck and pulled it off Everett\u2019s leg. All of a sudden, Everett was grabbed around the throat by Bobby McIntosh, who apparently was home after all.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you shoot my cat?\u201d he yelled.</p><p>\u201cBobby! Let go of him!\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a cat!\u201d Barb said from upstairs. \u201cBobby, did you bring a cat home?\u201d</p><p>Everett was sputtering and red-faced. Em sighed. \u201cLet him go, or I\u2019ll have to use this,\u201d she said, taking her Taser off her belt. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. She cocked an eyebrow, and, with a sigh, he released her partner.</p><p>Drat. \u201cThank you, Bobby,\u201d she said. So close.</p><p>\u201cBobby! What were you doing down there?\u201d Barb said. \u201cI called you and you didn\u2019t answer! Where did you get that thing, anyway? I hate cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love them,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cI got it from the shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019re good here,\u201d Emmaline said. Everett\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cCome on, Ev\u2014let\u2019s go. You\u2019re gonna have to file a report for discharging your firearm, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a sex offender,\u201d Everett said, his hands shaking.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re safe now, buddy,\u201d she said, patting his arm. \u201cCome on. Back to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU SHOT A CAT?\u201d Chief Cooper said fifteen minutes later, staring at Everett.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ev stood there like a chastened kid.</p><p>\u201cHe missed,\u201d Emmaline said. Now that the ringing in her ears had faded, it was hard not to laugh. \u201cThe suspect was quite fast.\u201d Levi gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cFile the report, Everett. The incident is under review, which means you just increased my workload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Chief. Um, Bobby McIntosh attacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you shot at his pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cThe cat was the one acting in self-defense.\u201d</p><p>Levi bit down on a grin. \u201cYour mother won\u2019t be happy about this, Ev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the mayor. So, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Everett heaved a sigh. \u201cAnything else, Chief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fill out the report and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Everett left the office and swiped a cookie from the desk of Carol Robinson, their newly hired administrative assistant, who\u2019d been shamelessly eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cThanks for not letting Bobby kill Everett,\u201d Levi said to Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cI was kind of hoping to use the Taser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve used it on Everett,\u201d he said. \u201cBut good to see cooler heads prevailed.\u201d</p><p>It was about as high praise as the police chief gave, and Emmaline felt a small rush of pride. Granted, it had been an idiotic call in the first place, but still.</p><p>Levi, who\u2019d been a year behind her in high school, stood and picked up a bouquet of red roses wrapped in green florist paper and tied with a white ribbon. His look warned her not to say anything.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she said. \u201cFlowers for the wife? You\u2019re such a snuggly teddy bear, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate, Officer Neal,\u201d he said, giving her his famous \u201cI tolerate you because I have to\u201d look. \u201cBy the way, about that crisis negotiations class. I got you a grant. You start in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Oh, you\u2019re the best! I take back every complaint I ever filed about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d her boss said. \u201cI\u2019m going home. Maybe I\u2019ll see you at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Tell Pregnita I said hi.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and left the office, stopping to say something to Carol before he left the station.</p><p>It was hard not to feel a little jealous. Levi and Faith had been married a little over a year and had a baby on the way. Seemed like everyone was getting married these days; Em had been to three weddings over the summer. In fact, she was considering marrying herself, just so she could register for the fun housewares.</p><p>Well. Time for her to go home, too. The O\u2019Keefe Emergency Services Building, which housed the fire, police and ambulance departments, was about five minutes from town. Em drove past Hastings Farm, past the high school and into the Village part of Manningsport, three blocks around a small green at the edge of Keuka Lake.</p><p>Emmaline lived on Water Street, right next to the library, and often parked the cruiser along the green where the good people of Manningsport could see it and reconsider any bad decisions, like driving under the influence. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Tavern, the only place in town open year-round, glowed warm and bright. Maybe she\u2019d eat there tonight, since she didn\u2019t have any plans. But first, home to the Wonder Pup\u2014Sarge, her recently acquired German shepherd puppy, who\u2019d need a walk and some exercise, despite his doggy door to the backyard.</p><p>She got out of the cruiser, her breath fogging in the cold, clean air.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em!\u201d called a voice. Lorelei Buzzetta and Gerard Chartier waved as they went into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, and Em waved back. Gerard was a firefighter and paramedic. Em saw him nearly every day at work (and also saw Lorelei, who owned the bakery and could make the angels weep with her chocolate croissants). The two had started dating a while back.</p><p>Through the windows, she could see Colleen O\u2019Rourke, now Colleen Campbell, kissing her gorgeous husband, Lucas. There was Honor Holland and her husband, the lovely Tom Barlow. Paulie Petrosinsky and Bryce, who ran the animal shelter and had fixed her up with her puppy just two weeks ago.</p><p>Seemed like couples\u2019 night at the pub.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe she\u2019d stay in tonight. She and Sarge could watch YouTube videos of hostage negotiators, eat Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese (don\u2019t judge, it was delicious). Maybe binge-watch The Walking Dead. She had a stack of books from the library, too. Or she could call around the Bitter Betrayeds, the name her book club had given itself, and see who else was climbing the walls.</p><p>Suddenly, the weekend spread vast and empty in front of her. No shifts till Monday. No plans other than a hockey game on Sunday\u2014she played in the town league. She could do laundry and clean. Um...maybe buy some new towels. Go to the shooting range. That\u2019d be fun, if solitary.</p><p>Her feet were getting numb. Time to get moving. Still, she stood there on the tiny town green, looking into the cheerful pub.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d drive to Penn Yan and see a movie, but it was a half an hour away, and there was more snow in the forecast. And after the big accident, everyone was feeling a little wary about winter driving.</p> <p>Speaking of that, there was Jack Holland.</p><p>He stood outside O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, staring at the building as if he\u2019d never seen it before. Maybe she should check on him. They played hockey together, and he was her boss\u2019s brother-in-law and an EMT, so it wasn\u2019t as though she didn\u2019t know him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, seeming to be trying to decide whether or not to go inside the bar.</p><p>Em crossed the street. \u201cHey, Jack,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Jack,\u201d she said again. He jerked, then looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emmaline,\u201d he said, forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>He was so not great that her heart ached, looking at him stalled there, dead in the water.</p><p>Poor choice of words.</p> <p>But he was clearly not great.</p><p>\u201cYou going in?\u201d he asked, aware perhaps that too long a pause had elapsed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m headed home. I just got a puppy. Sarge. He\u2019s a German shepherd. Very cute. Hopefully he hasn\u2019t pooped on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, the babbling thing. See, in addition to all the above, Jack Holland was ridiculously gorgeous. As in, Hi, I\u2019ve just dropped down from Mount Olympus. How you doin\u2019? Tall and blond with eyes that were so clear and perfect and pure that they made a person think of all sorts of ridiculous synonyms for blue\u2014azure and cerulean and aqua. His smile stopped traffic and made trees burst into flower and all that crap.</p><p>So yes, he rendered women stupid. Even women who were slightly prejudiced against very, very good-looking men. But everyone, including Emmaline, also knew that Jack was a tremendously nice guy.</p><p>\u201cJack? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d he said too quickly. \u201cSorry. Just a little tired. You take care, Emma.\u201d</p><p>No one called her that. More than likely, Jack Holland had just forgotten her name. He opened the door to the pub. There was a roar of \u201cJack!\u201d and \u201cHey! The hero!\u201d and general cheering. The iron bell behind the bar clanged; the O\u2019Rourke twins rang it in times of celebration.</p> <p>Poor guy.</p><p>Emmaline knew that the good folks of Manningsport\u2014and America\u2014had been quite dazzled with what Jack Holland had done. So had she. How many people could have done what he did, after all? It was dazzling.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t explain the look on Jack\u2019s face.</p><p>Well. He had a big family and a lot of friends. Everyone loved the Hollands. He\u2019d be well taken care of.</p><p>With a deep breath of the frigid air, Emmaline went around the corner to her house, a little bungalow. She\u2019d left a couple of lights on for the puppy, and her little house fairly glowed with welcome.</p><p>Emmaline wasn\u2019t a Manningsport native, but she\u2019d gone to high school here, living with her grandmother in this very house. Nana had died four years ago and left the house to Em and her sister, Angela, who lived in California. But to Em, the bungalow meant more than just home\u2014it was where she\u2019d found refuge and normalcy back in the day...and again when she\u2019d moved here three years ago. She\u2019d kept a lot of Nana\u2019s furniture, bought some of her own, painted here and there, and the result was a pleasing mix of old and new, no real style per se, but comfortable and cheery, and it never failed to make her smile.</p><p>She scooped her mail from the little brass mailbox, unlocked the door and got down on all fours. \u201cMommy\u2019s home,\u201d she said.</p><p>The scrabbling of paws and yips of joy were happy music of the soul.</p><p>Sarge ran to her, Squeaky Chicken, his favorite toy, in his jaws as an offering.</p><p>Emmaline gathered the puppy into her arms and kissed his furry head. \u201cHello, puppy,\u201d she said. She resisted the strong urge to indulge in baby talk to the dog to preserve his dignity and her own, but she couldn\u2019t help laughing as he licked her face, wriggling like a little otter.</p><p>She stood up, did a few twirls, since he loved that, then encouraged him to go outside before he peed on the floor from excitement. He galloped out, chasing a leaf across the small, fenced-in backyard.</p><p>Em flipped through her mail. A flyer for a discount on heart-shaped cookies and cupcakes at Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery\u2014Valentine\u2019s Day preorders now accepted. No need to save that, unless she wanted to buy herself some goodies (which she did, though her uniform pants seemed a little hostile these days). A bill from the cable company. A postcard from her sister. Saluti da Milano! Right. Flawless Angela had been in Italy at, yes, an astrophysicists\u2019 convention.</p><p>Em flipped the card over. \u201cHello, sis! Hope you\u2019re doing well. I haven\u2019t been able to see much of Milan yet, but I hope to squeeze a few days of holiday after the convention. Hope to catch up soon! Love and kisses, Angela.\u201d</p><p>That was nice. Her sister, younger by four years, was incredibly thoughtful. She was Daughter 2.0, adopted from Ethiopia when Em went away to high school. The kind of daughter Dr. and Dr. Neal hoped to have, though they never said anything like that. Angela was brilliant, kind, cheerful and also stunningly beautiful with her glowing brown skin and enormous, expressive eyes. She\u2019d modeled in college, even. If Emmaline didn\u2019t love her so much, it\u2019d be really easy to hate her.</p><p>Sarge came back in through his doggy door, a clot of snow right on his nose. Ridiculously cute. She gave him his supper, then poured herself a Blue Point Toasted Lager. Yeah, yeah, the Finger Lakes were known for their vineyards, but there were plenty of great microbreweries, too.</p><p>Oops. There was one more piece of mail on the kitchen floor. She leaped for it, snatching it up just before Sarge pounced. He loved paper.</p><p>It was a wedding invitation, from the look of it. Thick ivory envelope, red calligraphy, a flower stamp.</p><p>It was postmarked \u201cMalibu, CA,\u201d her hometown.</p><p>Her knees gave a warning tingle.</p><p>She sat down at the little enamel-topped kitchen table. Opened the envelope to find another envelope inside. \u201cMiss Emmaline Neal &amp; Guest,\u201d it said. She opened that, as well.</p><p>\u201cTogether with their parents, Naomi Norman and Kevin Bates joyfully request the honor of your company at their marriage ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Sarge put his paws against her knee, and she scooped him onto her lap. \u201cSo,\u201d she said to her dog, her mouth dry. \u201cLooks like my fianc\u00e9 is getting married.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON, Jack Holland drove from the hospital in Corning back to Blue Heron, the vineyard owned and run by his family. The radio was tuned to a talk show, though what the topic was, Jack didn\u2019t quite know. Still, the voices were comforting.</p><p>It occurred to him that he was probably alone too much these days. That a battered cat was insufficient company. That he should be with people. But last night at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s had been a circle of hell, all those people clapping him on the back and offering to buy him beers. Asking how he was doing. How Josh was doing. Thanking him. Telling him he was one brave son of a bitch and the town wouldn\u2019t stop talking about this for years, which made Jack\u2019s hands sweaty.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d smiled and thanked people for whatever it was they were saying, because he knew in one corner of his mind that they were saying nice things, or what they thought were nice things, and he knew that the longer he stayed away from regular things, the harder it would be. He was fine. It was all fine. It was okay.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed as long as he could take it. Colleen O\u2019Rourke, who was like yet another sister in addition to the three Jack already had, gave him a hug, and so far as he could tell, he\u2019d returned it. But once he\u2019d gotten home, he just sat on the couch, Lazarus next to him, not touching but still there.</p><p>So being with his family, doing normal things, that was a good thing. He loved his family. They weren\u2019t a circle of hell. Well, not completely.</p><p>He put on his turn signal even though he was alone on the country road. Ever the cautious driver.</p><p>If only he could see Josh. Go when the parents weren\u2019t around. Just to see him.</p><p>Shit. He might have to pull over.</p><p>Once, when Jack was building his house, a bobcat had wandered in, lured by the smell of Jack\u2019s meatball sub there on the sawhorse. Jack came into the great room, and the animal panicked, ran straight for the closed slider and hurled itself against it again and again.</p><p>That\u2019s what Jack\u2019s heart was doing right now. Smacking and thudding against his ribs. His hands were slick on the steering wheel, but it was okay; it was fine\u2014he didn\u2019t have to pull over. He was fine.</p><p>There looked to be a thousand cars at Honor\u2019s house. Jack and his sisters, Prudence, Honor and Faith, had grown up here in the New House, built in the 1800s. His middle sister, Honor, now lived with her husband, Tom, and Charlie, the teenager they\u2019d sort of adopted. Jack\u2019s father and stepmother, Mrs. Johnson (technically Mrs. Holland, though no one called her that), lived in a spacious apartment over the garage.</p><p>Today was Faith\u2019s baby shower.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle Jack.\u201d Pru\u2019s son, Ned, approached Jack as he got out of the truck. \u201cWhy are we here again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSolidarity for Levi, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the men of the family\u2014Jack, his father and grandfather, his three brothers-in-law, and unofficial nephew, Charlie\u2014were manfully hiding in the kitchen as a wave of feminine laughter came from the living room.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d said his father. \u201cWine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. Hey, Levi. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>Levi looked pained. \u201cThey were just talking about nipple infections,\u201d he said, nodding toward the living room, which was hung with blue streamers.</p><p>\u201cI call them the Coven for a reason,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cLevi!\u201d called Faith. \u201cCome see this, honey. It\u2019s a Diaper Genie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. A Diaper Genie,\u201d said Ned. \u201cGrandpa, can I have some wine, too? Please? Quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you old enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re calling for you, mate,\u201d said Tom, slapping Levi on the shoulder. \u201cBest not keep the pregnant wife waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn will come,\u201d Levi muttered darkly. \u201cThe baby, I\u2019m all for. It\u2019s the...stuff...that\u2019s making me nervous.\u201d He sighed and went into the living room to admire the diaper thing.</p><p>\u201cA new baby,\u201d Dad said contentedly. \u201cAbout time. Right, Jack? Another nephew for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope he\u2019ll be as cool as Charlie and I are,\u201d Ned said.</p><p>Jack smiled. His wine was gone, he noticed. Funny. He didn\u2019t remember tasting it.</p><p>Mrs. Johnson bustled in, a towering plate of food in her hands. \u201cI thought I heard your voice, Jackie, my darling boy! Would you like something to eat? You look thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. J.,\u201d Jack said to his stepmother, \u201cyou look beautiful today. And every day, now that I think of it.\u201d His voice was pretty normal, he thought.</p><p>\u201cOh, you terrible liar!\u201d She cuffed his head and beamed. \u201cCome. See your sister. Make haste, and then you can eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack allowed himself to be led into the living room, where Faith sat, a plate of cake balanced on her baby bump, pastel-colored wrapping paper and tiny outfits strewn around her.</p><p>A dozen or so women talked at once, sounding like a slew of metal trash cans bouncing down a brick staircase. \u201cJack, how are you? Jack, you were amazing! Jack, thank God you were there! Jack, Jack, Jack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d he said. The bobcat started ramming the door again, over and over and over. \u201cHey, sis.\u201d He bent down and dropped an obligatory kiss on his sister\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Faith said, reaching up to pat his arm. \u201cThanks for coming, buddy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Which sister are you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnant one. The queen.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. See? Perfectly normal. Faith was funny, and he reacted appropriately. Honor flashed him a smile, telling him he was doing okay.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope your labor will be better than mine, Faith,\u201d their grandmother said grandly. \u201cThree days. No painkillers back then, either. It was the ether, or you toughed it out. Sometimes you died. John! Where are you, son?\u201d Dad appeared in the kitchen doorway, already looking guilty. \u201cThree days of labor with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom,\u201d he said. \u201cStill.\u201d He sent Jack a pained look.</p> <p>\u201cI loved giving birth,\u201d Prudence said. \u201cNed slid out like a little otter, and with Abby, I didn\u2019t even have time to get to the car. She was born on the kitchen floor. Ass-first, no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad everyone got to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt explains a lot,\u201d her brother yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you get an episiotomy, Faith,\u201d said another woman. \u201cOtherwise, you tear, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how much. Anyone else have stitches in their butts?\u201d</p><p>Sadly, Jack had heard it all before. Three sisters who took no prisoners when it came to \u201csharing.\u201d It was like comparing war stories, he guessed, though his own stint in the navy hadn\u2019t resulted in any; he\u2019d been in research down in D.C.</p><p>It was a little weird being in the New House\u2014so called because it was newer than the original house built on the property, which had burned down last year. Honor had overhauled the New House this past summer, and while it was still the same friendly, sprawling old place Jack had grown up in, it took some getting used to. More power to her, but still a little disconcerting.</p> <p>Or maybe that was just how everything was these days. The same, but off.</p><p>Levi came over and sat down next to him. \u201cYou hear some of those stories? Good God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I grew up with three sisters. They can\u2019t be in the same room without talking about blood and ovaries. And then there was the crying and snarling when they were teenagers. Terrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes me glad I was in Afghanistan when my sister went through puberty,\u201d Levi said. \u201cProbably a lot safer there.\u201d He was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou doing okay, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d he lied. Levi shouldn\u2019t have to worry about him.</p><p>\u201cWell, even with a good outcome, sometimes these things can be...traumatic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever want to talk, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, pal. I appreciate it.\u201d The bobcat was back. Thud. Thud. Thudthud. Thud. He wondered if Levi could see the pulse in his neck.</p><p>Jack stood up as another peal of laughter came from the living room. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ve had my estrogen dose of the day.\u201d He paused. \u201cHave you heard anything about the Deiner kid?\u201d</p><p>Levi looked up. \u201cNo change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d He tried to take a deep breath, but the air wouldn\u2019t fit in. Nodded at Levi, waved to the women, then made his way into the kitchen, where the other guys were now playing poker.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair, Jack,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cWe can deal you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some stuff to do at home,\u201d he said, squeezing Pops\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDad, we should check the pinot tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, son.\u201d His father smiled at him, and Jack made sure he smiled back.</p><p>He went out to his truck. The sky was nearly dark. Another day past, so that was good. Not that the nights were easier. Just the opposite, in fact.</p><p>The door closed behind him. Tom this time.</p><p>\u201cHang on, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanted a word. How are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tom. Things are fine.\u201d</p><p>His sister\u2019s husband was a good guy. In fact, all his sisters\u2019 husbands were good guys. They were even his friends, though he hadn\u2019t known Tom, a transplanted Brit, as long as he\u2019d known Carl and Levi.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, say the word, yeah? You\u2019re always welcome here, of course. Honor\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll come watch one of those disgusting medical shows with her.\u201d Tom smiled, his eyes kind.</p><p>\u201cI definitely will,\u201d Jack said. He probably wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThanks, Tom.\u201d</p><p>He got into his truck and headed down the driveway.</p><p>The road crew still hadn\u2019t repaired the guardrail, and a makeshift memorial had sprung up there the first night. Now the flowers were dead, rotting in their plastic florist wraps. A sodden teddy bear holding a heart had tipped over in the snow.</p><p>Don\u2019t look.</p><p>The truth was, he thought as he drove up the road, turning onto the long driveway that wound through the woods to Rose Ridge, he didn\u2019t want all the concern and attention and questions and hugs. He wanted not to think. He wanted Josh to get better. He wanted to have a do-over.</p><p>He put his key in the door and stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>The house smelled like perfume.</p><p>Candles were burning on the table, and a fire flickered in the fireplace.</p><p>A beautiful woman unfolded herself from the couch. \u201cJack. Oh, baby, how are you? I\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The very last person on earth he needed.</p><p>\u201cHadley,\u201d he said, and with that, his ex-wife wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>SHE WAS HERE, she said, because of course she\u2019d seen the coverage on TV and come as soon as she could. What a wonderful, amazing thing he\u2019d done! The Midwinter Miracle indeed! Daddy was so proud, all of them were, of course it was just like Jack to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHadley, what are you doing here? Really?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>She settled back on the couch, wrapping the throw around her. He\u2019d have bet that she\u2019d checked herself out in the mirror before he got home. Blanket on or off? Do I want to look waifish and lost, or confident and strong? Hair up or down?</p><p>She sipped her wine (which she\u2019d helped herself to, he noticed). \u201cI just had to come,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to worry about a single thing. I took a leave of absence from my job, and I\u2019m here for as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as what takes?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cJack, I know how hard this all must\u2019ve been for you, and I know we\u2019ve had our problems\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed. That was one way of spinning it.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to be here for you. Take care of you.\u201d She paused, looking him directly in the eye. \u201cMake things up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for two years, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly how long it\u2019s been. I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve regretted what happened between us. I\u2019ve done some serious growing up these past couple of years, and I want to show you I\u2019m not that person anymore.\u201d</p><p>It was a pretty good speech, he thought. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you one bit.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always had a way of making everything she did look beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave now,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, and her voice was husky. She stood up and folded the throw. \u201cWell, I\u2019m staying in town for a little while, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even if you don\u2019t see it yet, I know we have unfinished business. And I want to help, Jack. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help. But thank you and good luck in the future and all that crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry. I don\u2019t blame you. Be that as it may, I\u2019m here for the duration. Besides, it\u2019ll give me a chance to be closer to my sister.\u201d</p><p>Right. Frankie Boudreau, the youngest of the four Boudreau sisters, was in her final year at Cornell, getting her veterinary degree, which Jack knew quite well, since he still had the occasional dinner with his former sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t let me keep you,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I...I just need to call a cab. I haven\u2019t rented a car just yet.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly. Manningsport didn\u2019t have cab service in the winter. She\u2019d have to wait a half hour, maybe more, for one to get here from Penn Yan. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you. Where are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Black Swan. Oh, Jack, thank you. You\u2019re such a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Her suitcases were by the front door. Four in all, enough for her to stay for months. He grabbed them and went back to the truck. Hadley followed, shivering delicately. He held the door for her, the politeness ingrained.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She gave him a soft smile as she climbed into the passenger seat.</p><p>Jack had a feeling his life had just gotten considerably more complicated.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE HELL are those?\u201d Emmaline looked in horror at the...the...the things in Shelayne\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Shelayne said. \u201cThey\u2019re gross, but they work.\u201d</p><p>The Bitter Betrayeds had taken her clothes shopping, because, yes, she was going to the Wedding of the Damned. Every time she thought of it, she was tempted to channel Edvard Munch\u2019s painting The Scream, but she was going.</p><p>It would be worse to stay away. Kevin would think that she still wasn\u2019t over him. Naomi would gloat.</p><p>The thing was, way back when Emmaline and Kevin had first become friends, so had their parents, both sets so relieved their kids had found someone. When Em\u2019s parents had divorced ten years ago (yet remained in the same house, how was that for Dysfunction with a capital D?), the Bateses and the Neals would have dinner every third Saturday of the month. They went to Alaska together and \u0327 a few years later, to Paris.</p><p>So Emmaline\u2019s parents would be going to the wedding, as well as Angela. And if Em didn\u2019t go, there was a strong chance that both psychologist parents would analyze her motives in front of anyone who asked, saying that Em hadn\u2019t mustered the emotional fortitude to undertake this painful journey and find closure. Mom had already called three times this week to share her thoughts, and that would break the strongest resolve.</p><p>Allison Whitaker, unofficial leader of the Bitter Betrayeds, had leaped on the chance to avoid discussing another book no one had read and arranged an en masse shopping trip to the mall.</p><p>The Bitter Betrayed Book Club wasn\u2019t really about reading. As the name implied, you had to have been dumped. Allison, a Southern transplant and pediatrician, had divorced her husband after he became consumed with a passion for collecting antique cookie jars \u201cand didn\u2019t even have the decency to turn g*y, the way that hot Jeremy Lyon did.\u201d Shelayne Schanta, the head nurse at the E.R., had been thrown over for her own aunt. Jeanette O\u2019Rourke\u2019s husband had impregnated a much younger woman some years back. Grace Knapton, who ran the community theater group and directed the school play, had been tricked into giving five grand to a Pakistani man she\u2019d met online who professed to be in love with her, never to hear from him again. Granted, Grace wasn\u2019t really bitter\u2014she laughed about the experience more than anything. But she was gifted in the art of cocktails (her Peach Sunrises were the stuff of legend) as well as cheese puffs, so they let her join. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly, going to the wedding of the man who\u2019d made Emmaline\u2019s membership possible was going to be discussed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think you should do,\u201d Allison drawled in her glorious Louisiana accent as she fondled a black lace bra. \u201cPut some high-test laxatives in their drinks. I can prescribe you a little something on that front, darlin\u2019. Or, even better, cut up a jalape\u00f1o right before the reception, see, and then rub it all over your hands\u2014\u201d she pantomimed this action \u201c\u2014and then touch their eyes. Hellfire and damnation, y\u2019all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she gonna touch their eyes?\u201d Shelayne asked. \u201cBut actually, Em, if you could do what Allison said, then grab his junk, that would be fantastic. We had a case in the E.R. for that last year. It was hilarious. Well, to us nurses, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So tempting,\u201d Em said, unable to tear her eyes off the package in Shelayne\u2019s hands. \u201cBut I probably won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTry those on, Emmaline,\u201d Jeanette said. \u201cI might get a pair myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad enough that I had to buy a bathing suit?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cMandatory water sports.\u201d Grace clucked. \u201cWho ever heard of such a thing at a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cShush, child,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe showed you mercy by letting you get a one-piece. Now get in there and show us your boobies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is so humiliating,\u201d Emmaline said. But she obeyed, slinking into the dressing room with her bathing suit in one hand, and the...things...in the other.</p><p>Emmaline yanked her MPD sweatshirt over her head and took off her jeans. Put on the bathing suit, which was one of those \u201clook ten pounds lighter\u201d types, praise Jesus. But when she\u2019d tried it on the first time, the Bitter Betrayeds had deemed her boobage to be unremarkable. All the squeezing and squishing from the miraculous fabric apparently minimized her bust as well as her stomach.</p><p>Enter Ta-Ta Ta-Dahs.</p><p>The Ta-Ta Ta-Dahs looked like raw chicken fillets. Their purpose: to boost the girls. The br**sts. Yeah.</p><p>Em opened the package and grimaced. They felt like raw chicken, too. Em sighed, then hefted her left breast and stuck the thing underneath. Flinched. It was cold. Silicone, the package said. Maybe Em would just buy regular chicken br**sts. It would cost less than these. She slid the right one in and looked.</p><p>Well, well. They worked. Ta-dah indeed.</p> <p>She went out to show the group.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe have liftoff, people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they feel, Emmaline?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting. I\u2019m changing back into my clothes now. You people have had your fun.\u201d</p><p>A little while later, seated around a table at the Olive Garden and sucking down Peach Sunrises that weren\u2019t nearly as good as Grace\u2019s, Em took a deep breath. \u201cSo, guys, I\u2019d like to bring a date,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou know anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Holland,\u201d came the chorus.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Em said. \u201cIs he for sale or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jeanette said. She worked at Blue Heron and was therefore the resident expert on the Hollands. \u201cHe just does that kind of thing. You need a date, he\u2019ll go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot Jack,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? He\u2019s so handsome! If I was twenty years younger... And he saved all those kids! I mean, he was gorgeous before, but now, I swear, things pulsate when I think about him. Lady things.\u201d This was from Grace, who was on her third drink. At least she wasn\u2019t driving.</p><p>\u201cJack took me to my sister\u2019s wedding,\u201d Shelayne said. \u201cHe\u2019s a perfect date. Gorgeous, we all know that, but he can also hold a conversation, he smells fantastic, he\u2019s not embarrassing on the dance floor. When we got home, he kissed me on the cheek. I offered sex, but he turned me down. Nicely, though, you know? My feelings weren\u2019t even hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis ex-wife is back in town,\u201d Allison said. Em already knew this\u2014Faith had stopped by the police station, presumably so Levi could kiss her and put his hand on her stomach and offer other married gestures of devotion, and spilled the news.</p><p>\u201cHis wife?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cThe Southern belle? The blonde? When we did Sound of Music, I begged her to play Liesl, but she was...well. You know.\u201d She dropped her voice to a stage whisper. \u201cNot friendly.\u201d This was about as mean as Grace got.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Hadley,\u201d Jeanette said. \u201cAnd, yes, she\u2019s gorgeous. She came in the gift shop at Blue Heron the other day. So stylish.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline remembered Jack\u2019s wife\u2014tiny and blonde, as helpless and adorable as a newborn bunny. Once, they\u2019d been at the grocery store at the same time, and Em had realized it was Mrs. Jack Holland because of the accent (small town, nothing else to talk about). Em had had her arms full of overpacked grocery bags, her Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s threatening to topple out. Gerard Chartier had seen Em struggling, said an amiable hello, then practically trampled her to offer to carry Hadley\u2019s one underfilled string bag, which seemed to contain an entire apple.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it got really chilly, and fast,\u201d Jeanette added with great relish. \u201cHonor froze her out with that stare of hers, and Hadley got the point. She practically ran out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho in her right mind would cheat on Jack Holland?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cIf Jack had a vagina,\u201d Grace said, \u201che could belong to our book club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more Sunrises for you,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cBack to my problem, I don\u2019t think Jack is up for it. He\u2019s got enough on his mind.\u201d Also, he was too beautiful for a mere mortal such as herself. \u201cYou guys know anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Charles\u2019s cousin,\u201d Allison said. The cookie jar\u2013inspired divorce had not stopped Allison and Charles from talking every day. \u201cHe\u2019s a man. He must know other men.\u201d</p><p>Talk turned to what Emmaline should wear, if she should go on a crash diet beforehand, if she should color her hair and slut it up or, just to make Kevin feel guilty, wear smelly clothes and stop washing her hair a week beforehand.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jeanette said. \u201cYou have to be extra beautiful.\u201d She gave Em a hard stare. \u201cWant me to send my daughter over? She knows about these things.\u201d In fact, Colleen used to make the occasional appearance at the Bitter Betrayeds, mixing her fabulous cocktails, but she was back with the guy who\u2019d dumped her and rosy with love and hormones, so they\u2019d kicked her out.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cI\u2019ll just go alone and hang out with my family.\u201d She paused, picturing that. \u201cActually, if anyone can come up with a guy willing to fly to California for a few days, I\u2019d make all those parking tickets go away.\u201d</p><p>AND SO IT WAS that two nights later, Emmaline kissed Sarge seven times, made sure Squeaky Chicken was with him and walked around the corner to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s to meet the man known to Allison\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s cousin. Mason Maynard.</p><p>According to Allison and the quick background check Emmaline had run, Mason was employed (score!) in marketing and didn\u2019t live with his mother (double score!). Never married, forty-one and fairly nice-looking in an unthreatening way. \u201cHe likes dogs, eating out and French films,\u201d Allison had said.</p><p>Emmaline had winced. \u201cThat\u2019s a red flag. And why \u2018films\u2019? Why not \u2018movies\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttitude, Em. I have to go. I want to sext someone I met online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how serial killers\u2014Allison? Hello?\u201d Her friend had hung up.</p><p>But Allison had a point. Em would forgive the French films and even sit through one or two if Mason Maynard would be so kind as to go with her to the Wedding of the Damned.</p><p>Em took a deep breath and went into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, which was warm and quiet tonight, the gentle lights glowing with just the right amount of flattering ambiance. The usual suspects were here\u2014the Iskins, Bryce and Paulie, Jessica Dunn and Big Frankie Pepitone. Lucas was smiling at his wife as she shook a martini shaker.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emmaline,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHow\u2019s Sarge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so great, Bryce,\u201d Em said. \u201cI owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, no, you don\u2019t. Just make sure he\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, girl!\u201d Colleen called. \u201cWant to sit at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a booth, if that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m meeting someone.\u201d She grimaced.</p><p>\u201cA blind date?\u201d Colleen was psychic about these things, as everyone knew. \u201cYou looking for someone, Em? Why didn\u2019t you ask me? I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>Colleen was noted for many wonderful qualities; discretion was not one of them. \u201cI\u2019m not looking. I just need a date for a wedding.\u201d She took off her parka and hung it on the hook.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask Jack Holland? He\u2019s always good for that. Except with me, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re married now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But if you just want a date, ask Jack. He loves women in distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot on his mind these days, I\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>Colleen nodded. \u201cHe looks tired, poor guy.\u201d She handed Emmaline a menu. \u201cWho\u2019s getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Saint Patrick! Okay, we need someone extremely good-looking. When\u2019s the wedding and where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen days. Malibu.\u201d Em had frittered away the two weeks since she got the invitation, debating whether or not to go, whether or not to scare up a date, whether or not to simply move to Alaska and date a crab fisherman.</p><p>Colleen gave her an odd look. \u201cUh...is this Naomi Norman\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, too. Naomi and I went to college together. Same sorority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, she was the other woman back when I was engaged.\u201d Might as well tell her up front.</p><p>\u201cNo! You know, I never liked her. I think she asked me to be a bridesmaid because she doesn\u2019t have any other friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bridesmaid?\u201d</p><p>Colleen grimaced. \u201cSorry. I said yes because I thought it\u2019d be nice to get out of this snowy hell with my husband before I\u2019m too pregnant to travel. Well, we can hang out, anyway. The resort looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a date tonight, and you never know, he might be great. I mean, they never are, but let\u2019s keep a good thought. Wait, hang on!\u201d She slapped her forehead. \u201cYou could go with Connor. Pregnancy brain. I\u2019m forgetting everything, even my twin. Connor!\u201d she bellowed toward the kitchen. \u201cYou have to go to that wedding in California with Emmaline Neal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d came the answering shout. \u201cSorry, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Em felt her cheeks ignite.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do!\u201d Colleen shouted. \u201cHer ex-fianc\u00e9 is the groom!\u201d And hey, why not announce her romantic woes to half the town? But it was too bad, because Connor was nice and attractive and manfully gruff.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to hire me out,\u201d Connor said, appearing in the door to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, Con.\u201d She turned back to Emmaline. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Blue Point Lager, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe a nice glass of pinot noir?\u201d Colleen suggested. \u201cSends the right message. Sensuous, but not too self-absorbed, and not too butch, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with beer.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019m not g*y, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. You just look it.\u201d</p><p>Em sighed. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hair down. It\u2019s pretty.\u201d Colleen reached over and took out the clip that was holding up Emmaline\u2019s hair. \u201cThere. Very hetero. I\u2019m a whiz with makeup. Just putting it out there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks. You must have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessage received. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for your guy.\u201d Colleen smiled and bustled away.</p><p>Colleen\u2019s pushiness aside, Em was hugely relieved. Colleen would be at the wedding, and Lucas, too. Angela, as well. She\u2019d have allies, in other words. Her parents were in the neutral column. It depended on their moods.</p><p>Hannah O\u2019Rourke brought her the beer, and Em took a sip. Jerked her chin at the Manningsport Fire Department, who\u2019d trickled in for their weekly meeting, which consisted of poker and dirty jokes.</p> <p>So. What was she supposed to do at this very moment? She hadn\u2019t been on many dates since the breakup. She\u2019d been on, oh, let\u2019s see now...two.</p><p>It had taken a while to get over Kevin, of course, the only man she\u2019d ever dated, slept with, kissed or even held hands with. And those two dates had been pretty terrible. One guy had had to go to the hospital to pass a kidney stone; Emmaline was going to wait with him, but he told her to leave before his wife got there. The other guy had asked her to pick him up, then invited her in, flopped onto a couch, picked up his bong and asked if she wanted to get high and watch SpongeBob. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d she\u2019d said, and so the evening had ended in his arrest.</p><p>Also, men weren\u2019t really beating a path to her door. She\u2019d read the books, the ones that instructed her to feign idiocy and let the man do all the work and be feminine and unavailable and all that, and she was more than willing to try. It was just that not many guys asked.</p><p>Em got it. She was a police officer who played hockey and had a smart mouth. Not unattractive, not drop-dead gorgeous, either, not like Colleen or Faith or anything. Shoulder-length brown hair. Blue eyes that were not sapphire, ultramarine, cobalt, turquoise or cerulean. Just ordinary blue. Her body was average, she guessed. She was in good shape in that she ran and took a kickboxing class from time to time. Then again, she\u2019d eaten an entire Pepperidge Farm coconut cake just last night.</p><p>Kevin\u2019s parting words to her had been about her weight.</p> <p>Sigh. Mason Maynard was forty-seven seconds late. Not that she was counting.</p><p>She\u2019d been clear in her email to him that she was looking for a wedding date and nothing more. She\u2019d pay for his flight and hotel for the weekend, of course, and all she wanted was an amiable companion. Someone to talk to and sit with and, when interrogated by her parents, to simply say they were friends.</p><p>She\u2019d been to weddings without a date before, of course. But those had been the weddings of nice people. Tom Barlow and Honor Holland, Faith and Levi last year.</p><p>She looked at her watch again. Allison\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s cousin\u2019s friend was now three minutes and fourteen seconds late. She took a sip of beer, but not too much, because she didn\u2019t want Mason Maynard to think she\u2019d been waiting too long or was the type to chug like a frat boy.</p><p>It was possible that Mason would be lovely. That at the age of forty-one, eight years her senior, he\u2019d have a heartbreak story, too. That he\u2019d completely understand why she needed a date, and, at the wedding, he\u2019d be charming and self-deprecating. That they\u2019d come back to Manningsport and he\u2019d say, \u201cYou know, I had a great time. Want to have dinner sometime?\u201d</p><p>Because, yes. Emmaline had always wanted to get married.</p> <p>It\u2019s just that she\u2019d always wanted to get married to Kevin.</p><p>That\u2019s what happened when you met the love of your life when you were in eighth grade.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline?\u201d</p><p>She looked up so suddenly she practically dislocated her neck. \u201cHey! Hi! Yes. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Mason Maynard was better-looking than his photo.</p><p>Much better-looking.</p><p>Now there was something that didn\u2019t happen every day. He looked like Michael Fassbender. Hopefully in every way.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he said with a faint smile. Emmaline\u2019s stomach did a flip, and she felt the start of a dopey grin.</p> <p>He had beautiful dark eyes and graying hair, and he looked...he looked like a husband. Not that she was getting ahead of herself.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You, too,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His grin widened. Yep. Husband.</p><p>\u201cThis is my sister,\u201d he said, stepping aside. A thin, similarly graying woman stood there, hatchet-faced and grim. \u201cPatricia, this is Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Patricia said in a toneless voice.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Em said.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>But no, no, this didn\u2019t mean anything. After all, it wasn\u2019t weird that a guy would bring his sister on a date, right?</p><p>Fine. It was freaky. But maybe there was a good reason. Maybe her car had broken down, or she had dropped by unexpectedly. Or, from the look of her, she needed a keeper.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to meet you,\u201d Mason said, winking.</p><p>\u201cNo, sure. That\u2019s...that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Colleen came over. \u201cHello! What can I get you?\u201d she asked merrily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a vodka tonic,\u201d Mason said. \u201cAnd my sister will have water with a very, very thin slice of lemon, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Colleen said, shooting Em a look. \u201cAnything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Mason said, as he and his sister sat down. \u201cWe\u2019re just here for drinks.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline wavered. On the one hand, weird already shimmered in the air. On the other, she was so hungry her stomach was growling. \u201cI\u2019ll have the nachos,\u201d she said, food slut that she was. Patricia slid lower in her seat. \u201cYou can share, if you like,\u201d Em added.</p><p>Mason smiled. Emmaline smiled. Patricia didn\u2019t smile. Colleen walked back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d said Em. \u201cThis is great, meeting you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a small phobia about being alone with women,\u201d he said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSo I always come with him,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cAlways. Every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Dear God, where do You hide the normal people? Love, Emmaline.</p><p>Mason laughed warmly. \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She doesn\u2019t.\u201d Mason smiled again. \u201cOnly the first time. I realize it\u2019s a little strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of our mother,\u201d Patricia said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not discuss it,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her, Mase,\u201d Patricia barked. \u201cKeeping things bottled up is dangerous! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>The fire department was now staring openly. The firefighters loved this kind of thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Em said. \u201cSome things are too personal to discuss with strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has boundary issues,\u201d Patricia said urgently. \u201cWe both do. Boundaries become very fluid in communes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say commune?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd the cats. Jesus.\u201d Patricia shuddered.</p><p>\u201cSo many cats.\u201d Mason\u2019s voice broke. He took a steadying breath, then tried to smile at Emmaline. She tried to smile back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a dog person myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, reaching over to grip her hand. That was a little uncomfortable, given that he was staring intently into her eyes...and that his sister was now trying to get something out of her back molar. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind. So! About this wedding. Difficult circumstances, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ll probably just go alone. I mean, it\u2019s fine. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was your first love, you said in your email.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Why did she tell him that? \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Patricia finished digging around in her teeth. \u201cMase, tell her about your first love. Do it. Tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Em said. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019d love to share the story. It\u2019s actually quite beautiful.\u201d He was still gripping her hand. \u201cLisbeth. She was so lovely, so very lovely. A friend of my grandmother\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the commune. We should\u2019ve run away from there long before we did, Mase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Mason continued, \u201cLisbeth was a beautiful woman. Oh, sure, maybe a little mature for a seventeen-year-old boy, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was seventy-four,\u201d Patricia said, waggling a shaggy eyebrow at Emmaline. \u201cSeventy. Four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere are your nachos!\u201d Colleen said, setting down the veritable trough of food. Why had Em been so gluttonous and ordered them? Because now she had to at least pretend to eat.</p><p>Hang on. She was a cop. She always had an excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot to mention that I\u2019m on call tonight. Just in case I\u2019m needed. Patricia, I\u2019m a police officer, and it\u2019s such a small town that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Levi\u2019s on tonight,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>Dear God, could You please throw me a bone? Love, Emmaline. \u201cNo, I am.\u201d She gave Colleen a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure of it. Faith came in for dinner because Levi\u2019s working. So you\u2019re off\u2014oh.\u201d Colleen seemed to realize she\u2019d just bludgeoned a hole in Titanic\u2019s last lifeboat. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s...that\u2019s great. I thought I was on call. But I guess I\u2019m not. Good! Fine. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your dinner,\u201d Mason said with that broad, easy grin. Creepy, really. \u201cGo ahead\u2014enjoy while it\u2019s still hot. We never had hot food in the commune, so I love it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, would you like some? Feel free.\u201d Do not. Do not feel free.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re vegetarians,\u201d Patricia said, taking a nacho and examining it. \u201cThough I order ham from time to time. Did you know the French for ham is jambon? I find that fascinating.\u201d She put the chip back on the plate. \u201cJambon. Jambon. Jambon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Lisbeth,\u201d Mason said. \u201cShe and I were soul mates. It was so refreshing, not having to hide who I was anymore, not being blinded by what was traditionally considered beautiful. Which is one reason I think you and I will work out just fine, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So Lisbeth\u2019s age was no concern. You see, at the commune, we didn\u2019t believe in aging.\u201d</p><p>Em took a nacho. \u201cReally. How did that work out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died!\u201d Mason cried. \u201cLisbeth died, dropped stone-cold dead when she was weeding the basil plants!\u201d He burst into tears. \u201cI never saw it coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mase,\u201d his sister said, wrapping her arms around his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d Apparently, her brother\u2019s tears were too much for her, because she began sobbing, as well.</p><p>Emmaline glanced over to the bar. Colleen had her hand over her eyes, her shoulders shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cColl?\u201d she called. \u201cCan I get these to go, please?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>WHEN HADLEY WANTED something, as Jack well knew, nothing could sway her. Not the opinions of other people, not common sense, nothing. And right now, she wanted Jack.</p><p>Which was an utter waste of her time.</p><p>\u201cMarry in haste, repent in leisure,\u201d Jack\u2019s grandmother had intoned when he\u2019d told her he was getting married.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a bachelor?\u201d his grandfather had asked. \u201cI wish I was a bachelor. I\u2019ve been wishing that for six decades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call a lawyer,\u201d Goggy had replied. \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are, old man.\u201d</p><p>In hindsight, they both had a point.</p><p>But Jack had been thunderstruck by love, and Hadley Belle Boudreau was unlike any woman he had ever met.</p><p>She was soft-spoken and smart and funny, and though Jack\u2019s three sisters would bludgeon him to death if they heard him say it, she had manners the likes of which Yankee women\u2014or at least Holland women\u2014just didn\u2019t have. Pru wore men\u2019s clothes and smelled like grapes and dirt, same as their father did, and had enjoyed tormenting Jack with gory, detail-filled talk of periods and ovarian cysts for the past several decades. Honor was brisk and unsentimental. Faith, the youngest, liked to punch him (still, even though she was pushing thirty). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Hadley was\u2014how could he put this?\u2014refined. Southern. She was, God forgive him, a lady, the kind they didn\u2019t seem to make in the farming regions of western New York. And again, his death would be long, drawn-out and extremely bloody if his sisters (or grandmother, for that matter) heard him say that, which basically proved his point.</p><p>There was a vulnerability about Hadley; she was a tiny thing, five-foot-two, delicate frame, silken blond hair and big brown eyes, and her smile lit up a room. But she also had an occasionally bawdy sense of humor, which kept her from being too sticky-sweet.</p><p>They\u2019d met at a wine tasting in New York City at a noisy, swanky restaurant near Wall Street populated by lean, fiercely fashionable women and loud, confident men, all aggressively eating hors d\u2019oeuvres and trying to top each other\u2019s stories of that week\u2019s ballsy successes. But the restaurant was one of Blue Heron\u2019s best accounts in Manhattan, and the owners were quite nice.</p><p>Honor usually handled these things, but she\u2019d asked him to go, and he was happy to. Tastings (and schmoozing restaurant owners) were part of the family business, and Jack wanted to do his part. He\u2019d joined the navy\u2019s Reserve Officers Training Corps in college, and after he\u2019d gotten his master\u2019s in chemistry (because wine making was all about chemistry), he spent his time in the navy in a lab outside D.C., studying the potential effects and treatment of chemical contamination in large bodies of water. Then he came back to Manningsport and assumed the position of winemaker alongside his father and grandfather.</p> <p>That had always been the plan: education, military service and a return home, and the plan had been working just fine. He loved his family, loved making wine, loved western New York. While he was exceedingly popular with the fairer sex, he was getting a little tired of dating. He wanted to settle down, have a couple of kids.</p><p>He just had to meet the right woman, and given that he knew virtually everyone in Manningsport, he was fairly sure she wasn\u2019t there. He\u2019d had his heart broken twice, once in college, once by a congressional aide, but since then, he hadn\u2019t had a relationship with staying power.</p><p>So that night, he poured wine and described what people were tasting (if they were interested). In the eyes of the Wall Street men, Jack was just a bartender, and if they were threatened by the way some of the women were eyeing him, they countered by ignoring him. Which was fine. He was only there to represent Blue Heron.</p><p>The women weren\u2019t his type, anyway\u2014they all seemed to be dressed in stark, narrow black dresses and wore twisted pieces of wire for jewelry. Must be the trend that year, because they could\u2019ve passed for clones, aside from variations in skin, hair and eye color.</p><p>\u201cSo what am I drinking?\u201d one such clone asked, leaning forward to make sure he could admire the view (not that it was hard; her bra was an architectural wonder that presented her br**sts as if on a platter).</p> <p>\u201cThis is a sauvignon blanc,\u201d he said, \u201cwith notes of tangerine and apricot and some great limestone elements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, letting her eyes trail down his torso.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a firm acidity and a long, clean finish. Great with any kind of fish or poultry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to come to my place after this?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m Renee, by the way. Associate over at Goldman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s against company policy,\u201d he lied.</p><p>Another Wall Street clone sidled up to the bar and gave Jack the same speculative look as the first woman. He suppressed a sigh and forced a smile, poured some wine and delivered the shtick.</p> <p>A male Wall Streeter stuck out his glass without even looking at Jack, and Jack poured obediently.</p><p>\u201cNot that one! The cabernet!\u201d the guy barked. Jack cocked an eyebrow and obeyed.</p><p>Then Jack saw her.</p><p>She was the only woman in the place not dressed in dark colors, which made her seem as if she\u2019d just wandered off a Disney set. Her dress was bright pink, her blond hair was caught up in a twist with a few loose tendrils escaping and she looked a little lost.</p><p>A lot lost, actually. She glanced around, standing on tiptoe. Then, taking pains to say \u201cexcuse me\u201d to the loud stockbrokers (who ignored her as if judging her to be inferior to their female counterparts), she made her way to the bar.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d He could smell her perfume.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a little...overwhelmed, it seems. I\u2019m supposed to meet my old college roommate, but she\u2019s not here just yet. Guess I feel like a fish outta water.\u201d</p><p>She had a Southern accent and a husky voice. It worked. Hell yes.</p> <p>\u201cJack Holland,\u201d he said, extending his hand.</p><p>\u201cHadley Boudreau.\u201d Her hand was smooth and soft. \u201cIt\u2019s awfully nice to meet you. You\u2019re the first person who\u2019s smiled at me all day, I swear. I\u2019ve never been to New York before, and my goodness, it\u2019s a whole different country, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d finished speaking, he was in love. She didn\u2019t fit into this loud, overconfident crowd, and Jack had the sense that if someone bumped into her or stepped on her foot, she\u2019d burst into tears. You didn\u2019t grow up with three sisters and not know how women thought.</p><p>And Jack\u2019s sisters had always told him he had a thing for a woman in distress.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cSavannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful city,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHave you been there?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIt is beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He told her how he\u2019d presented a paper down there a few years ago, and her eyes grew wide with the mention of the U.S. Navy (the hottest branch, Jack always thought). She actually squealed when he mentioned a restaurant she knew, and she was so sweet and energetic and easy to please, she stuck out like a flower growing in an abandoned parking lot.</p><p>She kept sipping wine and seemed to get a little tipsy, which was cute, given that she\u2019d had maybe a half a glass. Then again, she couldn\u2019t weigh more than a hundred pounds.</p><p>She was beautiful. Flawless skin, perfect nose, full, pink lips and a dimple in one cheek. She had a husky laugh that Jack found himself getting a little drunk on. Whenever he had to pour for someone else, he found himself looking back at her with a little wink or smile, and, each time, she blushed and smiled back.</p><p>When her friend came in (dressed in black, of course), Hadley introduced him, said how pleased she was to have met him and how grateful she was for the conversation. She extended her hand, and he took it, and held on to it for a long minute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying in the city for a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you like to have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>Hadley smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019d love that, Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>They had dinner the next night at a gorgeous, expensive restaurant in South Street Seaport with a killer view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Was he trying to impress her? Absolutely. He walked her back to her friend\u2019s apartment, and when he went to kiss her, she blushed and offered her cheek. \u201cI guess I\u2019m old-fashioned,\u201d she said. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind, but I don\u2019t kiss on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that kiss on the cheek was more special than anything he\u2019d experienced to date.</p><p>The next day, Jack called his dad and said he\u2019d be staying in the city for a few extra days. He called on some accounts, but mostly he saw Hadley. Her friend was working; Hadley had been planning to do some sightseeing before their girls\u2019 weekend officially started. So Jack took her around and showed her the city\u2014New York\u2019s most famous places\u2014Greenwich Village, the Metropolitan, the Empire State Building and Times Square, but also the High Line, the Cloisters and a bike tour of Governors Island.</p><p>They shared a pretzel in Bryant Park, rode the Staten Island Ferry, bought a cupcake from a street vendor in SoHo. In Central Park, Jack hired one of those hokey carriages, and Hadley was over the moon. She let him kiss her on the lips, and she was sweet and soft and lovely. But she also had a quick sense of humor and an earthiness to her that Jack found incredibly hot. The sight of her eating a hot dog had almost brought him to his knees, and she grinned as she chewed, well aware of the effect she had.</p><p>She was an interior decorator and loved popping into hotels to see the lobbies. On their way out of one building, a man held the door for them, and Hadley practically had a kitten. \u201cDid you see that? That was Neil Patrick Harris! Oh, I had the worst crush on him! Think he\u2019d turn straight for me, just for an hour?\u201d Then she stood on her tiptoes and kissed Jack\u2019s cheek. \u201cThis has been the best week of my entire life, Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>For him, too.</p><p>What followed was a very old-fashioned courtship. Letters (not just emails, either). Long phone calls into the night. He sent her flowers and a snow globe of Manhattan. She sent him cookies and a scarf she knitted herself. After three weeks, he went down south to visit her.</p><p>Hadley lived in a sweet neighborhood, not too far from her parents and two older sisters. Her house was a tiny bungalow, the yard filled with flowers. When Jack knocked, she answered the door (wearing a dress and heels and smelling incredible), took his coat, hung it up in a closet and poured homemade iced tea into a tall glass filled with ice. She added a couple of mint leaves picked from her garden. She\u2019d baked sugar cookies for him and served them on a porcelain plate, first inviting him to sit down and relax.</p><p>They had dinner with her entire family that night, and everyone seemed like wonderful, upbeat, intelligent people. Mr. Boudreau was a lawyer; Mrs. Boudreau had been a college English professor. Hadley had three sisters\u2014Ruthie was a pediatric surgeon, and Rachel was a state representative. Both older sisters were married, and each had a son and a daughter. Hadley\u2019s younger sister, Frances-Lynne, better known as Frankie, was a senior in college, wanted to be a veterinarian and was looking at Cornell, Jack\u2019s own alma mater.</p><p>Clearly, the Boudreaus were a wonderful family, and, even more clearly, Hadley Belle would make an incredible wife.</p><p>That night, he took her back to the Bohemian Hotel, and they slept together for the first time.</p><p>Afterward, Hadley said that being with him had felt different, not that she was too experienced. But she knew it had been special. Meaningful.</p><p>He flew her to New York a few weeks later. It was a great time to visit Manningsport; the trees were in bloom, the weather clear and warm, and it was the weekend of the Black-and-White Ball, a fund-raiser his family supported every year. That year, it was held at McMurtry Vineyard, another operation on Keuka Lake. Hadley loved it, charmed everyone and practically shimmered in a white sequin gown.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Jack asked Honor. \u201cIsn\u2019t she fantastic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty,\u201d she answered, and it was only later that Jack realized Honor had dodged the question.</p><p>Hadley loved Blue Heron, loved Jack\u2019s family, loved the house he\u2019d built high on Rose Ridge, tucked in the woods at the west end of the fields. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything nicer than sitting on this here deck and watching the sunrise,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nine weeks after they\u2019d met, Jack flew down to Savannah for the third time and knocked on the Boudreaus\u2019 front door. Mr. Boudreau ushered him into his study, poured him a glass of an excellent smoky bourbon and another for himself. \u201cI think I probably know what\u2019s on your mind, son,\u201d he said, sitting behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask Hadley to marry me, sir,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cAnd I wanted your blessing first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they say Yankees have no manners,\u201d Mr. Boudreau said with a faint smile. He took a sip of his drink and considered Jack. \u201cWell, now. I appreciate you coming to talk to me, I do. Let me ask you this, though, son. You sure you\u2019ve thought this through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s fast,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think a little more time might be a good thing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Initially, Jack just thought Bill Boudreau was trying to keep his third daughter closer to home, or was just being protective, doing what fathers did. Later, it would make more sense.</p><p>\u201cI think I know what I need to, sir. She\u2019s everything I could ever ask for.\u201d</p><p>Bill sighed. \u201cShe has her charms, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d He slapped the desk. \u201cWell, all right, then. Best of luck to you, Jack. I think you\u2019ll be good for her.\u201d</p><p>Jack took Hadley to dinner that night at 700 Drayton in the Forsyth mansion, her favorite restaurant. Afterward, they walked through the park, and, in front of the fountain, Jack took her hand, knelt down and pulled a little turquoise box from his pocket. \u201cHadley, make me the happiest\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! Yes, Jack, yes, let me see that ring! Oh, my land, it\u2019s beautiful! Oh, Jack!\u201d She let him slide it on her finger and practically danced in a circle around him she was so happy.</p><p>He\u2019d definitely scored with the ring.</p><p>Originally, Jack was going to give her his mother\u2019s engagement ring, which his dad had given to him years ago for just such a purpose. But something told him Hadley would want something that had been bought just for her, so he\u2019d checked with Faith, then visited Tiffany\u2019s and bought her an elaborate platinum-and-diamond ring that cost about as much as a new tractor.</p><p>He wanted to marry her fast and get her up to Manningsport, and she was all for it. Despite the rushed nature of the wedding, it was a huge affair. Hadley had an enormous binder she\u2019d begun at age seven, complete with spreadsheets and thousands of pictures on her computer, organized by file\u2014flower arrangements, bouquets, cakes, bridesmaid dresses, invitations, place settings. The only thing she didn\u2019t need was a gown; she\u2019d bought her wedding dress when she was twenty-one, she told him, which struck Jack as slightly terrifying. Then again, things were different in the South.</p><p>Jack learned that at the ripe old age of twenty-seven, Hadley viewed herself as an old maid. Most of her friends had gotten engaged (or lavaliered, whatever that was) in college. The summer after she\u2019d graduated, Hadley had been in eight weddings, and she\u2019d thought her day would never come. When he mentioned he had two unmarried sisters older than she was, she shrugged. \u201cSouthern women can\u2019t wait to settle down and start a family. It\u2019s more of a priority for us.\u201d</p> <p>She became a bit of a monster about the wedding, growing furious when the caterer didn\u2019t have the right shade of ivory for the napkins. Her eyes narrowed at the mention of a cousin who\u2019d \u201cstolen\u201d her idea for a bridal bouquet last summer\u2014everyone knew that Hadley\u2019s heart had always and forever been set on a bouquet of gardenias and bluebonnet, and then That Vanna had gone in and swooped up the idea, and now everyone would compare, and Hadley wanted to be completely unique yet traditional and have the most beautiful wedding ever held.</p><p>Jack was so, so glad to be a guy. But as he was one thousand miles away, he thought her bridezilla antics were kind of cute.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s going to be the most beautiful,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cBecause you\u2019re the bride, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack! You always know what to say! But dang it all, I\u2019m going to just kill That Vanna when I see her at my bachelorette party!\u201d</p><p>Speaking of parties, there were many. The traditional engagement party, for which Jack flew down with his father so the parents could meet, and so Jack could meet Hadley\u2019s extended family. That had been very nice. Southerners really did know how to socialize, and Dad liked Mr. and Mrs. Boudreau very much. There were no fewer than three showers, and Hadley was a little hurt that Jack\u2019s sisters didn\u2019t come to each one. There was the bachelorette party, a party the night before the rehearsal dinner, the rehearsal dinner and a brunch for wedding guests the day after the wedding. Not to mention the wedding itself.</p><p>Finally, the big day came, which was a relief, because Jack just wanted to be married so Hadley could go back to being her sweet self and not some Martha Stewart\u2013obsessed monster.</p> <p>The wedding was held at her parents\u2019 lovely home, in the vast backyard. Hadley had what seemed like thousands of bridesmaids\u2014her three sisters, his three and his niece, her sorority sisters and many cousins, even That Vanna, all clad in pale pink. Jack had a couple of friends from college, Connor O\u2019Rourke, a buddy from the navy, and his father as his best man, as well as Hadley\u2019s brothers-in-law. Biggest wedding party he\u2019d ever seen, frankly, and a little embarrassing that it was his.</p><p>But Hadley was radiant and happy, seeming to float on a huge, cloudlike dress. If she occasionally leveled a steely-eyed gaze at a bridesmaid who laughed too loudly or a kid who spilled juice on a table, well, she just wanted her day to be perfect.</p><p>Seemed pretty close to Jack. It was Southern hospitality at its finest.</p><p>White-covered tables held elaborate flower arrangements in blue mason jars. Half a dozen copper tubs filled with ice and glass bottles of Coke were left at strategic points (Jack had been schooled that Pepsi was viewed as a sin against humanity down here). Mint juleps and neat bourbons were served at the bar, and pitchers of sweet tea instead of water sat on every table. There was a groom\u2019s cake decorated to look like it was covered in grape leaves. The buffet had shrimp and grits, mac and cheese, fried chicken and roasted oysters. The wedding cake had twelve layers.</p><p>\u201cJesus, would you look at this?\u201d Prudence said, fanning herself. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at friggin\u2019 Tara.\u201d</p><p>The word Southern was tossed around endlessly, as if the guests needed to remind themselves where they lived\u2014Hadley was from a good Southern family, it was a real Southern wedding, Hadley was such a Southern beauty, what a wonderful Southern tradition, the Southern food was Southern delicious, Barb was such a Southern mama, didja see Bill cry, of course, he\u2019s a Southern daddy, sure is hot, you can count on this Southern weather, oh, look at that beautiful Southern smile!</p><p>Jack lost count of the times he was told that for a Yankee, he was all right. Apparently, the War of Northern Aggression, as it was called down here, was still a sore spot.</p><p>The dancing went on into the wee hours before Jack could finally carry his bride over the threshold of their suite.</p> <p>Their honeymoon was in the Outer Banks, a perfect week of walking on the beach and making love, swimming and sailing, eating and drinking wine, opening gifts and talking (a lot) about the wedding. Hadley thought it had been magical and perfect and wanted to go over every minute, again and again.</p><p>They flew back to Manhattan for one more night away to break up the travel, and, yes, stayed in one of the posh hotels they\u2019d looked at when they\u2019d just met (a suite, though not the penthouse suite, which caused the briefest pout).</p><p>And then, finally, they drove to Manningsport, and Jack felt himself relax as they got closer to home. The wedding had been great (if exhausting), the honeymoon idyllic, but this was what he\u2019d really been looking forward to. Not getting married...being married. Eating at home instead of restaurants. Sleeping in his own bed without the unfamiliar sounds of away.</p><p>And, Jack had to admit, he wanted to get back to work, because he loved his job. Two solid weeks of not working had made him a little itchy. He missed home, the morning fog that so often hung over Crooked Lake, the fields in the mist, the long, quiet afternoons with his father and grandfather, experimenting with techniques, listening to Pops\u2019s traditions, adding his own more scientific methodology, running things by Dad. He loved the smell of the grapes in the fields, the twisting vines and miraculous clumps of gold, green and purple fruit, the cool damp of the barns and cellars where Blue Heron wine was stored and aged.</p><p>But almost as soon as they got home, the troubles began.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>ON THURSDAY, WITH a knifelike winter wind slicing off the lake, Jack went into the Cask Room, the stone basement where they stored the oak barrels filled with the red wines of Blue Heron. The cool walls, the distinctive smell of fieldstone, the dim lighting all spoke to the centuries-old art of wine making.</p><p>Time was the most important factor. In most things, he supposed. Too little time, and the wine wouldn\u2019t have the chance to mature and develop all the levels of taste and texture. Too much time, and the color would muddy and the flavor would fade.</p><p>Like Josh Deiner. Too much time without air. Too much time underwater.</p><p>One of the victims sustained a head injury and possible anoxic brain damage. He was the last one rescued.</p><p>That had been the report on the news. Jack had watched every minute of the coverage; he\u2019d programmed his DVR to catch every story, every mention, hoping for a hint of something positive for Josh. The kid wasn\u2019t dead. That was it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dead yet, that was. Nor had he improved.</p><p>Jack realized he was sweating, despite the coolness of the cellar. He really needed to get some sleep.</p><p>Two nights ago, he\u2019d come home from work to find his front door wide open and every light on; yet he had a clear memory of locking the door, as he did every morning, a leftover from living in Washington, D.C. When the hell had he gone upstairs and turned lights on up there? He had no clue, and it was unnerving. Jeremy Lyon, who was a family friend and a doctor, had called Jack to check on him; maybe Jack would ask for a prescription for a sleeping pill.</p><p>His phone buzzed with a text.</p><p>Thinking of u.</p><p>Hadley. Frankie had caved and given her sister the number, then called to apologize.</p><p>Hadley was the wine that hadn\u2019t aged enough\u2014bright and beautiful in color, vibrant and lively at first taste, and then the lingering tannin, the cottony, unpleasant feeling. Too much, too soon.</p><p>Dinner w/ me &amp; Frankie this week?</p><p>Playing the Frankie card so soon? Frankie sometimes came out to have dinner with Jack, sharing stories about school and herself and not mentioning her sister. She\u2019d called right after the news of the accident hit and sent him a few texts since then. Jack had always liked her.</p><p>He shoved the phone back in his pocket, pulled the plug on the side of the barrel and inserted the sampling tube. He let it fill and then poured the wine into the glass. Swirled and inhaled the scent, getting notes of blackberry, tobacco and leather. Nice. He took a sip. Nope, not ready yet. Too cottony.</p><p>The door at the top of the stairs opened, and his youngest sister came waddling down the stairs. Her giant golden retriever, Blue, followed, making a beeline for Jack\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cHello, you horny bastard,\u201d he said. The dog smiled up at him, happy dope that he was.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cHey. Should you be down here in your delicate condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have at least seven weeks to go. Also, Goggy brought in half a ton of grapes the day she went into labor with Dad, and Pru drove the grape harvester the day Ned was born, so I think I can handle the stairs.\u201d She handed him a foil-wrapped package. \u201cLemon cake from Mrs. Johnson. I was told not to eat any. It\u2019s so unfair, you being her favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help being perfect,\u201d he said in a pale imitation of his usual back-and-forth with his sisters. The cake was still warm. He\u2019d eat some later, maybe. Then again, his appetite hadn\u2019t been so good.</p><p>Faith sat at the old wooden table. \u201cCan I smell the wine, at least?\u201d</p><p>He handed her the glass, and she took a deep sniff of the wine. \u201cOh, nice. Leather and plum. This\u2019ll be great in a few months, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>She settled back in her chair and rested her hands on her bulging stomach. \u201cSo how are you doing these days, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Thanks.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to burden her with tales of limp, lifeless teenagers. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Faithie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You know, we all love you, even if you\u2019re a little prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m head winemaker for our family dynasty. You, on the other hand, plant pretty flowers.\u201d Faith was a landscape architect, and while he completely respected what she did, he wasn\u2019t about to tell her. It would throw off his big-brother coolness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore that.

The cop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Tell her yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooray!

That\u2019s what you love about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust obey me, okay? I\u2019m brewing you a nephew.\u201d She stood up and rubbed her lower back. \u201cYou like her, right? I mean, you\u2019ll be a good date and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She\u2019s the best right wing on the hockey team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen love to hear that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention it, then.\u201d He opened another barrel. \u201cAnything else, whoever you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Will you be the baby\u2019s godfather?\u201d</p><p>He did a double take. \u201cSure. Thanks, Faith.\u201d He went over and kissed her head. \u201cI guess I figured it would be Jeremy. Or Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy and Tom aren\u2019t my beloved, much-worshiped older brothers.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled, and this time, it felt genuine. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten how you told Megan Delgado that I had roundworm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I did you a favor,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cDid you? Because last time I looked, she was still incredibly gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of gorgeous women\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Speaking of gorgeous, I hear Hadley\u2019s back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she looking to reconcile?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cDid she see the rescue coverage or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He removed Blue from his leg. The dog looked a little blurry. That wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cJack, come on! I get enough one-word answers from Levi when he\u2019s grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. She saw something on the news and thought I might need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I need roundworm.\u201d His inner ear ached.</p><p>Faith smiled. \u201cSo you want Pru and Honor and me to go beat her up? We could bring Mrs. Johnson. She never liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>The water had been cold like he\u2019d never felt before. Cold enough that his bones hurt.</p><p>\u201cSo this wedding comes at a great time, then,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Jack gave his head a little shake. \u201cWhat wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Jeesh! The wedding you just said you\u2019d go to. Emmaline\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. I\u2019ll stop by the station. Now get out of here and go plan your next garden. I have wine to check.\u201d He paused. \u201cThanks for godfather. That means a lot, Faith. Tell Levi, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, giving him a hug.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d She always smelled like vanilla cookies or something, his youngest sister, and Jack hugged her back, the blurry, floating feeling fading a little.</p><p>Faith pulled back. \u201cOh! The baby just kicked. He knows his uncle Jack is here.\u201d She put his hand on her stomach, and Jack felt a strange, firm, wavelike motion.</p><p>His nephew. A little boy who\u2019d dig in the dirt and play with trucks and learn to drive the harvester years before he could drive a car, and when he did drive a car, his uncle Jack would put the fear of God in him, and that kid would never, ever, ever drink and drive and crash\u2014</p><p>He removed his hand and cleared his throat. \u201cGot any names picked out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sighed. \u201cLevi says whatever I want is fine, which makes me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeartless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It won\u2019t be John...I\u2019m saving that for you, so you can have John the Fifth. If you ever get married and produce the Holland grandchild. Not that Mrs. J. has been complaining about that or anything. Or Goggy. I was over at Rushing Creek today, and she said, \u2018Oh, sure, it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re having a baby, Faith, but I want a Holland baby to carry on the family name.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget my superior gene pool,\u201d Jack said. He paused. \u201cBut if you want to name the little guy John, go ahead, Faith. Dad would love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re John Noble Holland the Fourth. You get to have Number Five if you want. If you can trick some woman into marrying you, that is.\u201d Then, realizing that perhaps his marital state was a sore subject with his ex-wife in town, she added, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>His heart was beating way, way too fast. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Actually, do worry about it. Make me a cake or something, and I\u2019ll forgive you. Now get out of here. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Because a flashback was coming, and Jack wanted to be alone when it hit.</p><p>ON THE DAY the car went into the lake, Jack had been waiting twenty years to save a life.</p><p>For twenty years, he\u2019d never been in quite the right spot at quite the right moment. For twenty years, it seemed like he\u2019d always been five minutes too late or five minutes too early, just missing the chance to help.</p><p>For twenty years, he\u2019d had to live with the image of his youngest sister trapped in the crumpled wreck with their mother\u2019s body, and for twenty years, he\u2019d been waiting for the chance to make up for that. Not that the thought made sense\u2014he\u2019d been away in college when his mother had died, but the thought that his little sis had been alone, in shock, with no one to help for more than an hour...that his mother had had no one to hold her hand in her last moment...that no one had come to help for far too long... Of course it left a mark.</p><p>From that day on, Jack had been on alert. He joined the navy thinking he might try to become a SEAL, but Uncle Sam had other plans after seeing his test scores, so to the lab he went. It was fine; he still had to train, improved his swimming skills, get advanced scuba licenses\u2014open water diving and specialized rescue, black water search, whatever he could.</p><p>But that feeling never went away, even after his service was done.</p><p>Every time a car raced past him on the highway at ninety miles an hour, every time he saw a motorcyclist tearing around town without a helmet, the pictures would unfold. The accident. The victims. What he would do, how he would help, how he\u2019d make sure his own pickup truck was pulled safely off the road, how he\u2019d call 911 as he ran, how he\u2019d pull the driver from the car or out of the road and put pressure on the wounds until help came. He had a fire extinguisher in his car (didn\u2019t everyone?) and a window-breaking tool on his key chain, as well as a hammer in the glove box. Flares. A first aid kit, a really good flashlight (batteries changed twice a year), a seat-belt cutter and a blanket.</p><p>In the summer if he was down at the lake, he\u2019d count the kids in the water and check to make sure parents were alert and not too engrossed in their books or conversations or phone games. When the flight attendants went over safety procedures, Jack listened, then looked at his fellow passengers and noted who would need help should their plane land on the Hudson or in an Iowa cornfield.</p><p>As Honor said, a hobby was a hobby.</p><p>Jack put his training to work and became a volunteer rescue diver for the Manningsport Fire Department. He was certified for ice rescue and as a lifeguard. He was an EMT.</p><p>And still, he\u2019d never saved a soul. Last spring, when his grandparents\u2019 house had burned down, it was Honor who\u2019d done the heroics; Jack\u2019s house was way up on the ridge, about as far away from the Old House as you could get on Blue Heron land. By the time he\u2019d gotten down there, Honor had already saved their grandmother\u2019s life, with a little help from her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>But on January 12, Jack had gone down to the dock to take photos. He loved winter, loved the brilliant red sunsets at dusk and the cold wash of the Milky Way at midnight. From here, he could see the Crooked Lake to the east and all the way up to Blue Heron to the west. So around 4:30 p.m., he was taking photos of the fields where the snow and dormant vines stood in stark contrast to each other. The sky over Rose Ridge deepened, promising one of western New York\u2019s famous sunsets. There might even be the aurora borealis later on.</p><p>At times like this, the power of the land spoke to him. It wasn\u2019t just the fact that the Holland family had helped found this town, that his ancestors and grandparents and parents had worked this land. It was the area itself: the cold, deep lakes, the gorges and waterfalls, the fertile, rocky soil.</p><p>This kind of thing reminded him of how much he had. A family\u2014three married sisters, a niece and a nephew and another on the way. His father and stepmother. A job he loved. His, uh...his cat. His health. All that good stuff.</p><p>It was just that lately, Jack had been feeling a little...unfinished.</p><p>After twenty years of being a widower, Dad had gotten married last spring. Which was great, because Mrs. Johnson was the world\u2019s finest woman and had been like a surrogate mother since Jack\u2019s mom had died. Pru and Carl had been together for nearly twenty-five years. Honor and Faith both married recently. Goggy and Pops had recently fallen in love after sixty-five cantankerous years of marriage, thanks to the fire.</p><p>Jack...Jack had gotten divorced after eight months of marriage.</p><p>And then he heard the car. Judging from the sound of the engine, it seemed as if the car was going at least sixty miles an hour in a thirty-five-mile-an-hour zone.</p><p>He turned away from the water and waited, oddly calm. The car would crash. How could it not, going that fast?</p><p>Then again, he\u2019d had that same thought hundreds of times. Maybe thousands.</p><p>None of that ever happened, but the instinct\u2014to watch over, pay attention, be alert, be ready\u2014was a reflex. His rational brain knew how unlikely it was that what he feared and watched for would come to pass.</p><p>But he looked up the hill anyway. In another few seconds, he\u2019d be able to see the car as it came down the curve on Lake Shore Road, thirty feet up the hill from Keuka.</p><p>Later, when people heard about the accident, how Jack of all people happened to be there at that exact moment, they said the usual things\u2014everything happens for a reason, it was a miracle, God works in mysterious ways.</p><p>To Jack, however, it was more of a statistics thing. All these years not being there had to end eventually.</p><p>Almost automatically, he processed what might happen: the car swerving off the road as the driver tried to handle the curving road, the vehicle rolling over and over into Blue Heron\u2019s chardonnay vines, which were closest to the road. Or the car would smash into the same telephone pole he himself had scraped when he was sixteen.</p><p>Worse, the car would hit the big maple at the base of the entrance to Blue Heron. The driver was a teenage boy, Jack guessed, because there was no one on earth who believed in his driving skill and immortality more than a teenage boy.</p><p>Hopefully, everyone in the car was wearing a seat belt. The windows would be closed, since it was January, so no one would be thrown from the car. Going that fast, though, even with air bags...</p><p>The engine screamed with a downshift as the hotdogging kid played with his life.</p><p>And here it was. The screech of brakes applied too late. Jack tensed for the crunch of metal as the car rolled or hit a tree, the subsequent, constant blare of a horn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound came, but it wasn\u2019t what Jack expected.</p><p>Instead, there was a sharp, oddly clean noise, and Jack felt his mouth drop open as the car burst through the guardrail, snapping off the topmost branches of the hillside trees. It sailed over his head, its engine still revving, tires spinning. Jack had a detailed view of the chassis.</p><p>And then there was a tremendous whoosh as the car hit the water nose-first\u2014the lake wasn\u2019t frozen; it was too deep for that. There was a massive slosh, and a crow screeched from a tree and Jack saw the white, terrified faces of two boys. Yep, teenagers.</p><p>The car was a silver coupe. An Audi. The nose started to sink almost immediately, the headlights shining down into the lake. The sky was red and purple, helluva sunset, his boots were off and he was diving. He much would\u2019ve preferred to do this in August, and holy mother of God, the water was cold.</p> <p>For a second, the frigid shock slammed all other thoughts from his head as every muscle in his body contracted in shock even as he was cutting through the water (thank you, United States Navy; they\u2019d trained him to act first and think later).</p><p>His bones already hurt from the cold.</p><p>The boys were screaming, their voices muffled by the closed windows. Damn. The best thing would\u2019ve been if the windows were already open, giving them an exit. One boy was pounding it with his fist. Pointless, since that wouldn\u2019t break anything except a bone in his hand. The electrical must\u2019ve already gone out, if they couldn\u2019t get the windows down by pushing the button. Or they were just panicking and not thinking of it.</p><p>Now the boy was hitting the door with his shoulder. Also pointless with several tons of water pressing against the doors. No, they\u2019d have to break the windows and get out that way, or let enough water in to equalize the pressure and then open the door.</p><p>But they don\u2019t teach that in high school, and, yes, Jack thought he recognized one of the boys as a classmate of his niece, Abby. Seniors or thereabouts.</p> <p>The thoughts shot through his head rapid-fire.</p><p>The water would be flooding in through the front of the car.</p><p>They maybe had five minutes before the car was submerged. Maybe eight, but that\u2019d be pushing it. That is, eight for hypothermia. Obviously less time if they couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Jack\u2019s arms already felt heavy and dead. Not good. No, strike that, no negative thoughts permitted. Just move. He made it to the car, which was now halfway into the lake at a forty-five degree angle, the water up to the middle of the windows. Four boys, two in front, two in back, one with blood on his face. The driver was slumped over the wheel.</p><p>\u201cHelp us! Help!\u201d the bleeding boy pleaded, and it wasn\u2019t like Jack wasn\u2019t trying.</p><p>He fumbled in his jeans pocket for the window breaker he had on his key chain. Ten bucks on Amazon, and not only did he have one, but every member of his family did, too. His dexterity was off, thanks to the cold, his fingers clumsy and slow.</p> <p>One of the kids had his iPhone out. Good. Help would be on the way. Then again, by the time the fire department got here, the boys would be drowned. They\u2019d all drown, Jack included, or die of hypothermia. How many minutes had he been in the water? One? Two?</p><p>The car was slipping deeper.</p><p>There. His numb fingers closed around the little device. Pressed it against the window, his hands shaking hard, and it slipped right off.</p><p>\u201cHurry! Hurry!\u201d the bleeding boy screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d said another, oddly calm, voice muffled behind the glass.</p><p>Jack positioned the tool again, pushed hard and the window shattered, water rushing in.</p><p>The car immediately began sinking faster, but already, one boy was wriggling through the window. Jack grabbed the collar of his coat and hauled him out. Did the same with the second, the calm one, Sam Miller, that was his name. \u201cGet to the dock,\u201d he said. They were already swimming. They\u2019d make it.</p><p>The driver, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t moving, which was not good, and the bleeding boy was screaming. Should\u2019ve been out by now.</p> <p>The tail of the car slipped underwater with a gurgling sound.</p><p>And then it was quiet.</p><p>Jack grabbed on to the roof and went with the car, the water gripping his face and head with a fist of ice. Through the window, the boy grabbed on to his arms. Jack pulled him free, but it was hard, the car was tipping in the water, nose down, the headlights shining into the eerie dark water.</p><p>The boy was free, and Jack kicked his numb legs, hoping they were moving upward. His lungs burned; the rest of him was dead. Then they surfaced, and the air was so cold it hurt, but damn. The kid choked and gasped, still clutching Jack.</p><p>\u201cRelax and kick,\u201d Jack said, his lips hard with the cold, his breath clouding the air. The boy just grabbed Jack harder, so Jack looped his arm around the boy\u2019s neck and swam.</p><p>The dock was sixteen, twenty feet away, maybe. He could make it.</p><p>How many minutes had it been? Three? Five? More?</p><p>Sam was on the ladder of the dock, reaching out for them. He and the other boy grabbed their friend by the arm, silent with shock and shivering with cold.</p><p>Jack was already swimming away.</p><p>\u201cI can help!\u201d Sam called.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d Jack ordered.</p><p>He was also shivering. No, shuddering. This wasn\u2019t good. This was Hypothermia: Stop Fucking Around edition.</p><p>Still...what was the word? Still...survivable.</p><p>The last boy, the driver\u2014probably dead. Drowned, if not killed on impact. Jack himself would probably...what did they call it? Oh, yeah. Die trying.</p><p>It was getting hard to think. Advanced hypothermia.</p><p>So quiet now, the red sky above, the frigid water all around.</p><p>The cold didn\u2019t hurt so much.</p><p>The car\u2019s headlights were still on. Jack wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>A deep breath, a hard exhale, a deeper breath, and he was under again, swimming as hard as he could and still too slowly.</p><p>The car rested on the driver\u2019s side on the bottom of the lake. Ten feet deep, give or take. A fish swam in front of the headlights, then was gone into the darkness.</p><p>Jack tried to open the passenger door, but it was locked or jammed. But the window was smashed. The dashboard was still lit up. The clock said 4:41.</p><p>He reached in for the driver, who looked oddly peaceful, arms drifting, hair waving in the current. Eyes closed. Almost certainly dead. Not wearing a seat belt, a huge gash visible on his forehead, black against the white of his skin, blood trickling up in a dark, lazy swirl.</p><p>No bubbles, meaning he wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Jack reached for the boy\u2019s arm and pulled.</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Soon Jack would have to surface again or die down here. Which maybe wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Nice that he could see. Deep blue all around.</p><p>He pulled again. A little movement now, but Jack\u2019s chest was working, wanting to breathe, and if he didn\u2019t go up now, now, he\u2019d drown, navy or no navy.</p><p>His niece was eighteen, too.</p><p>He\u2019d want someone to try one more time for Abby.</p><p>He pulled as hard as he could, bracing his legs against the car, all the air in his lungs leaving in a bubbling rush.</p><p>And then they were moving, heading up, and how they were doing it, Jack didn\u2019t know because he couldn\u2019t think anymore, but they were making it, a centimeter at a time, and then there was the sky, red and purple and violently beautiful, and full of air, like icy needles in his lungs, but so, so good, the sound of his gasps tearing through the cold.</p><p>His gasps. Not the kid\u2019s.</p><p>He held on to the boy and tried to keep going. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was hard and sloppy and weak.</p><p>A siren screamed, then another. Police and firefighters, on their way.</p><p>The dock was still so far away. Jack closed his eyes, his head slipping again under the water. Shit. Kicked harder, his legs really just flailing now.</p><p>The boy was still and quiet. No breath, no coughing. No resistance.</p><p>Jack\u2019s labored panting rasped in and out of his aching lungs.</p><p>The water splashed, over and over, a hopeless, wet sound as his arm smacked lifelessly in a sorry imitation of swimming. He held on to the boy with his other arm, and God, it was hard.</p><p>Still not there. Still not there. In between each stroke, Jack\u2019s face dipped a little lower in the water. He choked on some water.</p><p>Still not there.</p><p>Then someone grabbed his arm. Sam Miller, clinging to the dock ladder, reaching out for him. God bless Sam Miller.</p><p>The other boys reached down and grabbed on to their unconscious (dead) friend, hauling him up the ladder, ice in their hair now. One of the boys was sobbing.</p><p>Sam reached down for Jack, pulling him up, which was good because Jack was not going to be able to make it out himself. Water streamed off him, and he fell onto his knees. \u201cOn his side,\u201d he managed, and they obeyed, turning the limp boy onto his left.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, Josh,\u201d the sobbing boy said. \u201cJosh, please.\u201d</p><p>Josh. Right. Josh Deiner. A troublemaker.</p><p>It was now too dark to see if any water had come out of Josh\u2019s mouth, up from his lungs. Jack pushed him on his back and started chest compressions. He couldn\u2019t feel his hands, but this was a brutish job, just push, push, push, elbows locked, fast and hard.</p><p>The sirens were louder.</p><p>Sam breathed into Josh\u2019s mouth.</p><p>One...two...three...four...five...</p><p>God, he was tired.</p><p>And then there were red-and-blue flashes, and footsteps thudded down the dock.</p><p>\u201cJack, we got this,\u201d said a voice. Levi. Emmaline Neal was there, too, another cop, a good hockey player. They knelt down and took over compressions.</p><p>There was a clattering, and Jessica Dunn and Gerard Chartier were running with the stretcher.</p><p>\u201cDry him off!\u201d someone ordered. \u201cHe has to be dry if we\u2019re gonna shock him.\u201d</p><p>There was a whole crowd now. The three boys were being wrapped in blankets and hustled away, their faces white in the gloom.</p><p>The sun was still setting. How could that be? It seemed as though hours had passed.</p><p>Someone put a blanket around Jack, too, then led him down the dock, arm around his waist, holding him when he staggered. The three boys climbed into the back of one of the town\u2019s two ambulances.</p><p>The other would be for Josh.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of the cold,\u201d said the person at his side. It was Emmaline. Huh. He thought she was back with Josh. She opened the door of her cruiser and gently pushed him in.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>She glanced down the dock. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead till he\u2019s warm and dead. You know that. Let\u2019s worry about you right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>She was about to close the door when Sam Miller came over. His face was ruddy now\u2014he was warming up. \u201cYou saved us,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cYou saved us all.\u201d</p><p>But Jack hadn\u2019t, because Josh Deiner\u2019s body was still on the dock, Levi and Gerard on their knees next to him as if in prayer.</p><p>THE MEDIA CALLED IT the Midwinter Miracle, going for alliteration over accuracy. And for a few days, it was big news. Anderson Cooper, among others, came to town and interviewed the three boys\u2014Sam Miller, Garrett Baines and Nick Bankowski, who were tremulous and fine, save for a broken nose on Nick. Their parents wept and called Jack a hero, an angel, the hand of God. A former navy SEAL was interviewed and attested that it was a \u201chelluva rescue.\u201d</p><p>As police spokesperson, Levi gave a statement, as well, and when Anderson asked if Jack was indeed his brother-in-law, Levi said, yes, he was. When asked to characterize Jack, Levi said, \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy.\u201d That was it, and Jack was grateful.</p><p>He himself was asked for interviews by fifty-seven media outlets. He didn\u2019t give any.</p><p>That night in the E.R., Jack\u2019s father hugged him for a long, long time. Pops\u2019s voice broke as he told Jack how proud he was. His sisters fussed over him and his niece wept, and his nephew got teary-eyed, as well. Mrs. Johnson made him his favorite dinners every night for the next week, as did his grandmother, not to be outdone. So there was a lot of food. Jack tried to eat it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josh Deiner was unavailable for comment, since he was in a coma.

The face of Josh\u2019s girlfriend as she sobbed on Anderson Cooper\u2019s shoulder. And the words Josh\u2019s mother had spat at him in the E.R. ran through his brain, over and over and over.</p><p>You left him for last.

He has beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>It was true. \u201cYeah, but look. Aggravated assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat rules him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fussy. All right, who\u2019s next?\u201d</p> <p>They both flinched at the next photo\u2014no teeth.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much fun,\u201d Carol said. \u201cSo much more interesting than real estate. Oh, that one\u2019s a hottie.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline clicked for more information. \u201cCurrently in federal prison. Damn! All the good-looking ones are behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Levi asked. Both women glanced at him, then looked back at the screen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a man for Em to take to the wedding,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cDid you input that report like I asked you to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Carol said blithely. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give me that look, Levi.

You call Faith twenty times a day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call Faith three or four times a day, as she\u2019s my wife and expecting a baby and it\u2019s the middle of winter and I want to make sure she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one! This one,\u201d Carol exclaimed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go out with him, I will.\u201d</p><p>Em looked. Yep, the guy was gorgeous, all black hair and green eyes opened a trifle too wide.</p><p>\u201cHe looks a little psychotic,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, who looks good in a mug shot?\u201d Carol asked. \u201cDon\u2019t be so picky. Even Robert Downey Jr. didn\u2019t look so hot, and please. That man could be eating a can of cat food and I\u2019d still want to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate talk for the workplace, Carol,\u201d Levi said. \u201cBesides, Officer Neal, I thought my brother-in-law was going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Jack? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith said she was asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Emmaline yelped. \u201cHow did she even know?\u201d</p><p>Levi gave her a martyred look. \u201cIt was announced at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s the other night. And it\u2019s all you talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. Also, I may have mentioned it in the hope that you\u2019d get your mind back on work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Who went on seven calls yesterday, huh? It wasn\u2019t Everett, let me tell you, Chief.\u201d Levi raised an eyebrow and waited. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go with Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carol asked. \u201cI\u2019d go with Jack. Jack\u2019s adorable. Those eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carol,\u201d came a new voice, and, shit, it was Jack himself. \u201cHey, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Sure, he spoke to her. Of course he did. He was nice. They played hockey together (along with ten or twelve other people). When he came into the station, which he did every once in a while to talk to Levi, he always said hello (and goodbye). If she saw him at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s he\u2019d say hello (and goodbye).</p><p>And, of course, the day of the Midwinter Miracle, he\u2019d asked if Josh was dead.</p><p>But now, as her potential date, it was different.</p><p>Jack folded his arms and looked down at her. \u201cFaith said you were looking for a date for a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just sit there like a lump,\u201d Carol hissed. \u201cSmile at him. Who else are you going to take? A convict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a problem with that ten seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile!\u201d</p><p>Emmaline tried to obey. Carol waited. Levi waited. Jack waited.</p><p>Had she mentioned he was extremely gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Em said. \u201cMaybe we could discuss this over a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet you at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s around six?\u201d That way she could get home, walk the puppy and give herself a pep talk.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Carol said. \u201cChange into something feminine. Wear perfume. Men love that. Don\u2019t they, Levi?\u201d</p><p>Emmaline left, glad for the brief drive home, which gave her time to think. She rolled down the window and let the frigid air cool her cheeks.</p><p>Yeah, fine. She\u2019d take Jack. Of course she would. When a Greek god said he\u2019d go to a wedding with you, a wedding where you desperately needed to appear over the groom, you didn\u2019t say no.</p><p>Even if it meant the loss of your dignity. Even if this was one cash transaction short of prostitution. The truth was, she\u2019d rather take a stranger, because, for some reason, that seemed like it\u2019d be easier to tolerate than a person who was so...nice. Who might (perish the thought) pity her.</p><p>She wondered why Jack was game. He sure as hell never asked her out. She wasn\u2019t even sure he knew she was female, for all the interest he\u2019d ever shown before.</p><p>But the day she\u2019d moved back to Manningsport, her heart raw and scraped by Kevin, a floating, terrified feeling enveloped her as she lugged boxes into her little house. The whole thing was surreal. Could this really be happening? She was moving here? Instead of getting married? It had been a wet day in April, cold rain pelting her, mocking the brave little pink buds on Nana\u2019s magnolia, and Em felt like she\u2019d never be warm again. She\u2019d never have Kevin next to her in bed again.</p><p>It was shocking.</p><p>No crying, she told herself. Just buck up. Big deal. You were dumped. Happens all the time.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop the hot tears from sliding down her cheeks.</p><p>Then a pickup truck stopped, and a man got out.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d he asked, and without waiting for an answer, he grabbed a box and carried it inside the little bungalow. \u201cI\u2019m Jack Holland,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family owns Blue Heron Vineyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline Neal,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes with her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to town.\u201d He smiled, kindly ignoring her tears (because if he was a serial killer, he wouldn\u2019t care about that\u2014he\u2019d just kill her and wouldn\u2019t that serve Kevin right), and went back to her Subaru for another box.</p><p>She remembered the Hollands; she\u2019d been a year ahead of Faith in school. Jack probably wasn\u2019t a serial killer. She would\u2019ve told him that she\u2019d lived here for four years, that she once played at his house as a kid. But heartbreak was swallowing her whole, and it was all she could do not to sob. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. She was supposed to be in Michigan with the love of her life. Her wedding was supposed to be in seven weeks.</p><p>Jack and she unloaded the rest of the boxes in silence. \u201cTake care,\u201d he said, then drove off.</p><p>Every time she saw him from then on, Jack Holland said hello. She briefly entertained a revenge fantasy in which he fell for her, and Kevin would be wild with jealousy and dump that horrible Naomi. But no. Jack got engaged shortly after Em moved to town, and then married.</p><p>He stayed nice. His wife was very friendly, too; Jack introduced them once at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Hadley seemed to be the epitome of girlie-girl\u2014she bought foamy coffee drinks, always wore a skirt or dress. When she was in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s she drank pink cocktails and nibbled lettuce leaves.</p><p>The town gossip said she wasn\u2019t good enough for Jack.</p><p>Turned out, it was true. When his marriage imploded, the gossip machine ran red-hot. Hadley had cheated on him, people said. Took up with the stockbroker who owned Dandelion Hill, who died (in the saddle, according to the rumors) shortly thereafter.</p><p>Even so, Jack stayed Mr. Nice Guy. Didn\u2019t get drunk, didn\u2019t pick up the many women who hit on him, didn\u2019t put his fist through a window.</p><p>As for Em, she just thought he was...nice. And, yes, beautiful. She checked him at hockey one night, a full-body slam, and for a second, they were tangled together, and it had been so long since Kevin, a full year and a half, that Emmaline had forgotten how it felt to be pressed up against a man, even if they were both clad in bulky protective gear and fighting for a puck. Then she was free, sailing down the ice again, wondering if Jack had felt anything, too.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Or if he did, he treated her as romantically as he treated Levi or Jeremy or Gerard, which was to say, nada.</p><p>Em walked the dog, smooched his cheeks, fed him and then walked to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s.</p><p>This was so embarrassing.</p><p>Jack was waiting just outside. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, opening the door for her.</p><p>The pub was about half-full: Colleen was kissing her husband; the Iskins were there, Lorena as loud as ever, Victor silent. The Meerings ignored each other, as usual. Cathy Kennedy and Louise Casco were deep in conversation. There were Bryce and Paulie, arm-wrestling at a table. The Knoxes waved\u2014Em had been out to round up their chickens from the road just that morning.</p><p>Emmaline went to a booth in the back and took off her coat. Crap. She\u2019d forgotten to change. Most nights, she went from her uniform to her pj\u2019s. Well, it didn\u2019t matter. Besides, she loved her uniform. Especially her weapon. And Taser.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys. What can I get you?\u201d Hannah O\u2019Rourke asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer. Cooper\u2019s Cave IPA?\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cSame for me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, kids.\u201d Hannah waltzed away.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything. Smiled at her, which made her stomach hurt. \u201cUm, do you want dinner?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said.</p><p>Hannah returned with their drinks. \u201cAnything to eat tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope, we\u2019re good,\u201d Jack said with a friendly smile. \u201cThanks, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let me know if you need a refill.\u201d The waitress went to check on another table. She was pretty. Maybe Jack and she should hook up.</p><p>Get to it, Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so here\u2019s the deal,\u201d she said. She drained half her beer, then wiped her mouth with a napkin. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 is getting married, and I don\u2019t want to go alone, but I certainly can go alone. My sister and parents will be there, and, actually, Colleen and Lucas, too, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be a pariah or a laughingstock, and I\u2019m not going to set myself on fire or burst out sobbing during the ceremony or anything like that. I just would like to have a date, sort of a human shield. But I can take a friend if you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were friends,\u201d Jack said mildly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah. Sure.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut listen, Jack. You don\u2019t have to go. I imagine it\u2019s been a pretty rough couple of weeks for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go. Thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually didn\u2019t ask. You offered.\u201d And now she sounded like a shrew. \u201cOr your sister asked, but I didn\u2019t ask her to ask you.\u201d Stop talking, her brain advised. Her mouth didn\u2019t obey. \u201cMy point is, you don\u2019t have to come. I mean, yeah, it\u2019d be nice to go with a guy who looks like a Greek god\u2014\u201d here he smiled \u201c\u2014but I\u2019m not one of those women who\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit on corned beef. It was Hadley. The beautiful ex-wife with the wicked cool name.</p><p>\u201cI saw you sitting here and just thought I\u2019d come over and say hey.\u201d</p><p>She was gorgeous. Em had forgotten just how much. Crikey. Emmaline practically had a crush on her, she was so flippin\u2019 beautiful. She smelled fantastic, too. Huge brown eyes, silky blond hair, pink cheeks, heart-shaped face, full, soft lips. She wore a soft green knit dress, tan leggings and cool suede ankle boots on her tiny little feet. Em guessed that her own h*ps were about twice the width of Hadley\u2019s. In fact, if Hadley turned around, Em wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see wings sprouting from her shoulders, the better for her to flutter away to sprinkle fairy dust.</p> <p>\u201cHadley.\u201d Jack stood up, towering over her. \u201cThis is my friend, Emmaline Neal. Emmaline, you might remember my ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>The blonde gave her a sunny smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cHadley Holland. So nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>So she hadn\u2019t dropped the last name. Interesting. \u201cWe\u2019ve met, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we? I\u2019m so sorry. I see you\u2019re a police officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emmaline said.</p> <p>\u201cI always admire women who can go into a male-dominated field. Me, I\u2019d never last! I guess I\u2019m just not tough enough. I can\u2019t imagine having to run after a criminal and tackle him. My goodness! You must be so strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, bless your heart, no!\u201d Hadley laughed merrily. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m an interior decorator. No guns or tackling involved in that! More like painting and fabric choices, making a house into a home.\u201d</p><p>Em had to admire the skill with which Hadley had just drawn the line. Hadley\u2014delicate and artistic. Emmaline\u2014manly and brutish.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Hadley?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI was just...checking in, I guess,\u201d Tinkerbell said now. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Jack?\u201d She gave his arm a squeeze. Nice manicure.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d His face was completely neutral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that.\u201d Hadley smiled (beautifully, tragically). A Yankee would\u2019ve recognized Jack\u2019s response as the cold shoulder, but Hadley was Southern, and Southerners could make conversation with a block of wood, it seemed. \u201cJack, I talked to Frankie today. You know how she just adores you. Even more now, after your big save. Why, she was bragging to all her friends that you\u2019re her brother-in-law!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-brother-in-law,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, she doesn\u2019t think of you as an ex anything,\u201d Hadley said smoothly. \u201cBut shoot, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt y\u2019all\u2019s evening. Jack, I\u2019ll call you about having dinner. Bye, Evelyn! So nice to meet you!\u201d</p><p>With that, Hadley fluttered her fingers and floated away. Jack sat back down and took a sip of beer. Emmaline noted he hadn\u2019t turned down the dinner invitation.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s another thing. The wedding\u2019s Saturday. It\u2019s in Malibu, so of course I\u2019ll pay for your plane fare and hotel and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying for your flight, Jack, or you\u2019re not going.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cFine. So we\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll pretend to be your boyfriend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cNo. Like I said, I just want a pal.\u201d She sighed, then rubbed her eyes. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to come, Jack. Allison Whitaker would love nothing more than to leave her kids and come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to go with a guy, or else you wouldn\u2019t have been looking at mug shots with Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. If I take Allison, my parents will never believe I\u2019m straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I was engaged to the groom, okay? I\u2019m straight!\u201d Must use inside voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just...they think I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t looking at her. His gaze was on Hadley, who was perched alone at the bar, trying to get Colleen\u2019s attention. \u201cExcuse me a second,\u201d he said and got up from the table. He went over to Colleen, said something and then came back. Colleen sighed hugely, then pulled out a menu, went to Hadley and handed it to her.</p><p>Based on her excellent powers of deduction, Emmaline would guess that Colleen was ignoring the former Mrs. Jack Holland, and Jack had just asked her to knock it off.</p><p>So. The Princess of Beautiful Land was back in town and sprinkling her fairy dust on Jack. And while everyone knew Hadley had cheated on him, men were generally stupid about things like this. People who looked like Hadley (and Naomi Norman, for that matter) got away with some very stinky crap.</p><p>\u201cSo when do we leave?\u201d Jack asked, sliding back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cThursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursday\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cOkay. Thank you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. It\u2019ll be nice to go somewhere warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalibu is beautiful. Every day of the year, more or less.\u201d</p><p>He finished his beer. \u201cSend me the info on the flight and hotel so I can make a reservation, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it for you. You\u2019re not spending one thin dime on this trip.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her so suddenly that it was like being wrapped in a warm, soft blanket. \u201cAnd blah blah blah blah,\u201d he said. Well, he probably said actual words, but Em couldn\u2019t quite hear at the moment, as she was rendered close to death by the beauty of that smile, those crinkling, pure blue eyes, the tousled blond hair, the...the...the glory that was Jack Holland.</p><p>Then he stood up, squeezed her shoulder and left, waving at the O\u2019Rourke twins and nodding at his ex-wife, who positively beamed and fluttered, butterfly-like, back at him.</p><p>Which took away some of the glow.</p><p>Even so, it was a good five minutes before Emmaline trusted herself to stand up.</p><p>Do not fall for this guy, she warned herself. Very sternly.</p><p>But her shoulder still buzzed from the warmth of his hand.</p><p>This was a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cLET ME DO that for you.\u201d Jack gave his date his very best stern big-brother stare. It didn\u2019t work. It never did, now that he thought about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I can put my own stupid suitcase away.\u201d Someone was in a foul mood, but he couldn\u2019t blame her, given their destination. There was a pause. \u201cNo, thanks, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get that,\u201d said a flight attendant, wrestling the bag away from Emmaline. \u201cHave a seat, and I\u2019ll be right back with some champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d Emmaline hissed.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m six-three and the seats in coach only fit very skinny dwarves,\u201d he said, sinking into the leather seat.</p><p>\u201cFine. But why did you upgrade me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not a skinny dwarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an insult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? Would you like to be a skinny dwarf? Because even though you\u2019re acting like Grumpy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Fine. I\u2019ll sit here. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. It\u2019s first class. Relax, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>She flopped into the seat, and Jack had to smile. She was so far from relaxed it was almost funny.</p><p>For himself, he was downright thrilled about this wedding. He loved Kevin and the bride for having a wedding, for inviting Emmaline to bring a date, loved that it was across the entire continent. He hadn\u2019t felt this good since before the accident. He\u2019d be away from people wanting to shake his hand and buy him beers, from the food that Sam Miller\u2019s mom kept bringing over, from the hospital parking lot, from his well-meaning but omnipresent family, from Hadley popping up every other day. If his seatmate was grumpy, that was a small price to pay.</p><p>The flight attendant came by with two glasses of champagne. \u201cThanks,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d She smiled at both of them. \u201cAre you a nervous flyer?\u201d she asked Em.</p><p>\u201cI am today,\u201d she answered, chugging her champagne. \u201cOh, shit! I forgot my hair slime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely they have stores in L.A.,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot this stuff. I order it online. From Sicily. It\u2019s hard-core. Sicily understands hair frizz. You can\u2019t even buy it in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade with angel wings and freckles?\u201d</p><p>She took his champagne and drained that, too. \u201cAnd the blood of infant fairies, yes.\u201d</p><p>The flight attendant kept up with her unflagging, slightly creepy smile. \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything else I can get you.\u201d She moved down the row.</p><p>Emmaline fiddled with her phone and rebuckled her seat belt a few times. Pulled out her hair elastic and then put her ponytail back in. Opened the shade. Closed the shade. Tried to put her champagne flute in the seat pocket. Put it on her tray. Took it off her tray.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop fidgeting, please?\u201d he said, taking the glass from her. \u201cJust calm down. Your hair will be fine. We\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair will not be fine, Jack. And this is my ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding. It will be as fun as a hanging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food will be better, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. They\u2019re vegans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you tell me. When I\u2019m trapped on a plane.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline was pretty enough when she smiled, Jack thought. Granted, she looked a little on the homeless side at the moment\u2014scraggly hair and no makeup, gray sweats that screamed don\u2019t look at me\u2014I\u2019m sexless.</p><p>He wondered if she was. She always seemed pretty sparky to him. Granted, his contact with her had been limited to \u201cHi, Em/Bye, Em\u201d at the police station or O\u2019Rourke\u2019s and the occasional body check during a hockey game (much more fun than checking Gerard Chartier), but she seemed to have a little something going on.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know each other that well, do we?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d She started fiddling with the tray back again, so he took her hand.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re flying off to face the firing squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a cakewalk compared to this.\u201d</p><p>The plane began taxiing down the runway. Emmaline took her hand away so she could clench the armrests. \u201cSo do you like having sisters?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have one. Angela. You\u2019ll like her. She\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d Her knuckles were white.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the bride and groom,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cRight. Kevin Bates and Naomi Norman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Norman-Bates wedding?\u201d</p><p>Another smile tugged at her lips. She had a pretty mouth, pink and full and sweet.</p><p>Ah. She was talking, her words rapid-fire. \u201cYeah. So, he was my boyfriend from eighth grade on. We went to the same college and lived together and seemed pretty happy, more or less. I was, anyway. Then he fell for someone else and...that was that.\u201d She shrugged and looked out the window.</p><p>Jack had grown up around females. He\u2019d been the date for a lot of women in the past few years. Actually, he\u2019d always been good for that sort of thing. He\u2019d asked Eve Mikkes to the prom many years ago because Eve was nice and funny and had been in a fire when she was younger, which had left some pretty severe scars on her face and hands. He\u2019d gone to five high school reunions in the past few years, three weddings and a fiftieth wedding anniversary. He had the aforementioned sisters.</p><p>So he recognized a woman who\u2019d had her heart broken.</p><p>\u201cThe love of your life, huh?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at him, then returned her gaze to the clouds. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand once more and squeezed it. \u201cStick with me, kid. I promise you we\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>EMMALINE MET THE ONE in eighth grade during dodgeball, a game that further proved that gym teachers hated children. A few years before, someone\u2019s parents had sued the school to eliminate dodgeball, but then someone else\u2019s countersued to have it reinstated, and while there was currently a lawsuit to have it banned once more, the dreaded sport was still allowed, apparently, because Ms. Goldberg was smiling her snakelike evil grin and fondling her whistle.</p><p>Bad enough that Emmaline was already a target of her classmates. She didn\u2019t need to be pelted with red rubber balls. But worse than that, as everyone knew, was the choosing of the teams.</p> <p>She tried to look nonchalant and unconcerned, even as her palms sweated and her heart thudded, as the horrible ritual began. Lyric Adams (daughter of a middle-aged rock star and his fourth wife) and Seven Finlay (son of an award-winning British actress and her third husband) were the popular kids, and anointed by Ms. Goldberg to do the honors of bolstering or destroying the egos of their classmates, one by one.</p><p>\u201cIreland,\u201d Lyric called, and Ireland, who was the daughter of big-deal producers, bowed her head graciously as if accepting her own statue and cantered over to her best friend\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cMilan,\u201d Seven countered.</p><p>Most of Emmaline\u2019s classmates were named for a place\u2014in addition to Milan, there were two Parises, three Londons, a York, a Dallas and a Boston. It sounded more as if Lyric and Seven were in a geography bee than gym class, but hey. Emmaline wasn\u2019t kidding herself. She would\u2019ve loved a cool name. Would\u2019ve loved to have been one of the popular kids, even though she recognized their cruelty. She would\u2019ve settled for less, even...would\u2019ve loved to have been able to turn to the new boy and make a joke about all the map names and how the two of them were outcasts because of it.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t possible, however.</p> <p>\u201cJupiter!\u201d Lyric called with a hair toss.</p><p>\u201cDiesel,\u201d Seven countered.</p><p>Her fellow pariah had moved from a town that most of Em\u2019s classmates had never heard of...Tacoma or something. His parents didn\u2019t work in the entertainment industry, and he was therefore already marked as an undesirable. Also, he had a human name, which didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Kevin. Kevin Bates.</p><p>Kevin was also\u2014insert dramatic pause\u2014fat.</p><p>In Malibu, it was far more socially acceptable to be a he**in addict or murderer than to be overweight. When he walked into Algebra, Emmaline\u2019s classmates stared at him as if he had a nipple growing out of his chin. To be fair, many of them had never seen a fat person in real life. Not in Malibu. Not on the pristine beaches or exclusive mountains where their families cavorted. Being fat? Who would\u2019ve dared?</p> <p>Why hadn\u2019t his parents sent him in for gastric bypass? A tummy tuck or lipo? At the very least, why not a fat camp? Surely if there had been a surgery to fix Em\u2019s problem, her parents would have jumped on it. Why not fix something that made life so hard? In Malibu, it seemed that imperfect children were tossed into the ocean, or sent to live in a more normal state.</p><p>On his first day, the teacher asked Kevin to tell the class about himself and the other kids had peppered him with questions... Granted, he was fat, but that would be tolerated if he was, say, Steven Spielberg\u2019s son.</p><p>Kevin\u2019s mother was an accountant; his father was a computer programmer.</p><p>The death knell. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if Kevin\u2019s mom won the Nobel in economics or his father invented time travel; it didn\u2019t matter that his parents happened to make a very comfortable living. Kevin didn\u2019t have dinner with movie stars, he didn\u2019t come to school in a limo and he was fat. He was no one, buh-bye.</p><p>Em knew the feeling. She wasn\u2019t fat. She wasn\u2019t tiny, either, by SoCal standards; she was solid, lacking mouselike bone structure or an eating disorder. But her problem wasn\u2019t her size.</p><p>It was her stutter.</p><p>Words had always fought her. Years and years of speech therapy hadn\u2019t done much. The only way she got past it was if she was relaxed or spontaneous or had a patient audience, and even then it was a struggle.</p><p>And patience wasn\u2019t a quality associated with children. Not being able to get out an answer, not being sure if her throat would lock and the horrible sounds would start and stop, start and stop as her classmates watched in gleeful horror... It made her an easy target.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t matter that Emmaline got her black belt in aikido at the age of eleven. That she was great at sports. That she was tall and smart and, except for class participation, got really good grades. Her classmates were led by the mean popular kids, vampires who only seemed happy if they were feeding off someone else\u2019s misery.</p><p>When they were smaller, Em got into a lot of fights, back in the good old days when \u201cacting out\u201d was more acceptable. In fifth grade, however, Asia Redding\u2019s parents had threatened to sue the Neals after Emmaline had pushed Asia at recess. Never mind that Asia had been mercilessly mocking Em\u2019s stutter for years.</p><p>Emmaline\u2019s defense had been to pretend (miserably) not to care. She mastered the dead-eyed stare and wore Doc Martens and black clothes. She learned sign language for the rude phrases her stutter wouldn\u2019t let her say.</p><p>Her parents told her to laugh it off or ignore it. But her parents were child psychologists, so they had no idea how kids really acted. At least pretending to be tough protected her from having the mean kids know how much it hurt.</p><p>Next to her, Kevin heaved a sigh. Emmaline sneaked a look. His expression was amused and tolerant. He glanced at her, and his mouth pulled up in a smile. \u201cSucks to be us, huh?\u201d he said.</p><p>Us. That had a nice sound to it.</p><p>\u201cChord,\u201d Seven called.</p><p>\u201cBirch,\u201d Lyric said.</p><p>\u201cGuess his parents hated kids,\u201d Kevin murmured. \u201cBirch? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>A smile started in Emmaline\u2019s chest. There was something about Kevin. He had...swagger. Here he was, fat in the land where sixteen-year-old girls got breast implants for their birthdays, where boys had personal trainers and professionally done highlights before they started high school. Fat? Fat? It was a rejection of the very fabric of society. Almost James Dean in terms of rebellion.</p><p>Kind of thrilling, really.</p><p>\u201cJourney.\u201d This was said with a sigh, as Journey was the product of a first marriage whose parents were still together, and therefore not nearly as cool as the other kids. Not on Emmaline\u2019s and Kevin\u2019s level, but still pretty far down. Also, he was named after a band and not a place, so...</p><p>Now there were only two of them left.</p><p>Emmaline sneaked another look at Kevin.</p><p>He looked back. Rolled his eyes. Not at her...at this, the horrible ritual of crushing the human spirit. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cKevin, I guess,\u201d Lyric said. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Seven said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck with Eh-eh-eh-Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>Em glanced toward Ms. Goldberg, who was jotting notes on her clipboard, pretending not to have heard. She wouldn\u2019t chastise Seven, Em knew. And Em wouldn\u2019t be able to tell her about it.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Kevin muttered, then sighed and walked over to join his teammates, Gulliver among the Lilliputians.</p><p>That day at recess, Kevin waited for her by the door. \u201cWant a Twinkie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She took the strange, tubular cake in wonder. Her parents were on a macrobiotic kick these days, tragically. \u201cTh-thanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo you stutter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cS-s-somet-t-t-times.\u201d Most times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fat,\u201d Kevin said.</p><p>He had beautiful dark eyes\u2014amazing eyelashes\u2014and curly black hair. If you looked closely, he wasn\u2019t really that fat. Husky, that was the word. And, yes, soft. But he was tall, about the same height as she was, and the truth was, he was kind of...handsome.</p><p>\u201cWant to be friends?\u201d he asked, so of course she fell for him.</p><p>Around Kevin, her stutter wasn\u2019t quite so pronounced, and when it did come up, he waited. Not like her parents, who stared at her, waiting, waiting, waiting. Maybe if they hadn\u2019t been riddled with PhDs and gurgling with words like transference and empowerment and self-actualization, Em would\u2019ve felt a little less freakish.</p><p>Mom and Dad knew exactly what the recommended method was for dealing with a stutterer (or a nonfluent speaker, as they liked to call her). \u201cWe have all the time in the world,\u201d Mom would say. That was another thing. There was always a we. There was never I. \u201cDon\u2019t feel pressured. We\u2019ll wait as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>Which made the stutter even worse. Their take on her speech impediment was relentless reframing (Em knew all the terms). \u201cWe love your stutter, because we love you!\u201d Dad said once, which was just ridiculous.</p><p>She hated the stutter. She pictured it as a skeleton dressed in a black suit, rising up, wrapping its sharp, hard fingers around her vocal cords and squeezing, smiling as it did.</p><p>Kevin got it. He liked himself; he didn\u2019t like being fat. He liked her; he didn\u2019t like her stutter.</p><p>They kissed for the first time in April of eighth grade, when they\u2019d been friends for months. His lips were soft, and he didn\u2019t do anything more than just kiss her...no tongue, no groping. It was lovely. He smiled afterward. \u201cWant to go to the movies this weekend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you want to see?\u201d</p><p>Not one stutter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the idea that the two freaks of eighth grade were dating was deeply offensive to their beautiful, oddly named classmates. The bullying got worse. Emmaline found a used condom in her locker, such a disgusting sight that her throat locked for the entire day. One day when she went into music class, all the other girls burst out laughing for no apparent reason. Someone put a pregnancy test in her backpack, which caused her mother to deliver a lecture on sex and readiness, ignoring Emmaline\u2019s protest that she and Kevin had kissed and that was it.</p><p>But it was when Lyric threw a lit match at her in science class that shit got serious, as the saying went. The match went out before it landed in her hair, thankfully, and Emmaline shoved Lyric, who then screamed as if she were being chased by cannibals. Em was suspended for a week. Worse, she had to apologize to her bully, and, no, a note wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>But she had Kevin.</p><p>Then came the news. Kevin got into his dad\u2019s alma mater boarding school. In Connecticut. Kevin was wise beyond his years, it seemed; he knew they were only fourteen. Of course he\u2019d be going.</p><p>Her only true friend. The boy she loved.</p><p>She sat down at her computer at home and wrote her parents a letter. She wanted to go live with Nana and go to high school there, because she just couldn\u2019t keep fighting the good fight.</p><p>Nana, her mother\u2019s mother, lived in Manningsport, New York, a lovely little town on a big lake where Em spent each summer. Nana was the epitome of a grandmother\u2014she cooked, she clucked, she cuddled. Those summer weeks were fantastic, filled with plenty of gluten and red meat and sugary desserts. Bike rides and morning swims in the chilly lake, hikes and waterfalls and visits to the candy store. Nana even invited a couple of other girls over to play, and, unlike the Malibu crowd, these girls seemed nice. When one heard her stutter the first time, she put her hand on Em\u2019s arm and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have epilepsy, so I\u2019m different, too.\u201d</p><p>Em stuttered less there. Still stuttered a lot, but not as much.</p><p>Her parents were all too supportive of the idea of her moving.</p><p>\u201cVery empowering,\u201d Mom said, pretending she had something in her eye.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat. \u201cThis is a healthy decision. We support you.\u201d</p><p>All three of them knew they couldn\u2019t fix her or her problems.</p><p>In a sense, she was running away, but the idea of leaving her mean-spirited peers filled her with such relief and excitement that she didn\u2019t care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The kids in Manningsport viewed a native Californian as exotic and fascinating, not minding that she didn\u2019t talk a lot and, when she did, viewing her stutter as a little bit glamorous.</p><p>Em\u2019s relationship with her parents improved, too; she had more to say, not having to look into their faces; the phone and email made communicating a lot easier. And telling them that she, who had never joined any school club before, was now on the hockey team and in chorus, because singing didn\u2019t awaken the stutter like talking did... Well, she could hear their relief.</p><p>Nana\u2019s house was a cozy bungalow with clever little cupboards and wide windowsills, and a stained glass window on the way up the stairs. In the nice weather, Nana sat on the sweet little front porch, chatting with passersby (which just didn\u2019t happen where Em was from), sometimes inviting a neighbor to come up and have a glass of wine or iced tea. Em\u2019s grandfather had died when she was small, and Nana had the occasional date, which Emmaline thought was adorable.</p><p>And it was nice being useful to Nana, shoveling the sidewalk and scraping the car, running to the grocery store three blocks away. Em was needed. It was a great feeling. Sometimes schoolmates would come over to hang out and study and eat Nana\u2019s fabulous desserts.</p> <p>Another benefit of living in New York\u2014she could be closer to Kevin.</p><p>They were still hours apart, but they planned it carefully; if her grandmother would drive her down to Connecticut once in October and once in February (and Nana would\u2014she was a big believer in romance), and Kevin and Em both went home for Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring break, then they could see each other almost every month. They wrote, emailed, talked on the phone, and it was always the same, always great. Kevin was funny and nice and...safe. He would never make fun of her. Never reject her.</p><p>In February of that first school year, Em got a call from her mom.</p><p>\u201cWe have a wonderful, wonderful surprise for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a big sister! Here. Want to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-w-what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d came a voice. \u201cIt\u2019s Angela.\u201d</p><p>And so she had a sister. Angela Amarache Demeku Neal, adopted from Ethiopia. Her name, roughly translated, meant angelic, beautiful, brightly shining champion.</p><p>Emmaline meant little rival. Also laborious. Her middle name was Mara, which meant bitter.</p><p>Only child psychologists could mess with their kid\u2019s head like this.</p><p>Angela was ten years old. Her biological parents had died long ago, and she\u2019d been raised in an orphanage. She was very nice. And smart\u2014she could speak three languages. And beautiful, even at ten, big exotic eyes and long graceful limbs. She was extraordinarily polite and called their parents Mama and Papa, with the emphasis on the second syllable, so much more aesthetically pleasing than plain old Mom and Dad.</p><p>It was hard not to feel a little...replaced. Her parents would call to list Angela\u2019s accomplishments and qualities. Sometimes, Em wondered if they were punishing her for living with Nana, but they did seem to genuinely adore Flawless Angela. Who wouldn\u2019t? Angela loved nothing more than the times Em was home on break. She\u2019d leave bouquets of flowers on Em\u2019s pillow, tuck little notes into her suitcase. For that first Christmas with the Neals, she made Emmaline a beautiful scarf she\u2019d woven herself in the Ethiopian tradition.</p> <p>So sure, Emmaline loved her little sister. She didn\u2019t get to see her much, and it took some getting used to, but Angela was great.</p><p>In the meantime, she and Kevin stayed together. With him, Emmaline felt most like herself\u2014her wisecracking jokes didn\u2019t get so strangled by the stutter. With him, she could drop the tough act and relax a little. Even though the kids in Manningsport were nicer, Em was still on guard. She had trust issues, according to her parents.</p><p>But with Kevin, she was normal. All through high school, their romance continued. They both went to the University of Michigan. And then, one day during her sophomore year, something miraculous happened.</p><p>In Shakespearean Tragedy, the professor told the students they\u2019d be reading aloud, just a few lines each.</p><p>Emmaline\u2019s heart sank. Her stutter had quieted down over the years, but it was still there, especially when she was forced to perform. Her heart thudded, and she could barely see the passage from King Lear. Morgan, the boy who sat in front of her, was a drama major, and he read in a beautiful British accent, quite embracing the part of Bad Guy Edmund.</p><p>Then came Em\u2019s turn\u2014King Lear with the body of his beloved daughter. The most important part of the play. The stutter rubbed its bone hands together in glee. Her classmates waited.</p><p>She closed her eyes, imagined herself as Sir Ian McKellen, then looked at her book and read.</p><p>\u201cHowl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:</p> <p>Had I your tongues and eyes, I\u2019d use them so</p><p>That heaven\u2019s vault should crack. She\u2019s gone for ever!\u201d</p><p>The stutter\u2019s jawbone dropped in shock.</p><p>Her words had come out with a British accent, too, and she hadn\u2019t stuttered once.</p><p>\u201cNice, Emmaline,\u201d the professor said. \u201cMeggie, take it up.\u201d</p><p>Em noticed that her hands were shaking, and a strange sensation filled her chest.</p><p>It was joy.</p><p>From then on, if she felt her throat lock up, she\u2019d imagine the words in an accent, and her brain and throat detoured around the stuck sounds like a car veering around a roadblock. After all those years, her problem, which had made her so miserable, such an outcast, was gone. When she told her parents, they were quiet for a minute. Stunned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou must feel very empowered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad for you,\u201d Dad said from the other phone (they always talked jointly).</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting a divorce, by the way,\u201d Mom said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be living together. Nothing will change for Angela. Or you, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>One day about a month later, she and Kevin were at his off-campus apartment, lying in his queen-size bed. He was quiet.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>After a long minute, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t stutter anymore.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, not wanting to jinx it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We both had a...thing...when we first met. And now yours is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You never know.\u201d She paused, feeling almost guilty. \u201cI feel it there. Like it\u2019s lurking, waiting to come back.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWell. It\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been nice, she thought later as she walked through the bitter wind to her dorm, if he\u2019d been thrilled. After all, few knew better than Kevin how the stutter had paralyzed her, marked her, locked her in an invisible prison.</p><p>But she understood. He was afraid.</p><p>Kevin, you see, hadn\u2019t lost the thing that had made him an outcast. He was still fat. He was, in fact, obese. When she\u2019d met him, he was perhaps thirty pounds overweight. He\u2019d gained possibly fifty more pounds at Choate.</p><p>The weight kept on coming in college.</p><p>Though he never told her what he weighed, she guessed he was at least a hundred pounds above where he should be.</p><p>Maybe more.</p><p>They never talked about him losing it. With other people, Kevin cheerfully acknowledged that he was fat, or \u201ca big guy.\u201d He loved food, loved to eat, and he didn\u2019t just eat junk food and pizza (though he didn\u2019t abstain from those, either). He\u2019d cook for her, and, yes, his portion would be huge. But Em loved to eat, too, and the last thing she wanted to do was pass judgment or make him feel unattractive. Kevin knew he was heavy. It wasn\u2019t a secret.</p><p>Besides, she loved him. Truly was attracted to him. His dark eyes were so beautiful, his smile and laugh were totally infectious and he was a great kisser.</p><p>But as college passed and he started law school and continued to gain weight, she worried.</p><p>They both went home to Malibu for the holidays that year, and Kevin had to buy an extra seat on the plane. His face was fiery with embarrassment, but the thing was, he really did take up two seats.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak the entire flight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna join a gym when we get back,\u201d he said in the car.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she answered calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll join, too, if you want. It\u2019d be good for both of us.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>And join they did. Kevin went once. Em went five times, then stopped, worried that it wasn\u2019t helping. Besides, she ran five miles a few times a week, even in the winter. As ever, she was a strapping woman; she\u2019d topped out at five-ten and had muscles and an ass and some padding. Here in a normal state, her size ten (and sometimes twelve) was deemed quite average. In Malibu, the size \u201cLarge\u201d didn\u2019t fit her.</p><p>Kevin graduated from law school and accepted a very decent offer from a big firm. They both stayed in Ann Arbor, that lovely little city. Em had a pleasant job at a newspaper, trying to put her English major to work by writing obituaries, checking movie schedules and, later, doing some features.</p><p>It was oddly thrilling to be able to order a drink and pay bills, talk about coworkers and go shopping for a couch. Both of them liked their jobs and got promoted, moved to a nicer apartment and seemed well on their way to becoming full-fledged adults.</p><p>Kevin proposed at an Italian restaurant over eggplant parm and garlic bread, getting down on one knee and presenting her the ring. She said yes instantly and kissed him. Had to give him a hand getting up, but she covered well, pulling him into a hug. The other restaurant patrons clapped politely, but Em saw a few puzzled looks.</p><p>He\u2019s wonderful, you jerks, she thought even as she smiled. He\u2019s the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever known.</p><p>And he was.</p><p>He was also lazy, unhealthy and could easily leave her a widow.</p><p>So Emmaline made the mistake that changed her life.</p><p>She joined SweatWorld, the gym nearest their apartment. She\u2019d never liked gyms, preferring to run. But Kevin hated running (not that he\u2019d tried it in the past decade).</p><p>So SweatWorld it was, one of those horrible places with too-loud music and mirrors and complicated machines.</p><p>Her plan was to learn what she could and then gently suggest that he give it a try, using the wedding as motivation. They\u2019d set their wedding date for June, and it was August now. Almost a year to get healthy, and then to stay healthy, because Emmaline had loved this guy since she was in eighth grade, and she wasn\u2019t about to lose him.</p><p>But boy, she hated going to the gym. All that sweat, the smell of bleach-soaked wipes that people used to swab down their machines, the clack of weights and the grunts of humans, the whirring of spin class, the shouts of the staff.</p><p>There was one woman in particular Emmaline avoided. A hard-muscled trainer named Naomi Norman who stared as Em ran on the treadmill. Naomi\u2019s modus operandi was to scream at her clients, using words of encouragement such as, \u201cDon\u2019t be such a f**king pu**y! Get your fat ass in gear!\u201d</p><p>Rumor had it that Naomi had been a marine, a convict, a gym teacher and raised by wolves. All seemed true. Em did her best to pretend to be in the zone, earbuds firmly in place. When she did ask a SweatWorld employee for help with a machine, she made sure it was one of the nice people.</p><p>After a month, Em broached the idea of Kevin coming with her, and she used Naomi. \u201cBabe, you have to come with me. You know that woman on The Biggest Loser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d Kevin said, not looking up from the paper.</p><p>\u201cWell, Naomi is like her, except with very large hemorrhoids. She\u2019s evil. I\u2019m scared of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo find another gym.\u201d He got up to pour more coffee (adding half-and-half, not the nonfat creamer she\u2019d bought).</p><p>\u201cWell, this one\u2019s two blocks from here. You should come one day, honey. To protect me from Naomi.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that.</p><p>It was a start.</p><p>She knew Kevin didn\u2019t like being overweight. She knew his blood pressure and cholesterol were high. She also knew he was aware of how to lose weight and why he should. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she knew that her telling him to do it wasn\u2019t going to do the trick.</p><p>A week or two later, on a quiet Sunday morning, she bit the bullet. They were finishing breakfast (pancakes and bacon...a lot of bacon). \u201cHon, why don\u2019t you come to the gym with me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really busy,\u201d he answered instantly. And it was true; his job as a corporate tax attorney kept him at the firm till late in the evening, and he did work at least for a few hours each weekend.</p><p>She covered his hand with hers. \u201cKev, I love you. You know that. And I\u2019m so excited to be married and have kids and all that good stuff. But I want us to have a long and happy life, and...well...I\u2019m worried that we won\u2019t if you don\u2019t get healthier.\u201d</p> <p>She knew not to use words like diet or portion control or exercise more and the like. Focus on health and love, the literature had said. She\u2019d read dozens of articles on the subject. Obesity interventions, they called them, and she cringed a little at the phrase.</p><p>Kevin looked at her for a long minute. There was hurt in his eyes, and her own welled with tears.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to you, babe,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI could get hit by a bus crossing the street,\u201d he said, a defensive edge creeping into his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know. So could I. But\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises. I\u2019ll go once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She kissed him, and he smiled. Her sweet Kevin, the nicest guy in the world. She took him to bed first, to show him how she felt. Yes, he was a big man, but she felt so safe with him, her head on his chest afterward, his heavy arm around her.</p><p>They had to stop to buy gym shorts that fit, and Emmaline was horrified at how big they were. The weight had crept on, ten pounds here, another ten there, and somehow or another, Kevin had become immense.</p><p>He was quiet on the way to the gym. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kevin! You\u2019re not!\u201d She squeezed his arm. \u201cHoney, you have a big frame, and, yeah, you\u2019re heavy. But we\u2019re doing something about it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He gave a dejected nod.</p><p>Em held the door for him, chattering away, hoping to God Naomi wasn\u2019t there. Her goal was just to get him to walk a little on one of the treadmills, make it fun, chat about the wedding, try to keep him distracted, because Kevin hated exercise (obviously). The more painless this could be, the better it could work.</p><p>Kevin registered as Em\u2019s guest, signing the waiver they made people sign if they topped the scales at more than 30 percent of their ideal weight.</p><p>Kevin weighed almost twice what he should, the skinny, muscular man with bleached teeth told them. His ideal body weight was 188; he weighed 354.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019re here,\u201d the man said. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Kevin mumbled in response. He didn\u2019t make eye contact with Em as they walked to the treadmills, past the weight machines and the muscle-heads screaming with exertion. Kevin was out of breath by the time they got there.</p> <p>He was dying inside, Em knew. She smiled at him and set the treadmill at the lowest speed. Set hers at the same.</p><p>\u201cThis was probably the hardest part,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cJust walking in the doors.\u201d</p><p>Kevin didn\u2019t answer. He bumped up the speed a little higher and started jogging.</p><p>Em knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep that up. Too much, too soon.</p><p>Sure enough, he had to lower the speed a minute later. She pretended not to notice and kept walking, though if she were alone, she\u2019d be running at her usual seven miles an hour.</p><p>Then she saw Naomi.</p><p>The trainer was wearing microshorts and a sports bra. Her arms curved with perfectly defined, elegant muscle, and her stomach was flat and lean but not ripped. Long, tanned, beautiful legs. Her body was perfect. Not unappealingly muscular...just perfect. There was no other word for it.</p><p>And evil personified, because her face changed as her gaze stopped on Kevin. Her hands went to her hips, and she sauntered over, slowly, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my gym?\u201d she asked Kevin, her voice just shy of yelling. \u201cReally. What the f**k are you doing in my gym?\u201d</p><p>All around them, people grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cBack off, Naomi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your man? Are you here to be supportive? Huh?\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s face flushed even redder.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes,\u201d Emmaline bit out. \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019s taken the first step, so shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how sweet.\u201d Naomi sneered. \u201cGuess she has the balls in the family, huh, fatty?\u201d</p><p>It was nearly dead silent now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reporting you,\u201d Em said. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to us this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? We\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Kevin muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Em echoed. \u201cShut up, Naomi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Emmaline stopped walking, then jerked to a run to avoid being thrown off the treadmill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Naomi said, her eyes on Kevin. \u201cYou know how much fat you\u2019re carrying right now? Slick, yellow, nasty-ass slabs of fat? Oh, wait, you have a big frame, right? You\u2019re a big guy. Is that what you tell people? Is that what she tells you? You have a slow metabolism? Thyroid problem? Bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have a thyroid problem,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re a fat, lazy food addict, and you make me sick. You\u2019ve done this to yourself. You made yourself disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an eating disorder,\u201d Kevin said, his voice meek.</p><p>\u201cI have an eating disorder,\u201d she mimicked. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You have no self-control, no self-respect, and you\u2019re lying to yourself. I bet she lies to you, too. \u2018I love you just the way you are, honey!\u2019 Right?\u201d Naomi looked around at the other gym members, who were unabashedly staring. \u201cWell, guess what? Everyone here looks at you and thinks you\u2019re grotesque. No one cares about your great sense of humor and beautiful mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! Stop it!\u201d Emmaline yelped.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Kevin ground out.</p><p>He had never said anything like that to her. Ever.</p><p>Naomi reached over and pushed the stop button on Kevin\u2019s treadmill. He was drenched in sweat; the seven minutes they\u2019d spent walking just now was more exercise than he\u2019d had in a long time.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she said. \u201cGo home, lard-ass. Order a pizza. Bet you have Domino\u2019s on speed dial.\u201d</p><p>Just last night, Em had made a big salad with grilled chicken; Kevin had a huge serving, then called for a pizza. Extra cheese.</p><p>Now he just stood there, his head hanging.</p><p>\u201cYou want to lose weight, lard-ass? It\u2019s not gonna happen from climbing on a treadmill twice a week. You think just walking in this door is enough? It\u2019s not. You may as well not even try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Emmaline breathed. \u201cHoney, let\u2019s go. There are plenty of other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d Kevin asked.</p><p>Naomi smiled. \u201cEvery f**king thing I say.\u201d</p><p>It went against all the literature. It went against everything her parents had said. Bullying wasn\u2019t supposed to work. Humiliation wasn\u2019t supposed to motivate.</p><p>Kevin signed up for a six-month membership with two hours of personal training a day.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Emmaline asked as they went to the car. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me the truth,\u201d he said. He wouldn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>When they got home, he went straight to the bathroom and turned on the shower. A minute later, she heard him crying. It broke her heart, but he wouldn\u2019t unlock the door when she knocked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t eat for the rest of the day.</p><p>The next day, he wasn\u2019t there when she got home from work. She texted him; he didn\u2019t answer. Around nine, he came in, sweaty and red-faced, a stiff new SweatWorld gym bag in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...honey, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing this, but do you think Naomi is the best person to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Three days later, he came home from the gym with a list in his hand and, without further ado, opened their cupboards and began tossing everything into the trash, making disgusted noises as he read labels.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, retrieving a can of chicken stock. \u201cCome on! That\u2019s not even opened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poison,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the sodium count.\u201d He gave her a condemning look. She did the grocery shopping, after all. He picked up a packet of pad thai sauce and tossed it in the trash.</p><p>\u201cOkay, hon, we can donate this to the food pantry. But can you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d He tossed an unopened box of Special K, which she snatched. She loved cereal. \u201cAre we going gluten-free or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And sugar-free and dairy-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left?\u201d she asked, trying to make a joke.</p><p>He turned on her. \u201cDo you think this is funny? Look at me. I\u2019m sickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Kevin, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and went back to the purge.</p><p>That weekend, he was so sore he could barely put on his pants. But he went to the gym, anyway. \u201cNaomi says pain is weakness leaving the body,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She went with him, but Naomi ignored her, preferring instead to screech at Kevin, calling him lazy, a quitter, a slug. Twice Em had to go to the ladies\u2019 room to cry.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best if you and I went to the gym at different times,\u201d he told her on the way home. \u201cI appreciate the support, but I need to focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...well, sure. Whatever you need, babe. Whatever works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>Naomi took Kevin grocery shopping, and when Em saw the receipt, she yelped; two bags of gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, organic food cost more than she spent in a month.</p><p>All through the fall, he kept it up. He ate only lean protein and hard-to-digest vegetables and lumpy shakes made from green powder and soy milk. Quinoa and flax and wheatgrass. Egg-white omelets and raw broccoli, grilled fish and red peppers. He did fasts and cleanses and purges. The bathroom smelled ghastly. His sex drive dropped.</p><p>And all he could talk about was working out. \u201cNaomi says\u201d became the two words that began most of his sentences. Caloric load, adipose, anaerobic, layered eating... It was all they ever talked about. Well. All Kevin ever talked about.</p><p>He did, however, start to lose weight.</p><p>Nine pounds the first month. Eleven the second. In December, they had a big fight over her wanting to bake Christmas cookies to send to her parents and Angela. Kevin said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford the risk\u201d of her baking something not in his diet plan.</p><p>She baked the cookies anyway when he was at work, boxed them up, sealed them with packing tape and addressed them, then went for a run. When she came home, she found Angela\u2019s package ripped open and a furious Kevin. He\u2019d eaten at least a dozen cookies, he said, and it was her fault. She threw temptation in his path when he was at a vulnerable point, and how was that being supportive?</p><p>\u201cSee, I thought I was baking cookies for my family,\u201d Em said frostily. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was such a temptress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh it up. You\u2019ll be crying over my coffin if you can\u2019t support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do support you! And, my God, I\u2019m so sick of that word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the gym,\u201d he said with a martyred air. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to fast now for three days. Please have the rest of the cookies removed from our apartment when I get back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d she muttered. \u201cFine.\u201d She sighed, then hugged him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you, and I\u2019m really proud of you, okay? I just didn\u2019t realize I wasn\u2019t supposed to bake for anyone anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an addict,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease be more respectful of my issues.\u201d</p><p>He only lost four pounds that month. Her fault again, he said, for bringing him to her office party and letting Angela and her mother make Christmas breakfast.</p><p>The gym became his favorite place. Those long hours at the law firm weren\u2019t as carved in stone as they\u2019d seemed. In fact, the partners were all thrilled he was taking better care of himself.</p> <p>So was Emmaline.</p><p>Except she barely saw him anymore, and, when she did, all he could talk about was food and exercise.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t go out to eat with friends because the temptation was too great. If Emmaline went out with friends from college or coworkers, Kevin asked her not to bring home the leftovers. They couldn\u2019t go to the movies. Night after night, they stayed home, Kevin falling asleep in the chair, exhausted from his workout.</p><p>Occasionally, they\u2019d go for a run together, but Kevin mapped their route with painstaking care because God forbid they pass a bakery or hot dog vendor. \u201cNaomi says it will take an entire year for my resistance to strengthen,\u201d Kevin said as they ran through a deserted industrial park at seven o\u2019clock one Saturday morning. \u201cUntil then, I have to be really careful.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline went along with it, eating what Kevin ate, not buying anything that wasn\u2019t listed on the Naomi-approved list, not smuggling in Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, no matter how much she missed it.</p> <p>Kevin had taped Naomi clich\u00e9s on the fridge, which made eating at home a guilt-riddled affair. Whatever you eat in private, you wear in public. Abs are made in the kitchen. Don\u2019t kill your workout with food. The question isn\u2019t can you, it\u2019s will you. Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels. Em had to dispute that last one. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s definitely tasted better than being thin was. Not that she was thin. But she wasn\u2019t fat.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>As Kevin lost weight, food became more seductive than ever to Emmaline. It was all she could think about. Time became measured in the hours until she could eat. She fell asleep thinking about food, and as soon as she was done with one meal, she started imagining the next.</p><p>While once she\u2019d brought a yogurt and an apple for lunch, she now started eating a huge meal at work. Philly cheesesteaks and burgers and nachos, clam chowder and the Scrammy Hammy at Big Boy. She craved cherry pie, a Michigan specialty.</p><p>One day, she came home from work to find Kevin there, a rarity since he\u2019d discovered the gym. \u201cHi, babe!\u201d she said happily, dropping her bag on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d he said, hugging her close, and for a second, she felt such a surge of love and longing it nearly made her stagger. She hugged him back, noting that her hands could now touch. He really was melting away.</p> <p>Suddenly, Kevin stepped back. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! You smell like...yes! You went to Ray\u2019s Red Hots today, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He made it sound as if she\u2019d just kicked a baby panda in the stomach. \u201cGuilty, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Emmaline,\u201d he said, sounding like a sulky kindergartener. \u201cYou reek of Diablo Dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had two, Kevin. Okay? Sue me.\u201d The hot dog stand was an icon in Ann Arbor, and, back in the good old days, she and Kevin had stopped there often.</p><p>He glared at her, then grabbed his gym bag and left.</p><p>\u201cOh, for crying out loud, Kevin!\u201d she yelled down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m not on a diet! You are! I think I\u2019m allowed to go out for lunch.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t come home that night.</p><p>First time ever.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to speculate about where he might be.</p><p>Instead, she went to the store and bought a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and ate the entire thing. Peanut Brittle. It was flippin\u2019 delicious.</p><p>When Kevin came back the next night, they made up. Sort of.</p><p>By March, he\u2019d lost seventy-seven pounds, and Emmaline noticed something one night as he dozed in the chair, exhausted from the fresh gym hell Naomi had invented for him.</p><p>Kevin was gorgeous.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d always thought he was good-looking. But now his face was emerging from the chubbiness of jowls and chins. He had beautiful cheekbones and a square jaw. His eyes, now closed, seemed bigger, his lashes a dark smudge on his cheeks.</p><p>If only she liked him the way she used to.</p><p>It had been a long time since they\u2019d had fun. Or sex. Or fun sex. It\u2019s just a stage, her conscience told her. He\u2019s still your Kevin.</p><p>Except he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Once, Kevin had been easygoing, funny, mellow and kind. These days, he was vain, obsessive and...mean. There was no other word for it.</p><p>He hated fat people. Stared in disgust. Clucked in disapproval. He also hated people who got gastric bypass. \u201cCheater,\u201d he said one night when they were watching the news about a person who\u2019d lost three hundred pounds. \u201cHe\u2019ll gain it back. Health is like marriage. You can\u2019t cheat on it and expect it to work.\u201d One of Naomi\u2019s quotes.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of marriage, hon,\u201d she began, but the phone rang, and it was Naomi, who was also watching the \u201ccheater\u201d on TV.</p><p>One day, when they were standing in line to get into a concert at the university, he saw a chubby little boy, about eight or nine years old. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI was fat once, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKevin!\u201d she admonished. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing him any favors, letting him eat junk,\u201d he said to the boy\u2019s mother, who gave him the finger.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you can\u2019t be so judgmental,\u201d she told him later. \u201cI know you just want to help, but that was mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mean is his mother setting him up for diabetes,\u201d he said.</p><p>He had a point. But his point wasn\u2019t backed by kindness.</p><p>When Naomi gave him the green light to eat out in public, Emmaline almost cried with relief. Finally, she thought, they\u2019d return to their regular lives. Sure, they were eating a lot healthier (except for her secret lunch binges). But not eating out or going to friends\u2019 houses for dinner...it was hard! Finally, she thought, they could be normal. Go out for dinner, see a movie. Talk.</p><p>That night, Em was thrilled. Wore a dress, did her makeup with care, left her hair down because Kevin liked it that way. The restaurant was French and romantic, candles flickering, their server soft-spoken and attractive.</p><p>\u201cWould mademoiselle care for a drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a glass of pinot noir,\u201d she said. Kevin glanced at her, and she hoped he\u2019d order one, too. He was edgy, poor thing, in a restaurant for the first time in months and months.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, monsieur?\u201d</p><p>From the table behind her, someone cleared her throat. Twice. Three times. Emmaline turned around and looked.</p><p>It was Naomi, her glittering eyes fixed on Kevin.</p><p>\u201cIce water,\u201d Kevin said tersely. \u201cAnd don\u2019t bring any bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Emmaline added. She looked back at Naomi. \u201cHi. Want to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou passed your first test, Kev,\u201d Naomi said, ignoring her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. What do you see on the menu that you can have?\u201d</p><p>Em sighed.</p><p>Thus went dinner. Naomi would cough or hack at each wrong answer. Green salad? And what type of dressing would monsieur care for? (Hack.) No dressing? Very well. Grilled salmon? (Cough.) Make that haddock. Brussels sprouts (cough) no salt, no oil. No potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having.\u201d Em sighed. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to order the roasted duck with Gruyere bread pudding and butter-glazed asparagus. Forget the chocolate souffl\u00e9 that was already calling to her from the dessert menu. Anyway, she\u2019d gained a few pounds over the winter, and her jeans had been a little tight last time she\u2019d worn them. That being said, the woman at the next table was cooing over something cheesy and delicious smelling. Em\u2019s stomach rumbled.</p><p>Naomi came over and bent down to murmur to Kevin, her ass practically in Emmaline\u2019s face. \u201cLook around, Kev,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wanna be like those heart attacks waiting to happen?\u201d</p><p>Emmaline looked past Naomi\u2019s perfect ass. Didn\u2019t see anyone abnormal. Her eyes stopped on a middle-aged couple, normal enough in build. The server was bringing them dessert.</p><p>\u201cOne piece of cheesecake? Five hundred calories. Seventy grams of fat,\u201d Naomi said. \u201cPicture your heart, Kev, slimed up with that shit, the muscles pumping slower and slower, clogged with cheesecake.\u201d Kevin stared as if hypnotized.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really how it works,\u201d Em murmured. They both ignored her.</p><p>\u201cChampagne on the house,\u201d the server said to the older couple. \u201cHappy anniversary, and thank you for sharing it with us. How many years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five,\u201d the woman answered, smiling. They were a nice-looking couple and clearly very happy together, holding hands, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAll those two have to do is get off their lard-asses and move and stop indulging themselves at every turn,\u201d Naomi went on. \u201cBut no. They\u2019re here instead, stuffing their fat faces\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks, Naomi! Nice seeing you,\u201d Emmaline interrupted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Em,\u201d Kevin said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s life without cheesecake, though?\u201d Em said with a smile. \u201cJust once in a while, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s the attitude that will keep you fat, Kevin. The attitude that will keep people staring at you, wondering why that lard-ass doesn\u2019t look in the mirror once in a while and see how repulsive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cJust... Naomi, Kevin and I are out to dinner, and I appreciate you helping him get healthy, but please. You\u2019re just being cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being honest,\u201d Kevin said hotly.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s also being mean and nasty and hateful!\u201d she snapped. \u201cWho wants to live the way she does, in the gym all day long, never able to enjoy a meal, drinking those disgusting shakes! I\u2019d rather be like them over there!\u201d Em pointed to the couple. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like lard-asses to me!\u201d</p><p>Whoops.</p><p>The restaurant had gone silent, and the anniversary couple sat frozen, the man with a forkful of cheesecake halfway to his mouth.</p><p>Naomi lifted an eyebrow and went back to her prison rations.</p><p>Kevin asked for the check. He didn\u2019t speak to her in the car, even when she tried to make light of the night. When they got home, he went into their bedroom and closed the door. A second later, she heard his voice as he talked on the phone. \u201cHey, Naomi. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>WHEN KEVIN HAD lost a hundred pounds, he asked to speak with Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cI think we should break up,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cMy life is taking a different direction, and I need to focus on that.\u201d He didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married in two months,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nothing she said made a difference. She tried not to cry and failed. Tried not to beg and failed there, too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t support me,\u201d he said, the accusation dripping like melted butter.</p><p>\u201cI do support you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You keep talking about the old me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss the old you! You were happier, Kevin! I\u2019m not talking about being fat. You were funnier and happier and enjoyed everything more. Now all you do is go to the gym and count calories. That\u2019s no life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaomi says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! Not another one of Naomi\u2019s famous quotes. Not when you\u2019re breaking up with me!\u201d She started to sob. \u201cKevin, I\u2019ve loved you since I was thirteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, you\u2019ll never understand. I\u2019m finally someone I like. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t, but Jesus! Don\u2019t tell me to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you be healthy and still be sweet, Kevin? Because you were the nicest, best person I ever\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I had to be, so people wouldn\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one hated you, Kevin. No one hates a person for being overweight.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cRight. Look. I\u2019m sorry, okay? But I can\u2019t be the true me while I\u2019m with you. You\u2019re holding me back.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \u201cK-K-Kevin, p-p-please.\u201d</p><p>The stutter bolted upright, a delighted rictus grin on its face.</p> <p>It was back. Kevin\u2019s fat was disappearing, but after all these clean years, her stutter was back.</p><p>Kevin looked at her, his face gentling. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this for your own good, Emmaline,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight this year. You might want to watch what you eat.\u201d</p><p>AND THAT WAS THAT. The Kevin she\u2019d loved, who\u2019d made being picked last for teams tolerable, who\u2019d loved her when her words were stuck, was gone, shed like a snake skin.</p><p>He moved in with Naomi.</p><p>She wrote him a letter, unable to stop herself. It was filled with phrases such as \u201cnever stop loving you\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d and \u201cplease give us another chance\u201d and all those wretched, horrible, debasing phrases that your friends tell you never to say. He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>When it seemed truly final, she went home to Malibu to break the news to her family.</p> <p>\u201cKevin and I broke up,\u201d she said that night around the kitchen table with her parents (who no longer spoke directly to each other, yet still lived together) and Angela, who was visiting from Stanford, where she was getting her PhD in astrophysics.</p><p>\u201cWe figured that was coming,\u201d her mother said smoothly. \u201cI accept you exactly as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you unconditionally,\u201d Dad said, not to be outdone.</p><p>\u201cUm...thanks,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always knew,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>Mom patted her hand. \u201cThat you\u2019re g*y, honey.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline blinked. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to pretend, Emmaline. Your father and I don\u2019t care what your sexual orientation is.\u201d She handed Em a tissue.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I had dinner with the Bateses the other night,\u201d Dad said. \u201cThey told us about Kevin\u2019s weight loss. It\u2019s wonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Good old Dad, ever clueless.</p><p>\u201cI liked Kevin better when he was fat,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so very sorry about this, Emmaline.\u201d Flawless Angela always said exactly the right thing.</p><p>Em went back to Ann Arbor, only to find that the paper was downsizing, and she was out of a job.</p><p>Nana had left Angela and Em her little house in her will. They\u2019d planned on renting it, but now, it was a godsend.</p><p>The newspaper in Manningsport had one paid employee. Even if there was an opening, Em had her fill of covering town meetings and school concerts.</p><p>There was a job advertised for administrative assistant at the police department, which had all of one full-time cop and one part-timer. Levi Cooper, the chief, had been a year behind her in high school, a bit of a toughie, on the football team. All grown-up now, a veteran, somewhat grumpy and good at his job.</p><p>Em found that people confided in her as they called with their problems. \u201cOh, Emmaline, hi, honey. My husband is late coming home, and I hate to be neurotic, but you think Levi would swing by Suzette Minor\u2019s house and see if Bill\u2019s car is there? You know Bill. You don\u2019t? Well, he\u2019s not the most faithful dog on the sled team.\u201d</p><p>One day, a woman came into the station and introduced herself. Shelayne Schanta, looking to start a book club. Could she put up a notice on the bulletin board? \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 dumped me for my aunt, can you believe that?\u201d she said. \u201cGotta find something to do in my free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 left me six months ago,\u201d Em heard herself saying.</p><p>\u201cDid he cheat on you?\u201d</p><p>He had claimed no, but even if hadn\u2019t slept with Naomi before he dumped her, he\u2019d been emotionally unfaithful, putting all his trust and attention and time into that shrew. Also, People magazine\u2019s \u201cHalf Their Size\u201d edition had just come out, and Em (and the rest of the world) got to hear what Kevin really thought of her. That was infidelity enough.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the club,\u201d Shelayne said. \u201cThe bitter betrayed.\u201d</p><p>The name stuck, and the Bitter Betrayeds became her refuge. There wasn\u2019t much reading, but there were martinis and venting. They hung out at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s from time to time. Emmaline joined the town hockey league, having become a pretty good skater during high school. She kept up her grandmother\u2019s flower garden; the smell of lilacs and irises reminded her of happy memories.</p><p>As it had been in school, her attitude became her armor. If she was a tough, mouthy jock, then she wasn\u2019t a woman who\u2019d been tossed over for a mean girl.</p><p>But God, she missed Kevin.</p><p>She kept a button-down shirt of his from when he\u2019d been at his heaviest. It was massive; she could wrap it around herself twice. It reminded her of the man who would make her macaroni and cheese on the second day of her period each month. Who had cut out Dilbert cartoons for her all through high school. Who sent her the complete set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when she had her appendix out.</p><p>Whenever she felt lonely, or whenever she felt that maybe the time had come to register on eCommitment or Match.com, she found herself staring into her closet at that old soft blue shirt. She\u2019d take it out and sleep in it, and even though the old Kevin was no more, she couldn\u2019t help remembering the boy who\u2019d befriended her when she\u2019d had no one else.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>THE DRIVE FROM LAX to Rancho de la Luna was not going to be long enough.</p><p>Emmaline\u2019s plan was to get to the resort, check in as quickly as possible, then hide in her room, kill half a bottle of wine and fall asleep watching TV.</p><p>Jack fell asleep within seconds of getting into the passenger seat of the rental car, though he did run a hand over the hood as they got in. Because, yes, she\u2019d rented a tricked-out Mustang convertible. She wasn\u2019t going to pull up at Rancho de la Luna in an economy car.</p><p>She pulled onto the 405, flipped off the driver who laid on his horn behind her and tried to unclench.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t stir. His head was tipped back, blond hair shining in the sun. His sunglasses were on, and he looked like he belonged here in the land of the beautiful people. Faith had been right about her brother; he was a fantastic date. So far, anyway. Cheerful, reassuring, gorgeous. This wasn\u2019t a surprise as much as a concern, because Emmaline could definitely see herself becoming a slutty clich\u00e9 and sleeping with her wedding date to prove she wasn\u2019t a dried-up, rejected hag.</p><p>Inglewood. Culver City. Santa Monica. The familiar names flashed past alongside the speeding cars. It was a bit of culture shock, driving on L.A. highways again, the sunlight glaring and the smell of exhaust all around her.</p><p>Yesterday, the five-year-old Cabrera triplets had come up to her in the park to play with Sarge, and they\u2019d all ended up rolling around in the fresh snow and pretending to be snakes (Lucia\u2019s idea). Then all three kids climbed on Em and told her to be a pony, and she crawled around in the snow, whinnying, much to their delight (and Sarge\u2019s).</p><p>Twenty minutes in SoCal, and she was already homesick.</p><p>Relentless golden sunshine beat down. It was in the mid-sixties, maybe hotter here on the highway. She took the Santa Monica Freeway and headed for the Pacific Coast Highway.</p><p>Mom had told her a while ago that Kevin and Naomi had moved back to Malibu. That was before her parents had moved to Stanford to be closer to Angela.</p><p>Weird, picturing Kevin back here. In her mind, she saw the chubby, pale boy she\u2019d first met, and a bittersweet ache swelled in her chest.</p><p>There was the ocean, glittering blue and calm. The scruffy hills of Southern California formed a wall on the eastern side of the road, the Pacific on the other.</p><p>\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d Jack said, sitting up and taking off his sunglasses.</p><p>Not to her, it wasn\u2019t. Em had forgotten how dry it could get. Sure, the ocean was gorgeous, a shimmering, sparkling expanse today. But the landscape was scrubby and sandy, unless it had been gardened into an unnaturally lush oasis. Hotels and houses were plopped gracelessly along the highway\u2014anything for a water view.</p><p>If she\u2019d had better memories, it probably would\u2019ve looked prettier. After all, Malibu was considered one of the most beautiful places in America.</p><p>As they came into the city proper, Em\u2019s heart rate kicked up. Okay, it was beautiful, perfectly kept houses dotting the hills, the yards bursting with gardens. Palm trees and flowering bushes grew in lush clumps.</p><p>\u201cLots of celebrities live out here?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Bruce Willis, Courteney Cox, Leonardo DiCaprio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever see anyone famous in town?\u201d</p><p>Em smiled at the question. \u201cSure. A lot of actors stay here if they have an event in Hollywood. Morgan Freeman held the door for me once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>She turned off the PCH and headed up toward the ranch. The sun was starting to set, and her stomach grumbled. Despite being fed in first class, she was starving.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for tonight?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping to hide in my room and order dinner and drink wine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d Then, realizing how rude that sounded, she added, \u201cI mean, see the sights. It\u2019s a beautiful ranch. Used to be a rehab place for the wealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>Don\u2019t tempt me, Jack. She turned onto White Horse Canyon Road. Her heart was twanging with nervousness now. There was the sign\u2014\u201cWelcome to Rancho de la Luna, America\u2019s #1 Luxury Boot Camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuxury Boot Camp?\u201d Jack said. \u201cKind of an oxymoron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the place on The Biggest Loser,\u201d Em said. \u201cNaomi is a fitness guru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fun for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Em pulled over onto the side of the road, getting an enraged honk and some curse words from the car behind her. She flipped them off\u2014it was the California way, after all\u2014and looked at Jack. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. He was fat, she made him her project, they fell in love. My parents think I\u2019m g*y. And did I mention I have a very perfect and beautiful sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, my parents are divorced but still live together and don\u2019t speak directly to each other. They may analyze you. They\u2019re psychologists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably forgetting something, but for now, no.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou want to stop and change first?\u201d</p><p>She twitched. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThree sisters. I figured you wouldn\u2019t want to face your ex looking like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve just flown across the country and forgot your miracle drug for hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring you along for snark.\u201d She threw the car back in gear. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people who\u2019s fixated on looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, if you don\u2019t want me to stab you in the neck, shut it. Your publicity team said you were the perfect date. Act like it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Ah. He was joking. She felt the tug of a small smile. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rancho de la Luna\u2014Ranch of the Moon\u2014was gorgeous. White stucco with red clay tile roofs, beautiful plantings, a fountain. Orange and lemon trees were in bloom, competing with the soft white of ornamental pear trees, and the scent of jasmine was thick in the air.</p><p>Very romantic.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d said the valet as she pulled up to the huge wooden doors. \u201cAre you here for the Norman-Bates wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure are,\u201d she said, getting out and handing him the keys. \u201cI\u2019m Janet Leigh, and this is Anthony Perkins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you!\u201d he said, flashing a smile so brilliant Em almost shielded her eyes. \u201cHead on in, and make yourselves at home here at Rancho de la Luna!\u201d</p><p>Jack retrieved their bags from the trunk. \u201cShowtime,\u201d he said, reaching for her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. None of that,\u201d she said. But damn, she was glad he was here, a tall, handsome date. Really, he should start charging. He\u2019d make a fortune.</p><p>The lobby of the resort featured Mexican tile floors and clean white walls. Some lurid religious art hung on the walls; Em had read that the place had been modeled after a Spanish mission. She glanced around. Nobody she knew.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline Neal,\u201d she said to the clerk.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d the woman said, clicking some keys. \u201cAnd your name, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Holland. Can our rooms be adjoining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d the clerk replied cheerfully. \u201cI can put you in rooms 112 and 114. Just go down this hall and take a right. Both rooms have ocean views.\u201d She smiled again at Jack and handed them both keys.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Emmaline said. She picked up her bag, turned and nearly bumped into an extremely beautiful man. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Broad shoulders, chiseled bone structure, and electric attraction buzzed in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline!\u201d the man said. And holy bleepity-bleeping bleep, it was Kevin.</p> <p>Her face went hot immediately, and her knees felt sick and weak.</p><p>He looked like the love child of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Square jaw, perfect nose, lovely mouth and those eyes... The eyes were the same.</p><p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYeah, I did. Um, we did. Yes. Thank you for inviting me. You look...you look great, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>Almost three years since she\u2019d seen him last. He\u2019d been very handsome, yes, and strong and solid.</p><p>Now, though...now he was a sculpted wonder of science and divinity. His T-shirt, which read Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead, clung to his pecs, and his arms...his arms were a thing of beauty. Those were Daryl-from-The-Walking-Dead arms. Jeremy Renner arms.</p><p>Em closed her mouth. Presumably, Jack was nearby and hadn\u2019t burst into flames, but even if he had, it might\u2019ve been hard for Emmaline to look away from Kevin.</p><p>Her ex grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019ve never seen the end result. Pretty amazing, huh?\u201d he said, and with that, he took off his shirt and flexed.</p> <p>Such a...such a...such a jerk.</p><p>But holy bleep.</p><p>He was tan and hairless (he used to have chest hair, but the landscape was smooth and golden now). Perfectly defined muscles, no trace of fat anywhere. It was as if New Kevin had killed Old Kevin, melted down his fat and used it for lamp oil or something, because even though she\u2019d slept with this guy for years, she didn\u2019t recognize one thing on that beautiful panorama of skin and muscle and beauty.</p><p>Then Naomi came jogging up, wearing workout gear smaller than any bathing suit Em had ever owned. Emmaline tore her eyes off Kevin\u2019s eight-pack (was there such a thing?) and blinked.</p><p>\u201cBabe. There you are.\u201d Naomi slid a tanned arm around Kevin\u2019s perfect waist and smirked at Emmaline. \u201cEmily. Long time no see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Naomi hefted up a liter of bile-colored sports drink and guzzled.</p><p>\u201cHi. Jack Holland,\u201d came a voice. \u201cThe bride and groom, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Em said. \u201cJack, these are Kevin Bates and Naomi Norman. This is my friend, Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>Naomi scanned him up and down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your BMI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said patiently.</p><p>\u201cHow much can you bench?\u201d Kevin asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really a gym kind of person,\u201d he said, smiling. He took her hand. She didn\u2019t remove it. She might\u2019ve even been squeezing it very hard.</p><p>She should\u2019ve hugged Kevin to show she was over him. She should\u2019ve smiled. She should\u2019ve said, Kevin, hey! Look at you, gorgeous! and been all casual and happy and not frozen and stupid.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful spot,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe were so happy to get out of the weather back home.\u201d</p><p>Neither Naomi nor Kevin answered.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline, why don\u2019t we get settled?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>She stared at him mutely. Better than looking at Kevin, that was for sure. Let alone Naomi.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said, and hooray for her, she was speaking at long last. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you guys later. Of course. Because it\u2019s your wedding! Yay!\u201d Oh, Lord. Where was her gun? She had packed it, right? It would be so great to shoot herself right now.</p><p>Jack laughed, angels bless him, and put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cLong flight,\u201d he said, giving her a little squeeze. \u201cWe were up before dawn.\u201d</p><p>Naomi smirked. \u201cYeah. Get some rest, Emily. You look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Then, hand in hand, the bride and groom walked the opposite way. Naomi still had the most amazing body she\u2019d ever seen, and Em couldn\u2019t help the flash of envy she felt. Just once, just for one afternoon on the beach, she would\u2019ve liked to have rocked a bathing suit. Okay, fine. She would\u2019ve liked it for a weekend. A month. A few years.</p><p>And Kevin... He\u2019d done it. He certainly wasn\u2019t fat anymore. He was the one percent\u2014the perfectly beautiful people with perfectly beautiful bodies.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She stepped out from the comfort of his arm. \u201cI appreciate the thought, Jack, but I really don\u2019t want to pretend to be a couple.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long minute. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But thank you.\u201d She looked away from the kindness in his eyes and headed down the hallway.</p><p>Time for a very big glass of wine. Or two. They passed another hallway, and a familiar voice stopped Em in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline? Sweetheart!\u201d It was Mom. \u201cHow are you? Are you crushed? Did you see Kevin? You were very brave to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you came, Emmaline. You\u2019re very strong, as I raised you to be,\u201d said Dad. There was a brief scramble as each parent tried to be the one to hug her first.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\u201d She gave them simultaneous, one-armed hugs so as not to play favorites, then smiled at her sister.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline!\u201d Angela said, her eyes growing damp. \u201cHow wonderful to see you!\u201d</p><p>Her sister managed to extricate her from their parents and gave her a hug. Then Dad had to give her another, extra-long hug to show that he was a better parent than Mom, which meant Mom had to hug her again and kiss her twice on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you guys,\u201d Em said. She meant it, but there was no way she\u2019d ever sound as nice and sincere as her sister. \u201cThis is my friend, Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, lovely to meet you,\u201d Angela said, shaking his hand warmly. Honestly, those nuns at the orphanage had done a fantastic job raising her.</p><p>\u201cOh! This is Jack?\u201d Mom exclaimed. \u201cWhat a surprise! I didn\u2019t\u2014well, we didn\u2019t...ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Mom? I told you I was bringing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just assumed this \u2018Jack\u2019 person\u2014\u201d Mom made quote marks with her fingers \u201c\u2014was actually \u2018Jacqueline.\u2019 Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you,\u201d Jack said, smiling at Em. He shook hands with her parents.</p><p>\u201cSon, a pleasure,\u201d Dad said, to prove that he was way cooler than Mom.</p><p>\u201cWe were just going to have some dinner in the restaurant,\u201d Angela said. \u201cIt\u2019s very pretty. You have to join us, don\u2019t they, Mama? Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d Jack said, damn him. \u201cGive us an hour, why don\u2019t you? We\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>More hugs were exchanged until, finally, the three other Neals went off. When they were a sufficient distance away, Em looked at Jack. \u201cWhat did I say about hiding in the room and drinking wine?\u201d she asked. \u201cI thought you were a winemaker. You were supposed to support that plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family. They love you.\u201d He picked up her suitcase, ignoring her attempts to grab it back. \u201cYou can have wine at dinner.\u201d</p><p>EMMALINE COULDN\u2019T HAVE wine at dinner. No one could.</p><p>The resort restaurant\u2014Sea of Tranquility\u2014was beautiful, overlooking the Pacific. It also didn\u2019t serve alcohol. Where had that been on the website, huh? Rather hateful of them, really.</p><p>It had gotten chillier. There was a picturesque fire in a glass fireplace in the middle of the room and windows on three sides. Em, Jack and her family had a corner table; she thought Jack might\u2019ve slipped the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 a twenty, but she was a little stupid with fatigue. Strangely beautiful candles, probably made out of wheatgrass and edamame, flickered, and, outside, a whip-poor-will started to sing.</p><p>Naomi and Kevin weren\u2019t in the restaurant, thank God. Em thought she recognized one of his cousins, but no one called out a hello or stopped by the table, and she was deeply grateful. She\u2019d see everyone tomorrow and Saturday\u2014they\u2019d been given a program of \u201cFun and Healthful Activities!\u201d which included the mandatory water sports.</p><p>Saturday afternoon was the wedding itself.</p><p>She wondered how Kevin had felt, seeing her again. If they might have a real conversation, just the two of them, and maybe...maybe set some old feelings at rest. Maybe they could even manage to be friends again. Surely, somewhere in that beautiful sculpted body, a little bit of Old Kevin existed.</p><p>Dinner was a blurry, odd affair. Her parents were both talkers, but because they didn\u2019t speak to each other, it was as if there were two conversations going on at the same time, except for their sharp jabs at each other from time to time. Also, the combination of jet lag and stress was the equivalent to an Ambien and a baseball to the head.</p><p>The ranch only served gluten-free, vegan food, and while it wasn\u2019t awful, it also wasn\u2019t identifiable or filling.</p><p>Only Angela was normal, her usual charming self, laughing, laying her hand on Jack\u2019s arm from time to time, telling stories while Mom whispered questions to her about why Em had chosen to bring a man as her date.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m straight, Mom,\u201d Emmaline told her for the fifth or sixth time.</p><p>\u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that,\u201d she said, \u201cbut, Emmaline, you don\u2019t have to hide your sexuality from us. I\u2019m very open-minded, even if your father isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open-minded,\u201d Dad objected. \u201cI think we all know exactly who\u2019s homophobic here. But, Emmaline, you never have to hide who you truly are from your old dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything!\u201d Em said. \u201cI\u2019m broadcasting my sexuality, okay? I like men. I\u2019ve never kissed a woman, and I never want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Jack murmured, earning a scowl. He was acting way too boyfriendy for her.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d she asked, pushing some mysterious food that began with a Z around her plate. \u201cAnge, what\u2019s new in the world of the moon and stars?\u201d She turned to Jack. \u201cAngela\u2019s an astrophysicist. Just finished her PhD at Stanford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline, you\u2019re so sweet to ask, but my job is so boring compared to yours!\u201d her sister said. \u201cTell me how things are going in beautiful Manningsport. Have you had any interesting calls lately?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cUm, a four-year-old got a blueberry stuck in his nose, and I helped with that...\u201d Okay, it had been more fun than it sounded. Little Flynn Maloney had been quite thrilled with the attention and rightfully proud of the effort it had taken to wedge the berry up so high. \u201cWell, the other day, I had to unhandcuff a guy from his bed. His wife had dropped the key in the chocolate sauce and thought she might\u2019ve swallowed\u2014oh, uh, never mind, actually.\u201d</p><p>The frisky couple in question had been Prudence and Carl Vanderbeek. Jack\u2019s sister and husband. Whoopsy.</p><p>\u201cSounds like something my sister and Carl would do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Oh, he smiled.</p><p>Yep, that was some mighty good mojo. His eyes were unbelievably pretty, and that smile was balm for the battered soul. His eyes crinkled at the corners, too! Damn and blast, Jack Holland\u2019s face was just...it was just...</p><p>\u201cYou two make a lovely couple,\u201d Angela said.</p> <p>\u201cNo! No, no. We\u2019re just friends,\u201d Em said, jerking her gaze away from Jack.</p><p>\u201cWe play hockey together,\u201d Jack added. \u201cShe has the best wrist shot on the team.\u201d He put his arm around the back of her chair, doing that boyfriendy thing again. \u201cBut she looks pretty exhausted, so if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll get back to our rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! A well-rested body is the foundation of good mental health,\u201d Dad said, leaping up to hug her. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful, sweetheart. Daddy loves you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, Daddy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you just as much. If not more,\u201d Mom added.</p><p>\u201cGood to know. Ange? You want to chime in?\u201d</p> <p>Angela laughed. \u201cAnd I love you more than these two combined, plus infinity.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline smiled, hugged her sister and mom, and she and Jack headed back to their rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nice family,\u201d he said.</p><p>Not the word she\u2019d use, but they were hers, and she did love them. \u201cThanks. They liked you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone does.\u201d He grinned, taking away any conceit that might\u2019ve been associated with the smile. After all, it was true. What was not to like? To love? Who wouldn\u2019t want to rub up against him and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou want to hang out or something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm...I should get to bed. I mean, do you?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty whipped, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the morning, if you walk down to the beach, you might see some otters. They\u2019re really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep a lookout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hot yoga class at five-thirty,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s on our schedule of events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear that,\u201d he answered, sliding his keycard into the slot. \u201cSleep well, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>She went into her room, as well. Double-locked the door. Washed up, got in her jammies and got into bed. Very comfortable. She flapped her arms and legs as if making a snow angel. Big bed. Plenty of room for Sarge. She wondered how he was doing. Shelayne, who had an unhealthy love of dogs, had him for the weekend. Em would be lucky if she got her puppy back, given how Shelayne had promised to spoil him.</p><p>Yep. Big bed. Very big. Very comfy.</p><p>Crap. She was wired. Exhausted but wired.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to relax. Pictured being on the ocean in a gently drifting boat. (Why was she drifting? What if she got caught on the Gulf Stream and ended up like Pi, minus the tiger? Or even worse, with the tiger?) Pictured the blue, blue ocean. (Note to self: warn Jack to check the shark report before he went swimming. Then again, the water would only be about sixty degrees. Then again, he was from the Finger Lakes. He knew cold water. And then again, maybe he wouldn\u2019t want to go swimming because of the rescue, but she kind of did, except that she\u2019d have to wear a wet suit, and whose ass looked good in a wet suit? Naomi\u2019s and no one else\u2019s, that\u2019s whose.)</p><p>\u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t working,\u201d she said aloud, flinging back the covers. Time for a little fresh air.</p><p>She went out onto the balcony, which was teeny but adorable, red trumpet vine curling up through the post. A small iron table, two tiny chairs. She breathed in the cool salty air. Maybe she\u2019d have coffee out here in the morning. But wait...no. The ranch was also caffeine-free. Horrible place.</p><p>She glanced over at Jack\u2019s balcony, which was identical to hers. He\u2019d left the slider open, and his curtain fluttered out in the breeze. She hoped he\u2019d enjoy the weekend, being out of Manningsport in the land of sunshine and ocean. He really was an awfully good guy.</p><p>The lawns of Rancho de la Luna spread out before her, dark and green. The whip-poor-will called again, lonely in the quiet. The breeze was jasmine scented, a fragrance Em well remembered from her childhood, and she thought she could catch the sound of the gentle Pacific lapping at the sandy shore. Or maybe those were cars down on the Pacific Coast Highway. Either way, Rancho de la Luna certainly had a prime location. God only knew what this wedding would cost. The place itself had to be top dollar, let alone the food, band, flowers and activities.</p><p>Em\u2019s wedding was going to have been in her parents\u2019 house. Mom and Dad had worked side by side in silence each weekend for a year, getting the yard ready. Dad had even built a trellised archway, an adorably crooked little structure.</p><p>Boo-hoo-hoo. There were worse things in the world than being jilted by a fianc\u00e9. She knew that. She\u2019d made a nice life for herself in Manningsport. Loved her job. Loved her boss, loved Carol, even loved the dopey Everett. She had friends. She had a dog.</p><p>It was just that feeling of being alone. Coming home to an empty, dark house night after night. Week after week after month of not finding anyone she could picture spending a lifetime with.</p><p>Seemed like Kevin had been the love of her life. Old Kevin, that was.</p><p>She sighed and looked at her watch. She\u2019d been awake for an hour already. Well, the Kindle hadn\u2019t been invented for nothing. \u201cElmore Leonard, here we come,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She jumped at the sound of a thud from Jack\u2019s room. A really loud thud. \u201cJack? You okay?\u201d she called.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>Emmaline went back inside. A door joined their rooms, and she knocked. \u201cJack? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Nada.</p><p>Then there was another crash and some glass breaking.</p><p>The door was locked. \u201cJack! Open the door, buddy.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear any movement inside.</p><p>She knocked again, more loudly this time. \u201cJack, it\u2019s Emmaline. Open up, okay?\u201d</p><p>Five seconds, and no answer.</p><p>Okay. Time for some police work.</p><p>HE HAD JOSH DEINER by the arm now, and he was pulling him up. And really, this wasn\u2019t so hard after all; why had he been dreading going down here? It wasn\u2019t even cold, which was weird, because Anderson Cooper was on the shore narrating the action, and he kept saying how cold it was.</p><p>The car was deeper than Jack remembered, but that was okay, because it was warm and there were sea otters and the Deiner kid was even smiling a little, as if this was almost a joke between him and Jack. He wouldn\u2019t open his eyes, though. The other boys had. They\u2019d swum as gracefully as the otters, but Josh was pretending to be unconscious, probably because he wanted to be an actor. Jack knew that because Anderson Cooper had said so.</p><p>Then all the sea otters darted away, like fish do when the shark is coming.</p><p>But it was cold, all of a sudden, and Jack looked up. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have swum so far down, because the surface was far, far away. Weird that he could hold his breath this long. Actually, he couldn\u2019t, could he?</p><p>Suddenly, his lungs felt like chunks of coal, and it was getting dark; oh, shit, the ice was closing over them, a solid ceiling of ice blocking out the purple and red sunset, and Jack heard it close, it closed with a crash like glass, and he really, really needed to breathe now. He looked at Josh, and Josh\u2019s eyes were open now, and he was smiling, but it wasn\u2019t a nice smile. He grabbed Jack\u2019s arm and started sinking, pulling Jack down because Josh was already dead and furious that Jack hadn\u2019t saved him, and he wasn\u2019t going to be dead alone. Jack tried to pull free, tried to hit Josh in the face, but his arms were too heavy and slow, so he pinned the boy against the car\u2014</p><p>\u201cJack! Jack! You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re dreaming, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>There was a woman here. Underneath him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWake up, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Right. Emmaline. He was gripping her wrists, the sheets twisted around him, and had her half pinned. The small lamp on the desk had been turned on.</p><p>He jerked back, releasing her wrists. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and his voice was hoarse. He ran a hand through his hair and found that it was sweaty. He was sweaty, in fact. All of him.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink of water?\u201d she asked, oddly calm for a woman who\u2019d just been grabbed by a na**d sweaty man.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He was naked, too. He always slept that way.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just got up and went into the bathroom. He sat against the headboard and straightened the covers. Looked around, his breath still coming hard.</p><p>Actually, he had a glass of water somewhere. Ah. There it was, shattered on the floor, alongside the lamp.</p><p>Fourth time this week he\u2019d had the same dream, more or less. The sea otters had been new.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d he asked when she came back in the room.</p><p>\u201cI did knock,\u201d she said, handing him the glass. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer, so I climbed onto your balcony. Very cat burglar of me. By the way, you should lock your doors at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured the odds of an intruder would be low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot low enough,\u201d she said with a grin. She bent down and picked up the lamp, turned it on, then started picking up the pieces of glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou stay in that bed,\u201d she said. \u201cI bet you sleep na**d as a frog, and I don\u2019t want a show just now.\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve made a joke, except Josh\u2019s face was still burned in his mind, that unforgiving, ruthless smile.</p><p>Emmaline put the fragments of the glass on the table. \u201cDo you have nightmares a lot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like a doozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember what it was about.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look as if she knew he was lying. Better that than having her go all Dr. Freud on him.</p><p>He should be over this by now. The accident had taken place twenty days ago. Three of the kids were as right as rain.</p><p>Josh Deiner was holding his own.</p><p>If you could call a coma holding your own.</p><p>\u201cMove over,\u201d she said, and he did.</p><p>She sat next to him, on top of the covers, and took one of the many pillows the hotel provided, holding it on her lap. Looked at him. Pushed her hair off her face. It was a utilitarian gesture\u2014hair is obscuring vision: fix. So different from Hadley\u2019s sex-kitteny moves.</p><p>But Emmaline had something going on nonetheless. Her hair was dark and thick, and she had on sock-monkey pajama bottoms and a tank top. Nice rack. He tried not to notice.</p><p>He sensed he was about to be lectured on the importance of getting counseling, maybe something on post-traumatic stress disorder, or a pat on the shoulder and a reminder that all four kids would\u2019ve drowned without him, not just Josh, and even Josh was holding his own, and he couldn\u2019t beat himself up.</p><p>\u201cWant some chocolate?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting, she got up, unlocked the door that apparently connected their rooms\u2014Jack had hardly noticed it\u2014and came back a second later with a Hershey bar. With almonds, no less. She plunked herself down next to him and unwrapped the candy bar. \u201cI brought a stash. Don\u2019t tell on me, or they\u2019ll make me do sit-ups or something.\u201d She broke the bar in half and handed him his chunk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a bite of the chocolate.

Morbid curiosity, too.\u201d She took a bite of the Hershey bar. Her half was bigger, and it made him like her more for some reason. \u201cYou know. Is your ex really over you? Are you really over him?\u201d She shot him a glance. \u201cYou must know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you, having Hadley back in town?\u201d</p> <p>He finished his half (his third, really). \u201cI\u2019d rather she wasn\u2019t, but she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she want to get back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThink you\u2019ll give her a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Would you give Kevin another chance?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She finished her candy bar and licked the wrapper, and Jack felt a jolt straight to his groin.</p><p>\u201cI probably would,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Kevin I fell in love with would be worth a second chance, blah blah, who cares.\u201d She was quiet a second. \u201cBut he\u2019s New Kevin now. I guess people change. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Hadley?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was the dim light and the late hour or the intimacy of sharing a candy bar, or just to think about something else, but Jack found himself answering. \u201cShe probably didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I saw what I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are stupid that way,\u201d Emmaline concurred, and, much to his surprise, he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cHow are women stupid, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey go to their ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, hoping for something that will probably never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you like to happen? For him to leave the trainer and beg you to take him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fun to picture,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut no. I guess just some kind of...apology, maybe?\u201d She blushed.</p><p>Funny. She wasn\u2019t bothered by him lying on top of her or the fact that he was indeed na**d as a frog under the covers, or the fact that he\u2019d been thrashing around breaking things. But she blushed admitting all she wanted was a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he have to be sorry for?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>She wadded up the candy wrapper and tossed it neatly into the wastebasket. \u201cThree pointer.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing. The comment in People, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat comment in People?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, Jack, with three sisters, I figured you\u2019d be up on town gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re white noise as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>Another blush. \u201cHe said I was unsupportive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t unsupportive, Jack! I was supportive! I was 1950s girdle supportive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that you were very supportive,\u201d he said, biting down on a smile. \u201cSupportive of what, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. You\u2019re a terrible date. Of him losing 150 pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Well, good for him. So it changed him, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Old Kevin was pretty fantastic. New Kevin is a self-obsessed idiot.\u201d She gave him an assessing, coplike look, one he recognized from Levi. \u201cYou okay now?\u201d</p><p>Jack felt his smile turn to wood. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you. Sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI was awake anyway.\u201d She stood up. \u201cHope you sleep better the rest of the night, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d walk you to the door, except I\u2019m na**d as a frog.\u201d</p><p>She smiled over her shoulder and unlocked the door that connected their rooms. \u201cCall me if you need me.\u201d Her tone was matter-of-fact and not unfriendly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t lock the door behind her.</p><p>Jack considered that.</p><p>It had been a long time since he\u2019d slept with a woman.</p><p>Emmaline smelled nice. She didn\u2019t talk too much. She didn\u2019t ask those stupid date questions, like what was his ideal evening and did he see himself with kids in five years. She didn\u2019t seem to be assessing him for genetic potential of her future children, and she hadn\u2019t flirted with him once. She didn\u2019t ask questions about the accident.</p><p>Him being na**d as a frog hadn\u2019t had any effect on her.</p><p>She was simply...nice. Well, no, that wasn\u2019t the right word.</p><p>She was easy to be with. She was honest. He liked the edge she had to her and the tolerant affection she had for her family, so clear and yet meted out with eye rolls and snarky comments.</p><p>She smelled good.</p><p>She had a spectacular ass.</p><p>Her upper lip was a little fuller than her bottom lip, and he wondered what it would be like to kiss her.</p><p>And if he had her in bed with him, he\u2019d have something to think about other than the Deiner kid.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>EMMALINE DECIDED TO embrace her California roots the next morning and go for a run on the beach trail.</p><p>It was early. She was still on East Coast time, and she figured she\u2019d be safe. Also, running had always been her thing. She wasn\u2019t fast and she didn\u2019t go terribly far, but there was something about the simple action of running\u2014you didn\u2019t have to be good at it to have it work. That and a kickboxing class kept her in shape for her job. If she stopped eating like a college football player, she\u2019d probably slim down a bit. Be a size eight, maybe. But the time she\u2019d spent with Kevin when he was losing weight had made her hate dieting in all its forms. Besides, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s would fold without her.</p><p>Em had never really had an issue with her figure. Overall, she liked how she looked. She was tall and big-boned and strong.</p><p>But around people like Naomi, she felt grotesque. Colleen O\u2019Rourke was also gorgeous and slim and perfect, but there was a difference. Every time Emmaline had ever seen Naomi, she was in some sort of pose that emphasized her perfectly muscled arms or flat stomach. Colleen, by comparison, was normal. Also, Naomi wanted people to feel crappy about how they looked. It was her job to prey on people and make them think they needed her to direct their every move.</p><p>Sure had worked on Kevin.</p><p>Kevin, who had once told Emmaline that every morning when he woke up next to her, he wondered what he\u2019d done to get so lucky.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, Neal,\u201d she said to herself. She pulled on her running shorts, sports bra and Body by Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s T-shirt, then pulled on her Nikes and headed out.</p><p>No one else was around. The hot yoga people were not in sight, thank you, baby Jesus. A bleary-eyed waiter gave her a perfunctory smile as he set out a tea station. Dang. That\u2019s right. No caffeine. Hard to believe people paid money to stay here.</p><p>That being said, it was beautiful. Em ran down the trail toward the Pacific. Coreopsis was in bloom in bright yellow clumps amid the silvery sagebrush, cheerful little beacons in the semigloom.</p><p>At the top of the cliff, she stopped.</p><p>The sky was still deep blue, but a line of pink cracked the horizon. There were a few cars racing down, but she could hear the ocean, and her hair fluttered in the breeze.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss much about SoCal, but she did miss this view. She started running again. No music today\u2014she wanted to hear the birds. The trail was wide and twisting, flanked by the bushy foliage of the area. It was cool this morning, maybe fifty degrees.</p><p>It had been kind of nice, sitting with Jack last night, even if he was in the throes of PTSD. He\u2019d have an easier time if he\u2019d acknowledge it. She wasn\u2019t the child of psychologists for nothing; her bookcase back home had quite a few books on stress and trauma and people\u2019s reactions. She figured it would help with the high-intensity calls that she might have to go on as a police officer.</p><p>A coyote ran across the trail in front of her, a scrawny little thing compared with the beasts they had back home.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. Twenty minutes in one direction, twenty minutes back... That\u2019d be about four miles altogether (oh, fine, it was closer to three). Who cared? Any activity would absolutely justify a trip into town for some jelly donuts at Nance\u2019s Coffee Shop, if it was still in business, please God.</p><p>When she hit the twenty-minute mark, she turned around, inspired by the thought of donuts. Then she heard footsteps behind her.</p><p>Kevin. A shirtless Kevin, no less.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emmaline!\u201d he said, and damn if the sound of his voice\u2014that friendly, lovely voice\u2014didn\u2019t make her heart jump.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kevin. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d He stopped and wiped his forehead with his forearm.</p><p>He was shirtless. Had she mentioned that? Oh, yes. All that perfectly perfect perfection had an impact. He looked like a feature in Men\u2019s Health or some p**n o website. Heck, if men in p**n os looked like that, she just might start watching.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d he asked, and it was such a normal question.</p><p>\u201cGood! Good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWant to walk back? I usually like to run at least twelve miles, but it\u2019d be nice to catch up with you. Hear what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Her heart was jackhammering.</p><p>\u201cSo how far did you run this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um...just a couple miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can make up for it later. We\u2019re doing a half marathon tomorrow before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you Naomi\u2019s on the short list to be on The Biggest Loser?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Kevin. You haven\u2019t told me anything. We haven\u2019t talked in three years, remember?\u201d And, man, that would really suck, having to see Naomi\u2019s face on TV, snarling at sobbing contestants.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cWell, you know Naomi\u2014she\u2019d be the best. She has an audition on the thirteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck has nothing to do with it, Emmaline. It\u2019s all about work and goals. You set goals and commit to them.\u201d</p><p>One upside of being dumped\u2014didn\u2019t have to hear those stupid sayings anymore. She could also point out that he\u2019d committed to marrying her and hadn\u2019t stayed loyal to that. Then again, water under the bridge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, surprising her. \u201cI sound like a jerk.\u201d He stopped for a second, bent down and picked a small yellow flower. Handed it to her with that boyish grin she remembered so well. \u201cHow have you been, Emmaline? I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d His eyes were kind.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>It was a glimpse of Old Kevin. The sweet, thoughtful guy she\u2019d adored for so long.</p><p>The stutter twitched in its sleep.</p><p>She took a deep breath and thought in a British accent.</p><p>\u201cFine, really. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom says you\u2019re a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you like the work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s very\u2014\u201d Intimate, she wanted to say, but the I sound got stuck tight.</p><p>The stutter opened its eyes.</p><p>Better to say nothing than to mangle a word. She tipped her head as if searching for the right word.</p><p>\u201cRewarding, I\u2019d imagine,\u201d Kevin suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your boyfriend, what does he do?\u201d</p><p>Correcting Kevin would require more words than she was willing to risk. \u201cHe\u2019s a winemaker,\u201d she said. There. A complete sentence, no mangling anywhere. Three entire words. Five syllables.</p><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t drink anymore, but that\u2019s a very cool profession.\u201d He stopped, turning to look at her. She\u2019d forgotten how ridiculously lush his eyelashes were. \u201cEm, I have to admit, I\u2019ve thought about you so much over the past three years.\u201d</p><p>She cut him a sharp glance. Was it coming? The apology? More?</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you. You seemed so...broken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A cold fist of fury clenched in her stomach. Really? she wanted to say. Broken, as in \u201cheartbroken\u201d? And why would that be? Because you jilted me two months before our wedding? Because you left me for some exercise-addicted shrew and told the world I sabotaged you when in fact I loved you with all my heart for seventeen years? Why on earth would you worry?</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d ever get over me,\u201d he said, reaching out to tuck some hair behind her ear.</p><p>She jerked back. \u201cWell, somehow I managed. They dropped the suicide watch a while ago.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile, and she remembered it well. The commiseration smile, back when he was fat and she was a stutterer, the \u201cyeah, I know what that\u2019s like\u201d smile, and somehow that was the worst thing of all. How dare he feel sorry for her? How dare he worry about her? How dare he bring back her stutter when she really should be past this, goddamn it?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI hope you and your guy will be as happy as Nay and I are.\u201d Nay. How gross. \u201cAre things serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. In fact, we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit and whiskey. Not smart. Not smart at all.</p><p>But it was kind of great to see Kevin\u2019s mouth drop open. The stutter, too, was shocked and retreated to a corner to regroup.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Kevin asked. His cheeks mottled with color, and he glanced down at her left hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ring?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being resized.\u201d Well, well, well. Seemed like she was a pretty excellent liar. The things you never knew you could do until you had to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>He sounded anything but.</p><p>Guess Kevin had gotten a good bit of satisfaction, thinking about her mooning over him (which she had), staying home every Friday night (okay, yes, she did that a lot), feeling like no one would ever fall for her again. (Fine! She had those thoughts, all of them!)</p><p>Even so, this walk had just become a lot more enjoyable.</p><p>\u201cSo when are you getting married?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t set a date yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Uh...this is great, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cListen, I think I\u2019ll run the rest of the way, okay? See you later.\u201d</p><p>Because satisfaction aside, she had to tell Jack. Pronto.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll see you back at the ranch. You\u2019re playing some of the couples games with us later, right?\u201d He smiled, but it wasn\u2019t the sweet Old Kevin smile from before. \u201cWait till you see Naomi in a bikini. That\u2019ll get you motivated to lose some weight.\u201d</p><p>Oooh. War had been declared.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is fixated on physical appearance,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cSome people put more emphasis on kindness, loyalty and decency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I used to tell myself the same thing when I was fat. Off you go. Burn those calories. Hey, I\u2019ll race you.\u201d</p> <p>JACK WAS SHAVING when the police tried to bust down the door.</p><p>Correction. When Officer Neal tried to bust down the door, dressed in running shorts and a T-shirt, drenched in sweat and blowing like a steam train. \u201cHave we been invaded?\u201d he asked, opening up. \u201cAliens? Meteors? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d She pushed past him, ignoring the fact that he was wearing only a towel. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh\u2014women\u2014he went back into the bathroom and continued shaving. She followed, flipped down the lid of the toilet and sat herself down. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself at ho\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I said I didn\u2019t want the whole pretend boyfriend thing, but I told Kevin we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I demand conjugal rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to talk to your fianc\u00e9?\u201d He rinsed the razor and continued shaving.</p><p>\u201cHe was being so nice. He even picked me a flower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! Oh, you\u2019re being sarcastic. Save it, pal. Anyway, he was very sweet. Then he was all condescending, and then I said something about us being engaged. Just let it ride, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cMy parents are pathologically incapable of keeping a secret. I can\u2019t tell them. I\u2019ll call them after we leave this hellhole.\u201d</p><p>Another set of frenzied knocking broke the quiet, this time on what sounded like Emmaline\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline?\u201d said her mother. \u201cOpen up! Why did you keep this from us? Are you sure it isn\u2019t a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the tangled web we weave,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter open the door, Pooh Bear. And give me a second to get dressed, okay?\u201d</p><p>She finally noticed. Her face went red. She glanced away from him, then back at his torso, and Jack smiled. \u201cWe have a lifetime to explore each other,\u201d he said. \u201cNow open the door before they get a battering ram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate lying,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYour other option is to come clean with Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate lying that much.\u201d Then she went through the adjoining door into her room and greeted her family.</p><p>Jack finished shaving, rinsed his face and pulled on jeans and a T-shirt. Doting fianc\u00e9, check. Hey. Women did things like this. Hadn\u2019t Colleen O\u2019Rourke asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend? Or was that Shelayne Schanta? Whatever. Women got squirrelly around their exes. It was a known fact.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Angela crowed when Jack joined them. \u201cJack! You devil!\u201d</p><p>Emmaline\u2019s father shook Jack\u2019s hand vigorously. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>Her mom looked puzzled. \u201cEmmaline, are you... I was so sure you were\u2014\u201d Angela gave her a gentle nudge. \u201cWell,\u201d she amended. \u201cThis is very happy news.\u201d She gave Em an awkward hug\u2014awkward because Em looked as relaxed as a concrete wall.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a ring?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cTell them about the ring, sweetheart,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s nice. Very, um, pretty. It\u2019s being resized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cut? Emerald? Cushion? Solitaire?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of round,\u201d Em mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have two rooms?\u201d Mrs. Neal asked, glancing around.</p><p>Jack lifted an eyebrow. He\u2019d let Em handle this one.</p><p>\u201cI... Jack has...a medical...condition. He...he can\u2019t, uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShy bladder?\u201d her father suggested. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m the same way.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline looked as uncomfortable as if she were giving birth to a large bad-tempered porcupine. \u201cIt\u2019s just more spacious this way. Space is good. We like space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final frontier,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cSo. Who\u2019s doing all those stupid couples activities today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were just friends,\u201d Mrs. Neal said. \u201cI try so hard to establish an intimate mother-daughter bond with you, Emmaline, but you\u2019ve kept this entire relationship from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected,\u201d her father said, nodding. \u201cI picked up on something in her tone the last time we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t!\u201d her mother spat. \u201cYou thought she was g*y, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s new fianc\u00e9e looked pained. She started to answer, stopped, then said, \u201cI have to make a phone call. I just remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d he whispered as she bolted past, closing the door to his room. Then she came back immediately, grabbed her phone and went back, slamming the door.</p><p>\u201cThis must\u2019ve happened fast,\u201d Em\u2019s mother said. \u201cWhy the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t want to waste time,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>There was a collective gasp.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>\u201cIs Emmaline pregnant?\u201d Angela whispered.</p><p>Jack grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, let her answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline!\u201d her mother shouted. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>She burst back into the room. \u201cNo! What did you tell them? I\u2019m not pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI misspoke,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s not pregnant. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are! Aren\u2019t you?\u201d Angela crowed. \u201cOh, hooray! I\u2019m going to be an auntie!\u201d</p><p>AN EON OF MUTTERED lying later, the Neals left, firmly convinced that Em had a bun in the oven.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that?\u201d Emmaline wailed. \u201cHonestly, Jack! I\u2019m gonna have to pee on a stick before they\u2019ll believe I\u2019m not preggers, and my mother will want to be right there when I do, so thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a little blurry, seeing that I only learned we were engaged thirty seconds before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! I\u2019d think it\u2019d take a little longer to conceive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get right on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, Jack. And knock it off, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have somewhere to be right now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She flung herself into the chair. \u201cYes. Couples volleyball starts in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said.</p><p>She got up and started yanking drawers open. \u201cAnd to top it all off, I have to wear a bathing suit. God hates me today.\u201d</p><p>With that, she went into the bathroom and closed the door.</p><p>Which was too bad. Now that they were engaged, Jack felt he at least deserved to see her naked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t couples volleyball, Jack soon learned as they walked to the pool. It was couples chicken. Well, it was called something else, something crunchy and fake sounding, like Partnership Water Celebration, but it was chicken. The pool was a vast, turquoise thing shaped like a shamrock, waterfall on one side, an organic kale smoothie bar on the other. Several very fit couples were shrieking and laughing and flexing, looking like a commercial.</p><p>Beside him, Emmaline groaned. She was wearing what looked to be a white parachute. He\u2019d seen burkas that revealed more skin.</p><p>It was a shame they weren\u2019t going to swim in the ocean. Apparently, the ocean was too cold without a wet suit (Californians had clearly never swum in Keuka in May, the way Jack did every year).</p><p>At the memory of cold lake water, his heart began to thud. He stopped abruptly, and Emmaline, walking beside him, stopped, too. \u201cJack? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Now his breathing was funny, shaking in and out of his chest. His heart felt the size of a cantaloupe. Something was wrong; he might be having a heart attack\u2014</p><p>Then Em was towing him to a lounge chair and pushing him in it. He grabbed her wrist. \u201cNice and easy,\u201d she said, sitting so they were face-to-face. \u201cSlow down your breathing, big guy.\u201d She reached out with her free hand and pushed some hair off his forehead. \u201cNice and slow.\u201d</p><p>He was supposed to be looking after her this weekend. Not the other way around.</p><p>\u201cThe weather\u2019s amazing today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cSay what you will about Southern California, we have great weather.\u201d</p><p>She smelled like sunscreen. Also, she had freckles. He\u2019d never noticed that before.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could take a drive later on. It would be good to get away from here for a little while. Not that I\u2019m having a terrible time or anything.\u201d She smiled a little. Twisted her hand so he wasn\u2019t gripping her wrist anymore, but left her hand in his. \u201cThere\u2019s a great donut place not far from here. Well, there was. I hope it\u2019s still in business. I\u2019ll buy you a sugar\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her, and her mouth opened in surprise. Her lips were soft, and that was enough. That was all he needed. Her soft, pretty mouth, and her hair, hot from the sunshine, under his hand as he cupped the back of her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The panic attack drifted to the back of his brain. The breeze fluttered her hair against his face, and he smoothed it away, still kissing her, which he should probably stop. And he would. Eventually.</p><p>She did it for him. Pulled back a few inches and didn\u2019t look at him. Pressed her lips together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s... It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>Colleen O\u2019Rourke\u2014well, Colleen Campbell now\u2014was suddenly at their side. Jack hadn\u2019t seen her yet\u2014they\u2019d been on different flights out here\u2014but she was an old friend of the bride or something. \u201cHoly Saint Patrick, were you two just kissing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone, Coll,\u201d said her twin.</p><p>\u201cHey, Connor,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenance.\u201d He sighed and looked at his sister. \u201cI\u2019m her babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my date,\u201d Colleen said at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cColleen and Connor,\u201d boomed a voice. \u201cPlease report to the pool immediately.\u201d Ah. The bride had a bullhorn. Nice touch.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Connor muttered.</p><p>\u201cLucas couldn\u2019t come,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBelieve it or not, Con wasn\u2019t my first choice. But Lucas\u2019s niece had an appendectomy, so he had to go to Chicago yesterday, and he forced Connor to come with me, because I\u2019m a delicate flower, Jack, as you may have heard, and also percolating a baby.\u201d She paused for breath. \u201cYou guys playing chicken? Con and I are a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is horrifying,\u201d Connor said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to do this. I don\u2019t even like hugging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop. It\u2019s a piggyback ride. It won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might, the way you\u2019re eating these days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColleen and Connor, report to poolside immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe her? I didn\u2019t like her in college, and I don\u2019t like her now.\u201d Colleen looked up at Em. \u201cAre you guys playing?\u201d</p><p>Emmaline, who hadn\u2019t said boo, cleared her throat. \u201cWe thought it was volleyball. By the way, Jack and I are pretend engaged.\u201d</p><p>Connor gave him a look, and Jack shrugged. Colleen clapped her hands. \u201cI told you\u2014you should\u2019ve just committed to that plan to start with. Come on, Connor. Naomi\u2019s summoning me. God, I wish Lucas was here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cWell, believe me, I didn\u2019t want to be here with my grumpy-ass brother\u2014oh, and by the way, Connor, you should\u2019ve said yes to coming to this with Emmaline, because then you wouldn\u2019t be here with your sister as your date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your date. I\u2019m your keeper,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cEmily and Jack, report to poolside immediately,\u201d boomed the bride. What was that term? Bridezilla? Yeah. That worked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Colleen sighed. \u201cCome on, Connor. Prepare to fight to the death. Your death, of course. You have to save me and my unborn child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so wrong,\u201d Connor said, but he obeyed, and off they went.</p><p>Jack looked at Emmaline, who was still not looking at him. \u201cSorry about the kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s...whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him abruptly. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were blue. Dark blue.</p><p>\u201cTalking me down,\u201d he said. \u201cLetting me kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Made a weird snorting noise. \u201cIt was a huge sacrifice, Jack. I mean, have you looked in the mirror? You\u2019re hideous. Hey, did I tell you I\u2019m going to be a crisis negotiator? Well, sort of. I mean, I\u2019m taking a class when we get back home. You know. Hostage situations. Suicidal people. So it was good practice. Not that you\u2019re taking any hostages, or, uh...never mind. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>She was nervous. It was kind of cute.</p><p>\u201cReady to play chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be fun. Take that thing off and let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have come to this wedding,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop. Be brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened. Then she scowled at him, grumbled a little more and yanked the burka over her head.</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Now why the hell would she be worried about wearing a bathing suit when she looked like that? She had long legs, a really nice ass and an amazing rack that was on fantastic display, and whoever made that suit should be given a Nobel prize in engineering, because wow.</p><p>Emmaline wasn\u2019t lean by any stretch of the imagination, but Jack always kind of liked that. She looked like a woman, not a prepubescent girl. The kind of woman who\u2019d feel soft and sturdy at the same time.</p><p>Let\u2019s find out, his brain told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she growled.</p><p>He looked away. \u201cMy grandmother has that same bathing suit,\u201d he said. \u201cTry a bikini next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll also try setting myself on fire, since it would be just as fun. Bad enough that I\u2019m here in the Land of Plastic People.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily and Jack, get over here now!\u201d boomed the bride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you a bikini,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cNow that we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with. I apologize in advance for any herniated discs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Be happy. We\u2019re engaged and possibly expecting a baby.\u201d He took her hand and headed for the pool.</p><p>The thought of going into the water didn\u2019t bother him. A pool wasn\u2019t a lake. There was no chance of a car accident here. Everyone would be fine.</p><p>The bride put down her bullhorn. \u201cAbout time,\u201d she said, scanning Emmaline up and down.</p><p>To her credit, Em ignored her and dived neatly into the deep end of the pool, then surfaced, looking as if she wanted to be banged silly.</p><p>Okay, Jack, enough of that. The poor kid is going through a tough time. Also, that may be transference on your part.</p><p>He dived in, too, the cool water sliding over his head. No problems. Good. He was a navy man, after all. He couldn\u2019t be afraid of the water. And he wasn\u2019t. Here was proof.</p><p>He swam over to Emmaline. \u201cMount up, Pooh Bear,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be looking at her br**sts again. Being in the water only made them look more...buoyant. \u201cYou\u2019re rocking this suit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re gorgeous yourself. And where does a winemaker get washboard abs, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Nice of her to notice. \u201cI\u2019m a Greek god, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent the fact that you remember that.\u201d But she smiled a little nonetheless.</p><p>There was a splash from the deep end. \u201cOh, gosh golly!\u201d Colleen called. \u201cWe lost. Con, let\u2019s get something to eat. What do you say? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Jack turned to Emmaline and smiled. \u201cUpsy-daisy, Pooh.\u201d</p><p>EMMALINE WAS NOT HAPPY.</p><p>The miracle bathing suit was constricting her stomach to the point of Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s corset, and she was having difficulty breathing.</p><p>The Ta-Ta Ta-Dahs were in place, and while she was sure she never wanted to meet the weird, breast-obsessed, Mommy-didn\u2019t-nurse-me person who\u2019d come up with them, she had to give him credit. The girls looked quite ambitious.</p><p>Jack kept looking, which might\u2019ve been gratifying, were it not for (a) the look was fake, and (b) the two cold fake raw chicken cutlets felt just as disgusting as one might think.</p><p>And now she had to climb on Jack\u2019s shoulders. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t cry out in agony and crumple.</p><p>However, those shoulders looked pretty sturdy to her. In fact, all of him looked...so... He was... What was the question again?</p><p>Because even in this crowd, where wedding guests seemed to have been chosen from the modeling lineup for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Jack stood out. Not only was he ridiculously handsome, he was working-man delicious. He wasn\u2019t ripped and chiseled (or waxed, thank heavens)...but he was, well, hell, kind of perfect.</p><p>While Kevin and the other guys looked like what they were\u2014gym addicts\u2014Jack just looked strong. He had broad shoulders that would soon be put to the test under her weight. A flat stomach that rippled with muscle. Arms that got their definition from lifting barrels (or whatever his job required him to lift, but picturing him hefting wooden barrels was quite satisfying). There was a happy trail from his navel to the waistband of his trunks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cEmily and Jack! Can you please get going here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Jack said, and before she knew it, he ducked underwater and\u2014oh, boy\u2014between her legs. Then he stood up and she was teetering on his shoulders, and how did her stomach look? Was the miracle suit all it promised to be?</p><p>She grabbed on to his forehead so she wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>\u201cYou good up there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYep! Very good,\u201d she chirped. So, so good. Lawdy, the Bitter Betrayeds were going to hear about this! Maybe she\u2019d even get a tattoo on each thigh\u2014Jack Holland\u2019s head was here.</p><p>There was a DJ set up by the smoothie bar, and the theme song to Jaws started playing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in it to win it!\u201d Naomi bellowed, clambering on top of Kevin\u2019s shoulders. Two other couples were also in this gladiator match, and both women were quite gorgeous, too, except not quite as beautiful as Naomi. Both wore string bikinis, as did the bride.</p><p>Sigh. No, no! None of that! You will not feel like an ugly duckling, she told herself firmly. You have a 93 percent accuracy rate for head shots with your Smith &amp; Wesson. You can pick up all three Cabrera triplets at once. You rock.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a dive like Colleen and Connor did,\u201d she suggested to Jack, somewhat concerned about squashing his vertebrae. \u201cWe can go get donuts instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in it to win it, too.\u201d</p><p>The rules were simple\u2014knock the other couples down. They were in a part of the pool where the water was about chest deep, and each couple had their own quadrant to defend. Hopefully, no one would fall and hit their heads, because if any blood got in the water, Em was pretty sure Naomi would go into a feeding frenzy. Even now, she was flashing a sharklike grin. The music didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Em suspected she was about to have her leg bitten off.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a strategy here?\u201d Em asked. Jack\u2019s wet hair tickled her thighs.</p><p>He looked up, the motion of his head making her squeak with lust. His beautiful blue eyes crinkled with a smile. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOn your mark!\u201d Naomi bellowed. \u201cGet set! Go!\u201d</p><p>There was a sloshing noise as all the couples charged the center. The DJ turned up the music. Duh-duh...duh-duh...duh-duh-duh-duh.</p><p>Jack reached couple number one, a redheaded woman on top of a very beautiful man. \u201cHi,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Emmaline reached out with one hand and gave the woman a gentle push.</p><p>She went down like a narcoleptic kitten. Then again, she probably weighed as much as fog.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Em said, guilt flashing immediately.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. Was it Em\u2019s imagination, or did the woman look relieved?</p><p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d Jack said, turning around. Couple number two didn\u2019t wait; the man took a dive before Emmaline even touched the woman.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Randy!\u201d Naomi bellowed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on!\u201d Kevin echoed.</p><p>It dawned on Emmaline that no one wanted to compete with the happy couple. Indeed, Naomi seemed a little ticked that the other two couples were already swimming for the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow badly do you want to win?\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do.\u201d With that, Jack surged forward, and Em gave a little shriek. Oh. This was almost sexy time. Would it be wrong to ask him to do that again? Because the feeling of his head against her\u2014</p><p>Then Kevin and Naomi were right in front of them. Naomi\u2019s savagely beautiful face was right in front of her in what Em could only describe as a snarl. \u201cDon\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d the trainer said, \u201cbut Kevin and I have never lost. Right, Kevster, babe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, babe,\u201d he answered obediently.</p><p>\u201cNeither have we,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to,\u201d Naomi said. \u201cThe only difference between \u2018try\u2019 and \u2018triumph\u2019 is a little \u2018umph.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to lose for that alone, Naomi.\u201d There was a smile in Jack\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI never lose,\u201d she said. Then her hands were on Em\u2019s shoulders, and she shoved, hard.</p> <p>Em locked her feet around Jack\u2019s back to keep from falling\u2014she might\u2019ve been choking him to death with her thighs, but you know what? She didn\u2019t care all of a sudden. All she wanted was for Naomi to lose at something, and she leaned in, grappling with Naomi. And really, this was idiotic. Why not just put Naomi in the Hunger Games and let her kill everyone else, but damn it, Emmaline was not going to lose.</p><p>Even so, she couldn\u2019t help but admire Naomi\u2019s gorgeous shoulders.</p><p>Then Jack stepped to the side, possibly because he was desperate to breathe, and Em leaned forward, using his momentum, and pushed. Hard. Naomi wavered, and Em imagined her as a threat to those adorable Cabrera kids and pushed again. She wasn\u2019t a badass cop for nothing.</p><p>There was a splash as both Naomi and Kevin fell.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair!\u201d Naomi shouted, smacking the water with her fist. \u201cYou can\u2019t use your body weight like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kevin said, a sulk in his voice. \u201cObviously, you weigh a lot more than Nay does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to use?\u201d Em asked. \u201cA sword? My crossbow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShake hands, kids,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRemember, humble in victory, gracious in defeat.\u201d He grinned up at her. \u201cI feel very humble, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>She was having...feelings. That smile. Those eyes. The fact that he hadn\u2019t once complained about how heavy she was.</p><p>Then he dumped her, and she was under the water. She surfaced, pushing the hair out of her face. \u201cThank you, mighty steed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was more fun than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>He was still smiling. Then his eyes dropped to her chest, and his smile faltered. \u201cUh...Em, you seem to be...deflating.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her boobage. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>One breast was plumped up and coconut shaped, same as when she\u2019d left her room earlier.</p> <p>The other was normal.</p><p>Which meant...</p><p>Panicking, she looked around. Where was it? Where was it? Maybe it just slipped... She groped herself, patted her stomach to see if it had slid...no. It wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Where was her Ta-Ta Ta-Dah?</p><p>\u201cUh...is that what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>Kevin and Naomi were talking in low voices, still in the pool, Naomi hissing, Kevin apologetic. And there on his beautiful shoulder blade, like a giant leech, was the Ta-Ta Ta-Dah.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>A seagull cried out, circling over the pool, then hovered. Em knew that pose. That was the \u201cI see dinner\u201d pose.</p><p>She lunged. Jack lunged. The seagull dived, snatched the breast booster off Kevin\u2019s shoulder, causing him to scream in surprise, which would\u2019ve made Emmaline laugh if her Ta-Ta Ta-Dah wasn\u2019t in the seagull\u2019s beak. But it was too heavy for the poor thing. The bird\u2019s head wobbled; it opened its beak and the silicone slab fell with a splat back in the pool.</p><p>She dived for it, but Jack was faster. He grabbed it and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Naomi asked.</p><p>It might be time to commit suicide.</p><p>Jack surfaced next to Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cIs this raw chicken?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cSh! No! Give it to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys cheated,\u201d Naomi said.</p><p>\u201cHow is there cheating in Partnership Water Celebration?\u201d Jack called. \u201cDon\u2019t fuss, kids. Drinks are on us.\u201d He turned back to Em. \u201cHere,\u201d he said more quietly, giving it to Emmaline. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a rematch!\u201d Naomi demanded.</p><p>Em grabbed the disgusting, slimy boob enhancer (that had just been in a seagull\u2019s beak). Should she put it back? Or leave it? If the bird had any diseases (avian flu, for example), would the chlorine in the pool water kill off the germs?</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou gonna put that back, or shall I?\u201d He lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, at least let me...here.\u201d He pulled her a few steps away and hugged her. \u201cGo for it. You can tell me later why you\u2019re wearing raw chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not chicken. It makes...never mind.\u201d She slid the offending object back under her breast.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t help noticing how it felt to be pressed up close to Jack. Wet. Warm. Slippery.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering how the girls defied gravity like that,\u201d he murmured. She could feel his voice rumble in his chest as she adjusted her suit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me,\u201d she ordered. \u201cThis is a stressful weekend.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a little and looked down at her. A drop of water slid down his neck and pooled against his collarbone, and Em suddenly really, really wanted to lick it.</p><p>\u201cJust for the record, you don\u2019t need any enhancing,\u201d he said, and her knees buckled a little. His eyes crinkled, and he kissed her forehead.</p><p>Crap on a cracker. She was falling for this guy.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said briskly, and then, because the mortification of Jack\u2014and possibly everyone else\u2014knowing what she\u2019d stuck in her bathing suit was settling over her, she swam to the stairs and got out of the pool.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cMY KINGDOM FOR a cheeseburger,\u201d Colleen murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou said it, sister,\u201d Em answered.</p><p>The rehearsal \u201cdinner\u201d consisted of a raw vegetable buffet. Drinks were decaffeinated green tea (hot or iced), mint tea, nonfat soy milk, water and cranberry juice, the real kind that made your entire body pucker. Emmaline had a raging headache, probably due to a frightening lack of caffeine, carbs and ice cream in her diet for the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>The first thing she would do when she got home, after loving up Sarge, of course, would be to take him to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s\u2014Sarge was theoretically a police dog in training\u2014and order the nachos grande and two of the biggest burgers they had. One for each of them.</p><p>Her stomach growled.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d Colleen asked, putting some kale on her plate.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Em answered. She\u2019d knocked on his door, but there\u2019d been no answer. Maybe the jet lag had caught up with him. Maybe he was walking on the beach. Maybe he was in traction after the chicken game. Maybe he just needed a break from this dopey weekend.</p><p>She hoped he wasn\u2019t...well, suffering. That lost look that came across his face just killed her.</p><p>\u201cBack to the bridesminions\u2019 table.\u201d Colleen sighed. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Right. She and Jack had been assigned to a table of Russian-speaking older people. Naomi\u2019s relatives from Irkutsk, if Em had understood correctly, based on the map the sole English speaker had drawn on a napkin. A great-aunt or grandmother was filling her purse with cucumber sticks. One old man was asleep. Another kept looking at her boobs (even un-Ta-Dahed, they looked pretty nice in this dress, Em thought), but otherwise, they just talked among themselves. Em smiled at them occasionally to show she was one of the nice Americans. Only the boob-looker smiled back, and he was missing two teeth.</p><p>Angela, Mom and Dad were seated with Kevin\u2019s parents; Angela had very loyally offered to sit with Em, but Mrs. Bates (who had once quite loved Emmaline, if memory served) had almost given birth to a Komodo dragon at the suggestion. Em assured her that it\u2019d be fine back here in Siberia, and the truth was, she was relieved not to have to make conversation.</p><p>Kevin and Naomi sat at a tiny table for two under a spotlight.</p><p>They really did look in love.</p><p>\u201cOkay, folks, time to burn off some calories and dance!\u201d the DJ barked. Yes, heaven forbid those ten or twelve calories from dinner be allowed to simply rest. The Black-Eyed Peas came booming from the speakers.</p><p>Any minute, Em suspected, Kevin and Naomi would do a choreographed dance to their special song.</p><p>The song she and Kevin were going to dance to at their wedding was \u201cUnforgettable\u201d by Nat King Cole. Em still couldn\u2019t hear it without a small brain bleed.</p><p>\u201cNaomi and Kevin wanted you all to have one of these as a party favor,\u201d said a little girl who was holding a basket. Please, God, it was full of bottles of Jack Daniel\u2019s.</p><p>But no.</p><p>The little girl held out something all too familiar. People magazine, \u201cHalf Their Size\u201d edition.</p><p>On the cover was a picture of Kevin holding up a pair of his enormous pants. Pants that Emmaline had bought him, since he\u2019d hated shopping for himself back then. Probably loved it now.</p><p>The Russian relatives opened the magazine. Em slid hers into her purse. She could burn it later. Not that it would help. She had the damn thing memorized.</p><p>Page forty-seven. The usual stuff about how Kevin had struggled with food all his life, his blood pressure issues, his prediabetes. And then the killer blow:</p><p>\u201cI was living with someone who wasn\u2019t supportive,\u201d says Bates. \u201cShe sabotaged my efforts, always buying food that fueled my addiction. Then I met Naomi, and I realized I had to leave that other relationship. She was just too unsupportive.\u201d</p><p>Naomi Norman, Kevin\u2019s trainer and soon-to-be wife, chimes in. \u201cThe people we surround ourselves with make a huge difference in our lives,\u201d she says, laying her hand on Kevin\u2019s now-sculpted arm. \u201cI believe in Kevin and support all his dreams and goals. He\u2019s the most remarkable person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Gack.</p><p>Also, ouch. And now, everyone was poring over their magazines, dazzled with Kevin\u2019s weight loss. Maybe tomorrow, rather than just walk out to the altar, New Kevin would burst through a picture of Old Kevin, like they did on The Biggest Loser.</p><p>Though there weren\u2019t as many friends from college as Em had expected, a few people knew who she was, and looks were shot her way. At least the Russians didn\u2019t appear to care; they were looking at pictures of whatever red-carpet event had been covered in the same issue.</p><p>My kingdom for a really strong martini, Em thought. She smiled at the Russians, then checked her phone. Angela had just texted her. This is the tackiest wedding I\u2019ve ever been to. I plan to burn my magazine in a dramatic pyre and eat ice cream as I do.</p><p>Em looked over at her sister and smiled.</p><p>Faith had also texted her, asking how things were going. So had Shelayne and Allison. Shelayne had sent a picture of Sarge sleeping on her bed (under the covers), and Em smiled. It would be so, so good to get back home.</p><p>Jack still wasn\u2019t here. She\u2019d go check on him. A great excuse to leave.</p><p>Just then, the DJ tapped his mike. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, please give it up for Naomi and Kevin in their last dance as single people!\u201d The jolly beat of a familiar song came over the speakers. Bruno Mars, of course. \u201cI Think I Wanna Marry You.\u201d</p><p>How adorable.</p><p>There were shrieks and screams and giggles, and then, yes, the choreographed dance.</p><p>Kevin always had been a good dancer.</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit here?\u201d a woman asked. She was about Em\u2019s age. \u201cI\u2019m Trisha.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmmaline. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed to take a break from dancing. Feeling a little light-headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably hungry.\u201d</p><p>Trisha laughed. \u201cYeah, the food here isn\u2019t exactly filling. But I could lose a few pounds anyway. How do you know the bride and groom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI went to college with Kevin.\u201d Definitely the safest answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? I work with him now. I had a huge crush on him. Can\u2019t blame me, right? The guy is gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he is.\u201d How very well adjusted Emmaline was! She\u2019d have to give herself a sticker. Perhaps a run to a package store was also in order.</p><p>Trisha settled back and watched the dancing. \u201cGuess what I heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKevin\u2019s old fianc\u00e9e is here. She\u2019s stalking him. I guess she can\u2019t get over him and did all this hateful stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid all these vicious things to Naomi. Tried to sabotage Kevin\u2019s weight loss.\u201d She pointed to the nearest People. \u201cIt\u2019s right in there. Sad that she was so threatened. Hey, you must\u2019ve known him when he was heavier, right? Isn\u2019t his transformation amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019m the fianc\u00e9e, by the way.\u201d</p><p>It was kinda fun watching Trisha\u2019s face rearrange itself.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was invited. No stalking necessary, though I do have a dead squirrel in my suitcase for tomorrow.\u201d Em smiled sweetly. \u201cWant to come back to my room and see it? It\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Trisha fled.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun, Pooh Bear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knocked. Figured you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should\u2019ve knocked harder. I\u2019m here for a reason, after all.\u201d He scowled, and his blue, blue eyes were troubled.</p><p>Bet that nap hadn\u2019t been exactly peaceful.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Levi, by any chance?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I checked in a couple hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at the dancing couples. \u201cDid he happen to mention Josh Deiner?\u201d</p><p>Em\u2019s heart squeezed. \u201cActually, yes. He said Josh is...hanging in there.\u201d She was paraphrasing. \u201cNo change\u201d was what Levi had said.</p><p>Something flickered through Jack\u2019s eyes. \u201cAny improvement?\u201d he said, and there was so much packed into those two words.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been so easy to say something hopeful and vague, like some positive signs or no reason not to be hopeful. But she couldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>\u201cNo. But no decline, either.\u201d</p><p>Whatever had just flickered went out.</p><p>Her parents emerged from the crowd. \u201cEmmaline,\u201d Mom said. \u201cAre you feeling all right? I heard there was a fight in the pool. Should you be doing that, in your condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no fighting,\u201d she answered, suppressing a sigh. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Dad boomed. \u201cVery glad you\u2019re here! Shall we discuss future plans, son?\u201d Now that Dad thought she was straight, he was moving right into doting father-in-law.</p><p>\u201cWe were just about to take a walk, guys,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up with you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds very wise,\u201d Mom said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be easy for you, seeing Kevin moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I just care. Is that so wrong? That I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpending intimate time together is the foundation of a strong relationship,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWhich is why your mother and I didn\u2019t work out. She was too busy with her career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Your father was the one who was obsessed with his patients, Emmaline. As I\u2019m sure you remember. Jack, don\u2019t make that mistake with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I won\u2019t,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s...she\u2019s just great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a very nice couple,\u201d Mom said, and her voice was oddly wistful. \u201cMaybe we can go dress shopping together this time.\u201d</p><p>Okay, time to cut bait. Even if they were Dr. and Dr. Dysfunctional, her parents were good people. They loved her in their weird way, and Em\u2019s stomach was twisting at lying to them (or twisting because of the kale salad).</p><p>Em would come clean on Monday. Sunday, even. The very second she got out of this place.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you come home? We need to make plans for the wedding,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cUm...soon. We\u2019re gonna take that walk right now. Bye!\u201d Emmaline forced a smile and rather awkwardly groped for Jack\u2019s hand, got his wrist and practically dragged him from the dining room.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, Seabiscuit,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get out of here or I\u2019m going to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to tell, do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine either way. You want to leave? We can go home. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBefore we go anywhere, let\u2019s stop by my room first. I have contraband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you brought wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I brought wine. I\u2019m a winemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels bless you, Jack Holland. Though you might\u2019ve mentioned this yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and she felt it down to her toes.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were down on the beach. It was cold enough for a blanket, which Jack had thoughtfully provided. Two, in fact. One for the sand, one that he wrapped around her shoulders, as her dress wasn\u2019t doing much for her warmth.</p><p>Very romantic indeed.</p><p>She would have to be careful, she thought, taking a grateful sip of the wine. It was a well-known fact that Jack was like this with everyone, and half the women of Manningsport would eat a live puppy for a night with this guy. She couldn\u2019t read into anything.</p><p>Not even that kiss. That had been a way for him to get out of a bad moment. That was all. He\u2019d even apologized for it.</p><p>The waves lapped at the shore, gentle at the moment. There was no wind, and the moon was rising, making the sand look like snow.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when your parents adopted Angela?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFourteen,\u201d she said. The wine was good, mellow and smooth and whatever other adjectives winemakers liked to use. \u201cI went to live in Manningsport, and Mom and Dad didn\u2019t like the empty nest, so they went to Ethiopia and adopted Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was...surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and she seem really close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s great, as you probably saw. Beautiful, smart, talented. She did some modeling in college and donated it all to the orphanage that took care of her. She\u2019s about as nice as they come. It\u2019s hard not to like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cI take it back,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDo your folks still live out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey moved to Palo Alto to be closer to Angela. She\u2019s doing research at Stanford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch in what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about the evolution of stars in the ancient universe,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you could always ask her out, Jack. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d say yes.\u201d Imagine their babies. Beautiful to the thousandth power.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ask her out. I\u2019m a science geek, that\u2019s all. You jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Aflame with jealousy.\u201d She took another sip of wine. \u201cSeriously, you could ask her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded amazing. The urge to lay spread out like a starfish and pull Jack onto her... Wow. Very strong.</p><p>He nudged her with his shoulder. \u201cSo how do you like my wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. So grapey.\u201d</p><p>He gave a beleaguered sigh. \u201cTroglodyte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it I\u2019ve just been insulted with that big word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our best pinot noir in ten years, Emmaline. Don\u2019t chug it like it\u2019s Pepsi. Take a second to smell it.\u201d She obeyed. \u201cBlackberry, currant, clove and leather,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Leather. Mmm-hmm. Getting leather, sure.\u201d She sniffed again. \u201cI\u2019m really more of a beer person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019re done. Give me back your engagement ring and tell your dad not to worry about the dowry.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>He should really stop doing that. Every time he did, she became a little more of the Bitter Betrayeds\u2019 clich\u00e9\u2014get dumped, make Jack Holland be your date for a dreaded event, fall half in love with him, return home never to go out with him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat year did you graduate high school?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was a year ahead of Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He turned to look at her. God, he was just beautiful. The salt air had made his hair curl a little, as if he needed something extra to make him more appealing. \u201cWhy\u2019d you move?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her today. Largely to distract himself from a panic attack, but he\u2019d kissed her, and it had been a soft, gentle, amazing kiss that made her throb with...with something she hadn\u2019t felt in a long, long time.</p><p>Tenderness.</p><p>And lust, yes. No sense in pretending otherwise. It had taken all her self-control not to climb right onto his lap and take a bite, he was so delicious.</p><p>\u201cNone of my business. Sorry,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Oh, right, he\u2019d asked a question. \u201cI was bullied.\u201d</p><p>This was usually when the response was, \u201cReally? You? You\u2019re so tough/badass/scary, Em,\u201d and Em would either agree or change the subject. Not that she brought it up much.</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been pretty bad if you had to move to get away from it,\u201d he said, looking out at the ocean.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids can be such little shits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they bully you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stuttered.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her again, then put his arm around her. He was warm and solid, and, for a second, she felt the prick of tears in her eyes. Don\u2019t get carried away here, a little voice warned her.</p><p>\u201cAlso, Kevin went to boarding school in Connecticut. And he was... We were very close.\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s kindness had been an antidote to the casual, razor-sharp cruelty of her meaner classmates. And even worse, the kids who didn\u2019t instigate but just stood by, pretending not to hear, unwilling to take a chance on a nobody like Emmaline.</p><p>What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. How was that for a T-shirt?</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been tough, not being able to speak your mind,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYep. It was.\u201d She cleared her throat, took another sip of wine. \u201cI had this imaginary friend. Horatio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoratio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents read a lot of Shakespeare. Sue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was Horatio like?\u201d</p><p>She slipped off her sandals and dug her feet into the cool sand. \u201cWell, he was very loyal, of course. I\u2019d psychically tell him everything I couldn\u2019t get out, and he thought I was very smart and funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very funny and smart. You also have a wicked hip check.\u201d He gave her another grin. \u201cI had an imaginary friend, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But mine had a cool name, unlike poor Horatio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, bub. Horatio is incredibly cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine was named Otis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtis is not a cool name, Jack. It\u2019s sad that you think so. I\u2019m very sorry to tell you this, but Horatio wins this round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Otis serve a purpose?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. Whenever I got into trouble, I\u2019d tell my parents that Otis had done it. And that he talked to me at night. Totally freaked out my sisters. They thought either our house was haunted or I was possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the sound caused her stomach to pull in a wonderful, warm ache. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Not anymore, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline?\u201d came a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cOh, my God! Is it really you?\u201d</p> <p>Em looked up. \u201cUh...hi!\u201d</p><p>The woman, who was thin as a whippet and had very long hair, gave her a disbelieving look. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d She swept some hair around to the front and began stroking the ends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. The light isn\u2019t very good here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me! Lyric! Lyric Adams? We went to school together!\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. Em finished her wine and got to her feet. She remembered Lyric, all right. The meanest of the mean kids. \u201cHi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow! You look...uh, great!\u201d Lyric said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you look very, uh, good,\u201d Emmaline said. Lyric had had a little work done, as the saying went. Or, more precisely, a lot. Weirdly inflated lips\u2014the famous trout pout\u2014huge br**sts exploding out of her tiny, underfed rib cage and a much thinner nose than she\u2019d sported as a kid.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Lyric said, her voice taking on a different tone. \u201cI work out with this amazing trainer? And Pilates four times a week. No gluten, no meat, no dairy, plus these cleanses? You should try them! Wheatgrass and fish oil. Amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to pass,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cOMG! You don\u2019t stutter anymore! I barely recognize your voice. Remember how bad you sounded? \u2018H-h-hi, I\u2019m Eh-eh-eh-maline.\u2019 It took you forever to get a sentence out!\u201d She laughed merrily, her mouth barely moving, courtesy of whatever toxin she\u2019d had injected.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend Jack,\u201d Emmaline said, trying to ignore the burn in her cheeks. Lyric had been a piranha at age twelve. No reason to think she\u2019d gotten any nicer.</p> <p>Jack stood up. \u201cJack Holland,\u201d he said, putting his arm around Emmaline. \u201cEm\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Lyric said. \u201cI\u2019m Lyric, Lyric Adams-Rabinowitz. And yes, my father is that Travis Adams. I\u2019m an old friend of Em\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>The comment went right over Lyric\u2019s head. \u201cSo you probably heard what I\u2019m up to these days,\u201d she said. \u201cMy baby clothing line? Totally adorbs. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s daughter? She wore one of my outfits. And North West? Same. Can you even believe it? So, are you guys visiting? Wait, wait, oh, my God! You\u2019re here for Kevin and Naomi\u2019s wedding, aren\u2019t you? Oh, my God! So am I!\u201d</p><p>Em\u2019s toes dug into the sand. Kevin had been bullied by Lyric, too, and, yes, he and Naomi had moved back to Malibu, but still. The idea that Lyric had been forgiven was...wrong, somehow. Em\u2019s teeth ached, which meant she was clenching her jaw again.</p><p>Lyric was still talking. \u201cMy husband? You can meet him. Not to brag, but he\u2019s a real estate mobile, and he made eight figures last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you meant mogul,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMogul. You said mobile. You meant mogul, as in tycoon. Not mobile, as in something that can be moved. I\u2019m guessing your mobile didn\u2019t marry you for your beautiful mind.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline bit down on a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. So you and Kevin were together for a long time, right, Emmaline? This must be so hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were together for a long time, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect and serve the good people of Manningsport, New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops! My phone\u2019s ringing! Gotta go. S-s-see you t-t-tomorrow!\u201d Another whinnying laugh, and Lyric cantered away.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jack said, sounding almost surprised.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She was kind of doomed from the start. Thanks for sticking up for me, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He was quiet for a minute, then asked, \u201cYou okay, seeing her again?\u201d</p><p>Em shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know her type. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. I\u2019d tell her how miserable she made me, and she\u2019d tell me how much her shoes cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a kid in my class who made fun of Faith once,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe had a seizure at church, and he did an impression of her. I beat the living snot out of him, right there at Sunday school.\u201d He paused. \u201cToo bad I wasn\u2019t your brother.\u201d</p><p>I have no interest in you being my brother, Jack. \u201cWell, we should get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Officer Neal.\u201d</p><p>His phone chirped, and he took it from his pocket. She saw the name Hadley on the screen.</p><p>\u201cSo how is it really, having your wife back in town?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEx-wife,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight. And how is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d His tone, which had been warm and edged with a smile for most of the night, was cool and formal. She understood. The topic was off-limits.</p><p>Then again, Emmaline was a police officer, and cops liked answers.</p><p>\u201cYou still love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about Hadley.\u201d</p><p>Yes, in other words.</p><p>They picked up the blankets and headed back up the hill to the ranch.</p><p>She\u2019d do well to remember he was here as a favor. Jack, like a lot of men, loved a woman in distress. While Em appreciated that, she didn\u2019t like being in distress (though she was aware that this whole ridiculous wedding was distress inducing).</p><p>His ex-wife, the tiny and beautiful and vulnerable Hadley...she\u2019d be dying to be rescued. Em would bet her front teeth (which had once been knocked out in a hockey match and had been very expensive to fix) that Hadley had put a great deal of thought and strategy into her return to Manningsport and would need to be rescued. Often.</p><p>Besides, Em wasn\u2019t the type to fight for a man. She\u2019d tried that once and lost.</p><p>Not that Jack was even interested in her. That kiss had been a coping strategy and nothing else.</p><p>The walk back to Rancho de la Luna was quiet.</p><p>In thirty-six hours, she\u2019d be on her way home. Hopefully, there\u2019d be a crime spree in Manningsport, and she could go back to doing what she knew how to do.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>SO HERE\u2019S THE THING.</p><p>If you\u2019re going to your ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, and he\u2019s marrying a woman who has twice been featured on the cover of Fitness magazine, you do try to look good. You do strange and exotic things like blow-dry your hair, even without the magic goop from Sicily, and when it comes out looking as if you\u2019ve electrocuted yourself, you pounce upon a maid and beg her to find you something\u2014anything\u2014you can use, the end result of which is an industrial-size can of Aqua Net and hair that might shatter if you hit your head. You wrestle yourself into Spanx, hating yourself for caving to the societal pressures of this type of undergarment. You attempt makeup, then get mascara in the white of your eye, then try for ten minutes to get it out, then end up looking like you\u2019ve been crying all night. You push your innocent feet into heels that look like something invented by the Holy Roman Inquisitor. You put the raw chicken br**sts back in your bra.</p><p>And you put on a dress that makes you feel like you\u2019re trying way too hard.</p><p>Which, of course, you are.</p><p>Emmaline looked in the mirror.</p><p>She looked weird.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. \u201cYou ready?\u201d Jack called.</p><p>Em sighed, grabbed her purse and opened the door. \u201cHey. You look\u2014 Have you been crying?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I had something in my eye. I did. Don\u2019t look at me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can skip this,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGo get a nice juicy cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet thee behind me, Satan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t skip this. As for cheeseburgers, we can go to an In-N-Out on the way to the airport in just twenty-two and a half short hours.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou look very handsome, by the way,\u201d she said, then felt her cheeks flush. But he did. He had on a gray suit and a white shirt, and that smile could launch a thousand ships.</p><p>\u201cAnd you look beautiful,\u201d he said. She managed not to snort. He offered her arm, and she took it, abruptly and overwhelmingly glad that Faith had asked him to be her date.</p><p>They were almost the last ones to the wedding, which was held on the lawn that stretched to the cliff edge. Rows of white chairs festooned with pink roses and yards of white fabric faced the ocean, where a justice of the peace waited in a snazzy red dress. A string quartet was assembled near the front. Her parents gave her a wave, and Angela made the shape of a heart with her hands.</p><p>If it felt as if everyone was looking at her, they probably weren\u2019t.</p><p>Besides, they all thought she was engaged to the man next to her.</p><p>The string quartet started playing something slow and lovely. Bach, maybe, and the first of the six bridesmaids came down the aisle. All were clad in pale pink sheath dresses and holding white calla lily bouquets. Colleen went past, the prettiest of them all, and rolled her eyes at Em and Jack, then resumed smiling demurely. She was too nice to behave badly, after all. And maybe she had fond memories of Naomi, no matter how loyal she\u2019d been to Em.</p><p>Then came the adorable flower girls, four of them, dressed in white tulle with pink sashes, scattering rose petals.</p><p>And then there was the bride herself, unescorted, though her dad was here somewhere. Based on what Em knew of Naomi, she\u2019d want to make sure every eye was on her and her alone. Naomi stood there a moment for dramatic effect, waiting for the bridesmaids to fall into place (or start doing burpees, maybe). They did, and the musicians stopped for a moment.</p><p>If you didn\u2019t look into her glittering red, Smaug-like eyes, Naomi made a beautiful bride.</p><p>There was that body, perfectly showcased in a low-cut, low-backed wedding gown that swirled around her, clinging in all the right spots (everywhere, in other words), elegant and really hot at the same time. Naomi\u2019s skin was lightly tanned, her hair pulled up in a stark bun, and her jewelry was a single fat pearl on a thin gold chain, tiny pearls in her ears.</p><p>Very classy.</p><p>Then the music started, and Emmaline made a startled noise, then tried not to let her eye twitch. Found herself wishing a severe case of anal fissures on Kevin, because please.</p><p>The song was \u201cLargo,\u201d from the winter section of Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons.</p><p>Emmaline knew this because Kevin had chosen that very piece for Em to walk down the aisle to. He\u2019d said it was the most beautiful music he\u2019d ever heard, and he wanted to hear it play as the most beautiful woman became his wife.</p><p>Would it be wrong to dry heave right now?</p><p>Naomi started down the aisle, slowly, smoothly. Frickin\u2019 beaming at her guests, seeming to make eye contact with every single person there. Except Emmaline, of course. Her eyes slid right over Em, seeing and not seeing.</p><p>Why the hell had Em been invited? Why the hell had she come?</p><p>Emmaline looked at the groom, who was staring in a tearful, happy daze at Naomi. New Kevin looked different from her Kevin, and that helped.</p><p>But his eyes were the same. And while of course Em had known for quite some time that Kevin wouldn\u2019t be looking at her with wonder and love and joy as she walked down the aisle, she\u2019d managed not to picture those big dark eyes looking at someone else, either.</p><p>Funny how that worked. Denial, she believed it was called. Mom and Dad would be happy to spend several hours analyzing this for her later, should she mention it.</p><p>This felt more like a funeral than a wedding. Maybe that was why she was here\u2014to understand that Old Kevin, her Kevin, was truly dead now, New Kevin flexing on top of his grave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her shoes hurt. Yes. Think about that. Maybe she\u2019d have a blister. She almost hoped so.</p><p>Naomi handed her bouquet to her maid of honor and reached for Kevin, and the guests sat down. There was a buzzing sound in Emmaline\u2019s ears.</p><p>Then Jack leaned over and whispered, very, very softly, \u201cI hate weddings.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple, looking, she imagined, exactly like a fianc\u00e9 who couldn\u2019t wait to be at his own nuptials.</p> <p>Without turning her head, she cut her eyes to him. \u201cKnock it off,\u201d she whispered as one of the bridesminions fluffed Naomi\u2019s dress. \u201cYou\u2019re giving my parents false hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop whispering into my hair. You might chip a tooth, I\u2019ve got so much crap sprayed in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, sending a shiver down her side. \u201cYou smell like ethanol. I can feel my brain cells dying. You wearing those chicken cutlets today? Because the girls are looking fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jack.\u201d Her face was hot.</p> <p>\u201cIs that any way to talk to the man you supposedly love?\u201d Another kiss to her temple, a wink at her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a wonderful prostitute,\u201d she whispered. His eyes were a distracting, magnificent blue.</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d His mouth pulled up on one side, and the knot in Em\u2019s stomach loosened a little bit.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said the justice of the peace, and six minutes later, Kevin and Naomi were husband and wife.</p><p>AT THE VERY FARTHEST table from the bride and groom, the mysterious Russians were cheerfully passing around a bottle of homemade vodka. And Em had thought she was being punished by being seated here! The contraband booze tasted like death, but Em added a healthy glug to her unsweetened, locally grown, fair trade, organic, farm-to-table cranberry juice (which also tasted like death), improving both beverages probably because her taste buds were committing suicide. Still, it was a very jolly table, more so with every passing minute.</p><p>\u201cYour hair ees very beautiful,\u201d said Uncle Vlad, the boob-starer from yesterday. He reached out to touch it, winced and withdrew his hand.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s breakable,\u201d Em said. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Vlad put his arm around her neck and hugged her, then refilled her glass, God bless him.</p><p>Jack apparently had learned Russian in the navy and was chatting away, and it was good, it was fine, because for one, it was a stressful day. And for two, this flirty light stuff he was doing with her...it wasn\u2019t her thing. He kept putting his arm around her and murmuring compliments. It was making her very itchy and scratchy. And tingly.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he murmured. See? The tingle turned into a nearly painful buzz.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good! Really good! Yes. Da.\u201d The one Russian word she knew. Well, that and vodka. Yes, vodka! What more did she really need?</p><p>\u201cGo easy on that drink,\u201d he advised. \u201cThat has to be around one hundred proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Captain,\u201d she said. Hmm. Perhaps it had already taken effect.</p><p>She took a bite of the brussels sprout souffl\u00e9 covered in faux cheese, shuddered and washed it down with another slug of cranberry vodka drink, which was becoming increasingly delicious.</p> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d came the voice of the DJ, \u201cplease turn your attention to the dance floor, where Mr. and Mrs. Norman-Bates will have their first dance as husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really hyphenating, huh?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>But Em wasn\u2019t paying attention, because once again, a familiar song was starting up.</p><p>\u201cUnforgettable\u201d by good old Nat King Cole.</p><p>So Kevin wasn\u2019t that original. Big deal.</p><p>There went the last of the cranberry vodka. What were those drinks called? Cape Codders? Those Cape Codders knew what they were doing. Emmaline should visit posthaste. Have some clam chowder and drink some Cape Codders. Maybe meet some nice fisherman like, like...like Phil on Deadliest Catch. Wait. Wasn\u2019t he dead? Okay, then. It would have to be Sig.</p><p>Kevin and Naomi were very good dancers, all spinny and coordinated and stuff. Smiling, too. Very happy-looking.</p><p>Had Kevin really been so miserable when they were together? There had been times when he\u2019d brood, but who didn\u2019t brood once in a while? He had seemed to love her so much. How did that\u2014</p><p>Stop thinking about this, the sober part of her brain ordered.</p><p>Angela waved to her, a sympathetic smile on her beautiful face.</p><p>The song ended; Em applauded dutifully. Cake-cutting time, maybe a dance with her dad, then beddy-bye. She was almost home free. And when she got back, she\u2019d send Jack a big case of...well, something...and thank him for being the best sport ever.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even dessert to look forward to. Naomi had announced with great pride that, like the dinner, the cake was gluten-, dairy-and sugar-free. Brown rice cake with prunes. She wasn\u2019t even kidding. The icing had beet juice in it. Beet juice, for the love of God!</p><p>\u201cAnd now the bride and groom would like to invite their wedding guests to share a special memory of the two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fun,\u201d Jack murmured. The Russians muttered darkly, and the vodka was again passed around. Em smiled and shook her head, but Uncle Vlad ignored her and filled her glass halfway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink that,\u201d Jack advised. \u201cI\u2019m getting liver failure just looking at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may need it,\u201d Em said. \u201cTo share my superspecial memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I said let\u2019s make new memories, would you hit me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. Yes. And don\u2019t forget, I brought my gun.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. That was something, that smile. \u201cShow-off.\u201d</p><p>The best man, someone Em had never met, was first to share. \u201cThe second I saw them together,\u201d he said, \u201cI knew it was the real thing. I mean, Naomi was screaming at him not to quit. And Kevin, he\u2019s benching like three hundred as it was. Right, bro? Anyways, it\u2019s times like that when you really know you\u2019ve got a winner, dude\u2014can I just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful story,\u201d Jack murmured. \u201cAnd loosen up, okay? We\u2019re in love. Stop grinding your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Got it.\u201d</p><p>She unclenched her jaw and cracked her knuckles. Maybe she could flirt back if she gave it a shot. Then again, it was just that kind of thing that had her believing she was a fantastic dancer last year at the Bitter Betrayeds\u2019 Christmas party. The footage from Shelayne\u2019s phone had proved otherwise.</p><p>The special memories sharing was more of the same. The marathon when Kevin had to crawl across the finish line just after he lost control of his bowels. The difficult time when Naomi had ruptured her Achilles tendon and could only run seven miles a day. The hilarious time when they were doing an Ironman race and Naomi\u2019s bike had crashed, her shoulder dislocated, and God bless her! She\u2019d just rammed it back into place on a convenient tree, got back on the bike and caught up to Kevin, who of course hadn\u2019t stopped because it was \u201cemotionally important\u201d for him to give this race his all, and of course Naomi understood and supported this.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Em murmured. \u201cI think I\u2019d want someone to stop and call an ambulance for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d tell the paramedics to give you extra painkillers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I didn\u2019t want to get married.\u201d Aha! She could flirt!</p><p>He winked. Her knees quivered.</p><p>Then came Colleen\u2019s turn. She tried gamely to pass, but Naomi was grinning ferociously, so Coll took the mike and sighed. \u201cWell, Kevin and Naomi...um, near, far, wherever you are, I believe the heart will go on.\u201d She handed the microphone back to the DJ and stole a mysterious lump of something from Connor\u2019s plate.</p><p>Connor was not spared the microphone, either. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he said.</p><p>The DJ reclaimed the mike and headed for the back of the room. \u201cWho else would like to share? You, miss?\u201d</p><p>More vodka? Yes, I\u2019d love some, she thought, snagging the bottle from the weird uncle, who smiled approvingly at her cutlet-enhanced br**sts.</p><p>Even worse, her mother popped into an empty chair at their table. \u201cHow are you? Don\u2019t repress your grief. Let it out, honey. And why are you drinking? Isn\u2019t it bad for the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. How are you? There\u2019s no baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your dinner, Dr. Neal?\u201d Jack asked, and Mom murmured that yes, she was, then turned to look back at Em.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes were worried. That was the sucker punch. Mom meant well. She tried. Em knew she was loved, despite her parents being pretty clueless...when it came to her, anyway. They were better with Angela.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you have Jack,\u201d Mom whispered. \u201cEven though I was upset that you didn\u2019t want to share that with me earlier, I\u2019m glad. It was so hard to see you heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Lying sucked. She looked away from her mom.</p><p>The DJ was at their table. \u201cDo you have a special memory of Naomi and Kevin?\u201d the DJ asked the tiny shrunken Russian grandmother.</p><p>\u201cKogda uzhin?\u201d the grandmother said.</p><p>\u201cWhen is dinner,\u201d Jack translated into Em\u2019s stiff hair. \u201cPoor thing doesn\u2019t realize this was dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d the DJ said, handing the microphone to the boob-watching uncle. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany years ago, when I come to United States,\u201d Uncle Vlad began, \u201cI say, here is country of opportunity and money! Ha-ha! And my little niece, she is living dream! Za vas, Naomi!\u201d He tossed back a shot.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d the DJ said. \u201cAnd you, sir!\u201d He shoved the mike into Jack\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know either Kevin or Naomi that well,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can only hope they\u2019re as happy as Emmaline and I are.\u201d</p><p>Mom beamed. Squeezed Jack\u2019s arm.</p><p>Em took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re not really engaged, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cI lied about that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jack closed his eyes.</p><p>There was a collective murmur.</p><p>Ah. Seemed like the microphone might\u2019ve picked that up. Shit and vodka, her luck really sucked these days.</p><p>\u201cI knew that,\u201d Mom said hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve always known you\u2019re g*y, honey. Are you really pregnant, though? Is Jack the father, or was it artificial insem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not pregnant. And still not g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d chortled the DJ, looking slightly panic-stricken. \u201cUh, would you care to share a special memory?\u201d</p><p>Why not? Emmaline took the mike, stood up with hardly a wobble and looked toward the head table.</p><p>Kevin sat with his arm around Naomi, but he was leaning forward slightly, his head tilted a little to one side. Was that sympathy in his eyes? Understanding?</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cUm, I guess everyone knows that Kevin and I used to be together. We were...we were friends. Right from when we first met in eighth grade. Right, Kevin?\u201d</p><p>He smiled in response. The Old Kevin smile.</p><p>The vodka whispered that not only was she an amazing dancer, but Kevin was finally listening, too. For the first time in years, maybe for the first time since he\u2019d met Naomi. All of a sudden, it seemed as if that lovely, sensitive boy was here again.</p><p>God, she\u2019d loved him back then.</p><p>\u201cWhen I knew Kevin, he was\u2014\u201d the kindest, funniest person I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>But no. Her words slammed to a halt. Her tongue was behind her teeth, trying to make the th sound, but nothing was happening. Her throat muscles seized and lurched, but nothing happened.</p><p>The stutter.</p><p>It rose up and wrapped its hot bony fingers around her vocal cords, strangling her words. No sounds came out now. Nothing. Now, she\u2019d just be the stuttering, maybe-gay, not-engaged, not-pregnant former fianc\u00e9e who was so pathetic that she\u2019d come to this Wedding of the Damned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe w-was\u2014 He w-was th-the m-mo\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kevin looked away. Naomi smirked. Of course she did. It was her resting expression. And Lyric Adams, who was sitting a few tables away with a much older man, had her phone out, her thumbs flying away as she snickered.</p><p>Jack took her free hand.</p><p>She took it back. She didn\u2019t want pity. Hell to the no power.</p> <p>Think British, she commanded herself. Think Harry Potter or Tom Barlow or Colin Firth or\u2014</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d the DJ said, taking the microphone back and moving to another table. \u201cHow about you, mother of the bride? You must want to share a special memory!\u201d</p><p>Emmaline sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to us?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cEmmaline, this is just...just... It\u2019s practically pathological! Why on earth would you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDr. Neal,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI think you understand that Emmaline is in a tough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack. M-Mom, I\u2019m sorry. I r-r-really am.\u201d Her heart sank as the words struggled to get out. She pictured the stutter leaning against a doorway, wheezing its dry, whispery laugh. Hahaha. Got you again.</p><p>\u201cI think you need time to process your feelings,\u201d Mom said, a world of hurt in her voice. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Who could blame her?</p><p>Finally, the speeches were done, though she\u2019d stopped listening. The music started again, and Em sat there like a lump.</p><p>Jack took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d he said, and she complied. Angela was fending off the best man, but she shot Em a sweet smile, flawlessly conveying camaraderie and humor with no disappointment or blame whatsoever. Somehow, it made her feel worse.</p> <p>It was a slow song, something by John Mayer, and Jack pulled her close. It might\u2019ve been sexy, if she hadn\u2019t felt like a slab of oak.</p><p>\u201cHang in there,\u201d he murmured against her hair. His chin made a crackling sound as it broke through some of the hair spray. She would\u2019ve answered if she wasn\u2019t terrified of either stuttering or crying.</p><p>\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m a little disappointed you called off our engagement,\u201d he said, looking down at her with a smile. \u201cI was hoping for a bachelor party at a strip club.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Jack, for being a perfect date and the nicest guy in the world and also gorgeous. Thanks for not making me feel worse than I already do. Instead, she just tried to smile and shifted her eyes to his shoulder. He held her a little closer, and she had to bite her lip hard.</p><p>By tomorrow night, she\u2019d be home again in her snug little house, with her good puppy and her excellent job. Levi wouldn\u2019t ask how the wedding was because he wasn\u2019t that kind of boss, and Em would ask Everett if he wanted her to cover a couple of his shifts, which he always did. She\u2019d meet with her at-risk teenagers and go to her crisis negotiations class and have a night with the Bitter Betrayeds and by then, she\u2019d have had time to spin this weekend into a good story.</p><p>Then her dad tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cMind if I dance with my firstborn?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, sir,\u201d Jack said, stepping aside.</p><p>So she danced with her father, breathing in his comforting Dad-smell.</p> <p>\u201cYou must be experiencing some powerful feelings right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she managed, hating the stutter even more because it made her unable to talk to her father, who did love her in his weird psychoanalyst way. He kissed her forehead, and Em swallowed and gave him a squeeze.</p><p>The slow song ended. \u201cI\u2019d better go dance with Angela,\u201d Dad said. \u201cThat best man isn\u2019t taking the hint.\u201d Em nodded, kissed him on the cheek and watched him go.</p><p>She\u2019d have to come back and visit her parents to make up for lying to them. She\u2019d call them tomorrow. Angela, too.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t seem to be nearby, or at their table in the back, and people were giving her those embarrassed sliding glances. She grabbed her purse and walked out of the ballroom, smiling at whoever made eye contact (not that many) and grabbed the nearest parking attendant. She wasn\u2019t about to drive, not after two (or possibly three) zillion-proof vodka drinks. \u201cI need a favor,\u201d she said, handing him a hundred-dollar bill. \u201cWould you drive me into town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, pocketing the bill. \u201cWhere do want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Nance\u2019s diner?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI absolutely do. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>JACK COULD SWEAR he smelled bacon.</p><p>He was back in his room; Em had ditched him at the wedding, leaving him to hear about Naomi\u2019s grandmother\u2019s colonoscopy last year, which sounded even more horrific in Russian. All those guttural sounds.</p><p>He was a little worried. Emmaline hadn\u2019t answered when he knocked. Hadn\u2019t responded to his text, either. She wouldn\u2019t have driven; she was a cop and knew better than most that drinking and driving didn\u2019t go together.</p><p>As Josh Deiner would now understand, if he wasn\u2019t brain-dead.</p><p>For a second, Jack could swear he felt the lake water close over his head. The car seemed so far away, lying there on the bottom of the lake. All that cold and darkness.</p><p>No. No, thanks. He dragged his mind from the memory of that cold, that grim darkness. He was here in California, where it was now fully dark, a half-moon rising over the Pacific. Fifty-five degrees, maybe. If there was a reason to live in California, it was the weather. And San Francisco, a place Jack had visited a few times. Also, California wine country. Flippin\u2019 gorgeous.</p><p>Good. He was thinking about other things. He packed his stuff, since they had an early flight, and changed out of his suit into jeans and a T-shirt.</p><p>His phone chirped. Mrs. Johnson, of all people, texting him. Jackie, dear, you are terribly missed. When are you leaving California and coming home? Your father longs to see you.</p><p>He had several other texts, too. All three sisters, wondering how the wedding was going. One from Ned, asking if he wanted to go out for a beer, then another saying he forgot he was away. Two from Abby, asking for help with a chemistry project when he got back. One from Goggy that said WJY sek to DDjk. Goggy had just gotten a smartphone and, much to the chagrin of the entire family, complained about the tiny keys and had yet to understand AutoCorrect. That or she\u2019d just had a stroke.</p><p>There were five texts and two phone calls from Hadley.</p><p>He answered Abby and Mrs. J., told Goggy to stop trying to text until Ned showed her how and ignored Hadley.</p><p>He really wished she\u2019d leave town. Honor had told him that she\u2019d moved into the Opera House apartment building. That wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>He heard a sound from Emmaline\u2019s room. So she was in there after all.</p><p>That had been hard, seeing her flail today. Not being able to make her feel better.</p><p>He knocked on the door that separated their rooms. \u201cI hear you, Neal. Open up or I\u2019m calling the front desk and telling them you\u2019re a suicide risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bug me, Jack.\u201d She sounded irritable.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I outed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why\u2019d you do that? Twelve hours more, and you\u2019d have been home free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you open the door? This is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell bacon. Now open up and share, or I\u2019ll call Naomi to break the door down.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door, and the smell of bacon was much stronger.</p><p>Well, her hair looked better, anyway, out of that weird bun thing. She\u2019d showered, and her hair was damp. She smelled good, clean and citrusy. But the skin under her eyes was faintly pink.</p><p>She\u2019d been crying.</p><p>A surprisingly strong feeling flooded his chest. Emmaline didn\u2019t seem like the type to cry. Ever.</p><p>She wore pajama bottoms and a tank top, and there was a smear of brown on her cheek. In her hand was a giant bag of Skittles, and on the table behind her were several white bags, an enormous slab of cake and a bottle of wine.</p><p>She folded her arms under her chest and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou ate meat without me? This is the thanks I get?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI could use some time alone, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had plenty of time alone.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cCome in, then. There\u2019s half a cheeseburger left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been crying?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You have frosting on your teeth, by the way.\u201d He picked up the half cheeseburger and took a bite. It was fantastic, by far the best thing he\u2019d eaten since he got there.</p><p>She flopped into the chair and grabbed a chunk of cake. \u201cI\u2019m eating my emotions. Show some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what emotions are those, Officer Neal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrritation, embarrassment, frustration, jealousy, envy, gluttony... How many do you need?\u201d</p><p>Jack finished the burger and broke off a chunk of the cake slab. Incredible. It didn\u2019t seem fair that they\u2019d been eating root vegetables and mist when there was food like this around. He poured some wine and looked at the label. A midcoast zinfandel. Took a sip. Not bad with beef and chocolate, actually.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really jealous, are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot to criticize your taste in men, but he seems like an ass**le, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always.\u201d She took a rather savage bite of cake and gnashed away.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWhen the DJ gave you the microphone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, swallowing. \u201cThat he wasn\u2019t always an ass**le. That he was good and funny and kind until he cheated on me with that...that...that hideous beautiful mannequin with the abs of steel.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cHow much of that homemade vodka did you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. I\u2019m not drunk. Unfortunately, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my wife cheated on me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack, everyone knows that story.\u201d She winced. \u201cI mean, thanks for sharing. It\u2019s just that your sisters talk a lot. Well, Prudence talks a lot. Faith and Honor have never said boo. But it was the best town gossip there for a while. I mean, not best. Just the most interesting. Shit. I\u2019ll stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that. Deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something appropriate I\u2019m supposed to say? Like, \u2018Sorry your marriage went down in flames\u2019 or something?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, unable to stop himself. \u201cYou tell me. Maybe they should make a line of cards for people like us. \u2018Sorry your fianc\u00e9 turned out to be a dick.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She laughed, choking a little, then took a slug of wine and stretched out her legs so her feet rested on the bed next to him. \u201cHow long did it take you to get over what\u2019s-her-name? Blanche DuBois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about you,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cStill a pulsating wound, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re at your ex\u2019s wedding, and if there\u2019s a raw, pulsating wound, it\u2019s you.\u201d His lovely date gave him the finger. \u201cCome on, Em. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just great, Jack. I\u2019m a stuttering, lying, not-pregnant lesbian who puts raw chicken in her bra.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many boxes that checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d But she smiled as she said it. And it was kind of refreshing that she didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>Her foot was propped up on the bed next to him, and he put his hand on it. Cute foot. Very clean and nice. Smooth skin.</p><p>Try not to think about that, Jack, the nobler part of his brain advised. We don\u2019t sleep with heartbroken women.</p><p>\u201cIs your heart broken?\u201d he heard himself ask.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cNo. Not really. It was three years ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You were moving in, and I helped you carry some boxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I remember. I just didn\u2019t think you did. I bet you were an Eagle Scout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I was. We\u2019re trained to help damsels in distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever call me that again, I\u2019ll kick you in the soft parts.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how appealing she was.</p><p>He poured her some more wine. She might have said she didn\u2019t know anything about wine, but she knew how to taste it, holding it in her mouth a second before swallowing, then licking her lips afterward. Even the way she held the glass said so, close to her breast, the red a deep contrast to the white of her\u2014</p><p>Ah. She was speaking.</p> <p>\u201cOld Kevin...he was a peach. He was so nice, Jack. You have no idea. But that guy is gone, and I\u2019m the only one who seemed to notice or care, and for some reason, that makes me feel really, really sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he murmured, making sure he was looking at her face.</p><p>\u201cAll the things I loved about him...they seem dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this was something of a funeral,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Something flickered through her eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid up to her ankle and rested there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, then.\u201d</p> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYou know what sucks?\u201d she asked. \u201cI bought into the whole looks thing. I wore high heels and bought Spanx and I tried to look like them. The beautiful people. And the thing is, I like myself just fine. I\u2019m tough, I\u2019m strong, but get me next to someone like Naomi, and I stick raw chicken under my boobs and hope that Kevin will say something nice to me. And, of course, he didn\u2019t. So I sold my soul a little, and for nothing.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the painting on the wall and, very subtly, ran a finger under her eye.</p><p>Because she was crying. Not a lot, but, yep, those were tears.</p><p>Which was intolerable.</p><p>She took another bite of cake and didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said gently, \u201cwe men don\u2019t really pick you women because of your looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she snapped. \u201cAre you saying that Naomi has a stupendous body and a better personality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Simba. I\u2019m saying that looks aren\u2019t as important as you seem to think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSaid the Greek god.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re very pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me shoot you, Jack. Go back to \u2018You have a great sense of humor.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that. Let\u2019s not get carried away.\u201d She didn\u2019t smile back.</p><p>Jack stood up and reached out for her hand. \u201cCome on. Let me show you something.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her up and led her to the mirror. Turned on the light.</p><p>Emmaline flinched. \u201cDamn. How did I get chocolate there?\u201d She looked down at her shirt and rubbed a spot of chocolate over her heart.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAt the stain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Emmaline. Look at yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not do this, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby. Look. See what everyone else sees.\u201d</p><p>He stood behind her and pulled her hair back from her face.</p><p>\u201cYou probably do have a great sense of humor,\u201d he murmured, breathing in the sweet smell of her shampoo. \u201cAnd you\u2019re very competent at handcuffing people, I\u2019m sure. But you\u2019re also beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cExcept when you do that,\u201d he added. \u201cStop being so grumpy and take a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that Taser when I need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush. Look at yourself.\u201d</p><p>His hands were on her shoulders now, and her skin was as smooth as silk. Women and their secret weapons. Yes, the br**sts and lips and earlobes were all ridiculously appealing, and then they went and threw in silky skin and the smell of oranges and honey.</p><p>Without quite meaning to, Jack slid his hands down her arms to her hands, and back up again to her neck. Her long dark hair was sweet and damp between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you putting the moves on me, Jack Holland?\u201d she asked, her voice brisk. She didn\u2019t move, he noted.</p><p>He could see the pulse beating in her throat. \u201cYour eyes are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop interrupting. Your eyes are very pretty.\u201d</p><p>She shut them. \u201cWhat color are they, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark blue.\u201d</p><p>She scowled and opened them.</p><p>\u201cYour nose is perfect and adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Perfect noses. So hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Her ass was pressed right against his pelvis, and if he leaned in a little closer, he could\u2014\u201cBeautiful mouth. Made for kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that line work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never tried it.\u201d He smiled at her in the mirror, and her cheeks flushed. \u201cYou have perfect skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me in two weeks when I have my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you suck at taking a compliment. Say thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jack, for slinging the bullshit. Is there any more cake?\u201d</p><p>She was beautiful, and the longer he looked, the more beautiful she became. Her neck was long and smooth, her shoulders were strong and firm, her br**sts were, well, br**sts, and a very nice set at that, and there was a very appealing fullness to her hips.</p><p>He folded his arms over her chest and pulled her a little closer. Her eyes widened, and her pink lips parted.</p><p>He turned his head to breathe in her smell and felt her shiver. She didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>That skin smelled so sweet. He dropped a kiss on her bare shoulder. Smooth as water.</p><p>Emmaline inhaled, her breath shaky.</p><p>Another kiss, this one closer to her neck.</p><p>What are you doing? a small voice asked, but it was faint, drowned out by the hard, deep pulse that was thudding through his body. She tasted as good as she smelled.</p><p>\u201cYou should... I should... We probably shouldn\u2019t...\u201d she breathed, but then his hand was wandering over her ribs to the fullness of her breast, which was soft and perfect, no push-up bra or raw chicken required.</p><p>A small sound came from Emmaline\u2019s throat, and Jack took that as invitation to turn her to face him. \u201cI think we should,\u201d he said, and he kissed her, that sweet, full mouth, opening beneath his. He pushed his tongue against hers, tasting chocolate, and that thudding pulse surged hard and fast.</p><p>He backed her against the wall and leaned in hard against her, all that softness and good smells, that mouth. He didn\u2019t want to stop kissing her, because she was a drug and he was addicted, and he was throbbing now. He pulled her hands over her head and held them there, still kissing her mouth, her neck, the softness of her br**sts against his chest making him drunk. She wasn\u2019t protesting. In fact, little sweet sounds were coming from her throat, and he could swear he felt her skin get hotter under his mouth, because he was kissing his way down her neck, scraping her skin with his teeth, because Emmaline Neal was edibly delicious.</p><p>Then suddenly, she pulled her hands free and grabbed his shirt in her fists and yanked, sliding her hands up his ribs, then unbuttoning his shirt in hard, jerky movements as he worshipped her neck, one hand covering the firm weight of her breast. Then he pulled her shirt off and, God, he was so greedy for her, urgent and hungry. And damn, he wanted to erase everything else from her mind except him, and them. The two of them.</p><p>She was fumbling at his belt, and, without breaking the kiss, he turned her and pushed her onto the bed, falling with her, on top of her. A few more tugs, and their clothes were off.</p><p>She was soft and strong and Jack wasn\u2019t even thinking anymore. There was only Emmaline and the taste of chocolate, and her beautiful, solid, silken body underneath his.</p><p>EMMALINE WOKE UP at 2:16 a.m.; Jack sprawled on top of her. From the slow, steady sound of his breathing, he was asleep. Slowly, she extricated herself and tiptoed into the bathroom, closed the door and turned on the light.</p><p>And there she was, wanton woman.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Her hair was tangled, her lips puffy. Her legs felt weak and shaky, and certain parts were quite pleased at having had some attention, the first in a very, very long time.</p><p>Oh, and she was stark naked\u2014had she mentioned that? Also, nearly dead. Cause of death: orgasm.</p><p>Not a bad way to go. No, sir, not bad at all.</p><p>And looky here. Her reflection showed a shit-eating grin, she believed it was called, and it lightened her face, which she knew was usually serious.</p><p>Kinda sorta forgot how great shagging could feel.</p><p>There was a mass of thoughts waiting to be unleashed\u2014protests and winces and admonitions and some serious lecturing, but at the moment, she seemed to be quite taken with her reflection.</p><p>She felt beautiful. Jack had said it, a few times. It wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t like how she looked. She had a good enough face. She liked being strong. She never really thought about beautiful.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. \u201cComing.\u201d She pulled on the Rancho de la Luna bathrobe and tied it closed, then got a glass of water and went back into the room.</p><p>He was gorgeous. The moonlight, which had been specially ordered for the wedding, flooded the room with white light, casting Jack\u2019s face in shadows and angles. His mouth was proof of a higher power, it was so perfectly shaped, and when he smiled, God was just showing off. The blue, blue eyes. His hands. Had she mentioned his big, strong hands, slightly rough from the farming work he did? Had she mentioned just what kinds of squeaky sounds those hands could get from her?</p><p>Ah. She seemed to be in the throes of sappy gazing. Clearing her throat, she looked down at the rumpled sheets. \u201cHungry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d He reached out and, very slowly, pulled the tie of her robe.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still some cake,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about cake,\u201d he said, his voice deep and rumbly, and her girl parts gave a hot, sudden throb. \u201cBut now that you mention it...\u201d And with one quick move, he had her on his lap, robe open, and proceeded to feed her bites of cake in exchange for kisses. He took his time, sliding his hands over her as if he\u2019d never touched a woman before, licking chocolate off her lips, and damn if it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>Very well.</p><p>Very well indeed.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>YOU KNOW THAT expression, the cold light of day?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>For the first few seconds that Emmaline pried her left eye open, she wasn\u2019t sure why she was suddenly filled with dread. Hangover? No, no, she didn\u2019t feel terrible at all. In fact, she felt pretty...</p><p>And then she remembered, and regret and ruination rained down around her.</p><p>Shit and grilled cheese.</p><p>She\u2019d slept with Jack. Slept with in all connotations, because not only had they had sex, he was dead asleep next to her.</p><p>She bolted out of bed, then, abruptly aware that she was naked, grabbed the bedspread and wrapped it around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s wrong? Who\u2019s dead?\u201d Jack blurted, lurching upright. His hair was adorably mussed, and the muscles of his arms slid and bunched and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Nothing.\u201d She looked away from the golden glory that was her bedmate. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I have to pack. It\u2019s late. We have to leave in half an hour. We overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove it, Jack. Go pack.\u201d</p><p>Nice, said her brain. Very tender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already packed,\u201d he said, narrowing his eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to pack, so git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pack in front of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. So go shower and shave and eat something. Get out. I\u2014I have to brush my teeth.\u201d And put on clothes. Fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hustled to the bathroom, grabbing her suitcase on the way.</p><p>This. Had been. A mistake.</p><p>Pity fu\u2014 Okay, not that. Too ugly a term. Courtesy copulation, is that better? Yep. Jack Holland, god of Manningsport, had done her because she\u2019d been in the throes of the most pathetic moment of all pathetic moments. Jilted single woman, desperate to feel attractive, drinks homemade vodka with Russians and overdoses on Skittles.</p><p>Well, maybe the homemade vodka and Skittles were unique, but otherwise, no.</p> <p>All those thoughts that Emmaline had ignored in the loo last night were making themselves heard now in a very bossy and disappointed tone. Things about sleeping with someone for the sake of sleeping with someone. About going easy on vodka and wine. So what if the resort stocked condoms in the night table drawer? That wasn\u2019t carte blanche to go cartwheeling through Horny Land, was it? No. It was not.</p><p>She yanked her hair into a ponytail, took a marine-fast shower and pulled on her clothes with angry jerks.</p><p>Stupid, slutty, stupid. And wrong. She had used Jack for sex. Oh, sure, he didn\u2019t hate it\u2014he was a guy, and it was sex. But here was a man dealing with some serious issues back home, not to mention an ex-wife looking for a reconciliation. He\u2019d come here out of the goodness of his heart, and Em had done something that made her cringe.</p><p>She made him feel sorry for her.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door, and Em jumped. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cOpen the door and talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door. \u201cYeah. Listen. Last night was...thank you. Job well done.\u201d Automatically, she reached for her gun.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna shoot me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d She put it back in the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even have that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a law enforcement officer, and I can bring it if I want to.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cWe really do have to hurry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can give me two minutes. Are you freaking out because we slept together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. Bad idea, fun time. Just...\u201d A frustrated growl came from her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t want a relationship right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. That\u2019ll be four hundred dollars, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short. You were worth at least a thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cJack, look, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired of people saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re horrible.\u201d</p> <p>His mouth tugged on one side, and Em\u2019s uterus responded in kind. Slut. She was a slut.</p><p>She stuffed her hands in the pockets of her shorts. \u201cI imagine that you, being a very nice though horrible guy, want to be chivalrous and ask me out because your image of yourself doesn\u2019t have one-night stands. Plus, you have sisters and a niece you wouldn\u2019t want them to have a one-nighter with someone. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m the one-night-stand kind myself. But let\u2019s not go there. Let\u2019s just chock this up to a very brief vacation fling and never speak of it again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a relationship right now. You have stuff. And things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all have stuff and things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. But you never asked me out before. You\u2019re only here because I was desperate, and you wanted to get away from Manningsport. Also, you\u2019re invested in your ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, his phone chimed.</p><p>\u201cBet that\u2019s her,\u201d Em said. \u201cHow many times has she texted or called you this weekend?\u201d</p><p>His face hardened. \u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few? More than a dozen?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. So it was way more than a dozen.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your phone,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He handed it over, and Em took it.</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is from Hadley. \u2018Just taking a bubble bath, drinking Blue Heron wine, missing you. The bubbles are sliding down my\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the phone back. \u201cPoint taken,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a little...intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that code for crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I like crazy,\u201d he answered, reaching out and taking something from her hair. A Skittle.</p><p>\u201cThen get back together with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen. She was mean to my cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. We should go. Thanks for the shag. I really do appreciate your...attention.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a minute longer, his eyes beautiful and unreadable, and just as she was about to apologize and maybe ask to start over, he said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d and went into his room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>It was for the best.</p><p>She wondered if he slept with all the women who asked him to weddings and reunions, then squelched the thought. That wasn\u2019t fair. Also, if it was true, so what? He was single; he was straight. Women threw themselves at him. If he caught them, as he\u2019d caught her last night, who could blame him?</p><p>Part of the Bitter Betrayeds\u2019 speculation on Jack Holland was that he\u2019d married Hadley because he wanted someone different. He\u2019d never been serious with anyone local, and it hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed. His wife had been different, all right\u2014as out of place, beautiful and useless as a butterfly in a February snowstorm.</p><p>But he had loved her. Em had seen them together. She knew what love looked like.</p><p>Em hurled her toothbrush into the suitcase.</p><p>Theoretically, she wanted to find someone. She definitely didn\u2019t want to be a Bitter Betrayed forever. And sure, this wedding had brought up stuff. And things. Maybe she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. Maybe she needed more time to get over the guy she\u2019d loved for half her life.</p><p>Maybe, too, she was just chicken.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t get your heart broken if you didn\u2019t fall in love.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>FIVE DAYS AFTER they got back from sunny California, Jack was sitting in the hospital parking lot once again. Twice, he\u2019d gone into the lobby. He thought about what he would say to the Deiners. Debated over bribing a nurse. Jeremy Lyon was the Deiners\u2019 family doctor, and he\u2019d once been engaged to Faith... Surely that meant he owed Jack a little insider information, right?</p><p>Okay, not that.</p><p>If he could just see Josh, then...then...then what? He could apologize? Did he really think Josh would wake up from his coma and say, \u201cHey, thanks for pulling me out! You\u2019re the best! No worries, man\u2014I\u2019m doing great!\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed, his breath fogging the windshield.</p><p>It was as if Malibu had never happened. There was a foot of snow on the ground, it was fourteen degrees out, Josh Deiner was neither better nor worse and his family had just filed a lawsuit against Jack, saying that as an EMT, Jack should\u2019ve recognized that Josh\u2019s needs were greater than the other boys\u2019. They were also suing the town for not having a better guardrail in place and for not having a faster response time to the 911 call.</p><p>Not that they could win, Jack\u2019s lawyer had assured him. Josh had been doing sixty-four miles an hour in a thirty-five-mile-an-hour zone. Without Jack, the kid would certainly have died. No, this was just a grieving family lashing out in whatever direction they could.</p><p>Unfortunately, it did cause a collective gasp among the good people of Manningsport, and, once more, Jack was the topic of conversation. It was enough to make Jack wish Prudence and Carl would get caught for public indecency again.</p><p>And then there was Hadley.</p><p>Jack had glimpsed her the first night he\u2019d been home. He\u2019d been driving back from the hospital again and had to stop at the intersection on the green, where an ice-carving demonstration was taking place. Several dozen people stood bundled up in parkas and boots, watching Carlos Mendez carve a wolf out of a massive chunk of ice. Jack caught a glimpse of some of his family, and for a second thought about joining them.</p><p>But there were Sam Miller\u2019s parents, and rather than have them hug him and choke up with gratitude once again, he stayed in his truck.</p><p>Then he saw Hadley. She had a bag of groceries in her arms, and she was standing on the street, just outside the crowd. A few people streamed past her, and there was such a look of yearning on her face, such loneliness, that Jack almost called out to her.</p><p>She had no one in this town who cared about her. Except him. He did care; he just didn\u2019t want to get involved again. But he didn\u2019t want her to be shunned, or lonely, or miserable.</p><p>Fortunately, she went on her way, up the steps to the Opera House, and Jack continued home.</p><p>Unfortunately, he saw her again the next night, when she dropped off some dinner (bought from the caterer who had just opened in town) and stood shivering on his doorstep until he let her in. Just into the foyer, and only for six minutes till he told her she had to leave.</p><p>Speaking of difficult women, he was a little...mad at Emmaline.</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t used to being rejected by women. In fact, he had the opposite problem. There was the time Shelayne Schanta hid in the back of his truck like a serial killer. The time Shannon Murphy wrote her college essay on being in love with an older man (him), resulting in two extraordinarily furious parents threatening to castrate him, despite the fact that his interaction with Shannon had been limited to robbing her of a home run last spring during a baseball game. There was the time Lorena Creech Iskin cornered him at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s and told him in vivid detail about her husband\u2019s erectile dysfunction and how all she needed was fifteen minutes of his time.</p><p>So being thanked for a good time and sent on his way... That was new.</p><p>On Wednesday night, they\u2019d had a hockey game. He\u2019d said, \u201cHi, Emmaline,\u201d and she\u2019d said, \u201cHey, guys.\u201d That was it. She didn\u2019t even hip check him.</p><p>He started as someone knocked on his truck\u2019s window. He rolled it down. \u201cHey, Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Uncle Jack.\u201d Abby volunteered at the hospital. \u201cGuess you\u2019re wondering about Josh, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything. Even if I did, I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>She reached in and patted his shoulder. About a year ago, Josh Deiner had gotten Abby drunk. He\u2019d been one of those kids who was too spoiled, too indulged, always bored, always looking for trouble.</p><p>Didn\u2019t look like he was going to be able to atone for any of that.</p><p>\u201cYou need a ride, Abs?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve got Mom\u2019s car. You know what I found in it last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I feel like someone should share my pain, and you could use a distraction. You ready?\u201d She paused for effect. \u201cA riding crop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me she\u2019s taken up horseback riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel child, Abby.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHave a great day, Uncle Jack. Get out of here. Go do something with people your own age.\u201d</p><p>He watched to make sure she got to her car okay, and that it started, and then tailed her back to town to make sure she didn\u2019t speed or break any traffic laws (or careen into a telephone pole or a lake).</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Turned onto Old Farm Road with no problems.</p><p>But his breathing was getting shallow and fast, and he recognized the signs.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go home. Not that his cat was bad company, but he needed humans. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s it was.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack!\u201d said Colleen and Connor in unison as he came through the door. He nodded, figured he\u2019d sit at the bar, maybe hang out with Lucas, who was there, as well. If things were slow, Connor might come out and have a beer with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prudence, dressed much like he was in a flannel shirt and jeans, approached. \u201cHey, Useless!\u201d she said, smacking his shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging? Guess what? I\u2019m officially in menopause. The results came back today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me. It\u2019s horrible, Jack. I want to climb Carl one minute, then slowly choke the life out of him the next. Speaking of Carl, do you happen to have any spurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Pru. Believe it or not, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn. I back-ordered some, but they\u2019re still not here.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jack saw a table of women. One of them was studiously holding a beer to the side of her face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even want to be spotted, in other words.</p><p>\u201cCatch you in a little while, Pru,\u201d he said, walking over to the ladies\u2014Shelayne Schanta, Allison Whitaker, Grace Knapton and Jeanette O\u2019Rourke.</p><p>And Emmaline.</p> <p>\u201cHello, ladies. Mind if I sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d four of the five of them cried, moving their chairs to make room for him. \u201cHow are you, you look so handsome, want a drink, sit next to me, how was the wedding, have you eaten?\u201d</p><p>One of them didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cHi, Em,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go out sometime? Grab dinner? Catch a movie?\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a dark look.</p><p>The rest of the women fell silent. \u201cI\u2019m game if she\u2019s not, Jack,\u201d Shelayne said.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Allison said. \u201cJust in case you\u2019re looking for an older woman with two not-terrible children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out with you, Jack,\u201d said Hannah O\u2019Rourke, coming up with a tray full of peachy-pink drinks.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d said Colleen\u2019s mother. \u201cThough I am dating Ronnie Petrosinsky on and off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Chicken King?\u201d Grace asked, naming Ronnie\u2019s franchise. \u201cI just love their Mm-Mm Maple Glazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about it, Emmaline?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very busy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut thanks just the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d He looked steadily at his prey, who was staring determinedly at the jukebox over Allison\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBecause I had a great time in California. Especially that last night.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes jerked back to his. \u201cGood! I\u2019m glad. Good for you. That\u2019s great. I have to run. Sarge needs walking. Nice seeing you, Jack. Bye, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t want to go out with him?\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Rourke said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d he said, following her.</p><p>\u201cTogether again!\u201d Colleen called. \u201cSo cute. Coulda called it. Did call it, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop harassing the customers, Colleen,\u201d Connor called from the kitchen.</p><p>Emmaline was already outside.</p><p>\u201cEm. Hang on,\u201d he called, catching up to her. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your ego bruised?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>She smothered a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re really nice, Jack, and you\u2019re not exactly the Elephant Man, but I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to have dinner.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and held it, clearly on the fence. \u201cJust dinner, Emmaline,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went a little soft and wide.</p><p>Score.</p><p>But then she looked over his shoulder, and her cop face reappeared.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with your wife. Here she is. Take care.\u201d With that, she turned and walked away, her feet crunching on the snow.</p><p>\u201cWell, hey, stranger!\u201d Hadley said. \u201cHow are you, Jack?\u201d</p><p>And so, not wanting to be a jerk, he held the door for Hadley, took off her coat when she turned her back and gave her his hand as she struggled to sit on a stool.</p><p>Then, rather than getting webbed into a conversation with his too-beautiful ex-wife, he opted for the company of his cat and walked across the street to where his truck was parked.</p><p>There was a note on the windshield, on bright pink paper.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch yourself,\u201d it read. Laser-printed, not handwritten.</p><p>He glanced back at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Was this a warning from Hadley, something to do with his interest in Emmaline? She seemed to be talking to someone.</p><p>Might be from Mr. or Mrs. Deiner. But they\u2019d been camped out at the hospital around the clock.</p><p>You better watch yourself.</p><p>The pink paper watered down the threat of the words.</p><p>Might not be a threat after all. Or it might have been meant for someone else; half the people in this town drove gray pickup trucks. It was just a note, anyway. Not a big deal.</p><p>He could feel the water slicing into his scalp as he went under. His chest burned from the lack of air.</p><p>By the time the flashback was over, Jack\u2019s flannel shirt was damp with cold sweat. He started up his truck and headed for home, his throat raw from the cold, cold air.</p><p>TWO DAYS LATER, Jack, his father and Pops were at work. It should\u2019ve been easy, but for some reason, everything Jack did seemed wrong today. He bumped against a barrel, spilling his coffee. Missed what Dad had just said. Stepped on Pops\u2019s foot.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, son?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered. \u201cNot enough coffee, that\u2019s all.\u201d Except he\u2019d had three cups.</p><p>The three Holland men had always been close. First of all, it was them against what seemed like dozens of women.... Mom, back in the day, the three girls coming and going with their girlfriends, then Mrs. Johnson. When talk turned to periods or squabbles over who used whose hair goop, the three men would slip off to talk about baseball or vines.</p><p>When Jack was in the navy, Dad called twice a week, checking in, the gentle constant in Jack\u2019s life. Both Pops and Dad assured him he had no obligation to return to Blue Heron, and Dad only wanted him there if it was what Jack wanted. It was. The family, the farm, the wine... It was everything Jack had ever wanted. He was the eighth generation of Hollands on this land.</p><p>But since the accident, he couldn\u2019t seem to get back in the groove.</p><p>Today, they were racking a small vat of cabernet out in one of the big barns. Racking was the process of siphoning the wine off the sediment into a clean vat in preparation for bottling. As soon as Jack pulled the bung, though, Pops looked up. \u201cSomething\u2019s off,\u201d he said. The old guy had a nose like a bloodhound. \u201cIt\u2019s over-oxidized.\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed a glass and filled it halfway with the wine.</p><p>It was too brown, and Pops was right. It didn\u2019t smell right.</p><p>\u201cDid you add the Campden tablets last time?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I did,\u201d Jack said. The tablets kept microbes from forming in the wine. They\u2019d just racked this barrel for the first time three weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry, son,\u201d Dad said as Pops pried the head off the barrel to dump it. \u201cHappens to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cSmells like your grandmother\u2019s perfume,\u201d Pops said, winking at Jack. \u201cSpeaking of the old bag, I should get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my mother you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Dad said mildly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the love of my life. Just don\u2019t tell her I said that.\u201d Pops smiled and ambled off to his battered old truck.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of this,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait till tomorrow,\u201d Dad said. \u201cSo how are things, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Fine.\u201d Dad waited. \u201cA little tense,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Hadley the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s like a dog with a bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance of you two getting back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dad tapped another barrel and started siphoning that one. \u201cThis is better,\u201d he said, filling a glass. \u201cSmell that. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Jack obliged. This batch was fine, no oxidization, a nice jammy aroma. He took a sip and felt his shoulders drop a notch.</p><p>He\u2019d never screwed up a batch of wine before. Wine making was all about science and luck, but mostly about science, and he prided himself on the quality of wine that came out of Blue Heron. He\u2019d grown up watching his father and grandfather make wine, and he had two hefty degrees that said he should know better than to forget something as basic as sulfites.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I was just wondering about Hadley,\u201d Dad said, not quite meeting his eyes. \u201cShe was very, ah, forthcoming with me. Said she\u2019d made a terrible mistake with you, but she\u2019d grown up and learned her lesson and hoped that we\u2019d be supportive if you decided to reconcile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reconciliation,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because if you were over it, we could be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Johnson will never be over it,\u201d Jack said, forcing a grin.</p><p>Dad smiled. \u201cNo, maybe not her. But the rest of us would follow your lead, Jack. If that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He put his glass down. \u201cAnd I sure am sorry about this barrel.\u201d</p><p>His father gave him a long look. \u201cJack, maybe you need some time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just took some, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need more, just say the word. You\u2019ve been through a tough time.\u201d He gave Jack a slightly awkward hug. \u201cI love you. We all do.\u201d He pulled back and cleared his throat. \u201cYou want to come for dinner? Mrs. Johnson would sure love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you two are coming up on your first anniversary. Aren\u2019t you allowed to call her Hyacinth yet?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Dad admitted with a sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check on dinner. You go home. I\u2019ll finish this up.\u201d He took the siphon from his father. \u201cAnd thanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>His father squeezed his shoulder, then left to go home to his bride.</p><p>Odd to feel jealous of your own father for having a wife to go home to. As for doing something fun... There wasn\u2019t a lot of fun to be had in the middle of winter here in Manningsport.</p><p>\u201cHallo, Jack.\u201d His British brother-in-law came into the barn. \u201cJust saw your grandfather. He said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Tom. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got an email today from Dr. Didier, the high school principal. You know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her at the gym a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. A bit terrifying, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Tom grinned. \u201cAt any rate, they\u2019ve got a group of at-risk kids. The usual lot\u2014hoodlums and the like\u2014and she\u2019s looking for a chemistry tutor. I help out with math from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Honor tell you to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpot-on, mate. She said it might be good for you.\u201d</p><p>Honor. Always trying to run the world (and succeeding much of the time, he\u2019d admit). But the thought of being around teenagers other than his niece and maybe Charlie, Tom\u2019s stepson, gave him pause.</p><p>They\u2019d all know Josh Deiner.</p><p>\u201cLevi\u2019s deputy runs the program. Emmaline Neal. You two are friends, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked up. \u201cYes. We are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t ask you herself.\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant. Thanks, mate!\u201d Tom clapped him on the shoulder and went off, whistling.</p><p>EMMALINE PEERED AT the faux hostage taker. \u201cWhat did she do that made you mad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe took the last Twinkie. Those were for my apocalypse shelter. Now what will I have for dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtta girl, Shirley,\u201d said Jamie, the badass instructor. \u201cSounds crazy, class, but I swear, you can\u2019t make this shit up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Em tried not to smile, but damn! This sure beat out Consciousness and Form in Eighteenth-Century England, which she\u2019d had to take her junior year. (She\u2019d gotten a B\u2013. She was fairly sure she\u2019d be getting an A in Crisis Negotiations). Jamie, who was a negotiator with the state police in Buffalo, was filled with stories, curses and good advice. \u201cEm, what\u2019s your response to Crazy-Pants here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStole your Twinkies, huh? That\u2019s not good,\u201d she said. \u201cI love them. Thought I\u2019d tear my hair out when they stopped making them. Good thing they\u2019re back on the shelves, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s establishing empathy, people, and creating a bond between herself and the hostage taker. Keep it up, Neal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I can get you some more Twinkies,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cI can bring them inside and we can talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk that,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cThere are zombies everywhere.\u201d The rest of the class snorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Em said. \u201cI\u2019m really fast. And I don\u2019t want you to go without Twinkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic, kids,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cWe have to call it a day, but good job, everyone! Your homework is to read chapters four through six and deal with your in-laws without losing your cool. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf ever there was a time to barricade myself in a room with a gun,\u201d muttered Ingrid, a cop from Ithaca.</p><p>Jamie came over and leaned against Em\u2019s desk. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great in this class,\u201d she said. \u201cYou ever think about working for us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been a cop for nine months,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo? Think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019d be more chances to climb the ladder than in your department.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Levi wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>The state police handled the big stuff for a town like Manningsport\u2014if there was an actual hostage situation, for example, it\u2019d be the job of the local police force to keep everyone calm until the staties got there and took over. Homicides, kidnappings, bank robberies\u2014not that they were commonplace occurrences\u2014were handed over to the big kids.</p><p>It was a thought. She wouldn\u2019t leave the Manningsport Police Department anytime soon, but maybe someday.</p><p>She radioed in when she was ten minutes from town, got a request from Everett to pick up donuts. Before the station had moved to the new emergency services building, it had been right on the town green, spitting distance from Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery. Everett had dropped ten pounds since the summer and much mourned the move.</p> <p>Faith Cooper was inside, hands on her pregnant belly. \u201cHey, Faith,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cHi! How are you, Em? How was the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great. I, uh, I owe your brother something nice. He was a champ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re giving out presents, don\u2019t forget me,\u201d Faith said with a smile. \u201cIt was my idea, after all. So he was a good date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d So, so good. The memory of Jack on top of her, kissing her, made her left knee buckle. But then it was Faith\u2019s turn at the counter, and so Emmaline was spared further conversation.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop the thoughts from coming, though.</p><p>\u201cWIPE YOUR FEET,\u201d Carol Robinson ordered Jack as he walked into the police station. She looked up. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Jack. How are you, sweetheart? Still feeling famous? How\u2019s the Deiner boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mrs. Robinson,\u201d Jack said. He\u2019d gone to school with one of her sons and had fond memories of her chocolate chip cookies. \u201cYou look beautiful in that color.\u201d</p> <p>Carol beamed, her questions forgotten. \u201cCall me Carol,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are you still single, Jack? Oh, wait, I forgot. You got divorced. Do you want to marry my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Levi emerged from his office and handed Carol some papers. \u201cStop matchmaking,\u201d he said to her. \u201cCome on in, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s office was tidy and bureaucratic-looking, except for rather a lot of pictures of Faith. And an ultrasound of the mini Cooper. \u201cHow\u2019s my sister?\u201d Jack asked, always a little uncomfortable talking to the guy who slept with her. Curse of the brother.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good. Another few weeks to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified.\u201d Levi smiled. He\u2019d make a great father. Levi was one of those guys who was born to be a family man.</p><p>Jack sat down. \u201cYou heard anything about Josh?\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s gaze dropped to his desk, then went back to Jack. \u201cNo change. I check in with his parents every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear about the lawsuit against you.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cI understand.\u201d Couldn\u2019t blame them, either. You left him for last. The one who needed you most...</p><p>\u201cSo what can I do for you?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Emmaline, actually. Is she around?\u201d</p><p>Levi started to answer, then stopped. His eyes narrowed. \u201cDid you sleep with her?\u201d</p><p>Guess he was a cop for good reason. Jack didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Levi said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my sister\u2019s like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>Levi gave a begrudging nod. \u201cPoint taken. Em should be here soon. She was at a class in Penn Yan and has a thing tonight with her at-risk kids, but she said she\u2019d stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk to her about. The kids. Heard they need a chemistry tutor.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Emmaline came in, tossed a box of donuts on Everett\u2019s desk and said something that made him laugh.</p><p>A jolt went through Jack. Emmaline was in her uniform and wore a bulky jacket, a gun, a radio and a few other things on her belt. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun, and her cheeks were pink from the cold.</p><p>And she was smiling.</p><p>Until she saw him, that was, and the smile dropped. \u201cHey, Chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy,\u201d Levi said. \u201cHow was the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fantastic. I get to taze someone next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and that Taser. Enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Her eyes flickered to him. \u201cJack. How are you?\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m here to see you, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a complaint to file?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He waited, and her cheeks got even redder.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you two go to a wedding together?\u201d Carol asked. \u201cAre you dating? Levi, I\u2019m leaving. It\u2019s almost five, and the neighbors are coming for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky neighbors,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you!\u201d Carol, who was about a foot shorter than Jack, wrapped her arms around his waist and gave him a hug. \u201cCome visit me sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to seduce me, Mrs. Robinson?\u201d Jack countered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI might be a tiny bit old for you. Ask Emmaline instead. She\u2019ll go out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true, Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Em said.</p><p>Damn, she was cute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving, too,\u201d Levi said. \u201cJack, see you around.\u201d He left, holding the door for Carol. Everett was clicking through some pictures, his cheeks bulging with donuts.</p><p>Jack looked down at Emmaline, who was fidgeting with her jacket zipper. \u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Tone not encouraging.</p><p>\u201cI hear you need a chemistry tutor for your group of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom Barlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest. \u201cWe do. You in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You could\u2019ve asked me yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe meet every Tuesday night in the church basement at Trinity Lutheran. If you can\u2019t make tonight, come by next\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make tonight.\u201d</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cOkay, I have to run home, change, walk my dog and eat something. See you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could come with you. Meet your dog.\u201d Watch you change. \u201cCome on, Emmaline. I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThe truth is, I like talking to you. I like being with you. My life is kind of a mess right now. I can\u2019t sleep, my ex-wife is hanging around and now I\u2019m screwing up at work. So yeah, I have...issues. You were right. I\u2019m not looking for a relationship, but I could really use a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said almost before he finished. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I was rude the other night. I can do friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The blush flared again. \u201cYou won\u2019t thank me when you see what I have for dinner.\u201d</p><p>OKAY, SO THIS was...nice, Em thought as they left the police station. Her kids\u2019 group did need a science tutor. And if Jack wanted a friend, well, hell, she liked him, too. She could handle friendship. She\u2019d love to be friends. Naked friends.</p><p>No, no, none of that, she cautioned herself.</p><p>Jack was looking for a distraction. He had just admitted he didn\u2019t want a relationship. Friends with clothes on, that\u2019s what they\u2019d be.</p><p>They left the building, and Em broke into a run. Levi was crouched on the sidewalk, talking to someone on the ground. \u201cChief?\u201d she said, drawing her radio. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Hadley Boudreau was scenically arranged on the ground, her dress hiked up, just shy of slutty and just enough to show that she was wearing thigh-high stockings, the tops of which were lace. And really. It was eighteen degrees out. Full battalion makeup, perfectly applied. Em had never been able to pull off red lipstick, but Hadley sure knew what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cJust trying to convince Ms. Boudreau to go to the hospital and get this checked out,\u201d Levi said, giving Em a significant look.</p><p>Em glanced over her shoulder at Jack. \u201cI think this belongs to you,\u201d she said to him, then looked back at Scarlett O\u2019Hara.</p><p>And like Scarlett, Hadley Boudreau had a way with men and a calculating look in her eye.</p><p>\u201cI think my pride\u2019s hurt more than anything else, Chief Cooper. Jack, I was driving past and saw your truck, figured I\u2019d catch you and then the next thing I knew, I\u2019m ass over teakettles here on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d Jack said, his tone sawdust-dry.</p><p>Good for him.</p><p>Hadley started to move, then pursed her cherry lips in pain.</p><p>Em tried not to roll her eyes. She wondered how long it had taken Hadley to arrange herself so just the right amount of thigh was showing. \u201cCan you put any weight on it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Chief!\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI heard you\u2019re married to Jack\u2019s sister! She\u2019s the sweetest thing. I always thought of her as a kindred spirit.\u201d</p><p>Em sure as hell hoped not, for Levi\u2019s sake. She clicked on her radio. \u201cGerard, get your lazy ass out here. We have a casualty in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Gerard said.</p><p>Hadley sliced a look Em\u2019s way. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to inconvenience anyone,\u201d she said, an edge to her perfectly lovely husky voice.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re right here. No inconvenience at all,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cI just need a hand up. Jack? I feel like an idiot already\u2014don\u2019t make me lie here all the livelong day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the professionals,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>The door opened, and Gerard ambled out. Then, catching sight of a fallen and very beautiful female, he accelerated into a gallop. \u201cWhat\u2019ve we got here?\u201d he asked, kneeling next to Hadley.</p><p>\u201cMight need to be amputated,\u201d Emmaline said. Levi raised an eyebrow at her. Right. She was in uniform and was therefore required to be nice to idiots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just need a little help,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a wonderful paramedic, Mr. Chartier\u2014\u201d Gerard\u2019s name was stitched on his jacket \u201c\u2014but Jack and I used to be married. He can help me.\u201d Her tone was firm and friendly.</p><p>Jack sighed and went over. Emmaline followed. \u201cUp you go,\u201d he said, offering his hand to his ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t wear three-inch heels in the snow, you wouldn\u2019t trip,\u201d Emmaline observed.</p><p>\u201cA lady always wears heels,\u201d she said, seizing Jack\u2019s hand. He pulled her up, and she collapsed against him. He caught her right on cue.</p> <p>\u201cOh, dang,\u201d she said, tears filling her big brown eyes. She gave an awkward hop.</p><p>\u201cThat looks pretty bad,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cDefinitely a sprain, judging from the bruising. Let me take you to the hospital for an X-ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just a sprain. Um...Jack, I hate to ask, but would you mind driving me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack. Would you mind?\u201d Emmaline echoed.</p><p>He gave her a look.</p> <p>\u201cGet an X-ray,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll just get on home and pop it up on some pillows. Ice, compression, elevation, right, Mr. Chartier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Gerard. And, yes, exactly,\u201d Gerard said, smiling at her like a proud teacher. The guy was such a flirt. \u201cThrow in some Motrin and call it a day.\u201d</p><p>Well, Em had to give it to Hadley. Anyone could fake a fall in a parking lot. It took real commitment to actually injure yourself.</p><p>Hadley deigned to glance at her, and Em saw the gleam there. And Hadley knew she saw it, based on the twitch of lips. Watch, listen and learn, Yankee. This is how it\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cThis is downright embarrassing,\u201d Hadley said, \u201cbut I think you\u2019re gonna have to carry me to the car, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>Jack sighed and picked her up.</p><p>Em had the impression there would be many more sprained ankles in Hadley\u2019s future. \u201cHave fun,\u201d she said, starting for her car.</p><p>\u201cEm, wait,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you should take care of Blanche DuBois here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hadley,\u201d the other woman said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cEm\u2014\u201d Jack began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to have a conversation around the body in your arms,\u201d she said. \u201cHave fun, kids.\u201d</p><p>BECAUSE THE OPERA HOUSE didn\u2019t have an elevator, Jack ended up carrying Hadley up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cI really do appreciate this, Jack,\u201d she said as he set her down. She leaned against the door frame and got her keys out. \u201cI guess I just forgot how dang slippery it gets around here. Oh, well.\u201d She smiled and opened the door. \u201cWould you mind just coming in for a second? I did want to talk to you, after all. And maybe you could grab me an ice pack. I\u2019m so sorry to inconvenience you. Really, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Right. If her ankle hadn\u2019t been bruised, he would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d staged the whole thing. It was right up her alley; she\u2019d once confessed to him (while in bed) that she\u2019d crashed her bike on purpose to get the attention of a football player in college.</p><p>She hobbled inside, and Jack closed his eyes for a minute, then followed. He couldn\u2019t just dump her here, as much as he might want to.</p><p>Sharon and Jim Stiles kept this apartment for people just like Hadley, folks who\u2019d be in town for a few months at a time. Faith had rented it out when she\u2019d first moved back from San Francisco, and Colleen\u2019s husband had stayed here over the summer when his uncle was sick. It was a cute little place, furnished and stocked with china and glasses and that sort of thing.</p><p>Way too easy for Hadley to make herself at home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to be back here,\u201d she said as he opened the freezer and grabbed a bag of peas, since she didn\u2019t seem to have an ice pack. \u201cFrankie came up last weekend, and we were both real sorry you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was away with Emmaline,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hadley jerked, then recovered. \u201cIs that right,\u201d she murmured, sweeping her hair around to one side. She smiled as he handed her the peas. \u201cThank you, Jack. Um, would you mind getting a bandage? I think there\u2019s a first aid kit in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing but obeyed. The bathroom counter was laden with little baskets filled with bottles of perfume, makeup and other girlie stuff.</p><p>Looked like she was planning to stay awhile.</p><p>He grabbed the kit and a bottle of Motrin and went back to the living room. \u201cHere you go. I have to run,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could wrap my ankle?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just...I\u2019m clumsy. As you could tell, I guess. I feel so stupid. Bad enough to be the town pariah. Now I\u2019m the clumsy town pariah.\u201d Her expression was rueful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a pariah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ve been getting dirty looks since I moved back.\u201d</p><p>Moved back. He didn\u2019t like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cWhich I guess is what I deserve.\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to her, and she reached under her skirt and pulled off her stocking with a businesslike motion, which surprised him. He would\u2019ve expected a striptease. Her skin was cold and smooth, the joint fairly swollen. He felt a pang of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever tell people why we split up?\u201d she asked as he wrapped her ankle.</p><p>\u201cThey figured it out, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she began, her voice husky. \u201cIf I could undo what I did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the thought,\u201d he said. \u201cThere. You\u2019re all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re still hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the thing is, I\u2019ve learned so much. I was so young then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that young, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I was immature. I like to think I\u2019m smarter now, at least smart enough to know you were the best thing that ever happened to me. And it wasn\u2019t all bad, was it? Here. Look what I brought.\u201d</p><p>She reached over and grabbed a book off the table. One of those photo albums you make online, and on the cover was a picture of the two of them in Central Park. \u201cRemember?\u201d she said. \u201cWe had so much fun that weekend. You took me skating at Rockefeller Center. And that dinner we had, at the place with the view of the Chrysler Building, and we laughed so hard? Remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Hadley. You\u2019re right. We had some happy times. I also remember the lying, the tantrums, the spending and the cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t undo something like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you could forgive me. And I am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven. Doesn\u2019t mean I want to get back together, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do. I think you\u2019re just angry. If you\u2019d give me another chance, Jack, just one...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were full of tears. \u201cHadley,\u201d he said, putting his hand over hers. \u201cStop. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re back, but I imagine some shit hit the fan somewhere in your life, and all of a sudden, life with me didn\u2019t seem so bad. But I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes took on that stony look he remembered from when they disagreed. \u201cLook at this picture,\u201d she said, pointing to a photo of him standing next to one of the carriage horses in Central Park. \u201cLook how happy you are there. Just think about that, Jack. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking\u2014if the happiest time in your life doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance. Because I\u2019d do better. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Their life together had had some movie-esque qualities to it, Jack admitted\u2014their courtship, the choreographed, petal-strewn lovemaking, the dinners by candlelight, the way she could turn every move into something beautiful.</p><p>And in the past, when he\u2019d remembered those times, he\u2019d also remember her with Oliver.</p><p>\u201cRest that ankle,\u201d he said, and, with that, he got up and left.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>WHEN JACK AND HADLEY had returned from their honeymoon two and a half years ago, Jack had nine days before warning signs had started to flicker like broken neon lights.</p><p>Nine days.</p><p>Despite what she\u2019d said about wanting to have a family as soon as possible, Hadley decided to stay on the Pill, which was fine. After all, she was the one who\u2019d be pregnant and giving birth. It just wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been telling him or their families.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t want to work just yet; she just wanted to settle in first. Again, totally fine. She was living in a new town in a new part of the country. Of course she wanted to acclimate. Then, she said, she\u2019d hang out a sign and start up her interior decorating business once more.</p><p>But now that the wedding was behind her and life started to settle into a routine, Hadley seemed a little...irritable. She was surprised there weren\u2019t more events like the Black-and-White Ball, and her interest in doing wine tastings and guiding tours for Blue Heron quickly faded.</p><p>She went to a garden club meeting but didn\u2019t join, saying it wasn\u2019t for her. Joined the Art League, took two pottery classes and didn\u2019t go back. Honor asked her to help with the Manningsport Women\u2019s Club, which was organizing a tour of homes as a fund-raiser for local scholarships, but Hadley came back from that saying it made her sad, what passed for graciousness \u201chere in the North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a snob, honey,\u201d Jack said, pouring her wine.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, babe,\u201d she returned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to Savannah. You know what I\u2019m used to.\u201d Then she gave him a sheepish look. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just feeling a little out of sorts.\u201d Then she wandered off to her computer, calling him over to look at the Christmas decorating ideas she\u2019d found online, even though it was still summertime.</p><p>She was alone in the house a lot. Pru and Honor invited her out a couple of times, but the sister Hadley most liked was Faith, and Faith was in California.</p><p>And then there was Lazarus, the cat who lived with Jack.</p><p>To say it was his cat would be a stretch; Jack fed him and housed him, and Lazarus allowed it. Occasionally, Laz would jump onto Jack\u2019s lap, knead his stomach for a few seconds, then make a hideous gacking sound and go off to parts unknown to murder and pillage the bird and rodent population. He was an ugly creature; tan with splotches of stripes, a shredded left ear and a crooked tail, wary of all humans except Jack.</p><p>When Jack first moved back to Manningsport, he\u2019d been struck with a surprisingly strong yearning for his mother. He\u2019d gone up to the family cemetery and sat there in the misting rain, a hard lump in his throat.</p><p>And then, from behind the gravestone of the first Holland who\u2019d farmed this land, came a very small animal. It was battered and bleeding and matted to the point where Jack wasn\u2019t even sure what it was, but then it mewed.</p><p>Jack\u2019s mom had had a thing for cats. They\u2019d always had a few, out in the barns, in the house. Kind of seemed like a sign from Mom, him finding a cat out here right when he\u2019d been missing her. He wrapped it in his jacket and took it to the vet, who said he didn\u2019t think the kitten would make it. When he pulled through, Jack named him Lazarus.</p><p>Hadley hated Lazarus. Why, Jack had no idea, because Laz gave her a wide berth.</p><p>Hadley had a cat, too. Princess Anastasia was a fat, fluffy white Persian with startling green eyes and a fondness for shredding curtains, upholstery and human flesh. Princess jumped on the table, walked on the counters, crapped wherever she happened to be at the moment and shed large clots of white hair all over the house. In Savannah, she\u2019d been ill-tempered and unaffectionate. But in New York, she became downright destructive...especially and ironically toward Hadley, ripping her clothes, vomiting in her shoes and scratching and biting her. Not just little scratches, either, but long bloody tears and actual puncture wounds that would make Hadley\u2019s hand or foot throb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One night after such an attack, Jack grabbed the cat by the scruff and tossed her into the basement. \u201cJack!\u201d Hadley yelped, clutching her bleeding hand. \u201cShe\u2019s just an innocent animal!\u201d</p><p>However, Hadley had no such sympathy for Lazarus.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Prudence take him?\u201d she asked one night. Her own cat was draped across her lap like roadkill, peaceful (until she decided to turn homicidal).</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the problem cat here, babe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI just think Princess Anastasia would be happier if that thing wasn\u2019t around, spooking her. Wouldn\u2019t you, Princess? You want that ugly ole thing to go live with Prudence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadley. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She stared at Lazarus, who was crouched under the coffee table, making his weird gacking sound. \u201cHe\u2019s disgusting, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack said, grinning as he poured more wine for his bride. \u201cI love that disgusting cat. He\u2019s got character. And, yes, he\u2019s ugly. But so am I, and you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>She kissed him then. But she didn\u2019t warm up to Lazarus.</p><p>One night about a month after they\u2019d returned from their honeymoon, Hadley invited the whole clan for \u201ca genuine Southern dinner.\u201d Honor, Pru, Carl, Ned and Abby, Dad, Mrs. Johnson, Goggy and Pops all arrived at once. Even Faith was home from San Francisco, and Jack was pouring the Half-Moon pinot gris they\u2019d bottled four months ago.</p><p>\u201cThe house looks gorgeous,\u201d Faith said, and Hadley beamed.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the whole day getting ready, setting the table with their wedding china, making place cards with her calligraphy pen, arranging flowers. Hadley had sworn she didn\u2019t want him to do anything for the dinner, and he\u2019d been busy with some early harvesting, so he didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d cooked. She fluttered around like a tiny bird, seeming even smaller standing by Jack\u2019s sturdy sisters.</p><p>They drank wine and chatted and all was fine and good until they sat down to eat. Hadley set down a crock and took off the lid.</p><p>\u201cSouthern chicken and dumplings!\u201d she announced with pride.</p> <p>Mrs. Johnson and Goggy both recoiled in unison. What was in the pot looked like lumpy glue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, dear,\u201d Pops said. \u201cLet\u2019s get eating! It\u2019s already six o\u2019clock. I have to go to bed soon.\u201d</p><p>Hadley ladled out the dinner, which seemed to be a gelatinous goo with the occasional chunk of white meat thrown in. The dumplings were slimy, dense and slippery, and the chicken was chewy and tough, a far cry from what Jack remembered from when Mrs. Boudreau had made the same dish.</p><p>The Hollands didn\u2019t complain. They were Yankees; food was meant to nourish, not to enjoy, though their standards had risen during the Mrs. Johnson era (Mrs. J. was Jamaican and therefore believed in flavor).</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, dear,\u201d Pops said. \u201cThank you for having us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here, Mr. Holland,\u201d she said, smiling and fluttering her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cDid you just bat your eyelashes?\u201d Pru asked. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered if that actually happened. I mean, you come across the phrase from time to time, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it live and in person. Carl, stop staring at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, old man,\u201d Goggy said, smacking Pops on the back of the head.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I stare? She\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Holland, you\u2019re the sweetest thing,\u201d she said. This got a snort from everyone related to Pops. Hadley did have a way with men, and Jack had a soft spot for his grandfather. After all, the Holland men had to stick together, as Pops was fond of saying.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m thinking about redoing the house,\u201d she said sweetly, \u201cand I\u2019d love y\u2019all\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, redo?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked sternly. \u201cThis house is perfect.\u201d Jack winked at her; he\u2019d always been Mrs. J.\u2019s favorite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking it could do with a Southern woman\u2019s touch,\u201d she said. Pru laughed, then, realizing Hadley was dead serious, coughed to cover.</p><p>\u201cHadley, I forget. Are you an interior designer or an interior decorator?\u201d Honor asked, taking a bite of slimy dumpling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Hadley didn\u2019t answer. She shot Jack a look he couldn\u2019t read and remained silent.</p><p>\u201cAn interior designer deals with how the space is used,\u201d Faith said when Hadley remained quiet. \u201cDecorators deal with how it looks. Am I right, Hadley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. More or less. Excuse me, I have to check on something in the kitchen,\u201d Hadley said. She rose stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, darlin\u2019. You stay put.\u201d</p><p>She left the table. A second later, Jack heard their bedroom door close.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this gravy white, Jack?\u201d Goggy asked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m criticizing, dear, but I\u2019d be happy to teach her to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would also be happy to help her, Jackie dear,\u201d said Mrs. J., not to be outdone. \u201cJamaican cuisine is quite delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any cheese?\u201d Pops asked.</p><p>Jack got his grandfather cheese, then went down the hall to their room. \u201cBabe? Everything okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t spare him a glance, just returned to the table.</p><p>Shit. Fine equaled doom.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like life up north so far?\u201d his father asked Hadley. \u201cHope you\u2019re not too homesick, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, of course not,\u201d she said. \u201cI just love y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now. The feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d he said. Good old Dad.</p><p>It was, in a lot of respects, a typical family dinner for the Hollands. Lots of talking, lots of wine, lots of laughter, a fair amount of bickering. They ate the meal, which, though bland and sticky, wasn\u2019t horrible. If Faith had made it, the teasing would\u2019ve been merciless, but as Hadley was new to the family, no one said a word that wasn\u2019t complimentary.</p><p>Ned and Abby were ordered to clear the table, and Mrs. J. cut the grape pie she\u2019d brought while she and Goggy argued over crust-making techniques. Three minutes later, when dessert had been decimated, Goggy announced that it was time for everyone to leave, and the family trooped out with thanks and kisses and hugs.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, guys,\u201d Jack said, closing the door. He smiled and turned to his wife. \u201cSo that went well.\u201d</p><p>Hadley jammed her fists onto her hips. \u201cAre you crazy? Your family hates me! Your sisters are so mean! And your grandmother is so judgmental!\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cSweetheart, what are you talking about? No one hates you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Faith, showing off like that! Spouting about how designers are better than decorators! And Prudence didn\u2019t even take off her work boots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father, just sitting there, not saying boo! He hates me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, sweetheart. Dad never talks much. He loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Johnson is horrible!\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was going too far. Mrs. J. was tireless and fierce and pretty damn wonderful. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my first love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hate me because I\u2019m Southern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won the Civil War. We\u2019re totally over it.\u201d She was not amused, shooting him a glare. \u201cCome on, baby. Don\u2019t be upset. Everyone wants you to feel welcome here. They were just trying to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>He drew her a bath. Lit candles. Poured her wine. Apologized if his family came on a little strong (which they did, but that was just how it was...which he\u2019d assumed Hadley knew by now).</p><p>She took a sip of wine and sighed. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m just gonna lose myself in my work\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Do you have a client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, silly. His name is Jack Holland. Now get in this here tub.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, her mood was better.</p><p>HADLEY WENT CRAZY with the redecorating.</p><p>Jack\u2019s house was at the very top of the ridge, a good quarter mile up from the Old House, where his grandparents lived, and the New House, where Dad, Honor and Mrs. J. all resided. He\u2019d been given the land when he turned thirty; Dad had similar parcels for the girls, but so far, none had done anything with them. Pru and Carl lived in a nice neighborhood on the other side of Manningsport, Honor lived with Dad and Faith was a Californian for the time being, though Jack suspected she\u2019d move home soon enough.</p><p>But Jack had built his house two years before, after living in an Airstream trailer for six months to get the feel of the land, where the light hit at various times a day. He studied house plans from Frank Lloyd Wright and the Arts and Crafts era, then hired an architect to draw up plans.</p><p>The end result was an airy and open floor plan based around a huge stone fireplace with an exposed chimney. The floors were wide-planked cherry, the kitchen counters black soapstone. Two bedrooms upstairs for future kids, one down, as well as a home office. The basement contained a pool table and wine cellar. The house wasn\u2019t huge, but it had breathing space.</p><p>Most importantly, it blended seamlessly into the landscape, the most important thing to a Holland. The outside of the house was planked with cedar, with huge windows that overlooked the vineyard and Crooked Lake. On three sides, it was surrounded by a forest of maples, oaks and pine, so it was almost camouflaged. Faith had drawn him up a landscaping plan for a Christmas present, and he\u2019d followed it.</p><p>The result was that Jack\u2019s house looked as if it had been there forever. It was modern yet traditional, too, and everyone who saw it was rather dazzled.</p><p>Except his wife. Oh, she\u2019d cooed over it when she\u2019d first seen it, but now that she\u2019d lived there for a month, it was suddenly in sore need of \u201cSouthern charm.\u201d Which would\u2019ve been fine if it had been the type of charm Jack had seen at her own childhood home, carefully chosen antiques and family photos, clean lines and high-end furnishings.</p><p>But no.</p><p>Throw pillows seemed to be her trademark. The couch was covered in them; it looked nice, but it was impossible to sit without moving at least three. Their bed had the two pillows they used for their heads, four additional pillows covered in something called shams and a dozen more pillows in various sizes and colors. There was a painstaking order to these pillows, one Jack could never quite figure out. Lazarus liked to hide in the sea of shapes and then leap out, scattering them, which irritated Hadley to no end.</p><p>She rearranged the furniture. Ordered a new couch, one that cost eight thousand dollars, without asking his opinion. Bought a rather hideous fan shaped like a peacock for the fireplace, which Jack had stacked with white birch logs until it got colder. She bought velvet curtains that blocked out the light. Little signs appeared everywhere, ordering him to \u201cLive Fully, Love Deeply, Laugh Often\u201d and reminding him that \u201cWe Are So Blessed!\u201d In the kitchen, there now hung a chalkboard in the shape of a dancing reindeer that said \u201cOnly __ Days Till Christmas!\u201d The sign that bothered him the most hung in the foyer\u2014\u201cLife isn\u2019t about waiting for the storms to pass. It\u2019s about learning to dance in the rain.\u201d He always felt as though he should apologize for that one. After all, his people were Dutch Yankee Lutheran farmers. There would be no dancing in the rain.</p><p>But it was Hadley\u2019s house, too, now, so he moved aside the pillows and hoped her efforts would make her happy.</p><p>Then she asked if she could do some work for Blue Heron. When Jack said he\u2019d ask Honor, Hadley sulked and said Honor was bossy and mean. And yeah, Honor was bossy, but not in a rude way. Just in the way that she had to be, because she was indeed the boss of the business end, and a damn good one. She certainly wasn\u2019t mean. She was maybe misunderstood, but when Jack tried to explain that, Hadley claimed he was taking his sister\u2019s side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Honor said she\u2019d love to have some help\u2014proof that she wasn\u2019t at all mean. But by the end of Hadley\u2019s first day, Honor asked Jack to come by her office. She closed the door after him.</p><p>\u201cHadley\u2019s not going to work out,\u201d she said, getting straight to it.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cYou sure? It\u2019s only been a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she could start out by picking merchandise for the gift shop, maybe rearranging some of the displays out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. She loves buying stuff. And rearranging.\u201d Just last night he\u2019d caught his shin on the coffee table, which Hadley had moved for the fourth time.</p><p>\u201cWell, she had other ideas.\u201d His sister fiddled with a pen.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to redo our logo and every label on every bottle we sell. Redesign the tasting room by getting rid of the bar and putting in Italian marble and tile flooring.\u201d</p><p>Italian marble? The tasting room (which had been voted one of the ten most beautiful tasting rooms in America by Wine Spectator) featured a long, curving bar made by Samuel Hastings, using wood from a tree that had fallen in a winter storm ten years back. Blue slate floors. Two stone fireplaces, post and beam construction, beautiful old Oriental rugs.</p> <p>\u201cShe also thinks we should sheetrock the Cask Room, because the stone walls are\u2014\u201d Honor made quote marks with her fingers \u201c\u2018\u2014downright spine-chilling.\u2019\u201d</p><p>And the Cask Room was one of the best parts of the vineyard, an old stone cellar where the wine was aged in wooden barrels. Tourists loved it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d told her we were all set on those things, and she...\u201d Honor paused. \u201cWell, I think her feelings were hurt. You might want to bring her flowers.\u201d</p><p>Flowers didn\u2019t help. Hadley was seething, stating over and over that Honor hated her and didn\u2019t believe in her.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to understand that we all love Blue Heron. We don\u2019t want it to change. New ideas are great, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want new ideas!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot an overhaul of everything, no. The tasting room is only a few years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to our visitors,\u201d he said, his voice a little tight. He paused. \u201cHonor knows what she\u2019s doing, babe. Maybe telling her to change everything on your first day wasn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Take her side. You always do.\u201d</p><p>Her feelings of being persecuted baffled him. After all, his father called her sweetheart and always kissed her cheek and hugged her, Goggy beamed when Hadley made Jack show up at church each week, Pops told her she was the prettiest thing Manningsport had ever seen. Faith sent her emails and girlie gifts from San Francisco. Mrs. Johnson gave her the recipe for lemon pound cake, Jack\u2019s favorite dessert, which al-Qaeda wouldn\u2019t have been able to pry out of her. Pru invited them over and admired how good Hadley smelled, and Honor...well, okay, Honor didn\u2019t like her. But she never said anything that could even remotely be construed as impolite, not to Hadley, not to Jack.</p><p>Granted, the first year of marriage was the hardest, everyone said. And it wasn\u2019t all bad, not at all. There were moments when Jack couldn\u2019t believe he had a wife who literally skipped into his arms when he came home (sometimes) and who constantly told him how smart and handsome and wonderful he was. Who put her head on his shoulder and told him that all her dreams had come true the day she met him.</p><p>But Jack was learning that for every nice thing she said or did, he was expected to reciprocate in triplicate, and Hadley was definitely keeping score. One night, they went out to dinner to a really nice place in Corning, but Hadley barely spoke to him, becoming more and more sullen as the night went on, refusing to answer when he asked what was wrong. Finally, and only after they\u2019d gotten home, she told him. He hadn\u2019t noticed that she was wearing a new black dress. When he pointed out that she owned quite a few black dresses (eight, to be precise, he counted later), she slammed the door so hard a picture fell off the wall.</p><p>She had an endless need to be complimented. If he said she looked pretty, she\u2019d pout until he said beautiful or gorgeous or sexy. She\u2019d ask if he noticed anything different about her, and God help him if he didn\u2019t guess it was a new perfume or a different shade of pink on her toenails, because she\u2019d accuse him of taking her for granted. She loved gifts, and though he often brought flowers home, she\u2019d make a pretend game of patting down his pockets to see if had anything else for her. The thing was, she meant it. Whatever he did get her, it wasn\u2019t enough, the one exception being her engagement ring. Even so, she was already hinting for an anniversary ring\u2014a sapphire-and-diamond band that, according to the website she showed him, cost twenty-four thousand dollars.</p> <p>Then again, there were days when she\u2019d tell him a story full of dry humor and her musical laugh, and her eyes would dance, and he\u2019d feel this almost painful pressure in his chest, because this was the way he\u2019d always thought it could be. Sometimes she\u2019d call him to say she just wanted to hear his voice. She might bake cookies and bring them down, still warm from the oven, for him and Dad and Pops.</p><p>And, certainly not least of all, their sex life was fantastic. Frequent, boisterous, interesting...planned...mapped out, really. Choreographed. By her. Hey, he wasn\u2019t complaining. It was just always a bit of a production.</p><p>In four months of marriage, not once had Jack just been able to go to bed at the end of the day and make love to his wife. Nor was he able to come home from work and kiss her and just take her to bed (or to the living room rug, or the couch and its many throw pillows). Morning sex was frowned upon. Lunchtime sex was okay, so long as he let her know a day or two in advance so she could get ready. Jack sort of thought that was his job, getting her ready, but...well. It was okay. Frequent and boisterous, those were good things.</p><p>Still, it might\u2019ve been nice not to have to spend all that time lighting candles. Or scattering rose petals (he\u2019d done that on their honeymoon, and now it was kind of a thing). Or playing certain music. Sometimes there was a theme to the night, and Jack would be asked to guess what that theme was.</p><p>These productions required a special wardrobe for Hadley, as well\u2014new lingerie and red-soled high-heeled shoes, or skimpy little nighties, when all Jack really wanted was nudity.</p><p>While it was great that she put so much effort into that aspect of their marriage, it was a bit...much all the, uh, staging. And, yes, all the money.</p><p>\u201cIs this a mistake?\u201d he asked one night after he opened the AmEx bill. \u201cTwo grand at Bergdorf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not a mistake, sweetheart.\u201d She smiled at him, dimple flashing.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you at Bergdorf Goodman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered something online,\u201d she said, not looking up from the game she was playing on the computer.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pair of shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne pair of shoes cost two grand? My God! Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t raise your voice to me, Jack Holland!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Yes. Two grand on one pair of shoes.\u201d She gave him a pretty little pout. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I deserve nice things, baby?\u201d</p><p>This is where fights began, Jack was well aware by now. Two hundred would\u2019ve been a lot in Jack\u2019s book, unless they were those really good steel-toed leather work boots Pru had given him for Christmas last year. But two thousand? \u201cOf course you deserve nice things. But you have dozens of pairs of shoes already. Two grand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Christian Louboutin, babe! You sure didn\u2019t complain the other night.\u201d Another smile. Yes, the other night she\u2019d done a very hot little striptease, leaving on only her trashy shoes. Even so, they weren\u2019t worth two grand.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cHoney. That\u2019s way, way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the money.\u201d</p><p>Jack folded his arms. \u201cWe don\u2019t have two grand to spend on one pair of highly impractical shoes, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>Well, that opened the door. She stomped her foot. Jack clearly didn\u2019t appreciate how hard she worked to make their home beautiful. How much effort she put into being attractive, because \u201cthat\u2019s what Southern women do, Jack, not like your sister, who looks like a man!\u201d</p><p>Jack ran a hand through his hair. \u201cHoney, you can\u2019t drive us into debt because you liked a pair of shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne pair, Jack! I think I deserve one pair of Christian Louboutin shoes!\u201d</p><p>Except, he learned, she had four pairs.</p><p>They sat down that night and worked up a budget on how much discretionary spending money they had. She sulked.</p><p>It was obvious she\u2019d had the wrong impression of just how much Jack earned. Yes, Blue Heron supported the family. Yes, Jack was a part owner and received a salary in addition to vineyard profits (most of which went back into the land or a savings account\u2014farmers never took income for granted). She gave him the silent treatment for the rest of the night.</p><p>But the next morning, she apologized, said she\u2019d been childish and kissed him sweetly. She baked a pie using one of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s recipes, and, after dinner, she called Faith and had a long giggle-filled chat.</p><p>They flew down to Savannah for a Southern Thanksgiving. Hadley was overjoyed to be with her family again, and they were happy to see both of them. He played Southern football (which was an awful lot like Northern football) with her dad and two brothers-in-law, both very good guys, as well as the kids and Frankie.</p><p>\u201cYou guys planning on having kids?\u201d asked Beau, who was married to Rachel. The game had pretty much finished, and Jack was tossing a nephew in the air.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMight want to think that through,\u201d Frankie said, flopping on the grass. \u201cKids make things permanent. Right, ankle-biter?\u201d she added, grabbing her niece around the waist.</p><p>\u201cNow, Frankie,\u201d Hadley\u2019s dad said, shooting Jack an apologetic look. \u201cCome on, kids\u2014I smell ham and turkey. Your grandmother\u2019s worked too hard for us to be late to her table. Y\u2019all get in there and wash up, now!\u201d</p><p>Everyone went in, except Frankie and Jack.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I put my foot in it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just seem like a real nice guy is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, Jack,\u201d she said with a smack to his head, just like one of his own sisters, \u201cHadley\u2019s a handful. Gives us Southern chicks a bad name. Just be sure you know what you got there.\u201d She started in, then glanced over her shoulder. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m coming out to the family after dinner. Hope I can count on you not freaking. You knew I liked girls, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah.\u201d He was still digesting her words about Hadley.</p><p>Frankie\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t exactly groundbreaking. Ruthie and Rachel stated that they\u2019d known since Frankie was eleven, and Bill and Barb admitted that they had suspected but had hoped to be wrong, because it could carry some \u201cdifficult consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are y\u2019all talking about?\u201d Frankie said fondly. \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee now. There\u2019s lots of us lesbians up north. We\u2019re all the rage.\u201d This got a laugh, and Bill came over and kissed his youngest and told her they all loved her no matter what.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll look after her, won\u2019t you, Jack?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jack said. He liked Frankie a lot. \u201cNot that she needs looking after, but we\u2019re just an hour away from Cornell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I are about ready to start a family,\u201d Hadley announced.</p><p>He looked at her in surprise. Since that first conversation after the honeymoon, the subject of kids hadn\u2019t been brought up. But the conversation turned to babies and pregnancy, and when Jack looked across the table at Frankie, she said nothing. Just cocked an eyebrow, and it dawned on Jack that maybe his wife was, in some weird way, trying to steal Frankie\u2019s thunder and turn the attention to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hadley seemed a little blue at Christmastime, so Jack surprised her with a trip to Manhattan, earning a lot of happy shrieks and kisses (and the wrath of his grandmother and Mrs. J.). They saw a show, stayed in a nice hotel (though not in a suite this time), went skating at Rockefeller Center, Hadley clutching his arm and giggling as she wobbled and skidded.</p><p>Though she paused meaningfully in front of Tiffany\u2019s, Jack didn\u2019t take the bait; he\u2019d already bought her some very nice earrings in Manningsport and arranged this trip. He wasn\u2019t about to break the budget just for a turquoise box. She didn\u2019t seem to mind, and took his hand as they walked down Fifth Avenue.</p><p>When they got back home, she seemed happier. The bumps in the road seemed to have smoothed out.</p><p>Then, in February, Jack stopped by the post office, which was one of Hadley\u2019s jobs. She had clearly defined ideas about what husbands should do and what wives should. It was a husband\u2019s job to empty the trash and clean up Lazarus\u2019s victims (and Princess Anastasia\u2019s hairballs); it was a wife\u2019s job to make the bed and pick movies. Husband shoveled the snow and scraped cars; wife went to the post office.</p> <p>But Honor was expecting a package, and she asked him to swing by. He checked his own post office box while he was there.</p><p>Inside were three envelopes\u2014one from MasterCard, two from Visa\u2014addressed to John N. Holland IV.</p><p>Which was strange, since he only had one credit card, an American Express. He only used it when he had to, preferring to use cash whenever possible.</p><p>With a cold feeling in his stomach, he went out to his truck and opened the envelopes, his breath frosting the air.</p><p>One bill was for $6,008.01, one for $8,772.15, and one for $4,533.98.</p> <p>Almost twenty thousand dollars. At 24 percent interest, no less.</p><p>The charges went back as far as October...well after he and Hadley had the talk about the red-soled shoes that cost so much. They were from stores that Jack knew only by reputation. Tiffany\u2019s...he remembered how good a sport she was when they didn\u2019t stop in at Christmastime. Guess she could afford to be, since she\u2019d already bought herself a little something. Henri Bendel. Neiman Marcus. Chanel, Coach, Prada, Armani.</p><p>Almost twenty thousand dollars on clothes, shoes and handbags.</p><p>Jack found that he was sweating.</p><p>After the flights back and forth from Savannah...after spending five months\u2019 salary on a Tiffany engagement ring and a diamond wedding band...after paying for the rehearsal dinner for seventy-five people...after the lavish honeymoon, the new couch, after Christmas in New York City, after all the crap she\u2019d bought for the house...they simply couldn\u2019t afford this. Jack had never wanted for money, but this...this was twenty grand he just didn\u2019t have sitting around.</p><p>Worse than the money, though, was the lying.</p> <p>She\u2019d been lying to him for months.</p><p>Jaw locked hard, Jack drove home. She was there, sitting at the kitchen table, staring into space, idly stirring sugar into her tea. \u201cOh, hey, baby!\u201d she said when he came in. \u201cWhat are you doing home so early?\u201d</p><p>He put the bills on the table in front of her. \u201cExplain,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>She was calm; he had to give her that. Stroked Princess Anastasia and said that, yes, she may have \u201coverindulged,\u201d she shouldn\u2019t have kept that from him, but shopping had always been a hobby. She liked nice things; he knew that. She believed in buying quality. No need for him to have kittens.</p><p>He made her show him her purchases, and she sighed and complied. Some were right there in their closet, some in her jewelry box, some hidden in the attic.</p><p>Shoes galore. Seven new black dresses, each of which looked identical to the last. Four leather jackets. Five winter coats. More makeup than she could use in years. Special soaps and moisturizers and cleansers and creams. Belts and scarves and gloves. Perfume. An eight-ounce bottle of bubble bath that cost $179. \u201cI thought Faith might like that for Christmas,\u201d she said unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I like to shop all through the year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHadley, we can\u2019t afford this!\u201d he barked, and she folded her arms and stared at him patiently.</p><p>\u201cJack, we can. I know you\u2019re on the stingy side, but that wasn\u2019t how I was raised. Where I come from, a man takes care of his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy take care of you mean go into debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I did a little retail therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try the regular kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was uncalled for,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how lonely it is for me! You\u2019re at work all day long!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who work for a living generally work all day long, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you misled me, then! I thought you were\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was what?\u201d</p><p>Rich. That\u2019s what she\u2019d thought. And he\u2019d always thought he was\u2014he paid his bills, owned a home, bought a new truck every 125,000 miles, didn\u2019t have debt (until now) and put a modest amount in the stock market and savings.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t rich. Not by Hadley\u2019s standards, anyway.</p><p>She looked straight ahead. \u201cI thought you\u2019d value our time together more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I not value our time together, Hadley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always put your family first. You spend more time with your father than you do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work with my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Mrs. Johnson growls at me any time I even look at her, and your sisters are horrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sisters aren\u2019t horrible, Mrs. Johnson growls at everyone and they\u2019re not the reason you spent twenty thousand dollars on clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t think I\u2019m worth it, after all I do to try to make you happy.\u201d There was a challenge in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is practically hoarding, and it\u2019s money we don\u2019t have.\u201d He picked up a pair of long white gloves, the kind a woman would wear to...well, hell, he didn\u2019t know. \u201cYou forged my signature on three credit card applications, which is illegal, for one, and for two, means your own credit must be shot to hell. You\u2019re hiding things around the house because you know you shouldn\u2019t be spending so much. This is not how a responsible adult behaves.\u201d</p><p>She grew stony and wounded. She said she\u2019d pay off the credit cards by taking on a few clients if money was all he cared about. Apparently, she\u2019d misread him.</p><p>Jack loved his wife. He did.</p><p>Or you did before you got to know her so well, said a voice in his head, sounding a lot like Honor.</p><p>No. He did love her. But it was clear that she wasn\u2019t as straightforward as he\u2019d thought when they first met. And it was also clear that she thought he was a wealthy vintner and not a guy who had to work for a living. Maybe this wasn\u2019t the life she thought she\u2019d signed on for.</p><p>\u201cHadley, if you\u2019re not happy here,\u201d he began as gently as he could.</p><p>She jerked as if he\u2019d hit her. \u201cIf I\u2019m not happy, what?\u201d she said, and suddenly her voice was shaking.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we rushed into this. If you\u2019re not getting what you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, no! Are you...do you want a divorce? Oh, my God!\u201d She burst into tears, her hands over her face. \u201cPlease, Jack! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ll return everything I can, but please don\u2019t leave me, Jack!\u201d</p><p>He got up and put his arms around her. \u201cHadley, honey, it just seems like you expected something different,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease give me another chance!\u201d The sobs were tearing out of her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that.</p><p>He got a washcloth and wiped her face, held her tight, feeling like an absolute prick...and wondering how exactly that had happened. Poured her a hefty glass of wine, and another for himself, and assured her he didn\u2019t want a divorce.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t. He just wanted a better marriage.</p><p>The next day, Hadley wasn\u2019t home when he got back from Blue Heron. She came through the door a half an hour later, her face bright. \u201cGuess who just got a job!\u201d she said.</p><p>She was sorry about the credit cards. She would pay them off. He was right, she\u2019d gone a little crazy, but now she had a job and all would be put right as rain.</p><p>Her job was clerking in the gift shop of Dandelion Hill, another winery on Keuka, run by Oliver Linton, a transplanted Wall Streeter who\u2019d retired at the age of forty and bought a vineyard. Nice guy, as Jack knew from the wine association meetings and various events all the vineyards participated in. Oliver even took them out for dinner, and they reciprocated by inviting him up to the house one night, and it seemed that, finally, things were on the right track.</p><p>Jack was stunned at the relief he felt. Hadley had a job, a place to go every day, and it seemed like exactly what she needed. She laughed more and had more to say, funny little stories about the people she met or Dandelion Hill\u2019s grouchy shop manager. Things became more down to earth, more normal...happier.</p><p>It was almost liberating, her feet of clay. When they\u2019d first met, she\u2019d been perfect. Now she was real. Yes, yes, she spent too much money and played the victim when she felt defensive. But no one was perfect. She was happier now. She even started talking about kids.</p><p>\u201cJack, I have the best news!\u201d Hadley said one night, bursting into the house, and his heart leaped. She was pregnant. It had to be. \u201cOliver wants me to redecorate! At last!\u201d</p><p>Ah. Well, that was nice, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered across her face. \u201cOh. No. Not yet. But it\u2019s still good news! Oliver wants me to redo the tasting room!\u201d</p><p>Hadley threw herself into the job. Spent huge amounts of time on her laptop, talked about fabric choices and stool styles and glasses, all the stuff that Jack pretty much ignored at Blue Heron, as it fell under Honor\u2019s reign.</p><p>Oliver took to calling her in the evenings, and she\u2019d apologize to Jack and then skip upstairs to the room she\u2019d made into her office. She took even more care with her appearance, and when he teased her about it, she slapped his arm and said, \u201cJack! I\u2019m not just a clerk anymore. I\u2019m a decorator, baby. I have to look the part.\u201d Finally, she started making female friends, a couple of women who also worked at Dandelion Hill. Hadley joined their weekly book club, though they never seemed to read anything.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t seen her this happy since the wedding.</p><p>The only fly in the ointment was, oddly enough, sex. They just weren\u2019t doing it as much these days. \u201cOh, sugar, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just exhausted,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask me why, because when there\u2019s news, mister, you\u2019ll be the first to hear it. I\u2019m not one of those women who tells the whole wide world ten minutes after she conceives.\u201d</p><p>A baby. No, it was smart to be sure first, but Jack felt something huge move in his chest.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me with that goofy face, Jack Holland,\u201d she said teasingly. \u201cWhat did I just tell you?\u201d Her phone rang, even though it was after nine. \u201cOh, dang it, it\u2019s Oliver, I swear that man cannot find his car keys without a flashlight and a blue heeler hound dog. Hello? Oliver, honest to goodness! I have no idea!\u201d She smiled at Jack and left the room, still gabbing.</p><p>About two weeks after she hinted about the pregnancy, Jack decided to leave work early. He and Dad had been checking the tanks and doing some projections for the spring planting with Pru, but it was a quiet time of year. He stopped at the horrifyingly expensive gourmet market that had just opened, bought some filet mignon and cheese and asparagus. Allison and Charles Whitaker were there, too; they lived near Pru and came to Blue Heron all the time. \u201cMaking dinner for your bride?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cI sure am,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever make me dinner?\u201d she asked Charles, giving him a sharp elbow in the side. Her husband gave Jack a dark look and muttered something, and Jack left them, bickering in front of the beautiful, organic, locally-grown-and-prayed-over-by-the-monks-of-Saint-Benedict\u2019s vegetables. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Next, he swung by Laura Boothby\u2019s shop, flirted with her for a few minutes and got a bouquet of red roses. \u201cYoung love.\u201d Laura sighed. \u201cYou sicken me, Jack. But keep coming in, hon. You\u2019re good for business.\u201d</p><p>Last stop was the package store in town. Granted, he had a vast collection, but Hadley liked French champagne. Tonight, he wanted her to have something special, because since the big credit card debacle, she hadn\u2019t bought one thing that wasn\u2019t strictly necessary, and Jack was feeling a little miserly.</p><p>Also, they might have something to celebrate, in which case he\u2019d put the champagne in the wine cellar and open it on their child\u2019s birthday. If she wasn\u2019t preggers, then hell. This would be her little treat. She was mighty cute when she was tipsy. (And mighty horny, too, so maybe Jack would finally get a little, because it had been a couple of weeks. An eternity, in other words.)</p><p>Pru was leaning against his truck when he came out. \u201cHey, Useless, our wine isn\u2019t good enough for you anymore?\u201d she said, grabbing the bag from his hand and looking inside. \u201cOoh! Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon White Star! Are you in trouble?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Prudence. I\u2019m the best husband in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGack. You\u2019re still a jerk in my eyes, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. Give me back my champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I was going to invite you and Scarlett O\u2019Hara to dinner, but I see you have other plans.\u201d She smacked him on the shoulder and tromped off.</p><p>It was snowing pretty hard, and Jack felt about as happy as a man could get. Whistled on his way home. Nothing like being snowed in with a beautiful woman. He drove up the ridge to his house, the snow pleasantly muffling the sound of his tires, and turned off the engine.</p> <p>There was Hadley\u2019s yellow VW Bug, covered with snow... Oliver must\u2019ve sent her home early. And there was another car, too. One of her friends\u2019, maybe? He\u2019d been telling her to invite the book club to their house so he could meet the famous nonreaders. Whoever it was, she\u2019d have to leave soon, the way it was coming down now.</p><p>He gathered the bags and flowers in his arms and got out of his truck. For some reason, Jack stopped and brushed off the back of the strange car. It was a Mercedes.</p><p>Oliver had a Mercedes, if Jack remembered correctly. They must be talking about the redecoration.</p><p>Not that Dandelion Hill really needed a redesign. It was pretty spectacular...and newly renovated. Very sleek and modern and sophisticated.</p><p>Not something he could really see Hadley improving with throw pillows.</p><p>Funny how Jack had never thought of that before.</p> <p>His stomach felt cold all of a sudden. But no, no, that was stupid. Oliver was her boss, and twelve or fifteen years older than she was. He was a good guy, and Hadley was happily married. Things had never been better. Pretty sexist of Jack, imagining something illicit going on. Nah. They\u2019d be sitting at the kitchen table with fabric swatches or whatever.</p><p>He heard a little croak. It was Lazarus, waiting by the door.</p><p>His cat hated snow. He\u2019d go out in rain and lightning and wind. Didn\u2019t mind the bitter cold or the muggy heat, but he hated snow. He held up his crooked front leg, shook his paw and made his little squeak of distress once more.</p><p>\u201cHey, pal,\u201d Jack said, setting down the grocery bags. The cat leaped into his arms. First time that had happened. He rubbed the cat\u2019s paws, wincing as he felt how cold and hard the little pads were. Lazarus had been outside for quite a while, it seemed. And the thing was, the cat would head-butt the door, scratch the glass and send up ungodly screeches if he didn\u2019t get let in the instant he wanted to.</p><p>And if Laz had given up, then he\u2019d been at it awhile.</p><p>Jack opened the door and let the cat in, then picked up the groceries and flowers and followed.</p><p>The house was quiet.</p><p>Maybe they weren\u2019t there. Maybe they\u2019d gone down to Blue Heron to...to...look at the tasting room or something. Maybe Oliver had wanted to talk to Honor about some business.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t explain why he felt sick.</p><p>He went into the kitchen. There was Hadley\u2019s black wool coat, lying on the floor.</p><p>And her red-soled shoes that cost so goddamn much, carelessly kicked off.</p><p>His chest felt like it was in a vise. A cold, metal vice.</p><p>His mind was oddly empty as he walked down the hall that led to the study, the half bath, the laundry room.</p><p>He could hear them now. There was moaning. Sighing. There was Hadley\u2019s voice. \u201cOh, my God, yes, yes, oh, God, yes!\u201d</p><p>So much for taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain.</p><p>The door to their bedroom was open a crack. Jack pushed it open more, and yep. Hadley stood in the middle of their bedroom in a black push-up bra and thong. A buck-naked Oliver, complete with paunch, knelt in front of her, his fingers gripping her ass, making out with her belly button.</p><p>What was the protocol for this? Should he announce his presence? Yell? Leave? Beat the shit out of Oliver?</p><p>Hadley ran her fingers through Oliver\u2019s sparse hair. \u201cOh, Ollie! Oh, my!\u201d</p><p>And then, sort of mercifully, Oliver opened his eyes and saw Jack there and reacted by hurling himself away from Hadley. He crawled around to the side of the bed\u2014Jack\u2019s side\u2014and grappled for his pants.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Hadley gasped, grabbing one of the throw pillows and holding it in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019re home early!\u201d</p><p>HE DID DRAG OLIVER outside and toss him in the snow. Naked. Threw his clothes after him. Hadley, wrapped in her bathrobe (her red silk bathrobe, one of her credit card splurges), followed Jack, hysterical, sobbing, accusing, excusing and begging all in the same breath. Then Jack went back in the bedroom and grabbed all the sheets and covers and asinine throw pillows and carried them outside, as well.</p><p>Oliver was gone by then. Hadley\u2019s hysteria didn\u2019t seem to be fading, though she\u2019d had the presence of mind to clutch Princess Anastasia to her chest. The cat was writhing to get free, and Jack distantly hoped that the cat would get away and be devoured by a coyote, but then again, hey, it was an innocent animal, sort of. Mean as a snake, but he didn\u2019t really want it to die, of course not, but if it did, he wouldn\u2019t be shedding any tears.</p><p>Jack went into the cellar and found some lighter fluid and came back up. Hang on. He needed kindling. He went into the kitchen, ripped the \u201cHappily Ever After Starts Here\u201d sign off the wall. Grabbed \u201cKeep Calm and Have Southern Charm,\u201d as well. And who could forget \u201cLife isn\u2019t about waiting for the storms to pass. It\u2019s about learning to dance in the rain\u201d? He tossed them on the sheets and pillows, then doused the whole mess, the whole unfaithful, cheating, disgusting mess, and lit it on fire, the heat making his face tighten.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Hadley said, her voice small.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that you\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want me to apolo\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, and she must\u2019ve seen something in his face, because she shrank back and scurried into the house.</p><p>A few minutes later, Hadley dragged two suitcases and Princess Anastasia out to her car. The nasty cat scratched her hand, and Hadley jerked back, always surprised that the spoiled creature hated her. She turned to Jack, clutching her wounded hand like it had just been partially amputated.</p><p>\u201cJack, if you\u2019d just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cThere\u2019s no call to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>She finally did.</p><p>He watched her drive all the way down the road that led to Lake Shore, and, long after her little car disappeared up the road (toward Dandelion Hill, he couldn\u2019t help noticing), he stood in the falling snow, empty and stunned and furious all at once, the smell of lighter fluid thick in his throat.</p><p>Two days later, Hadley came up to talk. And here was where it got interesting.</p><p>Seemed as though maybe Oliver didn\u2019t want more than a little afternoon delight. Choosing her words very carefully, Hadley told Jack that she\u2019d \u201cbeen tempted\u201d but had been just about to stop Oliver because she would \u201cnever risk their marriage\u201d or \u201cbreak a commandment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done, Hadley,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sat there for a minute, and her eyes filled with tears. Self-pity more than grief, he was sure. \u201cAre you going to tell anyone why?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He hadn\u2019t yet. Not even his father, though Dad was aware that something was off. And hell. In a small town like this, there were no secrets. He wouldn\u2019t have to tell.</p><p>She moved in with Oliver. The rumor mill said he hadn\u2019t particularly wanted a live-in girlfriend, but she was there nonetheless.</p><p>A few weeks later, Bill Boudreau sent him a note saying he was very sorry to hear things weren\u2019t working out, and Jack remembered that conversation, that subtle warning Bill\u2014and Frankie\u2014had given him.</p><p>He\u2019d always thought he was a pretty smart guy. An advanced degree in chemistry from an Ivy League school, right? But it seemed he was pretty f**king stupid just the same.</p><p>Hadley asked for ten grand in exchange for an uncontested divorce, and Jack paid it. One lump sum and nothing else. She made noise about laying claim to the house and her \u201cinvestment\u201d in it, but apparently her father talked her out of it. Throughout it all, she insisted that she hadn\u2019t been unfaithful, despite what Jack had seen, and his discovery that there was no book club...all those nights out when he\u2019d been so happy his wife was making friends had been spent with Oliver.</p><p>New York state law said they had to be separated for six months before their divorce could be finalized, so Jack sat back and waited. Worked. Went home. Repeat.</p><p>One thing Hadley hadn\u2019t foreseen\u2014cheating on Jack made her a pariah. The one time she and Oliver went into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, Colleen, who\u2019d practically grown up in the Holland house, told them to get lost. When Hadley sputtered and gasped, Connor opened the door and told them they had three seconds to leave before he would ask Levi Cooper (also present) to escort them out. This was gleefully reported to Jack by Prudence, who only belatedly heard him ask her not to tell him about it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t avoid the gossip. Gerard Chartier, a firefighter-paramedic who saw Jack often on ambulance runs, told him that Oliver and Hadley were seen arguing at the antiques store. Honor said she\u2019d run into Hadley, and she\u2019d seemed absolutely manic, bouncing around the grocery store like a bee trying to get out of a car. At the Crooked Lake Spring Fling Wine Tasting, Oliver showed up to represent Dandelion Hill, but Hadley was nowhere in sight.</p><p>And then, three months after Hadley had left, on a night when the owl family had decided to serenade Jack as he sat on the deck with Lazarus, his phone rang.</p><p>It was Hadley, her voice a stunned whisper. \u201cJack, I don\u2019t know who else to call. I can\u2019t...I can\u2019t wake Oliver up. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s breathing.\u201d</p><p>He told her to call 911 and said he\u2019d be right over.</p><p>It was three o\u2019clock in the morning.</p><p>But Hadley didn\u2019t have anyone else. Frankie was an hour away at least.</p><p>So Jack went to Dandelion Hill and drove Hadley to the hospital, following the ambulance, then waiting in the relentless lights of the E.R. with his not-quite ex-wife. Got her a bottle of water from the vending machine, and when her cold hand slipped into his, he let it stay.</p><p>And when the doctor came out and said they\u2019d done all they could, but unfortunately the patient didn\u2019t make it, he put his arms around Hadley and held her as she shook.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s parents came to town, heartbroken and furious at finding a gold digger living in their son\u2019s house; they kicked her out. She called him once more, her voice subdued and small, saying she didn\u2019t have any money (the ten grand must\u2019ve slipped through her fingers like fog). Her father was furious with her, she couldn\u2019t ask her sisters for anything and all she was asking was if she could stay with him until after Oliver\u2019s funeral. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He said no. But he paid for her room and meals at the Black Swan B&amp;B.</p><p>She came up to the house a few hours after the funeral to say goodbye and tell him she\u2019d pay him back for the stay at the inn. Her face was white, her eyes too big and utterly terrified.</p><p>He almost wanted to take her in his arms and tell her it would be all right, that she could stay with him for a while.</p><p>Almost. It was disturbingly hard not to say the words.</p> <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cSO HOW WAS the wedding, Officer Em?\u201d Tamara asked as Emmaline walked into the basement of Trinity Lutheran Church.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about it,\u201d Emmaline said, smiling firmly at her at-risk teenagers.</p><p>\u201cSucked that bad, did it?\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cPretty much, yes. Sarge, look! It\u2019s the kids! The kids are here to see you!\u201d She unclipped her wagging, crooning pup and watched with a smile as the dog bolted for the teenagers, Squeaky Chicken firmly in his mouth.</p> <p>One of the reasons Emmaline had gotten Sarge was for the kids. Also, because she was single and liked having someone to come home to, and also because she was a cop and could make little Sarge here into a police dog (or not, because he definitely lacked the I\u2019m a big scary dog gene).</p><p>But for this purpose\u2014for making four tough, bored, cynical potential dropouts tolerate her\u2014her dog was perfect.</p><p>\u201cSo Cory, you got suspended again, huh?\u201d she said, setting down the box of cookies she\u2019d picked up at Lorelei\u2019s earlier that day.</p><p>\u201cHe told Dr. Didier that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already heard, Tamara. Cory? You were already in trouble with Mrs. Greenley. Did you feel things getting to that snapping point?\u201d</p><p>Cory shrugged. He\u2019d been suspended today after suggesting that the principal of Manningsport High was, in fact, a man. An ugly man at that, using some colorful words to describe just how ugly and just what evidence indicated Dr. Didier\u2019s masculinity, then threw Dr. Didier\u2019s paperweight in the trash\u2014but he threw it hard. Like a baseball. The result was suspension.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you did,\u201d Em said. \u201cAnd we all have those moments, Cory, when we\u2019d like to break something. But that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Tamara said, peeling blue nail polish from her thumb and eyeing the cookies.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Cory said. He took another cookie, put it in his teeth and let Sarge eat half of it, then chewed and swallowed the other half. Boys were so gross. Then again, Em had done the same thing the other night, so she was in no position to judge.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cory, what about your suspension?\u201d she asked, trying to refocus them.</p><p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re gonna get expelled,\u201d said Dalton.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who stole a car,\u201d Cory said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re smart,\u201d said the other boy. \u201cYou could get a scholarship and everything. All I got is a life of crime to look forward to. Right, Officer Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, Dalton. Cory, he does have a point. You could. But if you don\u2019t find a way to cope with your temper, it\u2019ll haunt you all your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cory muttered. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I can\u2019t help it.\u201d He paused. \u201cI was gonna throw that thing through the window, and at the last minute, I threw it in the trash instead.\u201d</p><p>Ah, progress. \u201cOkay, so that was a step in the right direction. You made a less destructive choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get a sticker,\u201d Kelsey Byrd said.</p><p>Em kept talking. \u201cEven little things like taking a deep, slow breath can help. Eat right, get enough fresh air. Those are clich\u00e9s because they\u2019re true. Maybe you could join the boxing club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, like, listen to music?\u201d Tamara suggested. \u201cWhen my mom had my brother and he cried all the time, she\u2019d go into the cellar and play Nine Inch Nails really loud and, like, dance. Badly, I might add. But she always felt better.\u201d</p><p>Cory gave a little smile.</p><p>\u201cFour months till graduation, kids,\u201d Emmaline added. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, graduation,\u201d said Kelsey. \u201cLike that makes a difference.\u201d She folded her arms and rested them on her pregnant belly. She had good reason to be bitter, Em guessed. Single motherhood was hard enough; single teenage motherhood was harder.</p><p>\u201cWell, the thing is, it does make a difference,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t graduate or get a GED, chances are you\u2019ll have to work longer and earn less. And by longer, I mean longer hours and more years. You want a nice car? A decent place to live? A job you like? It\u2019s going to be a lot easier if you stay in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna be on TV,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cLike Ellen.\u201d She took a cookie and bit into it.</p><p>\u201cEllen graduated from high school, dumbass,\u201d Cory said. \u201cHow many days have you missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to hold Sarge,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cCome here, puppy.\u201d Her face softened beneath the harsh makeup.</p><p>Out of these four kids, Em was pretty sure that Tamara, Cory and Dalton had a decent chance. Cory\u2019s parents were doing all the right things for his temper issues, and they adored the kid. Tamara, too, had nice parents and average intelligence; she was just a late bloomer who liked getting attention by acting up. She\u2019d probably go to a community college and figure out what she wanted to do a year or three down the road. Dalton was from a long line of petty criminals; both parents had served time. The kid had a good heart and charm, though, and was as cute as they came. If he could find something that interested him, he might do okay... She could see him in sales or advertising. Or as a grifter. Same thing, really.</p><p>Kelsey, though...Kelsey would be hard-pressed to break out. A baby on the way, her father dead, her mother one of Em\u2019s frequent calls for DUI and possession. They lived in a decrepit farmhouse on the edge of a field. Graying sheets hung in the windows for curtains, and there was a large hole in the roof. Kelsey was already heavily tattooed, seriously overweight and had those expander earrings and a pierced lip. She maintained a D average, and that was through the generosity of her teachers.</p><p>The odds had never been in her favor.</p><p>\u201cKelsey, what was your week like?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>Just then the basement door opened, bringing in a blast of cold air.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d The girl pulled her head back like an offended duck.</p><p>It was Jack.</p><p>Huh. Emmaline hadn\u2019t expected him to show.</p><p>\u201cDude! It\u2019s him! The guy who pulled Sam and Garrett and everyone out of lake. Shit! Nice to meet you, man!\u201d Dalton met Jack halfway and shook his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re, like, a hero or something!\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but something went out in his eyes almost immediately at the mention of the accident. He glanced at her. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cHi, guys. I\u2019m Jack Holland. Heard you need a chemistry tutor.\u201d</p><p>This was met with groans and a general exhausted sinking.</p><p>\u201cAre you a teacher?\u201d Tamara asked, scanning him up and down.</p><p>\u201cCan you make crystal meth?\u201d Dalton asked. \u201cLike that dude on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably could,\u201d Jack said, pulling up a chair next to Emmaline. \u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cJust exploring your options, man. And if you need a Jesse for your Walter White, keep me in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a bomb?\u201d Cory asked, sitting up with interest. \u201cCould you make that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, yes, I could, and, no, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison gas cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison gas, yes. Poison gas cloud? The kind that would float over a city and rain hellfire and brimstone down on people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally!\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what can you do, then?\u201d Tamara asked.</p><p>\u201cMake wine.\u201d</p><p>The kids rolled their eyes and slid deeper down in the folding metal chairs. Everyone made wine around here. How boring indeed.</p><p>\u201cChemists do a bunch of different things,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all really interesting. In organic chemistry, we work with carbon and carbon compounds. We can develop drugs, fertilizers, plastics. Inorganic chemists work with metals, electricity and minerals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop him before I stab myself in the eye,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then we have analytic chemists, who identify materials and evaluate properties, and physical chemists, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing them Jack,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cThey\u2019re literally dying of boredom. Look at them, the poor babies. Dalton? Speak to me! Stay away from the light!\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cI can also guarantee you an A on any chemistry test you have this year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a B+ for physics and biology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re all flunking out. Except Cory,\u201d said Dalton. \u201cYou might want to rethink your statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe offer stands,\u201d Jack said. He looked down at Emmaline. \u201cAs does the offer for dinner,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cOoh, Officer Em! You got a boyfriend! You got a boyfriend!\u201d Tamara crowed, doing a little dance in her chair, and for some reason, it delighted the kids (except Kelsey), who high-fived each other and made Sarge bark with excitement, then pee on the floor. Em got up to get the paper towels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna use chemistry,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t even care if I flunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever hear of oxytocin?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin\u2019s addicted to that,\u201d Tamara said somberly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Oxycontin,\u201d Jack said with a smile. \u201cOxytocin is an amino acid peptide. A hormone. They call it the love chemical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Kelsey gave him a dead-eyed stare.</p><p>\u201cSo when you\u2019re further along in your pregnancy, more oxytocin receptors will be created in your uterine muscles. When the baby\u2019s big enough, your oxytocin level will rise, triggering labor, and will help your muscles contract so you can give birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d said Cory.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMiraculous. Without the oxytocin, your muscles wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to push that baby out. But because of that chemical, you are. You\u2019ll be superhero strong.\u201d He smiled right into Kelsey\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen, when you see your baby, that rush of oxytocin will help you bond. That\u2019s why they call it the love drug. And if you breast-feed, more oxytocin gets released, strengthening that bond. The maternal instinct is the strongest instinct in the world. Chemistry is definitely part of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely breast-feed, Kelsey,\u201d Dalton said, wiggling his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ll supervise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Dalton,\u201d Em said.</p><p>Kelsey had a soft, rapt look on her face.</p><p>Em would bet no one had talked about Kelsey\u2019s pregnancy using words like superhero and miraculous and love and bonding.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Kelsey breathed. Jack glanced at Em, still smiling, and Emmaline felt...well, a little like Kelsey looked. Even if she was cleaning up dog pee.</p><p>She went to the kitchen, washed up and returned. \u201cDalton, it\u2019s your turn. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill out on probation,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cBut he\u2019s getting itchy.\u201d He picked at his shoe. \u201cMaybe you could swing by. I don\u2019t want him to do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Jack was mostly quiet for the rest of the meeting, but it was different, having him there.</p><p>Em knew the kids were only there because they had to be; the alternative was being expelled. But she hoped she wasn\u2019t the typical adult, with too much authority and not enough understanding (like Levi), or one of the irritating kind who pretended to be their age and used words like smexi and hater. She wanted them to be able to count on her. They didn\u2019t have to like her, but she hoped they did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was eight o\u2019clock before she knew it. \u201cPack it in, kids,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShow us your cop trick,\u201d Tamara said. The kids had been ridiculously thrilled last time when she\u2019d radioed Dispatch for an audio check. Smartphones had replaced the wonder of walkie-talkies, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cShoot a bull\u2019s-eye into that clock,\u201d Dalton suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would be illegal and get me fired,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cTase Dalton,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tase anyone, alas,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cSo unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow us how to take down the bad guy,\u201d Cory suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Tamara said.</p><p>\u201cI volunteer,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cDon\u2019t be rough with me, Officer Em.\u201d He grinned like a naughty toddler.</p> <p>\u201cInappropriate, young man,\u201d she said, borrowing a line from her boss. She glanced at Jack. \u201cDo you mind helping me show the kids how to bring down an assailant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt a warm buzz in her lady parts. She was about to touch him, and heck! She needed to get out more. \u201cI might hurt you,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cYou can try,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, a challenge! How thrilling for little old me. Okay, kids, watch this. Jack, go ahead and grab me from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cThere are children present. Behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the bad guy. I\u2019m not supposed to behave.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, then turned her back. Was her heart embarrassing itself by hammering a little too hard and fast? Why, yes, the idiot organ was.</p><p>The kids gathered around to watch.</p><p>\u201cHow should I grab you?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAny way you want,\u201d she said.</p><p>He bear-hugged her, eliciting a bark of joy and some laps of delirious excitement from Sarge, and Em really would\u2019ve liked to just sit there and think happy thoughts and maybe press back a little bit and had she washed her hair today? Hopefully, it smelled good and not like garlic... Oh, where was she? She did a neat step-twist-push, and Jack was down on his knees and then flat on his face, and she had her knee in the small of his back and was handcuffing him.</p><p>Gosh, it was fun.</p> <p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d Em asked, grinning at the kids.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Officer Em!\u201d Tamara yelled. \u201cYou\u2019re such an awesome chick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turn eighteen in two months, Officer Em,\u201d Dalton added. \u201cJust putting that out there.\u201d</p><p>Her dog loped over, licked Em\u2019s face and then bit Jack\u2019s ear. \u201cOw,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it for tonight, kids. I\u2019ll see you next week. And make sure you show up when you said you would for tutoring. Jack is not just here to look pretty.\u201d</p><p>She uncuffed her volunteer, and he got up. \u201cNext time we use handcuffs, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said, his voice low and, uh, scrapey and velvety at the same time. She focused on putting the cuffs back on her belt and not blushing.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Officer Em,\u201d Cory said.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, honey. Stay out of trouble, okay?\u201d</p><p>He muttered assent and left, hitching up his droopy pants. Kelsey followed, staring zombielike at her phone, and Dalton and Tamara headed out, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good with kids,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou, too. I\u2019m surprised you and Hadley didn\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always bring her up?\u201d He folded his arms and gave her a stony glare.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she always around? Why don\u2019t you tell her to take a flying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is America. She can live wherever she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you like having a stalker. How\u2019s her delicate little ankle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwollen and blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going over to carry her to bed? Tuck her in, read her a story?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t answer. Just kept looking at her, then raised an eyebrow with great effect. Em felt her cheeks flush.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Sarge flopped down on the floor and began gnawing on Jack\u2019s bootlace.</p><p>\u201cWould you have dinner with me if Hadley wasn\u2019t around?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you want to have dinner with me if Hadley wasn\u2019t around?\u201d she countered. \u201cThat\u2019s the real question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing I would,\u201d he said, stepping closer. \u201cI had a nice time with you in Malibu. I liked sleeping with you. I\u2019d like to see more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Jack, knock it off.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing! You\u2019re just hard to argue with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t argue.\u201d There it was again, that deep, velvety voice. \u201cJust say yes.\u201d Em swallowed.</p><p>If she were honest, she\u2019d say, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Jack, I want a devoted husband and three extremely well-behaved but delightfully irrepressible children. You up for that? Because otherwise, let\u2019s skip dinner, since I\u2019d probably fall in love with you in twenty, twenty-five minutes, then spend months resenting you for not feeling the same about me.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched her earlobe.</p><p>Good God. She was halfway to Planet Orgasm because he touched her ear. Get a grip, Neal. You own adult toys for a reason.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Emmaline. Say you will.\u201d</p><p>Then again, who was she to tell him he didn\u2019t want to date her? Of course, he wasn\u2019t talking about dating, not really...it was just \u201cdinner,\u201d which probably would lead to sexy time, and in this case, sexy time probably meant \u201cI\u2019d rather do you than have a flashback and also use you to make my ex-wife jealous\u201d and that, friends, was where stupidity lay, but his finger really knew what it was doing, and who knew earlobes were directly connected to other parts of her anatomy?</p><p>His phone chimed with a text.</p><p>Em stepped back. \u201cBet I know who that is,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded normal, she was almost sure.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have dinner with me sometime, Emmaline?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCheck your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you answer, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather you take this first.\u201d Da-da-ling. \u201cOoh. Another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tough,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket, looked at it and put it back. \u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she needs something, and you\u2019re the only one who can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need something, too, and you\u2019re the only one who can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s just it, Jack. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a terrible self-image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. But I can tell the difference between someone who really likes me and someone who needs a distraction from\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her all of a sudden, and how the heck had she gotten against the wall? The clever man had backed her right against it, and holy bleep, Jack could kiss. His mouth was insistent and warm and his hand cupped her face, and she was kissing him back without even thinking about it, and her arms went around his lean waist, and whoops, yes, she might\u2019ve been grabbing his ass, but come on, he was completely irresistible.</p><p>He pulled back a little, then kissed the corner of her mouth. Em was dimly aware that she was breathing hard.</p><p>Jack took her hand and put it over his heart; she felt the hard, solid thumping.</p><p>Damn, he was good.</p><p>\u201cPlease have dinner with me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cSaturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Not put off by her one-word vocabulary, he kissed her forehead and then walked off, just like that, leaving Emmaline shaky and flushed and...and worried.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d need twenty or twenty-five minutes to fall in love. It looked like she\u2019d just needed that kiss.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>\u201cYOU NEED A thong, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The statement was delivered by Allison as they stood over Em\u2019s pathetic wardrobe, the nicest piece being a cashmere sweater with a hole in the sleeve, courtesy of Sarge, who was surreptitiously trying to reclaim it. Allison\u2019s thumbs flew over her phone. \u201cYep. Caroline concurs with my professional opinion.\u201d</p><p>Was it wrong that Allison was consulting her child about slutty underwear? Granted, Caroline was on the elderly side of \u201cchild,\u201d but still. \u201cWell, Jack\u2019s not going to see my underwear,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby doll,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThey all say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s they? Is Jack a slut? Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no! Maybe I could\u2019ve gotten me a little some-some if he was. That being said, he was the best date I\u2019ve ever had, and don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t call Charles to gloat about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Charles?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine. We\u2019re probably getting back together. He\u2019s given up the cookie jars. Don\u2019t tell anyone, though. I want to lord that over his little bald head the rest of our natural days together. Anyway, back to you. Thong. Let\u2019s go. The bridal store has some real nice trashy underwear. Don\u2019t you make that face at me! I assure you, that ex-wife of his wore thongs all the time. Tramps like that give us Southern girls a bad name. And you\u2019re wearing a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a dressy occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush, darlin\u2019. You just let Auntie Allison do the thinking here.\u201d</p><p>And so it was that two hours later, Emmaline stood in her bedroom, cutting the tags off a pale pink lace bra-and-thong set from the bridal shop across the green. They were very pretty. And small. She put the bra on first. A little scratchy, but not too bad.</p><p>And then the thong.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be...did women really...? She must be wearing it wrong, because good God in heaven! It was horrible! Was the little string supposed to...</p><p>She took it off, went to her laptop and Google searched \u201chow to wear a thong.\u201d No, she hadn\u2019t put it on wrong. She tried again.</p><p>Ow. Fantastic. This was just a twenty-five dollar version of a severe wedgie. She picked up her phone and called Allison. \u201cHey, Allison, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d Allison said without bothering to say hello. \u201cTakes a couple of weeks to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks? Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta run. Some kid put a Lego Darth Vader up his nose, and I\u2019m the doc on call tonight.\u201d</p><p>Okay, well, the thong was...horrible; there was no getting around that. But it did look nice. Better than the cotton panties with the orange and purple stripes (on sale, don\u2019t judge) and the rip in the side, purchased in the year I Can\u2019t Remember. And if she was going to sleep with Jack (slow down there, girl, warned the smarter, less slutty part of her brain), she felt he deserved better than orange and purple stripes. And rips. He deserved thongs and shoes with heels and Sicilian hair slime.</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d already slept with Jack felt surreal. The moon had been shining that night, and the doors to the balcony had been flung open, and the ocean had lapped at the shores and all those other innuendo-laden metaphors. If he didn\u2019t refer to it, she\u2019d pretty much think she\u2019d made it all up in a post-wedding, homemade-vodka-induced fantasy.</p><p>But if they slept together here, in Manningsport, it\u2019d be real.</p><p>She took a painful step toward the bathroom. Crikey! That hurt! How was she supposed to be able to walk, let alone sit?</p><p>She practice sat, made it halfway down, then jolted up, causing Sarge to run over to her, jump and cover her front with dog hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A half hour later, after slapping several yards of tape over her front to remove German shepherd fur, Emmaline\u2019s doorbell rang. She hobbled to the door, and there he stood, the blond, the blue-eyed, the beautiful Jack Holland.</p><p>He had a bouquet of red tulips in his hand. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She took the bouquet, mentally counted the number of steps it would take to get to the kitchen and put the flowers in a vase and tossed them on the coffee table. \u201cWhere are we going? O\u2019Rourke\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHugo\u2019s just opened for the season. I thought we\u2019d walk there. It\u2019s nice out. Don\u2019t you want to put those in a vase? Your dog might eat them.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Sarge was snuffling them right now.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSure.\u201d Then, every step a reminder of heretofore ignored parts of her anatomy, she walked into the kitchen, grabbing the flowers on the way. Put them in a vase, stopping for a minute to touch the smooth, cool petals. Nice choice, tulips. Less clich\u00e9 than roses. And she\u2019d always liked how they felt.</p><p>She rubbed a bloom against her lip, breathing in the faint, peachy fragrance. Small wonder deer ate the blossoms right off every spring. She\u2019d almost like to give it a try and see how they tasted.</p><p>Turning, she gave a little start. Jack was leaning in the doorway, hands in his pockets, a half smile on his face.</p><p>Something pulled in her chest.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d She almost forgot her thong pain. He was that beautiful.</p><p>They didn\u2019t hold hands as they walked down the sidewalk, which was a shame. Maybe Jack could carry her and make her forget that her thong was trying to eviscerate her. Also, her left breast was incredibly itchy. She tried to rub it with her upper arm, which just made it worse. Wondered if she could subtly go at it with a fork once they sat down.</p><p>But they were almost there. (Just thirty or forty painful steps to go, and had she mentioned she was wearing heels? Not the sprain-inducing kind, but the kind that nevertheless made her feet throb.) Being a girl sucked.</p><p>Just as they got to Hugo\u2019s, however, Jack stopped in the foyer, and a curse slipped from his lips.</p><p>\u201cForget your wallet? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s you! Honey, look\u2014it\u2019s Jack Holland!\u201d</p><p>Lori Baines charged. A murmur went up from the diners. Lori and Phil Baines were Garrett\u2019s parents. They owed Jack their son\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cJack, it\u2019s so, so good to see you!\u201d She hugged Jack tightly, her shoulders shaking with sobs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re buying you dinner,\u201d said Phil, his voice husky. \u201cWhatever you want, on us. Please let us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d said Jessica Dunn, who worked there one or two nights a week. \u201cTable for two?\u201d</p><p>As for Jack himself, his face was on the gray side, but he was trying to smile as Lori showed him pictures on her phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re staying,\u201d Em murmured. \u201cSorry, Jess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he looks a little...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Em put her hand on his arm. \u201cHey. They don\u2019t have anything gluten-free here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you know how I am about gluten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is the same way,\u201d Lori said. \u201cAnd, Officer Neal, we never thanked you. You were wonderful that night, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad everything turned out okay. For Garrett, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lori said, her eyes filling once more. \u201cThat poor Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive Garrett our best, okay?\u201d Em said. \u201cWe have to be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we wanted to buy you two dinner\u2014\u201d Phil began.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you. Another time, maybe.\u201d Em smiled and took Jack\u2019s arm. \u201cHave a great night.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. Once outside, he started walking toward the green. Em had to hop-run to keep up, hobbled by her underwear.</p><p>He stopped at the first bench they came to and sat down heavily, leaning forward with his head in his hands. Didn\u2019t look up when Em sat beside him, subtly trying to adjust the thong of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She waited. After a minute he ran his hands through his hair and looked at her. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to be sorry about.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and sat back, closing his eyes.</p><p>She wanted to tell him how brave he\u2019d been, tell him about the awe she felt at how he\u2019d put his life on the line for those kids...and how he went back for Josh, even when the odds were so poor.</p><p>But she also knew he\u2019d heard that a thousand times, if not more.</p><p>\u201cPeople think when you rescue someone, it\u2019s the greatest thing ever,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThey never think about how scary it is, all the what-ifs that go through your head.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, the intense blue still a shock to her. \u201cHave you ever saved anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Not the way you did. I\u2019ve pulled over a few drunk drivers. But otherwise, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really hate the hero worship,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m just a winemaker who was taking pictures of the sky that night. It doesn\u2019t get less heroic than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did was extraordinary, Jack.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t. Tell me you wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing if you\u2019d been there. Anyone would\u2019ve. My teenage niece would\u2019ve. Faith would\u2019ve. Her dog would\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did it. You were the one who was there, and you went in and pulled four kids out of a frigid lake, Jack. We might\u2019ve tried, but I don\u2019t know anyone else who could\u2019ve actually done it. And you...you didn\u2019t stop trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Josh Deiner. So much for extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be dead without you.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bitter laugh. \u201cFrom what I can tell, he\u2019s dying right now. Just slowly, in pieces, by inches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo should you have left him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI should\u2019ve done better.\u201d</p><p>Her heart cracked. \u201cYou did your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d He looked at her a moment. \u201cWell, this is cheerful, isn\u2019t it? Come on\u2014let\u2019s get dinner.\u201d He grabbed her hand and hauled her to her feet. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, what you\u2019re going through is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ordering the nachos. You know Connor will put salmon on them if you ask? Sounds disgusting, but it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d He towed her ruthlessly across the green, yanked open the door to the pub and became manically cheerful, kissing Colleen on the cheek, shaking Lucas\u2019s hand. And great. There were Jack\u2019s dad and stepmother. \u201cYou guys know Emmaline, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Of course they know me.\u201d He was vibrating with energy. \u201cNice to see you again, Mr. Holland. Mrs. Holland.\u201d The Jamaican woman gave her a regal nod, and Em suspected she\u2019d just won points for using Mrs. J.\u2019s married name.</p><p>\u201cYou look very pretty tonight, dear,\u201d Jack\u2019s dad said. He had the same blue eyes as his son, and Em felt her cheeks warm with the compliment. \u201cWell! We\u2019ll let you two kids get back to your date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll let you two get back to yours,\u201d Jack said. He took another minute to clap Gerard Chartier on the back and say hello to Lorelei.</p><p>Crikey. Emmaline was surprised he didn\u2019t fly around the room a few times, he had so much energy.</p><p>Finally, they made it to their table.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked as he sat down.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cPlease let\u2019s have a good time tonight,\u201d he said, looking her in the eye, giving her the full power of the blue. \u201cI don\u2019t need a social worker. I need a friend.\u201d</p><p>Naked friends, she\u2019d been thinking after that make-out session in the church basement. If they weren\u2019t going to be na**d friends, she could\u2019ve worn human underwear instead of this razor wire. \u201cFriends it is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Emmaline.\u201d He smiled, a wide, adorable smile, and she had a flash of memory of Jack when he picked Faith up from some high school event, the college boy back to see his family, and how it made her wish she had a big brother.</p><p>They ordered the nachos and burgers and a bottle of wine that, Jack promised, would be perfect with dinner, a fresh, plummy pinot with hints of nutmeg and autumn leaves.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Em said, shifting. The thong was giving her a colonoscopy. She tried sitting on her hands. It didn\u2019t help. Crossed her legs\u2014yow! Bad idea, abort, abort!</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than your panic attack ten minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, ignoring her comment. \u201cWith you. You\u2019ve been walking funny, and you keep fidgeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel good, we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m fine! Okay? I\u2019m better than you, Captain Avoidance.\u201d She shifted, wincing.</p><p>\u201cYou just did it again. You\u2019re like a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a quaint Southern phrase. Did you pick that expression up from your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father, actually. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing a thong, okay? It hurts.\u201d</p><p>Well, that stopped him. It also stopped the Saint Thomas vestry members, too, who were seated at the table next to their booth. Reverend Fisk gave her an appreciative wink, then redirected the rest of them back to their budget woes.</p><p>\u201cA thong, huh?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Enjoy the visual, because I\u2019m never doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s that uncomfortable, you can take it off.\u201d He grinned, the cheeky man.</p><p>\u201cSucks to be a girl, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to take your word for it. But I\u2019m glad you are.\u201d</p><p>A slow roll of squeezing warmth encompassed her stomach. Just then, Hannah set down their nachos, and Prudence Vanderbeek flopped into the seat next to Jack. \u201cHey, Useless! Hey, Em! Can I have some? I\u2019m starving.\u201d She helped herself to a heavily laden chip and bit into it. \u201cAre you guys on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust friends,\u201d Em said at the same time Jack said \u201cYes.\u201d Aha. So maybe the thong had been worth it after all.</p><p>\u201cOoh. I like the conflict,\u201d Pru said. \u201cKeeps things lively. Enjoy all this friction when it\u2019s new, children, because when you\u2019ve been married for a quarter of a century, you start having to be a little more creative in the boudoir, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know what you mean,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you not to tell me what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, ignore him,\u201d Pru said. \u201cI can give you a lifetime\u2019s worth of tips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not take sex tips from my sister,\u201d he said. \u201cPru, get out of here, okay? You\u2019re ruining my game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no game,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sad, smelly bachelor, Emmaline. And have you seen his cat?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cYou can do better.\u201d She took another slab of nachos, smacked Jack on the shoulder and left, her work boots thudding on the wooden floor.</p><p>\u201cDeep down, she loves me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Em did, too, and for a second, they just looked at each other until she broke.</p><p>Damn. Dates were hard. It probably explained why she\u2019d been on so few. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou like being a cop, it seems,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Good. Work. She loved talking about work. \u201cYes. Very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Levi a good boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell him if I say yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. Don\u2019t want him getting too full of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a great boss. Is he a good brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Except that he\u2019s sleeping with my sister, I\u2019m almost positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Faith\u2019s tummy seems to indicate that.\u201d</p><p>Hannah brought them their burgers, ruffled Jack\u2019s hair (it seemed to be the law that if you were female, you had to touch Jack), and they were alone again.</p> <p>And the thing was, it was nice. She was almost relaxed.</p><p>Except when she stopped to look at him for too long. Because, you know, he was just so...good-looking. Everything about him was perfect\u2014his wide, lovely smile, his mouth (every time she thought about kissing, she nearly choked on her food). And his eyes...those sky-blue eyes were just the icing on a very fine cake.</p><p>Whereas she was okay. She was not unpleasant to look at. She also had a good smile, thanks to Dr. Warren\u2019s skill at replacing her front teeth. Her hair was behaving today, courtesy of the ingenious Sicilians.</p><p>She reminded herself to sit up straight, which exacerbated the thong issue. Tried to smile. Did smile. Tried to think of entertaining stories to tell him and came up empty.</p><p>Surely she had entertaining stories. Uh...yeah, she was almost sure she did, but could she tap into those right now? No. There was something about a cat, wasn\u2019t there? Oh, yeah, the cat story! That was a winner!</p><p>\u201cSo the other day, I was on a call, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, guys!\u201d It was Faith, rounder and prettier than ever. \u201cHow are you?\u201d She beamed, hands on her belly.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Emmaline said, ignoring Jack\u2019s groan. \u201cYou and Levi here for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here with my sisters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re spying on Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not be,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPru says you have no game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be more like her, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, God, no. You know what she told me the other day? She and Carl were watching a Walking Dead marathon, which of course put them in the mood for love, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Come on, Faith, you\u2019re as bad as she is.\u201d</p> <p>Faith winked at Emmaline, and Em felt a warm rush of affection. She\u2019d always liked Faith.</p><p>\u201cOh! The baby\u2019s kicking. Feel.\u201d She grabbed Em\u2019s hand and put it against her stomach, and sure enough, there was a mysterious roll and then another.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>There was a baby in there. Okay, obviously, there was a baby in there, but feeling the little thing move around... \u201cThat\u2019s really amazing,\u201d Em said, and her voice was husky.</p><p>\u201cFaith, come on\u2014leave them alone.\u201d Honor Holland came over and gave a rueful grin. \u201cSorry for the parade of sisters, Jack. How are you, Emmaline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine. Nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Come on, Faith. Your nachos just came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Gotta go! Eating for two and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor, you\u2019re my favorite sister,\u201d Jack called as they left.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Faith said over her shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s making you godfather to her firstborn child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it back, Honor. Faith is my favorite,\u201d he said. Honor waved.</p><p>\u201cYou have a very nice family,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay,\u201d he said. \u201cA little overwhelming, but they\u2019re pretty great.\u201d</p><p>Then his gaze jerked to the door.</p><p>Em looked, too.</p><p>Of course. Hadley had just come in, wrapped in a glamorous ivory coat and high caramel leather boots, a green-printed scarf tied in a complicated knot. Her hair was in a ponytail, making her look fresh and energetic. She took off her coat in a graceful swirl, revealing dark green leggings and a really adorable lacy top. Sophisticated yet fresh, casual yet elegant. Maybe Emmaline should take a photo and use it as a reference for how to dress for a date, because suddenly, her basic black dress felt both incredibly boring and pathetically ambitious at the same time.</p><p>She sighed. In another minute, Hadley was going to come over and say hello and make Emmaline feel like a gorilla who\u2019d been allowed to dress up for the evening and play with the humans.</p><p>\u201cSo you had a story about a call?\u201d Jack asked, looking back at Em.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go say hi to your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife, Emmaline, and no. Tell me about the call you went on.\u201d But his gaze drifted back toward Hadley, and he was frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m irritated,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Grumpy Cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at you. We should\u2019ve stayed at Hugo\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve tracked you wherever you are. It\u2019s that computer chip she put in your neck.\u201d Emmaline took a nacho and waited for Hadley to float over and coo at Jack.</p><p>But much to her surprise, Hadley didn\u2019t come over. She did see them, gave a nod and a smile and took a seat at the bar. Not directly in Jack\u2019s line of vision, but not out of it, either.</p><p>Hmm. Suspicious. Even more suspicious, she took a book out of her bag.</p><p>Well, well, well. Hadley could read.</p><p>Then again, Em well knew the loneliness of the dinner table when night after night, it was just you and the quiet. Sometimes it was welcome. Sometimes it was not, and if ever there was a place to come when you felt lonely, this was the place.</p><p>Could be a coincidence that Hadley had shown up.</p><p>\u201cSo you have a cat?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jack said, returning his gaze to her. \u201cLazarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found him when he was a kitten. Looked like he\u2019d been attacked by something, all covered in blood, ear torn off, broken leg. I took him to the vet, and they didn\u2019t expect him to make it through the night, but he did.\u201d</p><p>His left hand was on the table. As was her right hand. Almost touching. She hadn\u2019t even noticed. Should she pull her hand away? Would it be even more obvious that she was nervous if she did?</p><p>He had big hands. Big, strong, masculine hands. Em swallowed.</p><p>Jack\u2019s little finger touched hers, just that smallest caress. A very slight smile tugged as his mouth, and happiness ballooned in her, warm and full.</p><p>He\u2019d brought her flowers. He\u2019d shaved. His little finger was making her feel wobbly, and if his little finger could do that, then what about an entire hand? What about his\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, no! No!\u201d</p><p>Both Em and Jack looked over at Hadley, who had one hand over her mouth, the other clutching her phone to her precious little ear.</p><p>Damsel in distress, take two.</p><p>Emmaline sighed. \u201cGo see what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told her date.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said, though his eyes were on his ex. \u201cIf she needs me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can come over here.\u201d</p><p>Em rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat your burger.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least there was that. She took a bite\u2014one of Connor\u2019s specials with caramelized, crispy onions and some kind of fabulous, gooey cheese\u2014and waited.</p><p>Not for long. Hadley came over, tears spilling out of her Bambi-esque eyes.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2014I\u2019m so sorry to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Hadley?\u201d</p><p>Yes, what indeed? What crisis would require Jack to carry her home this time? \u201cTwist your ankle again?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a death in the family,\u201d Hadley whispered.</p><p>Crap. Em felt two inches tall. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said and reached out her hand to hold Hadley\u2019s. The other woman gave a hitching sob.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Who, Hadley?\u201d Jack asked, standing up.</p><p>Hadley pulled her hand away from Em\u2019s, covered her face and broke down sobbing against Jack\u2019s chest. If she was saying actual words, Em couldn\u2019t make them out. She thought she made out the name Anna. What if Anna was a kid? Or Hadley\u2019s sister? Or grandmother or\u2014</p><p>\u201cI know she was twenty-three, but I guess I just...I just wasn\u2019t ready to lose her. Oh, Jack!\u201d</p><p>Aw, shit. Twenty-three was way too young to lose someone. Poor Hadley! And why wasn\u2019t Jack being nicer? With a sigh, Jack put an arm around her shoulders, which made her burrow against him like a mole. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d he said.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t very nice, especially coming from Jack.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine life without her!\u201d Hadley wept. People were staring openly now.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Anna?\u201d Emmaline murmured.</p><p>\u201cHer cat,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnastasia.\u201d</p><p>Em blinked.</p><p>For crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three, huh?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d Those nachos weren\u2019t going to eat themselves, so Em took some more. Hadley wasn\u2019t exactly going for stoic here. Em noted that her mascara was waterproof. Of course it was.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t even sick,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cThis is such a shock!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Twenty-three sounds like a ripe old age to me,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cIt was probably just her time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t! It was not her time!\u201d Hadley gave her a tragic, wounded (and possibly triumphant) look, then resumed clutching Jack\u2019s shirt. \u201cShe was so healthy. Remember, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut twenty-three,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cQuite, quite old. This can\u2019t be that much of a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked, I tell you! I wasn\u2019t prepared for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why would you be? I mean, don\u2019t most pets live forever?\u201d</p><p>Jack gave her a look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Anastasia,\u201d he said to his ex, trying to hold her at arm\u2019s length, but Teeny Tiny was apparently quite strong and she clutched him harder.</p><p>Em sighed, took another bite of her burger and wondered if it would be rude to check her phone to see the Rangers\u2013Penguins score. In light of the fact that her date was being sobbed on by another woman, she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Several people had inched nearer\u2014the vestry members making sympathetic clucks, Gerard Chartier, Victor and Lorena Iskin. \u201cI had a cat who made it to nineteen,\u201d Lorena said in her booming voice. \u201cIt went under the radiator to die, and I didn\u2019t find him until the smell let me know where he was. Poor old Oscar.\u201d</p><p>Hadley cried harder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the life span of a cat, anyway?\u201d Gerard Chartier asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe fifteen years,\u201d Victor Iskin said, who had many pets himself.</p><p>\u201cFifteen?\u201d Em said, glancing up from her phone. (Rangers up by four, God bless \u2019em.) \u201cWow. Sounds like you got quite lucky there, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t feel so lucky right now, do I?\u201d the li\u2019l ole bit of dandelion fluff snapped. There was a flinty look in her eye, and Emmaline squinted at her. Where was the steel magnolia thing when you needed it? Allison Whitaker would never sob in public like this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d Victor said. \u201cYou could have her stuffed. I do taxidermy on the side, you know.\u201d</p><p>Teeny Tiny\u2019s sobbing escalated.</p><p>Em had had enough. \u201cOkay, Jack, I\u2019ll see you around. My condolences, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d\u2019ve known she was near her time, I would\u2019ve been there with her.\u201d Hadley wept. \u201cOh, Jack, she died without me! How could I have let that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he said. \u201cEm, don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the date. I had such a wonderful time.\u201d She made sure to give him a dead-eyed stare so he wouldn\u2019t miss the sarcasm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come over later,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cStay here and comfort the grieving. I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline\u2014\u201d</p><p>She left.</p> <p>To think she\u2019d worn a thong for this.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>THREE DAYS LATER, Jack woke up in a foul mood.</p><p>He\u2019d walked Hadley home the other night, ignoring the fog of disapproval coming from his sisters and Mrs. J. as he left O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Between them, they\u2019d texted him six times to weigh in.</p><p>Yeah, he was a sucker. But what else was he supposed to have done? Left Hadley there, sobbing her eyes out in a town where no one liked her? Driven an hour to Cornell and dumped her on Frankie\u2019s doorstep? Told her to just deal with it?</p> <p>Princess Anastasia had been Hadley\u2019s beloved pet, no matter how satanic the cat\u2019s personality. Her seventh birthday present. And she truly was devastated. He knew that.</p><p>He left her apartment as soon as decently possible. Walked over to Emmaline\u2019s and stood there in front of her little house. There was a light on upstairs\u2014her bedroom, maybe. The walls were painted green, and the ceiling slanted down. He could see some brick from the exposed chimney.</p><p>Bet her bed was messy and comfortable. Flannel sheets and soft old mattress, a couple of books on the night table. She seemed like the type to let the dog sleep with her.</p><p>He took out his phone and called her. It went right to voice mail. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m standing outside your house. I\u2019m really sorry about tonight.\u201d He paused. \u201cGive me a call, okay?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t. Nope. He had the feeling she wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>Which was too bad, because he liked being with her. She was an odd combination of tough chick and gooey caramel center. She scowled fiercely but wore a thong. Slapped on handcuffs but nuzzled a tulip. A hip check that could castrate a bull, but surprisingly soft and silky skin.</p> <p>Well. His coffee was finished, and it was time to go to work. But first, he clicked on his computer, brought up the local newspaper\u2019s website and checked for news of Josh Deiner\u2019s death.</p><p>Not today. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>Lazarus gave his \u201cfeed me\u201d screech, and Jack obeyed. Mrs. Johnson had chastised him for never coming over for breakfast anymore, and she had bribed him with an offer of a chocolate cake made just for him. It paid to be her favorite.</p><p>He grabbed his keys, mentally reviewing what had to be done today. Cask cleaning, which was good\u2014mindless, hard work. Check the new Riesling vines with Pru, who was concerned that the heavier-than-average snowfall had hurt them. Talk to Dad about trying a new varietal of oak for their chard barrels.</p><p>Stop by the hospital and maybe run into the Deiners coming or going. Maybe they\u2019d tell him how Josh was. Let him see the kid, just for a minute.</p><p>The one who needed you most, and you left him for last.</p><p>Jack left the house, his movements deliberately exact. Locked the door and stopped for a minute.</p><p>The one who needed you most.</p> <p>He stood there a minute, pushing away the memories of that night. Took a slow, deep breath of the cool, damp air. Fog hung heavy over Crooked Lake today, but up here, the pale March sunshine streamed in slices of gold. A crow called from the oak tree, then flew down and landed on a cedar post at the end of a row of vines.</p><p>Another breath, slower this time. There was the stone wall one of his ancestors had built and which Jack kept up, rambling alongside the field.</p><p>He opened the truck door, started to get in and froze.</p><p>There was a dead possum on the dashboard.</p><p>Possums under any circumstances are not attractive animals. But dead...and in Jack\u2019s truck...it was even uglier, its bald tail dangling, its mouth open in a too-wide rictus. Its neck was broken, judging from the sick angle.</p><p>There was no way a possum could\u2019ve gotten into his truck. It didn\u2019t wander in through an open window, because there was no open window; it was early March, for the love of God, and it had been seventeen degrees last night.</p><p>Someone had put it there.</p><p>LATER THAT DAY, Jack drove over to the police station and went inside. \u201cHi, Jack!\u201d Carol said, hopping up for a hug. He obliged. \u201cAre you here to see Emmaline? I heard your date didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol answered. \u201cShe\u2019s taking a class for hostage negotiation. Not that we have many hostages around here.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment he felt was surprising. \u201cIs Levi available?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s in his office on the phone. Levi!\u201d she yelled. \u201cJack\u2019s here and wants to talk to you when you\u2019re off the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great secretary,\u201d Jack observed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an administrative assistant, smart-ass,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t talk fresh to me. I changed your diapers when you were a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that to all the guys,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Jack,\u201d Levi said from his office. \u201cAnd, Carol, please try to master the intercom instead of yelling, okay?\u201d</p><p>Carol rolled her eyes and sat back down, and Jack winked. He\u2019d always loved Mrs. Robinson.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is...well, it\u2019s police business. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Levi sat behind his desk, and Jack sat down, too. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said, picking up a pen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to file a report or anything official,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI found a dead possum in my truck this morning. Its neck was broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you call me right away?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cIt was dead. Its biting days were over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t usually find dead animals in their vehicles, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put on rubber gloves and put it in a garbage bag. It\u2019s in the back of my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I bet you scrubbed that truck down, didn\u2019t you? And erased lots of fingerprints we might\u2019ve been able to lift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can check the door, but, yeah, I did. I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of this. It\u2019s probably just kids.\u201d Poor \u201ckids.\u201d They were blamed for so much.</p><p>Levi was quiet for a minute, doodling on a pad. \u201cAnything else happen recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone left a note on my windshield. It said, \u2018You better watch yourself.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jack, it\u2019s always frustrating when the taxpayers of Manningsport don\u2019t turn to their friendly neighborhood cop for help. Especially when that cop happens to be a member of their family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe notepaper was hot pink, if that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would\u2019ve really helped is if you didn\u2019t throw it away. Anything else you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was another night when I came home and all the lights were on and the front door was open. I might\u2019ve done that myself, though. I\u2019ve been...forgetting things recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat accident was bound to cause some stress. You doing all right otherwise? Any problems sleeping or anything?\u201d</p><p>Nice to know Emmaline hadn\u2019t mentioned anything to her boss. For a second, he thought about telling Levi about the flashbacks and nightmares. But Levi was his brother-in-law, an expectant father, the police chief and combat veteran who probably had flashbacks of his own. Jack wasn\u2019t going to add to his load. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Levi stared at him. Jack stared back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Levi finally said. \u201cSounds to me like someone\u2019s mad at you, Jack. I\u2019d like to talk to the Deiners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir son is in a coma. I doubt very much that they have time to pick up roadkill and sneak it into my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They haven\u2019t left his side, so I doubt it, too.\u201d Levi leaned back in his chair. \u201cHow about your ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>The thought had crossed his mind. \u201cThe lights and the note on the windshield, maybe. But not the dead possum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Nothing makes people crazier than jealousy.\u201d</p><p>Jack paused. Hadley was a little...off; that was true. He couldn\u2019t see her doing this, though. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like her style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might ask her some questions just the same. Be smart, Jack. If something else happens, tell me. The dead animal in your truck\u2014that ups the stakes a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d There was a picture of Faith on the bookcase behind Levi. \u201cHow\u2019s my sister?\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s expression changed from stoic police chief to goofy-in-love. \u201cShe\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Can\u2019t wait to see my nephew.\u201d He stood up and shook Levi\u2019s hand. \u201cGotta go.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline still wasn\u2019t back.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cREMEMBER, THIS PERSON IS, for the time being, your friend,\u201d Jamie the badass instructor said. \u201cEven if you hate what they\u2019re doing and wish you could kick them in the sac, for now, you empathize, you listen, you mirror.\u201d She tapped the whiteboard to emphasize the words she\u2019d written there. \u201cDon\u2019t tell them that what they\u2019re doing is crazy or stupid. Don\u2019t deny what they\u2019re feeling. That\u2019s creating an argument, and you want them to feel they can trust you. Okay? Emmaline and Butch, you\u2019re up. Em, you\u2019re the tormented woman with your parents held at gunpoint. And...action.\u201d</p><p>Butch cleared his throat. He and Em were sitting in chairs at the front of the class, facing away from each other while Shirley and Gale pretended to be the cowering parents.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you and your parents?\u201d Butch asked.</p><p>\u201cI hate them,\u201d Em said, winking at Shirley, who was her best bud in the class.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, everyone hates their parents. I hate mine, too,\u201d Butch said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Butch,\u201d Jamie interrupted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about Em and her shitty parents. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Butch said. \u201cUh...hate your parents, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Em said. \u201cThey love my sister best.\u201d Might as well go for something close to home.</p><p>\u201cLove your sister best, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d Butch asked. Em could practically hear him sweating; he wasn\u2019t the best student in the group.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s just better. Prettier, smarter, nicer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hold them hostage,\u201d Ingrid quipped.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Butch,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cSo...uh...what should I say next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about some emotional labeling?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cIdentify her feelings so she\u2019ll know you understand her situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Uh, so you\u2019re really pissed, right?\u201d</p><p>Em tried not to smile. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pissed! That\u2019s why I tied up my parents and have this gun!\u201d Role-playing was fun.</p><p>To be honest, there was a lot more psychological work in this field than Em had anticipated. Mirroring, empathy, active listening, behavioral change... For the first time in her life, she understood why her parents loved their jobs so much.</p><p>\u201cLet me take over, Butch,\u201d Jamie said. She kicked Butch out of his chair and sat down. \u201cSo, Em, you\u2019re feeling like it\u2019s not fair that your parents favor your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cThat must be really frustrating. Note, class, that I\u2019m labeling her feelings, not just echoing them, like Butchie was\u2014no offense, Butch. But when I put a label on them, Em can see that I get it, and that I understand her. We\u2019re creating empathy here. Okay, Em, back to you. That must be frustrating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Em felt a pang of guilt. \u201cBut I was no picnic, and my sister really is pretty great.\u201d Speaking of Flawless Angela...Em should give her a call.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you guys are close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Pretty much. She\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019d say about this situation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019d tell me not to do it.\u201d Jamie didn\u2019t respond, so Em kept talking. \u201cShe\u2019d be upset. Devastated, really. She loves them a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how I paused there, people?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a rapid-fire police interrogation where you\u2019re trying to keep someone off balance to get them to tell the truth. Sometimes the pauses let your bad guy do some thinking, and their situation starts to sink in.\u201d She stood up. \u201cAnd that, my friends, is all the time we have. Good job today.\u201d</p><p>On the way home, Levi radioed in and asked her to check on Alice McPhales, a sweet old lady struggling with dementia. She still lived on her own, but it was a matter of time before her son had to make some changes. She called the police at least three times a week, convinced she saw people creeping around her property, which was a farmhouse on the outskirts of town. Today she\u2019d reported that someone had broken into her house. She called with this complaint a few times a month, so Em wasn\u2019t really worried.</p><p>Everett pulled up in his cruiser just as she did. \u201cSlow day?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the perimeter for intruders,\u201d Everett said, reaching for his gun.</p> <p>\u201cKeep that in the holster, dumbass,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I supposed to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t like going in there. It\u2019s too crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverett...never mind. Knock yourself out and check the perimeter, but if you pull that gun out for anything less than an alien attack, I\u2019m telling Levi.\u201d</p><p>Everett muttered and kicked some grass.</p><p>\u201cMrs. McPhales?\u201d Emmaline called as she knocked.</p><p>The old lady opened the door a crack. \u201cWhere\u2019s Levi?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the station. He asked me to come instead. I\u2019m Emmaline Neal. Luanne Macomb\u2019s granddaughter. Remember? I\u2019m a police officer, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Luanne. She\u2019s lovely! Such a good knitter! Tell her I said hello, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that, Mrs. McPhales.\u201d No point in reminding the old lady her friend was gone. \u201cCan I come in and check things out?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. McPhales\u2019s house was typical for an old person\u2014too cluttered, too many little rugs that would make tripping easy. It was dark, too, since she had all the curtains drawn. \u201cWhat seems to be missing, Mrs. McPhales?\u201d she asked as she turned on a light.</p><p>\u201cThe gravy boat my grandmother gave me! I can\u2019t believe they took it!\u201d The old lady began to cry. \u201cIt was so beautiful, and now it\u2019s gone. They must\u2019ve come in when I was sleeping. I\u2019ll never feel safe here again, and my husband built this house. They\u2019ve ruined it! They\u2019ve soiled it!\u201d</p><p>Em put her arm around her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I make you a cup of tea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI prefer coffee. But the...the...black box in the kitchen is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coffeemaker?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Em went into the kitchen. Dirty dishes were piled in the sink. The coffeemaker was unplugged. She plugged it back in and made coffee, and, while that was brewing, she filled the sink with hot water.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Mrs. McPhales said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind. I like doing dishes. You can tell me where they go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerimeter is clear,\u201d came Everett\u2019s voice over the radio.</p><p>\u201cImagine that,\u201d Em muttered. \u201cRoger,\u201d she said back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you head back, Ev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, heading back to the station.\u201d</p><p>The cupboards were a mess\u2014cereal boxes in with the glassware, an open jar of peanut butter in a colander. Em straightened up as best she could, then poured Alice some coffee. \u201cSo what does this gravy boat look like?\u201d She took out her notebook so Mrs. McPhales wouldn\u2019t feel like Em was merely tolerating her.</p><p>Mrs. McPhales took a sip of her coffee. \u201cWhat gravy boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one your grandmother gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It was white with pink flowers. It was very old. She brought it from England, and when I was little, she\u2019d put it out at Christmas. I just loved seeing it on her table. It was so fancy and beautiful.\u201d She started to cry noiselessly, and Em\u2019s heart gave a tug. Her father\u2019s parents had died when she was little, Nana of a massive stroke or heart attack that took her while she was sleeping.</p><p>Em lived in Michigan at the time, and she remembered crumpling when her mom told her the news, and how wonderful Kevin had been, holding her close, the comforting smell of his shirt, the ever-present tang of his sweat, back when he carried so much extra weight.</p><p>Nana had been lucky. Old age wasn\u2019t so kind to most.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a look around,\u201d she said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find it! They took it. Those men, I wish they wouldn\u2019t come here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I take a look around anyway? Make sure nothing else is missing.\u201d Em rested her hand on Mrs. McPhales\u2019s shoulder, and the old lady blinked up at her, her eyes still teary.</p><p>\u201cWould you, dear? Oh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>The gravy boat was in the bathroom, perched on the radiator. \u201cIs this it?\u201d Em asked, returning to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou got it back! Oh, thank you, darling! Thank you! Oh, I just love you!\u201d Em smiled, though she wasn\u2019t sure if Alice was talking to the gravy boat or to her.</p><p>After Em made Mrs. McPhales a sandwich and checked all the windows and locks for the old lady\u2019s peace of mind, she went out to her car and radioed Levi. \u201cAll clear here, Chief. But I think you should talk to her son about getting her into Rushing Creek, or maybe finding some live-in help. She\u2019s awfully isolated up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on back to the station. I need you to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chief Cooper, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>Em smiled as she clicked off. Levi took himself a little too seriously, but it was oddly endearing. He was a good boss and a better cop. Not that he needed to hear it from her\u2014the townspeople worshipped the guy.</p><p>Em called her parents from the car. Pretending to hold them hostage and then seeing Mrs. McPhales so blue...well, heck. Her parents weren\u2019t getting any younger.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said when her mother picked up.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline! Are you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just calling to say hi.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how are you?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>There was another pause. \u201cDid you get those pictures I sent you from the wedding?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>Did she ever. \u201cI sure did. Why would you send me pictures of Kevin and Naomi, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Does it still bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t want to see them kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought some immersion therapy might help you get over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help.\u201d Except in talking to you, it seems. \u201cI\u2019m really fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting that you choose that word to characterize yourself, darling.\u201d</p><p>Mom was in psychotherapy mode. Conversation between the two of them had never been a strong point. Em tried again. \u201cSo guess what? I\u2019m taking a crisis negotiations class, and it\u2019s got a lot of psychology in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Emmaline waited for a question, using the pause technique. No question came. \u201cI guess I can see why you like your work so much.\u201d Rapport, anyone?</p><p>Silence. Okay, so rapport was harder than it looked. \u201cHow\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>Em sighed. Mom was like this sometimes, usually after a fight with Dad. \u201cOkay, Mom, good talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming home, Emmaline?\u201d</p><p>Em caught her own grimace in the rearview mirror. \u201cUm, maybe a weekend this summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, when are you coming home for good, Emmaline? Your stint as a police officer has gone on long enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a career, Mom. And I really like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019re hiding from your real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Kevin is truly behind you and you\u2019ve had closure, you can come home. I saw how miserable you were at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ma, first of all, you sold my home. And secondly, of course, the wedding was awkward. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re so smart. What about your degree? Don\u2019t you miss journalism? Surely you want to do something more meaningful than write out parking tickets.\u201d</p><p>Only a mother could stab so directly. Em made sure to keep her voice level. \u201cMy job is meaningful, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be so much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, look at your sister! A doctorate in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about the PhD, Mom. I\u2019m happy doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>Alice McPhales didn\u2019t think so. Her at-risk kids didn\u2019t think so (hopefully).</p><p>\u201cGotta go, Mom. I\u2019m at the station.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and unclenched her jaw.</p><p>When Levi had first offered her the job, he\u2019d made it clear that it would be 90 percent community service and 10 percent law enforcement. The occasional B and E, speeders and DUIs were about as dramatic as it got.</p><p>Well, hell, Jack\u2019s rescue. That had been dramatic (and terrifying, seeing him with ice in his hair, pushing on Josh Deiner\u2019s chest, the boys clustered around him in a knot of helpless terror).</p><p>But doing Mrs. McPhales\u2019s dishes and finding her beloved gravy boat... There was a warm golden weight in her chest because of that.</p><p>\u201cHow was class?\u201d Levi asked as she came in.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I have another job for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free, Chief,\u201d Everett volunteered. \u201cIs it dangerous?\u201d Automatically, his hand went to his gun.</p><p>Levi gave Everett a long-suffering look. \u201cNo, Everett. I need Emmaline. And if I see you fondling that gun one more time this week, I\u2019m taking it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief. No gun fondling. Yes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome into my office, Em.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, snagging a cookie from Carol\u2019s desk. Mmm. Oatmeal raisin. \u201cTake two,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cGet in line,\u201d Carol retorted.</p><p>Levi sat behind his desk and folded his hands. \u201cI need you to check on something. Seems like someone\u2019s got a grudge against Jack. Mostly mischief, but it\u2019s getting a little nasty. First, someone went into his house, turned on all the lights and left the doors and windows open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Deiners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s them, since they\u2019re always at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis ex-wife, maybe?\u201d She could kind of see Hadley doing something like that as a way to show Jack he needed her back...but no, Hadley seemed more the sort to go for the \u201crescue me\u201d theme.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Levi said. \u201cA week ago, he got a note on his windshield that said \u2018You better watch yourself.\u2019 Hot pink paper, laser-printed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he save it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Em made a disgusted noise. \u201cDoes no one watch NCIS?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. And then this morning, he found a dead possum in his truck. Neck broken.\u201d</p><p>Em jumped a little. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Levi looked at the wall. \u201cI want you to go up to his place as a security detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA security detail? What am I, the Secret Service?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get fresh with me, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a year older than you, Levi. Do you really think he\u2019s in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our job to make sure he\u2019s not.\u201d Levi picked up a pen and started fiddling with it. He didn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>\u201cChief,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have three people on this police force. You think a dead rodent means I should babysit Jack Holl\u2014 Oh, my God, you\u2019re matchmaking, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed. \u201cFaith made me do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m your boss. Please make sure Jack\u2019s tucked in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Chief Cooper, Officer Neal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t get official on me!\u201d She slumped back in her chair. \u201cOkay, the broken neck thing is creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t Everett do it? You know how he likes to wander around with his hand on his gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he\u2019s going to shoot his foot off one day because of it.\u201d Levi sighed. \u201cYou have to admit, a dead possum in someone\u2019s truck is unusual. So get that look off your face and go up there and check on him. Check around his property. And maybe talk to his ex-wife. Faith said she was a little...unstable. If she deliberately sprained her ankle to get Jack\u2019s attention\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014who\u2019s to say she wouldn\u2019t pick up roadkill and put it in his truck? Especially if she\u2019s mad at him for dating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dating me. He keeps trying to date me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about personal lives, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one pimping me out here, Levi.\u201d</p><p>He crinkled his brow at her. Stared, patiently, slightly bored.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so very much, Officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep this in mind during my annual review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d He allowed a faint smile, then waved her out of the office.</p><p>EM\u2019S FIRST STOP was the Opera House. She clomped up the stairs and knocked on the door of apartment 3-C. Hadley opened the door, a bright, expectant smile on her face that dropped like a lead hockey puck at the sight of Not Jack. \u201cHello, Miss Boudreau,\u201d Em said. \u201cMind if I come in and ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jack all right?\u201d she breathed, peering around the door.</p><p>\u201cInteresting you should ask. Any reason he wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Em asked, cocking an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUm, I...I have no idea!\u201d She flushed.</p><p>Guilty, Em thought. She waited.</p><p>\u201cWell, do come in!\u201d Hadley said. \u201cWhere are my manners?\u201d</p><p>She was wearing a dress, a rose-colored sheath kind of thing that Em imagined would make her look as shapely as a pillow but on Hadley looked romantic and delicate. Her long blond hair was caught at the nape of her neck in the type of artless, casual ponytail that Em had never been able to master; her thick, not-straight, not-curly locks were the Houdini of hair and could only be forced into her regulation bun with a combination of the magic slime, a thick supermarket elastic once used to lump the broccoli together and seventeen bobby pins.</p><p>Suppressing a sigh\u2014she wasn\u2019t supposed to care about this stuff anymore\u2014she stepped into the dimly lit apartment. It had come furnished, Emmaline knew, but Hadley had put her mark on it. A vase of pink and purple tulips sat on the coffee table, and a soft ivory wrap was artfully draped on the arm of the sofa. Lots of throw pillows, a series of framed mirrors on the brick wall. Two or three candles filled the room with the scent of lavender, clogging Em\u2019s throat.</p><p>The whole room was set up for seduction.</p><p>Oh, and how cute. A giant wedding photo of Hadley and Jack sat on the bookcase, impossible to ignore. Em had to admit\u2014Jack Holland in navy whites was a very nice sight. He and Hadley made a gorgeous couple; it couldn\u2019t be denied. Hadley was beautiful and radiant and tiny, and Jack...Jack looked incredibly happy.</p><p>Em forced her eyes away from the photo. A bottle of wine, nearly three quarters empty, sat on the counter. One glass. The cork and corkscrew were over by the sink, indicating that it had been opened recently.</p><p>A lot of wine for such a petite woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Officer?\u201d Hadley asked.</p><p>\u201cJack found a dead possum in his truck today. Would you happen to know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s just awful! Was he upset? Should I call him? Does he need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t even pressing charges. Maybe he knew it was his ex and didn\u2019t want her in trouble. \u201cIs there anyone who can confirm that?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact. I talked to my sister around ten. Frankie. Jack\u2019s very fond of her. He loves my family. Well, they\u2019re his family, too, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go anywhere?\u201d</p><p>Hadley folded her arms. \u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t do anything. You think I\u2019d touch a dead animal? Do I strike you as that type?\u201d She had a point. As much as Emmaline would love to arrest Hadley for criminal mischief, she really couldn\u2019t see her getting her perfect little manicured hands dirty. \u201cAfter I talked to Frankie, I went straight to bed to get some beauty sleep. Maybe you should try it.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline indulged in a brief fantasy in which she slapped some cuffs on Teeny Tiny and Mirandized her. Put her in the holding cell. Happy thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDo you always drink alone, Miss Boudreau?\u201d Em asked, nodding at the wine bottle and glass.</p><p>\u201cWell, being married to a winemaker certainly developed my appreciation for wine, Officer. But not always. Sometimes Jack and I have a glass together.\u201d</p><p>Em didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t drink and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m perfectly sober. In fact, it sounds like Jack shouldn\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll go on up and check in on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, Miss Boudreau. The police have this covered.\u201d</p><p>Hadley scowled. \u201cWell, I think Jack could use some company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief Cooper thinks so, too, which is why I\u2019m going up there right now. I hope not to see any trespassers. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>She left the Opera House and walked across the green, past O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, which was already jumping, and down the street to her own little place. She needed to feed Sarge. Might as well bring Super-Pup, too, if she had to hang out at Jack\u2019s.</p><p>Sarge twirled in circles of joy when she came through the door, Squeaky Chicken clutched in his mouth. \u201cHi, handsome! Are you happy to see me? You are?\u201d Indeed, Sarge was whimpering and crooning with joy. Em ruffled his sides with both hands and let him lick her face for a few minutes. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? Huh? You are, buddy! Come on\u2014out you go!\u201d</p><p>While Sarge did his business in the backyard, Em took a look around.</p><p>It didn\u2019t glow with femininity the way Hadley\u2019s apartment did, that was for sure. But it was a happy space. There were a few pictures on the mantel; one of her and Angela, another of Levi pinning on her badge the day she\u2019d graduated from the academy. Her and Nana one summer day long ago, both of them laughing, Em\u2019s two front teeth missing. The furniture was comfortable and sturdy (rather like herself). Lots of books in the built-in shelves. A beautiful Tiffany lamp that she\u2019d splurged on at Presque Antiques on the green.</p><p>This house was where she\u2019d spent the happiest times of her life, aside from those years with Kevin. This was more home than the place where she\u2019d grown up, which was someone else\u2019s now, anyway. But it still gave her a pang, the ease with which her parents had sent their only child away for the bulk of every summer. They\u2019d kept Angela close by their sides; even after the divorce, they were unable to split up because they might not see her as much.</p><p>Well. They had done Emmaline a favor. She\u2019d been better off here.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sarge,\u201d she said, as her dog raced in through the doggy door. \u201cWe have guard duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>JACK FOUND THAT cooking had taken on greater importance since the accident, as it gave his mind something to think about. A science podcast was playing on his computer; another tool to keep his brain occupied.</p><p>Oddly enough, he wasn\u2019t really concerned about the possum in his truck. A teenager, he figured, probably one of Josh Deiner\u2019s friends. And if so, Jack sort of deserved it, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>His phone buzzed with an incoming text. Hadley. Great.</p><p>Heard about \u201cincident\u201d 2day. U ok???? Xoxox</p><p>Was it so hard to spell out the words? Text-style spelling would make Stephen Hawking seem idiotic. He opted not to answer.</p><p>That was a mistake. His phone buzzed again, vibrating on the counter.</p><p>Pls let me know ur ok.</p><p>Jack sighed.</p><p>U want 2 come over 4 dinner???</p><p>She had fast thumbs, he\u2019d give her that.</p><p>I can come 2 c u if easier. :)</p><p>And now a smiley face, for the love of God.</p><p>Give me a call, ok???</p><p>No, thanks, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Miss u!!!</p><p>Worried about u!!!</p><p>It was the emotional equivalent of nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>And now the phone was ringing. Three guesses as to who it was. He didn\u2019t bother picking up, but he did text her back. I\u2019m fine. Nothing to worry about.</p><p>He thought about turning off his cell, but he didn\u2019t have a landline. And his grandfather had been looking a little gray lately. Jack had asked Jeremy Lyon to drop in on Pops, as the old man wouldn\u2019t go to the doctor without a gun to his head.</p><p>He added sausage to the garlic and onions he was saut\u00e9ing. This would be a good dinner. Then again, food hadn\u2019t tasted like much these days. Oh, and there was Mrs. Johnson\u2019s chocolate cake for dessert. He picked up his phone and called her.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to thank you again for my cake,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jackie, don\u2019t be silly! You know I love you best,\u201d Mrs. J. cooed.</p><p>\u201cI do know that, and I lord it over my sisters whenever possible. And Dad.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat are you guys doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business, Jack darling.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Thanks again, Mrs. J.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he should get a dog. Lazarus wasn\u2019t much in the company department. As if determined to prove him wrong, the cat rubbed against Jack\u2019s ankle in a rare show of affection, then hissed and ran under the couch.</p><p>A knock came at the door, and Jack felt his jaw tighten. He turned off the stove and went to the door. If that was Hadley, he just might call the police.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Hadley. It was the police, still in uniform. And the police officer\u2019s puppy, holding a stuffed animal in his mouth.</p><p>Jack felt himself smiling. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, opening the door. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is police business,\u201d she said, already blushing. \u201cLevi made me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe him one,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome in. I\u2019m making dinner. You can stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re just, um, checking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? For dead possums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically. Mind if I walk around your property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d He grabbed his jacket. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Jack said, bending down to pet the puppy, who wriggled in ecstasy, then whipped his toy\u2014a chicken\u2014back and forth. Lazarus darted out and ran under a bush, the better to spy on the dog. Jack stood up, catching the smell of Emmaline\u2019s shampoo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nice.</p><p>She had beautiful eyes. Cat-shaped and blue. Her mouth... He remembered that mouth. Hell, yeah. That was a good mouth. Perfect for kissing. Perfect for\u2014</p><p>He realized he was staring and cleared his throat. \u201cSo what are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSigns of a trespasser.\u201d She jammed her hands in her jacket pockets. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have wiped down the truck, by the way. Next time a crime is committed against you, please let the professionals do their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSave it,\u201d he said. \u201cLevi already lectured me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your driveway the only way up here?\u201d she asked, starting off toward the stone wall that bordered the woods.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can drive up from the other side of the ridge and go through the Ellis property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d wake up if someone drove up your driveway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s gravel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I bet Possum Person came through the back way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds about right.\u201d</p><p>The snow had melted during a brief warm spell, but the temperature had dropped back to the twenties last night. Their breath fogged in the sharp, clean air. Sarge snuffled behind them, off his leash, and Lazarus brought up the rear.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have any ideas who might leave a dead possum in your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of Josh\u2019s friends, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s my best guess, too.\u201d</p><p>The light was fading, the sunset brilliant red on the horizon.</p><p>Same as the day the kids went into the lake.</p><p>The thought swelled in Jack\u2019s brain, blotting everything else out. The bottom of the car, so clear and foreign, sailing over his head. The thunk of the camera as he dropped it on the dock. The steely bite of the water over his head as he dived.</p><p>For a second, he couldn\u2019t breathe; he was looking up at the red-and-purple sky so far away. Josh wasn\u2019t budging, and Jack was out of air, and his vision was shutting down, and Josh was already dying. He was\u2014</p><p>There was fur against his mouth, and a warm, wriggling body against his chest. Em had handed him the puppy.</p><p>\u201cHis paws are a little cold. Would you mind holding him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure.\u201d Sarge was already joyfully licking his face and whining. \u201cEasy, pal,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe barely know each other.\u201d His voice was almost normal.</p> <p>The dog made a mooing noise, then put his head on Jack\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Emmaline was studiously not looking at them, holding the dog\u2019s toy chicken. It occurred to Jack that she\u2019d given him the dog for a reason.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get this guy, anyway?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cBryce Campbell. He owns the animal shelter now. Hey, is that Jeremy\u2019s place over there?\u201d She pointed to the Lyons Den, the nearest neighbor to Blue Heron, owned by Faith\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so nice. Maybe you could talk to him about your PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you aware that two minutes ago, you stopped in your tracks and didn\u2019t answer me till I handed you my dog?\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this up, okay? The perimeter check or whatever you\u2019re doing. Then you can stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but as they got close to the house, she stopped at each window and looked at the ground. \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no snow. And it\u2019s too cold for muddy prints,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe someone dropped a cigarette butt or something.\u201d</p><p>Sarge was snoring gently.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m done,\u201d Em said, seeming chagrined that she hadn\u2019t found anything incriminating.</p><p>\u201cGood. When do you get off duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on call tonight.\u201d</p><p>Just then her phone chimed. Jack\u2019s did, too. He checked it with his free hand\u2014Levi\u2019s taking tonight\u2019s shift, so if Emmaline\u2019s there, why don\u2019t you have her stay for dinner? xox your favorite sister.</p><p>Em sighed.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re not working tonight, I guess you can stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWho says I\u2019m not working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boss\u2019s wife.\u201d He smiled. \u201cCome on, Em. Stay. I could use the company. Stop scowling. I\u2019m a good cook. And since you\u2019re off duty, you can have a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>JACK HOLLAND LOOKED awfully good in the kitchen, Em thought. He caught her looking, and she jerked her gaze away.</p><p>\u201cI visited your wife earlier,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI have no wife,\u201d he answered calmly, pouring her a glass of white. \u201cOur unoaked Granite Chardonnay, so named because it comes from the field next to the family cemetery, and we felt funny about naming it Cemetery Chard. Vanilla and floral bouquet, clean mineral notes, a buttery finish that lingers on the palate. Why on earth would you go see Hadley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask about that possum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just stirring the crazy pot, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more attention you give her, the worse she gets.\u201d His fingers brushed hers as he handed her the glass, and a current ran up her arm.</p><p>She sat on the stool at the counter and took a sip of wine. \u201cYou like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStab me in the heart, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed awfully thrilled that someone\u2019s stalking you.\u201d</p><p>Jack set down the spatula from whatever meaty, yummy thing he was stirring. \u201cEmmaline, I don\u2019t want to talk about my ex-wife. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What are you cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Italian sausage ragout in a creamy vodka sauce with broccoli rabe over penne. Here. Taste it.\u201d He held the wooden spoon to her mouth, and she obeyed.</p><p>Holy food orgasm. Spicy and creamy and sweet and frickin\u2019 unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou cook like this every night?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes were on her mouth. \u201cI could if I had a reason.\u201d</p><p>She stopped chewing. Swallowed a bit hard.</p><p>Men like Jack should be careful about what they said. A lot could be read into a statement like that.</p><p>Then his cat made a sound like an old screen door, and Sarge dashed after him. \u201cWant me to put the dog in the cellar?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Lazarus can take care of himself.\u201d He got a spice out of the cupboard and added it to the frying pan.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time a man had cooked for her. Well, cooked her a meal she actually wanted to eat. Those last few months with Kevin didn\u2019t count.</p><p>A fire crackled and popped in the big stone fireplace in the great room. Em got up and wandered around.</p><p>Jack had a few pictures here and there\u2014one of Levi and Faith and Blue from last year, at their wedding. Em had gone to that one, and she remembered the photo being taken, people laughing as Blue kept nudging in between the couple. Another photo from a wedding she\u2019d gone to, Tom and Honor\u2019s. This one was of Jack and Honor. Nice. Here was one of Jack and his father holding up a gold medal and a bottle of wine. Another Holland family portrait, but this one with Jack\u2019s mother in it. Prudence\u2019s wedding, young Jack tall and skinny and geeky-cute.</p><p>The bookcase was filled with biographies and political thrillers, the typical man stuff when it came to reading. A couple dozen tomes on wine, as one would expect.</p><p>The windows showcased the Holland farmland, all the way down to Keuka.</p><p>Jack\u2019s furniture was beautiful\u2014simple and functional, but with inlaid wood and graceful lines. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d she said, running her finger along a tall narrow table.</p><p>\u201cI made it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Of course he made it. He saved children and made beautiful furniture and cooked and looked like a movie star.</p><p>\u201cIt was my first and last project,\u201d he said. \u201cI almost cut off my finger with the miter saw.\u201d He grinned and held up a hand. \u201cNineteen stitches.\u201d</p><p>Oddly enough, it was nice to know.</p><p>\u201cI got my front teeth knocked out in college,\u201d Em said. \u201cHockey. Five stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Are those teeth fake, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The miracles of modern medicine. The dentist put them right back in. It was gross. Lots of blood. I was extremely brave, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo scar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>The scar was just above her upper lip, a faint white line about half an inch long, barely noticeable. \u201cIt\u2019s there. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He came out of the kitchen and stood in front of her. Cupped her face in his hands and stared at her mouth.</p><p>Emmaline could feel her heartbeat, slow, rolling thumps.</p><p>His face was serious. Mouth perfect. She didn\u2019t even dare look at his eyes for fear that her knees would buckle.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere it is.\u201d He ran his thumb over the scar, and Em sort of forgot how to breathe. Was it in-in-out? Or...oh, wow, those eyes\u2014oops, she\u2019d looked\u2014were so beautiful. All of him was so\u2014</p><p>Lazarus came tearing into the room, Sarge hot on his heels. The cat veered under a couch; Wonder Pup didn\u2019t steer that well and crashed into Em\u2019s legs.</p><p>Emmaline stepped back. Cleared her throat. She was still in uniform. It was probably against some rule to kiss in uniform.</p><p>\u201cSarge, go lie down,\u201d she ordered. The puppy gave her a reproachful look. \u201cDo it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He obeyed, giving her a mournful eyebrow as only a German shepherd could.</p><p>A timer went off in the kitchen, and Jack went back behind the counter.</p><p>Fat snowflakes began falling from the sky.</p><p>It was utterly romantic here, even with the demonic sounds the cat was making from under the couch. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. That\u2019s his normal.\u201d</p><p>Jack seemed irritatingly unaffected by her scar-touching. Men. Such mysteries. She sat back down at the counter and watched him stir and nudge and adjust the heat. Captain Seduction one minute, Chef Ramsay the next.</p><p>Em had always had a thing for Gordon Ramsay, now that she thought of it.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question, Jack?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me? There are a lot of women in this town who\u2019d love to go out with you. Who fantasize about going out with you. Who\u2019d run their grandmothers over with a tractor to go out with you. Why are you interested in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a guy. We don\u2019t think that hard. Is \u2018because you\u2019re good in bed\u2019 a sufficient answer?\u201d</p><p>A surprised snort of laughter escaped. \u201cUm, no.\u201d</p><p>He poured her more wine. Such nice manners. \u201cI have a question for you, Officer. Why won\u2019t you go out with me? And don\u2019t give me that bullshit about me still having a thing for Hadley or having PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have a thing for Hadley. And you\u2019re the poster child for PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear that and await your answer.\u201d</p><p>Em covered by taking a sip of her drink. It really was fantastic. She\u2019d never paid much attention to wine descriptions\u2014it was wine, how bad could it be?\u2014but when Jack identified the flavors the way he did, she really could taste them. Guess it wasn\u2019t just blowing smoke after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Hadley wasn\u2019t in town?\u201d he asked when she failed to answer. \u201cAnd what if those kids didn\u2019t...crash? Would you go out with me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were never interested before, so I\u2019d have to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could say you were the one who was never interested, whereas I always thought of you as the hot hockey chick.\u201d</p><p>Another snort. Must stop doing that. \u201cYou never asked me out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never gave me the time of day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were pining for me, you hid it well.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a tolerant look. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pining for you, Emmaline. I did think you were the hot hockey chick. We all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich explains why I\u2019ve had two dates in three years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe your sweet and gentle personality has something to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rest my case.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a sweet and gentle attitude. You do have to at least smile once in a while. You\u2019re a tiny bit guarded\u2014has anyone ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, as a matter of fact,\u201d she lied. She took another sip of wine. Make that a chug. \u201cThen there are your looks.\u201d Shut it, Em, her brain advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hideous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. I\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you.\u201d He smiled, and her mouth went dry. \u201cNo...you\u2019re...incredibly good-looking. It\u2019s a consideration.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as if she were a complicated algebra equation. \u201cSo you\u2019re not interested in me because I\u2019m incredibly good-looking, since your ex was also good-looking and he broke your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn addition to the other stuff. And drop that expression. It\u2019s not as dumb as it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because it sounds very dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s very complicated and intelligent.\u201d</p><p>Or not. Maybe it was dumb. Maybe she should eat something before drinking any more wine.</p> <p>She took another sip just the same. \u201cJack, I think you want to be with me because I\u2019m here, because we\u2019ve already done the deed and because you want a distraction from your troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of those things are true. I also like you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, those words scared the living bejesus out of her.</p><p>He liked her. She already loved him. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know that already.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>This was exactly the kind of situation that led to doom and despair, to whining to the Bitter Betrayeds, to crying in one\u2019s pillow, to that unutterably bleak knowledge that you loved someone who didn\u2019t love you back. Jack wanted a distraction. He liked her; that was it.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d she said, clearing her throat.</p><p>He turned off the stove and came around to her side of the soapstone counter, and Emmaline swiveled on her stool to keep him in sight. That was a mistake.</p> <p>He braced his hands on either side of her and leaned forward. Oh, he smelled good. Like laundry detergent and wine and food and smoke.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then he leaned in closer, and rubbed his cheek against hers, and she felt the scrape of five o\u2019clock shadow, the heat from his body. His lips brushed her jaw, and her legs went weak and hot, and a nearly painful throbbing began in her girl parts.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s chocolate cake for dessert.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cIs that your idea of foreplay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, kissing the spot where her jaw met her throat, so, so softly. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back a little and looked into those clear, smiling blue eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>Then his mouth was on hers, soft and smiling, and she\u2019d been an idiot, because for two weeks now, she\u2019d been putting him off when she could have been kissing him instead. His hand went to her head and started tugging at her bun, which of course wouldn\u2019t come out without a crowbar and a map to the seventeen bobby pins, but no, nope, he was doing it, her hair was loosening, and then his fingers were sliding through it, and a few bobby pins pinged on the floor. His mouth was on her throat, causing flashes of heat to spark through her. Without her thinking about it, Em\u2019s hands slid up his ribs and onto his chest, feeling the solid, warm muscles shift and slide.</p><p>Then he pulled her into a standing position, holding her close, which was a good thing because she wasn\u2019t 100 percent sure her legs were working. She tugged his shirt out of his jeans, feeling the warm, velvety skin sliding over muscle.</p><p>She took off her utility belt\u2014oops, should\u2019ve thought of that before, didn\u2019t want to accidentally shoot the guy\u2014and draped it over the chair.</p><p>Then Jack lifted her up (strong, really, she had to give him credit), and lay her down on the kitchen table and proceeded to unbutton her uniform shirt, brushing away her hands when she tried to help. He pulled off her boots, unbuttoned her pants and tugged them off, cleverly unhooked her bra and slid off her panties.</p><p>And then Jack Holland did her right then and there.</p><p>Who needed cake?</p><p>\u201cTHIS CAKE IS FANTASTIC,\u201d Em said a very pleasingly long time later.</p><p>She was curled up on his couch, wearing a pair of rubber ducky pajama bottoms (his, a gift from his niece, he said) and a Cornell sweatshirt, eating Mrs. Johnson\u2019s famous chocolate mocha cake.</p><p>Jack was watching her eat, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth, and she felt quite like a sex goddess. Oh, yes.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, she was a tramp; sue her. Like she was going to be able to resist Jack when he whispered things about how she tasted and smelled and felt, and all those things were very complimentary and she felt beautiful and strong and weak and cherished all at the same time.</p><p>She\u2019d taken a shower in his glorious bathroom and spent a minute looking at herself, bedraggled hair, bee-stung lips, a possible love bite on her shoulder that she rather felt like photographing and posting to her Facebook page. My hickey\u2013with Jack Holland. Her chest was still flushed and her skin looked creamy and, hells yes, she had it going on.</p><p>His bathroom was pretty amazing. There was a massive rectangular tub encased in a huge block of dark wood, the lip wide enough so a person could have a few plants or a glass of wine, a sandwich and a book and not have anything get wet. The shower was equally impressive, separate from the tub behind a glass brick wall. She combed her hair and put on the clothes he\u2019d given her and padded to the kitchen, where, in case Jack wasn\u2019t already everything and a bag of chips, he\u2019d sliced them each a huge piece of cake.</p><p>Dessert first. Finally, a man who understood her.</p><p>Sarge was asleep in front of the fire, and Lazarus sat on the mantel, looking very vulturelike as he gazed at the fat little puppy.</p><p>\u201cWill your cat eat my dog?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll try.\u201d Jack sat next to her and took her feet onto his lap. \u201cWe\u2019re dating now, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, woman. We\u2019re dating. Now finish your cake. I have plans for you. You\u2019ll need your strength.\u201d</p><p>And for once, Em didn\u2019t object.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>TURNED OUT ALL Jack needed was a woman. At least, that was what it seemed like to him.</p><p>Granted, getting her had been as hard as catching an eel, but once he had her, he appreciated her wriggly properties. And he meant that with all the innuendo possible.</p><p>He really liked Emmaline Neal.</p><p>She was funny, she was smart, she was amazing in bed. Her dog was incredibly cute.</p><p>It was nice not being alone. On Saturday, they went cross-country skiing after their hockey game, the cold air and hard, bright sky making it a perfect day for it. Sarge came along, galumphing through the snow, trying to wrestle the poles out of Jack\u2019s hand. Then they came back to Jack\u2019s house, and he went down to the cellar to get a bottle of wine.</p><p>When he came up, it hit him.</p><p>This was what the house was supposed to look like. When he was married, it was too much, all those pillows and signs and clouds of perfume. Alone, it was on the barren side, looking more like a magazine shoot than a place where people lived.</p><p>But now it was kind of perfect. She\u2019d brought a paperback novel, which was on the coffee table, as well as a comic book for him.... He\u2019d confessed to a love of Superman growing up, and she found an old copy in Presque Antiques. Her knapsack sat on a kitchen chair, and her dog lay on his back, trying to woo Lazarus. There was a coffee cup on the table, and her jacket hung by the back door.</p><p>The woman herself was sprawled on his couch, not trying to look picturesque, the way Hadley always did...just relaxing. Or asleep, from the looks of it.</p><p>\u201cSo? I\u2019m tired. You\u2019ve worn me out,\u201d she said, not opening her eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about skiing. I slept like the dead last night.\u201d</p><p>The image of Josh Deiner, cold and lifeless on the dock, slammed into him.</p><p>Emmaline sat up. \u201cShoot. Sorry about that. Poor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with the comic book, straightening it out. \u201cDid you go to the hospital today?\u201d</p><p>He had. He did every day, for some stupid reason. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Em. I\u2019m not allowed to see him. You hungry or not?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, but she stood up and took his hand. \u201cYou need to deal with this, you know,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>He took his hand back. \u201cLook. I saved three kids. Almost four. That\u2019s a good thing. Don\u2019t make me a victim, Emmaline. I thought it was your parents who psychoanalyzed everything, not you. Now do you want dinner or not?\u201d</p><p>His voice was hard.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I cook?\u201d And she got off the couch and went into the kitchen.</p><p>His phone buzzed with a text from Faith. Is Emmaline there? Don\u2019t blow it. Are you wearing something decent? Hint: clean clothes are nice.</p><p>Almost immediately, there was another text, this time from Honor. Don\u2019t come down for Top Ten Tumors. I\u2019ll TiVo it. Hopefully you have better things to do. Like Emmaline.</p><p>And another, this one from Pru. The Coven must be together, deciding that nothing was more fun than tormenting their brother. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he said. He tapped Faith\u2019s name to place a call.</p><p>\u201cAnd who might this be?\u201d she answered, and he could hear the noise of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s in the background.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, girls. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d she said. \u201cJack\u2019s busy, girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need any tips, we\u2019re here for you, brother!\u201d Pru called, and Honor laughed.</p><p>He hung up, smiling begrudgingly.</p><p>Emmaline was leaning against the counter, staring at a pot.</p><p>Jack got up and went over to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped at you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She gave him a quick smile, which made him feel worse.</p><p>He kissed her then, gently, then boosted her onto the counter and kissed her not so gently, and ignored the small voice in the back of his head that told him he might be using her.</p><p>THAT THURSDAY, EMMALINE rounded up her kids. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a field trip,\u201d she said. \u201cTry to contain your excitement.\u201d There were the expected groans and complaints and excuses. \u201cOh, stop,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s a sport. Exercise and healthy living, kids. The keys to a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer Em, we liked you,\u201d Cory said.</p><p>\u201cShush, children, and get into the squad car, and if you\u2019re very good, I\u2019ll put on the siren.</p><p>She drove them to Pettiman Rink, where she played hockey each week.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t skate,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not skating,\u201d Em said. \u201cIt\u2019s curling, and you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s curling?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that thing with the rock and the brooms and the ice for losers who live in the Arctic circle and shit,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cIs he kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s about right,\u201d Emmaline said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy GPA is too low for me to be on a team,\u201d Tamara said proudly. \u201cNice try, though, Officer Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a club, not a team.

Isn\u2019t that sunshiney and sparkly and wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat drugs are you on?\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAnd can I have some?\u201d</p><p>Inside the rink were two other kids\u2014Abby Vanderbeek and Charlie Kellogg. \u201cCan we join, too?\u201d Abby said listlessly. \u201cMy mother said I needed to be on a team sport, but I really think she just wants more grown-up time with my father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Tamara said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course you can join,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cHave you always loved curling, Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just keeping Abby company.\u201d He blushed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you guys cousins?\u201d Cory asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not related.\u201d His face went from blush to lava.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s related in this town.\u201d Abby sighed. \u201cI hear you\u2019re sleeping with my uncle, Emmaline. Will I be calling you Auntie soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Abby,\u201d came a voice. \u201cHey, kids!\u201d</p><p>Speak of the devil. Jack came over to Em and planted a quick kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d Abby said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it enough that my parents are home pretending to be Lord and Lady Crawley? Now my uncle is making googly eyes with the last cool adult in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful, man,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cYou go, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are cute,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cYou gonna get married? Can we be in the wedding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough, enough,\u201d Em said. \u201cHere are the rules, more or less.\u201d</p><p>For the next ninety minutes, Emmaline let the kids go at it. The curling stone, a hefty, polished granite rock, was pushed from one end of the rink to the other, the kids furiously scrubbing the ice in front of it. Em didn\u2019t bother with technique; it was enough that the kids were doing something other than sitting around, complaining about life\u2019s injustices. Dalton kept running down the ice and sliding on his belly like an otter, and Charlie Kellogg and Abby seemed to have a dozen inside jokes, which was kind of nice.</p><p>Em went to the bleachers and sat, taking a couple of pictures of her kids (and sure, one or two of Jack). It was rare to see her kids in motion, and for once, they were all smiling.</p><p>Kelsey even got in on the action a little as the lead, the person who pushed the stone down the ice. She was six months along, which meant the baby would come right before graduation. She hadn\u2019t named a father yet and hadn\u2019t made a firm decision about adoption, either. Em was worried. If Kelsey didn\u2019t graduate...</p><p>\u201cYes, my brother!\u201d Jack shouted, high-fiving Dalton. \u201cWe win!\u201d</p><p>And speaking of worries, Jack was a little manic today. He had been since the other night, when she\u2019d asked him about going to the hospital. That same night, he\u2019d had a doozy of a nightmare, unable to wake up from it. She\u2019d tried to soothe him, whispering that everyone was safe. But there were dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>He saw her looking and flashed her a smile that was too bright.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to fix Kevin, too. Fix his ego, his weight problem, protect him from mean people and his own negativity, and that had backfired miserably.</p> <p>There was no reason to think she could fix Jack. She could be a distraction. She could be fun. She couldn\u2019t save anyone, and she shouldn\u2019t try.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d came a sweet voice, and Em tried not to twitch.</p><p>\u201cHadley. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wonderful, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how are you, Officer Neal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Though it was a balmy forty-five degrees today, Hadley wore a black wool coat with fur around the collar and a matching hat, looking like something out of a Russian fairy tale. Em was in uniform, as usual.</p><p>As if on cue, Hadley looked her up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re looking very...muscular today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more of an observation than a compliment. But I guess up here, you women need to be strong, since y\u2019all are much more likely to stay single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cI am single and can open jars all by myself. That being said, I\u2019ve never been divorced.\u201d Never cheated on my husband, either.</p><p>\u201cYes, I read People magazine,\u201d Hadley replied. \u201cWell. Doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to talk with Jack, actually, but I just love watching him move. Reminds me of just how graceful he is. And predatory, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Em rolled her eyes. Glanced at her watch. \u201cPack it in, kids,\u201d she called. \u201cAnd Jack, there\u2019s someone to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jack came over, his face neutral at the sight of his ex. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Hadley?\u201d he asked, ever polite. Irritating.</p><p>\u201cJack, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d she said, clasping her gloved hands in front of her. \u201cYou looked so handsome out there. Well, you always do, don\u2019t you? Now, guess who\u2019s in town? Frankie! She\u2019s dying to see you, Jack! Please say you\u2019ll come for dinner this time, please. You know how she\u2019s always adored you. Oh, my gosh, you know what she remembered today? The time the three of us went on the ole trolley tour and you and she were standing in front of that bakery, and y\u2019all didn\u2019t even notice when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about cocktails at six o\u2019clock? You know how Daddy instilled that in us.\u201d She beamed.</p><p>\u201cFine. See you later, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hooray! See you later, baby!\u201d Knowing to quit when she was ahead, Hadley practically skipped away.</p><p>\u201cYou two-timing Officer Em?\u201d Dalton asked, sliding over.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s just dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, are you crazy?\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay! Although, props, man. She\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a problem with that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. It was not fine. And yet, she knew he was fond of his former sister-in-law. And it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d made plans that he\u2019d just canceled. Nor did she want to be that kind of girlfriend who told him who he could see and who he couldn\u2019t, because, let\u2019s face it, those women were control freaks.</p><p>Still. Teeny Tiny wanted him to come for dinner, and he was going.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re screwed,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cSucks to be you, pal.\u201d He ran down the ice and slid once again.</p><p>\u201cIs he right?\u201d Jack asked. \u201c\u2018Fine\u2019 does tend to signal doom when it\u2019s said like that.\u201d</p><p>Em glanced over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have to get the kids back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Frankie and I stayed friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019ve screwed the pooch here, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can have dinner with anyone you like. This is America. Life, liberty and dinner with your crazy ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Frankie in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She summoned a smile. \u201cBut you\u2019ll miss me.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her on the mouth. \u201cYou got that right.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline dropped the kids back at the church and then headed for home. Looked as though she\u2019d have to cook tonight, alas. She unlocked her front door and went inside.</p><p>There were four suitcases in the living room, and sitting on the couch with Sarge on her lap was her sister.</p><p>\u201cAngela!\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her voice, Sarge leaped off Angela, grabbed Squeaky Chicken and began twirling in his love circles, whining around his toy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Emmaline, it\u2019s so good to see you! I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t call first!\u201d Angela unfolded herself like an elegant flower and hugged Em tight, causing further joy from Sarge, who leaped against their legs, trying to get in on the action.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you,\u201d Em said. \u201cWhat a surprise!\u201d</p><p>Angela made a rueful face. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was impulsive, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, yes, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just...well, I\u2019m a bit at odds. Can I stay with you for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Em said. \u201cIt\u2019s your house, too. Nana left it to both of us. But what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m filling in for a colleague at Cornell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was rather sudden, but frankly, the timing was perfect. You see, I just ended a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? I didn\u2019t know you were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to tell you at the wedding, but it didn\u2019t seem the right time. It\u2019s been ending for a while, actually, but now it\u2019s official. And Mama and Papa...They\u2019ve been circling. You know how it is when they sense you\u2019re troubled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike vultures?\u201d</p><p>Ange smiled. \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here as long as you like,\u201d Emmaline said, meaning it. \u201cWe\u2019ll finally live together.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cAnd how lovely that will be. Also, Emmaline, I\u2019ll need your help telling Mama and Papa some news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news is that?\u201d Was she pregnant? They\u2019d be thrilled. Hell, Em was thrilled at the very thought.</p><p>Her sister took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m g*y.\u201d</p><p>Em\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cI, uh...wow. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d She paused. \u201cWill they be crushed that it\u2019s you and not me?\u201d she asked, and much to her relief, Angela burst out laughing and hugged her. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll have biological babies someday,\u201d Em added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your gene pool to go to waste.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>ONE OF THE things Jack remembered most about Hadley was she couldn\u2019t cook to save her life. From two flights below, he could smell smoke.</p><p>\u201cIt don\u2019t smell so good in here,\u201d Frankie said when she opened the door, using her good-ole-boy accent. \u201cI may be staying with you tonight, Jack, \u2019cuz it may be that something crawled in that there oven and took its life. Or it could be Big Sister\u2019s version of pot roast. Best if we don\u2019t try to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Frankie,\u201d Jack said, giving her a hug. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, big fella! We\u2019re going to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, if you don\u2019t mind. Hadley was trying to impress you by cooking, but I remember the burgers at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s with a deep and abiding fondness, so I\u2019m not at all sorry with this turn of events.\u201d She thudded down the hallway to get her coat.</p><p>Jack took a couple of steps into the apartment. There was a nearly empty bottle of Blue Heron Chardonnay on the counter. The wedding photo beamed out at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, I\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d Hadley said, coming out of the kitchen and untying her apron. \u201cI wanted us to have a nice family dinner, and I just do not know what happened.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. One thing Hadley hated most of all was to look foolish in front of her sisters, those high-achieving, high-IQ women, and he felt a pang of sympathy for her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was really nice of you to try,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave him a faint smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGuess you know I was always something of a pretender to the throne when it came to cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Come on, ladies\u2014off we go. Frankie, is that a new tattoo I see on your wrist?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure is, Jack.\u201d She pulled up her sleeve. \u201c\u2018Conscientiously and with dignity.\u2019 Part of the vet\u2019s oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t keep getting tattoos,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cIt\u2019s so un\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnladylike? Oh, my Lord, don\u2019t you say that. You sound like Blanche Freakin\u2019 DuBois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for someone who supposedly loves animals so much, you sure didn\u2019t show me much sympathy about Princess Anastasia, did you?\u201d Hadley snapped.</p> <p>\u201cI sent a card. I called. Was I supposed to declare a national day of mourning? The cat was older than Methuselah, Hadley. And don\u2019t forget how she bit me on my ninth birthday. Still have the scar.\u201d</p><p>The sisters bickered and picked at each other with surprising fervor on the short walk across the green, making Jack slightly more grateful for his own sisters (not that they were perfect, God knew, especially with the number of texts and bits of romantic advice they\u2019d been offering lately). But if ever there were two women with less in common, it was Frankie and Hadley.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was mobbed. Right. It was Mardi Gras. Colleen wore a low-cut maternity dress, her belly more noticeable these days. That wasn\u2019t the only thing\u2014the girls were on fine display, as usual, enhanced by pregnancy. Jack always thought pregnant women were beautiful, and Colleen had a lot going for her to begin with. Lucas was behind the bar, helping out. Colleen waved, then did a double take. \u201cOh, hey! Frankie, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a great memory,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cIs that a love bump I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt most certainly is.\u201d Colleen put her hand on her stomach and beamed. \u201cThis Spanish pirate is my husband, Lucas Campbell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a contractor,\u201d Lucas said, shaking Frankie\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you. Hey, Jack. Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked pirate better,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cI\u2019m Jack\u2019s ex-sister-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Jack considers you an ex-anything,\u201d Hadley chirped.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Coll scanned the restaurant, then smiled knowingly. \u201cYou want to join Emmaline and her sister? They just sat down, and I bet they won\u2019t mind. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be about forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll wait for a table,\u201d Hadley said.</p><p>\u201cSure, we\u2019ll join them,\u201d Jack said a bit too aggressively. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p> <p>EMMALINE AND ANGELA had been having a really nice time\u2014well, Angela was the type who\u2019d have a really nice time with anyone from Kim Jong-un to the Real Housewives of New Jersey, since there wasn\u2019t a mean bone in her body. But it was rare that the sisters ever got to do anything just the two of them...maybe twice, Em thought.</p><p>And, she admitted, it was awfully nice to have Angela confiding in her.</p><p>Angela had been in a relationship with a woman named Beatrice, but things hadn\u2019t been right for a while. When the chance came to teach astrophysics at Cornell for the rest of the semester, she jumped at it.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t face Mama and Papa,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be shocked. They\u2019re not the most observant people in the world, for all that they\u2019re such involved parents,\u201d Angela said with a guilty smile.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Em murmured. \u201cI think I\u2019ve broken their hearts by being straight.\u201d</p><p>Angela laughed, then looked up. \u201cWhy, hello, Jack! How wonderful to see you again!\u201d</p><p>Jack stood there with Colleen, Hadley and another woman, shorter and also quite pretty, with spiky hair and lots of piercings.</p><p>\u201cYou guys mind sharing a table?\u201d Colleen asked, giving Em a wink. Good old Colleen. Em smiled back.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d Angela said. \u201cPlease join us. Hello, I\u2019m Angela Neal, Emmaline\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankie Boudreau. My sister Hadley here was married to Jack for a brief time.\u201d</p><p>Angela didn\u2019t bat an eyelash. \u201cHello, Hadley. What a pretty name! I\u2019m Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Hadley said. She looked as if she smelled decaying animal.</p><p>\u201cHow do y\u2019all know Jack?\u201d Frankie asked.</p><p>\u201cEm and I are dating,\u201d he said, claiming the chair next to Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Angela exclaimed. \u201cOh, hooray! I knew it was real. I could feel it.\u201d She sat back and beamed.</p><p>\u201cWell, tonight just got more interesting, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Frankie smiled and sat down across from Angela.</p><p>\u201cSo you need a bodyguard?\u201d Em whispered as Jack sat next to her.</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her wine (apricot and grass with a hint of limestone...or maybe it was just grapey, but she was trying).</p><p>Hadley sat down across from Jack, slid her little pink cardigan off her shoulders to reveal a pink sleeveless dress. \u201cThis is so nice, being here again,\u201d she said, fluttering her lashes. \u201cI always loved this little place. Jack and I had so many fun times here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d Angela said. \u201cFrankie, forgive me\u2014I\u2019m not from around here. Do you live in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but before I say another thing, I just gotta tell you how much I love your accent,\u201d Frankie said.</p><p>Angela laughed. \u201cAnd I love yours, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEastern Africa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, yes! What an ear you have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a few weeks in Kenya on an animal preserve,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cI\u2019m finishing up my veterinarian degree at Cornell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful! I start teaching there next week. Relativity and astrophysics for Dr. Bering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat smelly old dog? I took his Searching the Solar System class just for fun, or so I thought. Well, I tell you, his students are in for a real treat when you walk through the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I make her stop flirting?\u201d Jack asked Em.</p><p>Em looked at her sister, who certainly didn\u2019t seem to be suffering. \u201cNah. Ange can handle herself.\u201d</p><p>Hadley had a pinched look on her face. \u201cLooks like our sisters are getting on like a house on fire,\u201d Emmaline said to her. \u201cSweet, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Hadley said, opening the menu.</p><p>Jack had his arm around the back of Em\u2019s chair. He gave the back of her arm a small caress, and her side broke out in goose bumps. When his eyes met hers, a hint of a smile warmed his eyes from January blue to Caribbean sky.</p><p>God. Listen to her. So much for warning herself not to get carried away.</p><p>But he shouldn\u2019t be looking at her like that in front of his ex-wife, no matter how much of a pain in the ass the woman was.</p><p>And Em knew what it was like to watch your ex with another woman.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with you, Hadley?\u201d she surprised herself by asking.</p><p>Before Hadley could answer, Hannah O\u2019Rourke swung by with a bottle of red and another of white. \u201cFor the hero of the Midwinter Miracle and his friends,\u201d she stated grandly. \u201cSent by Barb Nelson, who wouldn\u2019t mind interviewing you for the paper. She guessed the answer would be no but wants you to have the wine anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes went flat. \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d he said. But he turned around, spotted Barb and waved. When he turned back, Em could feel him locking up. His arm was no longer around her chair.</p><p>As the evening unfolded, Frankie and Angela did most of the talking, each of them gifted at the art of conversation. Hadley said very little, though she laughed loudly whenever anything remotely funny was said. There was a \u201cLook at me\u2014I\u2019m so much fun!\u201d desperation to her, and while it was irritating, Em couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for her. In this little circle of five, she was the odd man out.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any decorating jobs lately, Hadley?\u201d she asked as their dinners were brought out.</p><p>\u201cNo. As a matter of fact, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Hadley said tightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you an interior decorator?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cHow interesting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to my family,\u201d Hadley snapped. \u201cFrankie\u2019ll be a vet before long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess where this hand was today, by the by,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cIn a cow\u2019s vajayjay. Mother and calf are both doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as I was saying before my sister interrupted me, my sister Ruthie is a doctor, and Rachel\u2019s a state representative, and, as my daddy puts it, I like pretty things. No one understands or appreciates what I do.\u201d</p><p>Frankie rolled her eyes, and Jack sighed. Em concurred. Hadley was hard to take.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful field,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWhat would life be like if we didn\u2019t all have our little refuges to come back to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline and I went curling today with her high school kids,\u201d Jack began, and a storm flashed across Hadley\u2019s face at the change of subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s curling?\u201d Frankie asked.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d came a rather slurred male voice. \u201cI just had to tell you how beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d said Hadley, looking up with a bright smile. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet of you to say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Hadley\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock. And please, Em thought. Hadley was beautiful, yes, but Angela was breathtaking and otherworldly and dazzling. Em smiled at her sister, who lifted a flawless eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s talking to you, Emmaline,\u201d she said.</p><p>Em looked up. \u201cYou are?\u201d Goofy-looking guy, that dorky, sculpted hair flip in the front. He was maybe twenty-five years old.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re really...wow.\u201d He swayed a little.</p><p>\u201cYou driving tonight?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019ll take me home,\u201d he said, bracing his hands on the end of their table.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned I\u2019m a cop?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how hot that is?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me, pal,\u201d Jack said. Hadley\u2019s lips disappeared.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love that,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cI mean, I may like girls, Jack, but that was delicious, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay, dude,\u201d the guy said. \u201cI getcha. But you, lady, are hot.\u201d He glanced at Frankie. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not so bad, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo driving, bub,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cYes, Officer. Though I wouldn\u2019t object if you handcuffed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019ve never heard that one before,\u201d Em said.</p><p>Jack started to rise, but the guy grinned\u2014he was pretty cute\u2014and wove away.</p><p>Angela clapped in delight. \u201cOh, Emmaline, does that happen to you all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d she said with a grin. Only Angela could ask that with a straight face. \u201cExcuse me, I just want to make sure he\u2019s really not driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cThe poor man was so drunk he could barely see straight.\u201d She drained her wine and held her glass out for more.</p><p>Em paused. A talent was a talent, and Hadley had certainly mastered the art of the razor-sharp put-down.</p><p>She went over to the guy\u2019s table in the corner, where he was sitting with some friends about the same age. \u201cDo we have a designated driver here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be me,\u201d one of the guys said, holding up his glass. \u201cSeltzer water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just wanted to check and make sure the Boy Wonder here wasn\u2019t driving. I\u2019m a cop,\u201d she added, just in case.</p><p>\u201cYou followed me! I knew it!\u201d Drunk Boy said. \u201cYou wanna step in the bathroom, have a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Emmaline said. Drunk people. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cShut up, idiot,\u201d one of his friends said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Em turned to leave, but suddenly she heard the scrape of a chair and there was a hand on her shoulder. She turned around fast. \u201cKnock it off,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>But the kid grabbed her and kissed her square on the mouth.</p><p>Now, nine months ago, Emmaline would\u2019ve just kneed him in the nuts and left him whimpering on the floor. But now she was a cop, and rather than be accused of police brutality, she opted instead to push her index finger into his Adam\u2019s apple.</p><p>And it worked, of course; no one could kiss when his airway was being toyed with. Then all of a sudden, he was yanked back, and Jack had him against the wall with his arm on his throat, and the kid was wheezing and terrified.</p> <p>The kid\u2019s friends surged, then stopped, not sure what to do. \u201cStay,\u201d she commanded. \u201cJack, knock it off.\u201d She put her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>The bar grew quiet, only the music from the jukebox playing.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jack bit out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m even a little bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem here?\u201d asked Connor O\u2019Rourke, wiping his hands on a dish towel. Lucas stood behind him, as well as half the fire department, ready to rumble.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Em said. \u201cJust a kid who can\u2019t hold his beer. Jack. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>He did (took him long enough), and his face was stony when he looked at her. A tiny muscle under his left eye twitched.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, mister,\u201d the drunk kid said.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are done here,\u201d Connor said to the youths. \u201cSettle up and off you go.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s jaw was still clenched, his eyes burning holes in the drunk kid, and, really, it was kind of hot. No one had ever been jealous over her before. Then again, it was also pretty over the top. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to our table,\u201d she suggested, taking his arm and steering him away. He let her, though he grumbled most attractively. Em smiled.</p><p>Then there was a thunk, and Jack staggered forward. Em turned, and there was a rush of people and then Connor and Lucas and half the kid\u2019s friends had the idiot pinned against the wall.</p> <p>Because Drunk Boy had just hit Jack over the head with a beer bottle, and Jack\u2019s blond hair was steeped with red.</p><p>\u201cSO LET ME GET this straight,\u201d Levi said at the E.R. about an hour later. \u201cMy brother-in-law and deputy were brawling in a bar?\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed. His head was throbbing, Hadley was yowling like Lazarus during a trip to the vet and he really didn\u2019t need all this...attention.</p><p>\u201cLevi, drop the disapproving parent act,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cThe kid coldcocked Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack barely heard. Several floors above, Josh Deiner lay hooked up to his machines.</p><p>\u201cJack, why did the kid coldcock you?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he kissed me, and Jack was defending my pure and untainted honor,\u201d Emmaline said. Ungratefully. Women. You never could win with them.</p><p>Levi raised an eyebrow, then looked over at Hadley, who was still choking with sobs. Frankie sat next to her, reading a magazine. \u201cAnd why is she here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Why indeed? Because Jack\u2019s ex-wife fed off attention like a vampire. Whatever happened to anyone happened to Hadley more. Just the fact that the shit-faced kid had hit on Emmaline had been guaranteed to make her crazy, so Jack wasn\u2019t surprised when she went the Route Hysterical moments later.</p><p>As soon as the drunken idiot coldcocked him, Hadley had started screaming like a banshee (speaking of a lack of sobriety), begging him to speak to her, even though he was standing with a dishcloth of ice against his head, handed to him by Colleen seconds after he was hit. But that wasn\u2019t enough for Hadley, and she\u2019d actually crawled over to him as Frankie tried to pick her up off the floor.</p><p>Then Everett Field arrived, in uniform, puffing up with self-importance as he led the handcuffed kid away to the applause of the O\u2019Rourke patrons. Pru and Carl had been at the bar, too, hidden in one of the back booths dressed in Star Trek uniforms, and Pru burst out laughing at the sight of her brother\u2019s blood, which was fairly typical.</p><p>Then Levi had come in, as well as Faith, and, against Jack\u2019s wishes, the ambulance was called, much to the delight of his fellow members on the Manningsport volunteer EMS squad.</p><p>He really just wanted to be home. With Emmaline.</p><p>As if picking up that thought, Hadley paused in her crying, glanced over and burst into renewed sobs.</p><p>\u201cI have to interview her,\u201d Levi said, his forehead wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cSucks to be you,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer will this take?\u201d Jack grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re busy tonight,\u201d Levi said. \u201cWant me to call anyone? Your dad? Mrs. Johnson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your wife already has. If Pru didn\u2019t beat her to it.\u201d Privacy wasn\u2019t an ideal the Holland family held dear.</p><p>\u201cHello! I\u2019m looking for John Noble Holland the Fourth? Gorgeous name, right? Come on in!\u201d Jack stood up and walked toward a tiny Asian woman who looked to be about fourteen years old. \u201cHi! Nice to meet you. I\u2019m Dr. Chu. Sorry for the wait! It\u2019s totes crazy here tonight.\u201d</p><p>Hadley got up and tried to follow them in, but Jack simply said, \u201cNo,\u201d which caused still-louder crying.</p><p>\u201cWill you pipe down?\u201d Frankie said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna medicate you if you don\u2019t. Stop being such an attention whore, Hadley. He\u2019s fine. And he\u2019s not your concern anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was dead! Oh, Jack, if you\u2019d been\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, the doors swung shut behind him, cutting off his ex-wife\u2019s wails.</p><p>The doctor, who couldn\u2019t have been more than five feet tall, showed him into the exam room. \u201cHave a seat, Mr. Holland. We\u2019ll get you taken care of lickety-split. Positive attitude, check!\u201d</p><p>There was a knock, and Emmaline peeked in. \u201cWant company?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you his wife?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Girlfriend.\u201d She blushed.</p><p>\u201cWell, from the look of that gross and bloody towel, Mr. Holland,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cI think you\u2019ll need some stitches. I love stitches. They\u2019re my favorite! Has anyone ever told you you\u2019re really handsome, Mr. Holland?\u201d</p><p>Christ.</p><p>\u201cHey, is Jeremy Lyon on tonight?\u201d Em asked. That\u2019s right. Jeremy took shifts here a few times a month.</p><p>Dr. Enthusiasm paused. \u201cUm...yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a family friend. Mind if he sees Jack instead?\u201d</p><p>The girl sighed. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, deflating. \u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d She slouched away.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Emmaline sat down on the edge of his bed, glanced at him, then back at her hands. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for...you know. Looking out for me.\u201d She stuffed her hands in her pockets. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s irritation melted a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I probably earned a kiss, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and hooked a finger in the front of her sweater and pulled her to him, then kissed her. Em\u2019s hands went to his chest. Her mouth was so soft, a balm against this whole stupid night. \u201cI really hated seeing that guy kiss you,\u201d Jack murmured against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and this time, his tongue brushed hers, and she melted against him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack\u2014 Oh, my God, you two are together? Why am I always the last to know the good stuff?\u201d Jeremy stood in the cubicle. \u201cThis is so nice! I only wish I could take credit for fixing you up. Hi, Emmaline, how are you?\u201d He hugged her, then shook Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cSo you got hit on the head, huh? Not very smart of you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe turned his back on a drunken idiot,\u201d Em offered. Jeremy tsked and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cActually, you turned my back on a drunken idiot,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cTrue. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose consciousness?\u201d Jeremy asked, washing his hands.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou military types. So stoic.\u201d He looked at Jack\u2019s head, then opened a cabinet and took out a suture kit. \u201cGonna need a few stitches, bro. This will sting.\u201d</p><p>WHEN JEREMY WAS DONE, Em said she\u2019d check on Hadley and see if Levi needed anything else. \u201cOther than the head wound, how are things?\u201d Jeremy asked when she was gone.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sequelae from the rescue?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked up sharply. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInner ear pain, balance issues.\u201d Jeremy paused, his eyes steady. \u201cPTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is confidential, of course, since I\u2019m here as your doctor. PTSD would be things like nightmares, panic attacks, flashbacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is, but I\u2019m fine, Jeremy. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Glad to hear it.\u201d He signed a paper. \u201cIce, Tylenol if you need it, come to the office in a week for stitch removal.\u201d Jeremy smiled. \u201cGood to see you, even under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Jer.\u201d He gave Jeremy a manly hug. The guy was practically part of the family. As decent as they came, too.</p><p>Emmaline wasn\u2019t back yet, and Jack found himself going to the elevator. Got in, pushed the button. The elevator rose, and six seconds later, the doors opened to a sign.</p><p>\u201cFourth Floor, Intensive Care Unit. Please speak quietly.\u201d</p><p>The hall was quiet except for the beeping of machines and, farther down, the murmur from the nurses\u2019 station. The squeak of rubber-soled shoes. The hiss of a ventilator.</p><p>Room 401 had a whiteboard hanging on the door. McGowan, H. was written in green marker. Jack could see a bed and someone sleeping (or dead). Across the hall, 402, Zaccharias, M., 403, Blake, S., 404, Humbert, L.</p><p>Room 405, Deiner, J.</p><p>The door was open a few inches.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>His heart was smashing in his chest, hurling itself against his ribs like that bobcat.</p><p>If he opened the door just a little more, he\u2019d be able to see something. Josh\u2019s feet, maybe.</p><p>The image of Josh Deiner, sitting up in bed, texting on his phone or watching TV or eating Jell-O, came to him so fast and hard that Jack\u2019s knees nearly buckled.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Jack jumped. He hadn\u2019t even heard the nurse behind him. \u201cJane MacGregor, APRN,\u201d her name tag said. Jack was aware suddenly that he was drenched in sweat.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Jack whispered.</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cAre you a family member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I can\u2019t discuss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you? Get out! Get out!\u201d</p><p>Josh Deiner\u2019s mother stood in the doorway, her voice like breaking glass. \u201cHow dare you come here? Get away from my son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Deiner, I just wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from us!\u201d she screamed, and shoes were squeaking on the floors and visitors\u2019 heads popped out of rooms. \u201cHe\u2019s here because of you! How dare you intrude like this!\u201d</p><p>The nurse took Jack\u2019s arm and led him down the hall, and Jack thought he might fall; he wasn\u2019t sure his legs were working right. Maybe it was the hit on the head, but he was wrong, something was wrong, and Josh, please, please don\u2019t die.</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and there was Emmaline.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a disturbance here,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cSecurity\u2019s on their way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh Deiner\u2019s room?\u201d Em asked. \u201cJack here is the one who pulled him out of the lake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d The woman looked at Jack, her face kind. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d Em said. \u201cYou won\u2019t need Security. I\u2019m Manningsport P.D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did was amazing, by the way,\u201d the nurse said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the Deiners.\u201d Then she walked back down the hall.</p><p>Jack could hear Mrs. Deiner sobbing, the loneliest, most heart-wrenching sound on earth...a mother mourning her only child.</p> <p>Josh wasn\u2019t getting any better. Jack didn\u2019t need a doctor to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home, big guy,\u201d Emmaline said. She pushed the button for the elevator, and the doors opened.</p><p>When they closed behind them and the elevator started to move, Jack put his arms around her, held her close and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>When they reached the lobby, he let her go and saw that her eyes were wet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Angela I\u2019m staying at your place,\u201d she said, and that was all.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>EMMALINE WAS SLURPING down her third cup of coffee a few days later. It was her day off, and she and Angela had been up late the night before with the Bitter Betrayeds, who\u2019d graciously accepted Angela as an honorary member, despite declaring her \u201ctoo beautiful and too nice.\u201d</p><p>The group was full of news\u2014Jeanette O\u2019Rourke was going on a cruise with Ronnie Petrosinsky, the Chicken King. Allison was indeed going back to the irritatingly perfect Charles, who\u2019d proven his love by sending her a gift-wrapped box of cookie jar fragments. Shelayne announced that she\u2019d just been approved as an adoptive parent, and there were hugs and more Peach Sunrises and a bottle of champagne.</p><p>And lastly, Em was grilled on how Jack was in bed. Her silence had brought on some fierce (and very colorful) speculation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blushing,\u201d Grace had pointed out, coming in from the kitchen with a fresh pitcher of Peach Sunrises. \u201cYou know what that means. Jack is a dirty, dirty boy.\u201d Coming from their senior citizen member, this had caused shrieks of laughter from the women.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you changed the name of your group,\u201d Angela had suggested. \u201cNone of you seems particularly bitter or betrayed.\u201d</p> <p>That had given the rest of them pause.</p><p>\u201cCall yourself the Sunrise Girls,\u201d Ange had suggested. \u201cThese cocktails are simply wonderful, Grace.\u201d</p><p>It was surely their best meeting yet. No one had mentioned the book they\u2019d neglected to read, but that was never really the point.</p><p>Angela, of course, leaped out of bed that morning, completely unaffected by last night. Emmaline wasn\u2019t so lucky. Sarge was upstairs, having decided he loved Angela more, the faithless wretch, and was barking in excitement at whatever Angela was doing. Loudly, Em thought, wincing.</p><p>Ten minutes later, both of them craving chocolate, they walked to Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery. The smell of pastry sent out its siren call. \u201cOh!\u201d Angela said. \u201cLook at this. A bridal salon! Let\u2019s go in, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you should try on dresses,\u201d she said. \u201cFor when you and Jack get married. I always hated that sad little dress you bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sad,\u201d Emmaline said.</p> <p>\u201cPlease. It looked like you were going to a dance at the Elks Lodge circa 1983,\u201d Angela said. \u201cNo, this time, you must take me with you. I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what an Elks Lodge dance looks like? Besides, I\u2019m not getting married anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. He\u2019s crazy about you. He\u2019ll be popping the question in a matter of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline opened the door of the bakery and bumped squarely into the man himself.</p><p>\u201cJack! We were just talking about you,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He gave Emmaline a look as if trying to place her.</p><p>\u201cJack, what do you think?\u201d Angela said, her eyes twinkling. \u201cIvory or white? Which do you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnore her,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>Jack glanced across the street where a poufy dress shimmered in the window of Happily Ever After. He didn\u2019t smile. \u201cWould you like to have dinner with my family tonight?\u201d</p><p>Angela gave a muffled squeal, and Em shot her a filthy look. \u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be welcome, too, Angela,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! No, thank you for including me, Jack. You\u2019re terribly sweet, but no, I have to be at Cornell this evening.\u201d She gave Emmaline a sly smile. \u201cIn fact, look at the time! I should go. Always lovely to see you, Jack.\u201d She strode away, waving at someone inside the antiques store.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t shopping for a wedding dress,\u201d she said, immediately regretting it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come for dinner?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She squinted at him. \u201cYou sure you want me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ask you if I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix o\u2019clock at Honor and Tom\u2019s. I can pick you up if you want.\u201d He looked at his watch.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Jack, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. I have to run. See you tonight.\u201d</p><p>SOMEHOW, EMMALINE HAD forgotten just how many Hollands there were.</p><p>The driveway was filled with cars, and Blue, Faith\u2019s giant golden retriever, raced up to her door. Sarge yipped wildly, his tail whacking Em in the head.</p><p>Honor had called her earlier to invite her to dinner personally and told her to bring her dog, since who didn\u2019t love puppies? She said her own little dog could use some socializing.</p><p>The Hollands\u2019 big white house was a landmark in Manningsport. Em had never been inside before, and it was a little imposing. Made her glad she\u2019d dressed in a skirt.</p><p>She clipped on Sarge\u2019s leash, got out and let her dog wriggle in ecstasy as Blue sniffed him over. Then she grabbed the flowers she\u2019d brought\u2014gerbera daisies\u2014and with a deep breath, went up to the front door and knocked.</p><p>No one answered, though the door practically shook from noise inside. She knocked again. Nothing. Opened the door and peeked in.</p><p>The place was mobbed.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline! Welcome,\u201d said Honor, bustling over. \u201cOh, these are gorgeous! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for having me. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to leave Sarge in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all love dogs\u2014don\u2019t worry.\u201d She bent over to pet Sarge, who sat and wagged his tail. \u201cHello, handsome! Are you here to teach Spike some manners?\u201d She unclipped the leash and smiled.</p><p>A tiny Yorkie came skittering over and growled at Sarge, causing the much larger puppy to collapse in delight and roll over in the acknowledgment that, yes, the Yorkie was boss and could do whatever it wanted.</p><p>\u201cBest friends forever,\u201d Honor said with a smile. \u201cCome on in. It\u2019s chaos, but that\u2019s who we are. I\u2019ll hang up the leash and put these in some water.\u201d She took the flowers and walked off, leaving Em alone.</p><p>The periwinkle-blue living room was big and gracious, filled with tasteful furniture, built-in bookshelves and a gorgeous white marble fireplace. Jack and his father were in deep conversation there, each holding a glass of wine in their left hands. Easy to see where Jack got his looks. The older Mr. Holland, Jack\u2019s grandfather, stood listening while eating a chunk of cheese the size of a smartphone. The grandmother speculated why on earth Honor had painted the living room this shade of blue when she herself preferred pale blue, then segued into how Abby should beware of white vans, because that\u2019s what kidnappers drove.</p><p>Em edged toward Jack, overhearing Mrs. Johnson lecturing Tom Barlow on his curry-making technique. Pru and Carl Vanderbeek were arguing over something, Pru doing some magnificent eye rolling. Their son, Ned, was talking with Charlie Kellogg, and Levi stood in the corner, watching as Abby pressed her hands against Faith\u2019s belly.</p><p>The noise level made Emmaline\u2019s eyes throb.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She jumped a little. \u201cHey, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t kiss her. \u201cGuys, you all know Emmaline, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Prudence said. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Did Jack invite you? Wow. He hasn\u2019t done that since he brought the Southern belle home. Is there news? You guys engaged or knocked up or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d said his grandmother, \u201cyou should try marriage again. Your grandfather won\u2019t be around forever, you know. Don\u2019t you want him to have more great-grandchildren? This one has nice breeding hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoggy!\u201d Faith yelped.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You do, too. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone, guys,\u201d Honor said. \u201cSorry, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Em said, feeling slightly sweaty. \u201cBreeding h*ps are...good. Thank you, Mrs. Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallo, Em,\u201d Tom said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d</p><p>A lot, Em thought. \u201cOh, wine is great,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>The three dogs raced through the living room, then up the stairs, then down the stairs. Em seemed to be the only one who thought this was perhaps a bit rowdy. Then again, her family dinners consisted of carefully modulated voices swapping bitter insults disguised in psychobabble, compliments from Angela and grunts from herself. Topics of discussion included self-actualization, repressed memories and why Emmaline was wasting her life, with a side of martinis.</p><p>Rowdy dogs weren\u2019t so bad at all by comparison.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten after six, Honor, sweetheart,\u201d said old Mr. Holland. \u201cCan we eat? What are we, Europeans or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re dating my loser uncle,\u201d Abby said, bouncing over to Em\u2019s side. \u201cAlso, would you mind taking me to the firing range? I want to learn how to kill a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kiss him,\u201d Ned advised. \u201cHe\u2019d die of horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ned! Levi, did you know that Ned drove to Geneva on Sunday to see your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends!\u201d Ned said. \u201cStop glaring at me, Levi. If you hurt me, Faith will be heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI only love you about half the time as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d the grandfather complained. \u201cCan we get this show on the road?\u201d</p><p>Levi and Em were the last to go into the dining room, as Jack was pressed into service in the kitchen. \u201cIs it always like this?\u201d Em whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Levi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get interrogated over dinner, by the way. Same thing happened to me the first time I came for dinner, and to Tom last spring. Don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re good people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sweating like a farm animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the feeling. Hang in there, Deputy. Think of it as a hostage situation, except you\u2019re the hostage this time.\u201d He gave her a half smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chief,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God. I\u2019m having that engraved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it back.\u201d</p><p>They crowded around the table, and Honor, Tom, Mrs. Johnson and Jack emerged from the kitchen laden with platters and dishes. The noise level increased as the food was passed and described and argued over, and before Emmaline managed to sit down, old Mr. Holland and Charlie were taking seconds.</p><p>\u201cSo, Emmaline, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Johnson. \u201cTell us about your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh...well, it\u2019s just my parents and sister and me. Angela. She was adopted when I was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were an only child until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky,\u201d said Ned and Abby in unison. Charlie snickered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd are you close with your parents?\u201d Mrs. Holland asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cDo I know them?\u201d Mrs. Holland asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you might remember my grandmother. Luanne Macomb, my mother\u2019s mother? She lived on Water Street, where I live now. I used to spend summers with her, and then I came to live with her when I was in high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you leave your parents?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked, a fierce frown on her face.</p><p>\u201cMom, will you send me to live somewhere for the rest of high school so I don\u2019t have to see Ned all the time?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Mom,\u201d Ned added.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you go there to play sometimes, Faithie?\u201d Jack\u2019s father asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Em\u2019s grandmother would have a few of us down in the summer. She made the best brownies.\u201d Faith smiled in fond remembrance.</p> <p>\u201cSo where did you grow up?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked.</p><p>\u201cSouthern California,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, how horrible,\u201d Mrs. Holland murmured. \u201cWell, I guess you can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite beautiful out there, Goggy,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cDo you see your parents a lot?\u201d Mrs. Holland asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave the girl alone!\u201d old Mr. Holland said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t taken one bite of food.\u201d</p> <p>True. It\u2019d be nice if Jack jumped in here and called off the dogs, but he didn\u2019t seem to be listening.</p><p>\u201cI visit a few times a year, Mrs. Holland,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cCall me Goggy.\u201d</p><p>Do I have to? Em thought. \u201cGoggy it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! Since we\u2019re going to be family,\u201d the old woman added slyly.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Goggy,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cCharlie, tell everyone about your match the other day,\u201d Tom said, winking at Emmaline from across the table. \u201cEmmaline, our boy here is becoming quite the boxer.\u201d</p><p>A THOUSAND OR so hours later, Emmaline thanked Honor and Tom once again and led Sarge out into the rain, which felt blissfully cold on her hot face. Jack followed.</p> <p>The subject of marriage had been broached nine times tonight. Hints about babies, eleven. Goggy (that name!) had expressed her hope that Emmaline and Jack wouldn\u2019t \u201clive in sin\u201d; Pops had countered with the opposite opinion. Abby unsubtly requested more cousins. Pru showed Em a website for sex toys called KinkyKitties, making Abby, Ned and Charlie go into fits of horror and hysterics.</p><p>It felt like someone had taken sandpaper to her brain.</p><p>Jack had barely said a word. And while she didn\u2019t want to be a weenie, it would\u2019ve been nice if her...her...her boyfriend, curse the stupid word, had come to her aid once or twice tonight. She had to wonder why he\u2019d even invited her in the first place.</p><p>She put Sarge in the car; the dog was limp with exhaustion at the moment, though that would change the second she started the engine. The rain was harder now, soaking her hair.</p><p>\u201cSo that was fun,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>She looked at him. He was serious. \u201cFun? That was fun? That wasn\u2019t fun, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right, you weren\u2019t exactly present, were you? Well, I\u2019m glad you had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you? Everyone really likes you.\u201d His phone buzzed, and he looked at it.</p><p>\u201cEveryone? Even you? Because you didn\u2019t speak to me the entire time.\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he had no clue what she was talking about. \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s recap,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you said \u2018Hi\u2019 and...and that was it. Meanwhile, your grandmother was asking about how long my mother was in labor with me, Mrs. Johnson asked how many kids I thought I\u2019d like to have, then actually wrote down the answer, and your niece wants me to teach her to shoot to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds about right. How many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many what?\u2019</p><p>\u201cHow many kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her eighteen. Possibly twenty.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile crossed his face. \u201cWant to come back to my place?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She blinked. Men. \u201cJack, why are we dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her, the two of them standing there in the rain. His mouth was gentle and soft, his body warm against the cool night. Em was torn between the desire to smack him and...and...and to just keep kissing him, because his hands were cradling her head and her arms were around his waist and he knew what he was doing. Yes, indeed, his mouth moving, lips soft and smooth in contrast to the scrape of his razor stubble. \u201cWe\u2019re together,\u201d he murmured against her mouth. \u201cGet used to it.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and sucked in a breath of damp, cold air. \u201cYou\u2019re very unpredictable, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all the best ways. Come up to my place and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He grinned, and it was like the sun coming out, causing a flare of warmth in her chest. That smile made her legs hot and wobbly. Made her think of blue-eyed babies, eighteen of them. Okay, fine, maybe not eighteen, but a few, anyway.</p><p>Being that he was Jack Holland, he got into his truck and started it, completely confident that she\u2019d follow.</p><p>And being that she was rapidly becoming one of those swoony, lovesick females, she did.</p><p>Men were confusing.</p><p>But you know what? She had a sister, and while Angela might be g*y, she was also the smartest person on the continent. She pulled out her cell and hit her sister\u2019s number. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d Angela asked by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cUm...I have no idea. He\u2019s happy now. Barely spoke during dinner. I\u2019ve been told I have breeder\u2019s hips. We\u2019re going back to his place.\u201d</p><p>Ange laughed merrily. \u201cTime to rock his world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I may be so forward, Emmaline,\u201d Angela began.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would be.\u201d She started up the long winding lane that led to Jack\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to be a little less...careful? A little more heartfelt? Because I sense that you have very deep feelings for Jack, and perhaps it\u2019s time he knew. He brought you home to his family...maybe he needs a sign from you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I can\u2019t really help. But you\u2019ll know. You will. I\u2019m heading back now. Would you like me to walk Sarge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s with me. But thanks, Angela. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, darling.\u201d</p><p>Em drove up Jack\u2019s long driveway and sat there for a second. Lights went on inside the house, and a warm sensation washed over her. The house was beautiful. The man who owned it was beautiful, and he was waiting for her. And Angela was right. Time to rock his world.</p><p>\u201cCome on, puppy,\u201d she said to her dog, wiping off his paws with the towel she kept in the car for just such a purpose. She carried him inside the mudroom and set him down, then took off her coat and hung it on a hook. Lazarus came to investigate, croaked at Sarge, earning a tail wag and a wary head lick, which the cat endured before skittering off.</p><p>Jack was lighting a fire as she entered the living room.</p><p>We\u2019re together now. Get used to it.</p><p>So this wasn\u2019t just for sex or a distraction or a human shield for Hadley. Maybe this was real.</p><p>The warmth in her chest seemed to expand.</p><p>His phone buzzed on the table next to her.</p><p>\u201cProbably one of my sisters,\u201d he said, adding a log. He stood up and came over, looked at the phone. \u201cYep. I should sell a few off. You want a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She\u2019d barely had any at dinner.</p><p>\u201cI have a nice bottle in the cellar. Be right back.\u201d He kissed the top of her head and went downstairs. He hadn\u2019t said boo at his family\u2019s, but he was making up for it now. She could live with that. She wasn\u2019t perfect, either.</p><p>Sarge went over to the fireplace, turned in a circle five times, then curled up. Lazarus approached, warily, then lay down near the puppy\u2019s head.</p><p>Aw. They liked each other.</p><p>Jack\u2019s phone buzzed again. And again. In fact, it was vibrating right to the edge of the table. Without thinking, Em picked it up before it fell.</p><p>And then, before she could even make a case against it, she looked at the screen.</p><p>Pru: We like her, Useless. Are you guys na**d already? Don\u2019t let her see those ugly-ass pajamas Honor bought you for Christmas. In fact, burn those.</p><p>Faith: You should\u2019ve talked more tonight, dummy. She looked like a deer in the headlights. Tell her she doesn\u2019t have breeder h*ps even if that will come in handy later. Takes one to know one.</p><p>Goggy: Wermww ri&amp;ght cmlwlr?.</p><p>Honor: She took that like a champ. Tom &amp; I both approve. Charlie too.</p><p>Hadley: Jack, I need 2 speak 2 U asap. We belong 2gther. Pls. call asap. I no u still love me. We can work this out!!!</p><p>Goggy: qhy ro$(ia we flt rgis</p><p>Okay. Jack\u2019s grandmother appeared to be drunk. But, no, Abby had complained about getting seventeen texts from her that day alone.</p><p>Hadley\u2019s text\u2014not so nice. The woman really needed to get a clue or some counseling, stat.</p><p>But Em was glad Jack\u2019s sisters liked her, which she already knew, more or less. And Jack liked her, and she liked him, way too much...or maybe the right amount. Maybe it was time to go for it. And if she wanted to prove something tonight, a constantly buzzing phone wasn\u2019t going to help.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d just mute it for a little while. It was after ten. She slid the switch over. There.</p><p>She and Jack had been together for a few weeks now. And, yes, she\u2019d been wary, given her own romantic past and Jack\u2019s ex-wife being around, not to mention the emotional maelstrom surrounding the accident.</p><p>But tonight, she wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>He came back upstairs, and Emmaline stood up.</p><p>\u201cSo was tonight really awful?\u201d he asked, setting the bottle on the counter.</p><p>Rather than answer, she went over to him, wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him for all she was worth. Hot, wet, demanding, 100 percent slutty kissing.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t waste time. He grabbed her breeder h*ps and boosted her up on the counter, and Em pulled him close, feeling him hard and solid and hot against her. She slid her hands under his shirt, over his lean stomach, his lightly furred chest, and tugged his shirt off over his head, then let her hands wander down his back, kissing him again, pulling his h*ps harder against her.</p><p>Jeans, unfastened.</p><p>Then she scootched off the counter, pulled off her sweater, unhooked her skirt and let it fall to the floor. Jack\u2019s eyes lowered and a very gratifying noise came from his throat right before he unhooked her bra, and then she was kissing his neck, his hot, beautiful neck, and bit down on his collarbone. And then the smooth, cool tile of the kitchen floor was against her back, and Jack was on top of her, hard and heavy and hot, while his mouth burned heat on all the best spots until she wriggled free and returned the favor.</p><p>So yeah.</p><p>Wary no more.</p><p>Not when you were doing it on the kitchen floor.</p><p>The animals, bless their furry little hearts, stayed sound asleep, despite the noise.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>JACK HOLLAND WAS a happy man. For now, anyway.</p><p>After the kitchen floor encounter\u2014which, by the way, yes\u2014he\u2019d led Emmaline into the master bathroom, turned on the bath taps and made out with her while the tub filled. Left her to get in while he uncorked the wine and brought them each a glass. Then he got in with her, pulling her back against his chest, so, so glad he\u2019d gone for the big tub when he built the house.</p><p>The only sound was the water sloshing if either of them moved and the rain beating against the windows. The puppy came in and tried to drink out of the tub, making them both laugh, and if there was a better sound than Emmaline laughing, Jack didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>Her skin was creamy and soft, and her body was solid and strong and perfect. After a little while, she couldn\u2019t help notice that he was noticing, and she turned around to face him and they did it right there in the tub. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Come to think of it, Jack did know what sound was better than Emmaline laughing.

She was asleep within seconds, but Jack just lay there, feeling something he hadn\u2019t felt in a while now.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>His marriage had been tumultuous, Jack never knowing which version of Hadley he\u2019d be coming home to at the end of the day. The brief periods of happiness had been built on what he thought he knew, like judging a wine on its color and clarity, only to find it had turned to vinegar. After he\u2019d walked in on Hadley and Oliver came that edgy, angry sense of failure\u2014and loneliness.</p> <p>And then, since the boys had gone into the water, his mind had been like a river after a savage flood, all sorts of sharp, dangerous things sliding under the current, sharp and unseen, sometimes rushing past, sometimes slamming into him without warning.</p><p>But now there was something else blanketing that, and for the first time in a very long while, Jack felt at peace.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have guessed the potty-mouthed hockey-playing cop would\u2019ve been the right one for him.</p><p>He\u2019d have been wrong.</p><p>Lazarus jumped up on the bed, and, after a second, Jack heard the cat\u2019s rusty purr. From Emmaline\u2019s side, no less. Even his feral cat liked her.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t aware that he\u2019d fallen asleep until he heard a noise. A thudding.</p><p>Thunder?</p><p>No.</p><p>Someone was at the door.</p><p>The clock read 2:37 a.m.</p><p>He slid out of bed, pulled on his pants and went to the front door. It was Pru.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling for forty-five minutes, Useless!\u201d she barked. \u201cPops had a heart attack. Hurry up, Jack! It\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline shot through his arms and legs. He grabbed a sweatshirt from a hook and pulled it on, ran to get his wallet and keys. And phone.</p><p>Sixteen missed calls. A screen full of texts. Why the hell hadn\u2019t he heard?</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Em stood there, wearing his bathrobe, hair tangled.</p><p>\u201cOur grandfather\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Pru said. \u201cHeart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Can I do anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy phone was off,\u201d Jack said tightly.</p><p>Her hand flew over her mouth. \u201cJack, I\u2019m so sorry. I muted it before...\u201d</p><p>Jesus H. Christ. That was something that Hadley would do. Not Emmaline. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to discuss it.</p><p>His grandfather was dying, and he hadn\u2019t even known.</p><p>EVERYONE WAS AT the hospital, sitting grimly in the waiting room of the E.R. Goggy was flanked by Honor and Faith; Abby was sobbing quietly in Ned\u2019s arms; Carl, Levi, Charlie and Tom stood off to one side. Mrs. J. had her arm around Dad.</p><p>Jack went right to Goggy and knelt in front of her chair. \u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she said, and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything right now,\u201d Honor murmured. \u201cJeremy\u2019s still with him.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Pops had awakened with chest pain radiating into his left arm. He\u2019d been unable to talk, and Goggy didn\u2019t waste time, just pressed the emergency button that all apartments at Rushing Creek had and shoved a baby aspirin in her husband\u2019s mouth. The facility had its own ambulance service, and they\u2019d gotten him to the hospital in fewer than fifteen minutes. Goggy also called Jeremy, who was Pops\u2019s regular doctor, and Jer was with the cardiologist now.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you did everything right,\u201d Jack told his grandmother. \u201cJust like always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only just started liking each other last year.\u201d She wept against his neck, and Jack hugged her closer.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Jack murmured, his throat tight. \u201cYou know what he told me the other day? He said you were the love of his life.\u201d</p><p>Goggy tried to smile. \u201cOf course I am. Who else would put up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Jeremy said from the hallway. \u201cHe\u2019s stable for now. Elizabeth, he wants to see you in a minute. John, could you come with me?\u201d</p><p>Dad looked at him, and Jack went with him, putting his arm around his father\u2019s shoulders as they walked down the hall.</p><p>Usually, his sisters would make disgruntled comments about sexism in the family and call Jack the little prince. The fact that they didn\u2019t was horrible.</p><p>No one lives forever, of course. That wasn\u2019t exactly news, but it was still shocking when that universal truth hit home.</p><p>Pops was easy to dismiss as a joking, bickering old man, but that was just the surface. John Noble Holland, Jr., had a deep love of his family and land, the work ethic of a Spartan and a sentimental streak that he did his best to keep hidden. But he got choked up every time he saw Jack in his navy whites. He put flowers on all the graves in the Holland family cemetery on the anniversaries of their deaths and each April before the blessing of the crops. His eyes filled when Faith and Levi told everyone about the baby. Last year, when Goggy had almost died in a house fire, the fear of losing his wife had practically felled him.</p><p>Jeremy stopped outside a room and signaled them to go in.</p><p>Pops was gray, an oxygen mask over his face. If not for the beeping of the heart monitor, Jack would\u2019ve assumed he was dead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, Dad,\u201d his father said, taking the old man\u2019s hand. His eyes were full of tears.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pops,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Pops\u2019s eyes fluttered open. He gestured weakly to his face, and Jeremy leaned over and took the mask off. \u201cProud of you,\u201d he whispered, looking at Dad, then Jack. \u201cSo proud of my boys.\u201d</p><p>Then his eyes closed again, and the beeping of the monitor slowed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>TO SAY THAT Emmaline was writhing in guilt would not have been an exaggeration.</p><p>Shit. How could she have decided to mute Jack\u2019s phone? Without even asking him? For the tenth time that morning, she scrubbed a hand over her face.</p><p>She was still at his house, though she had to go to work in half an hour. But she\u2019d stayed, hoping to see him first. The coffeemaker was set up, and she\u2019d even baked somewhere around 4:00 a.m.\u2014an almond coffee cake, her grandmother\u2019s recipe, and one of the few things Em could bake from memory. She\u2019d imagined Jack coming home and telling her his grandpa was okay, what a night, had she baked, all was certainly forgiven, no worries on the phone thing.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t come home, and he didn\u2019t call or text, either, and she didn\u2019t dare interrupt. She wasn\u2019t family, after all.</p><p>The rain had turned to snow at some point, the fat, heavy, discouraging snow of late winter, not enough to be a real storm, more than enough to be depressing.</p><p>Sarge erupted into excitable barks, and Emmaline jolted from the table where she was sitting. Sarge\u2019s tail wagged and he whined and pawed at the floor-to-ceiling window.</p><p>It was Hadley, walking up Jack\u2019s driveway, wearing a shiny black raincoat.</p><p>Super.</p><p>Emmaline opened the door just as the other woman knocked. \u201cSurprise!\u201d Hadley said, opening the raincoat.</p><p>She was wearing a fire-engine-red bustier and tiny scrap of panties.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d Em said. \u201cNice underwear.\u201d That was a perfect body, all right. Em guessed her thigh and Hadley\u2019s waist had about the same circumference.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack? I need to talk to him. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Hadley was drunk.</p><p>Her eye makeup was smeared, and while she didn\u2019t quite look like Heath Ledger as the Joker, it was close. Her red, red lipstick had been crookedly applied, and the usually smooth and perfect blond hair was matted in the back. Despite the cold, she wasn\u2019t wearing stockings. Or sensible shoes...those had to be four-inch heels, and her feet were nearly blue.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cJack\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was already at Blue Heron, and no one\u2019s there, so don\u2019t you lie to me! I wanna see him! He\u2019s my husband, after all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore he\u2019s not,\u201d Em said. She wasn\u2019t about to tell Hadley about poor Mr. Holland. She\u2019d end up going to the hospital, and Em didn\u2019t think Jack would want that one bit.</p><p>But you know what? This was good practice for crisis negotiations. Half the calls they got were because someone was under the influence. First rule of negotiations: establish rapport. \u201cCome on in, Hadley. Those shoes are amazing, but your feet must be freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hafta do what you say,\u201d Hadley slurred.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. But are you sure? It\u2019s nice and warm in here. There\u2019s coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a bite of my pink...Southern...ass.\u201d She poked a finger against Em\u2019s chest with each of the last three words.</p><p>Em smothered a smile. Hard to commit to active listening and empathy with a statement like that. \u201cYou must be pretty frustrated,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell. Where\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>Ruh-roh. Emmaline paused.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hadley shrieked, guessing the answer. \u201cHow dare you steal my husband, you Yankee slut!\u201d</p><p>Clearly, stating the obvious wasn\u2019t going to help here. Em opened the door wider. \u201cHadley, come on inside and we can talk. You, uh, you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re not the boss of me! And if I can\u2019t have Jack, then I may as well go off and die!\u201d She burst into noisy sobs.</p><p>For the love of the baby Jesus. \u201cHadley. Let\u2019s have some coffee, and you can, um, see Lazarus. Right? You must miss him. You\u2019re a cat person, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that animal! I hate him! Jack! Jack! I need you! If you don\u2019t come out right now, I swear I\u2019m gonna make you sorry!\u201d</p><p>With that, she picked up a rock and threw it at the house, and it was like she was channeling Derek Jeter firing to first base, because there was a smash as a window broke.</p><p>Clearly, that hadn\u2019t been planned, because Hadley\u2019s mouth dropped open. She cut her wide eyes to Emmaline. \u201cOopsy,\u201d she said, then bolted, wobbling crazily in her ridiculous shoes. Instead of down the driveway toward the road, she ran into the woods.</p><p>This was just great. With a curse, Em ran after her. This was not how she wanted to spend her morning, and God forbid Jack come up the driveway to see his girlfriend (who\u2019d turned off his phone to make sure their shagging wouldn\u2019t be interrupted, preventing him from being with his family during a crisis) chasing his ex-wife (who was drunk off her pink Southern ass and nearly naked).</p><p>For a drunk, Hadley was fast. \u201cHadley!\u201d Em yelled. \u201cKnock it off! You\u2019re going to hurt yourself!\u201d</p><p>Or freeze to death. It was raw today. Hadley\u2019s coat flapped like awkward wings. And what was that about making Jack sorry, huh? Aside from breaking his window, that was?</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t need this. Not with Mr. Holland in the hospital, very, very sick...or even dead. \u201cHadley. Please stop.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and gave Emmaline the finger.</p><p>Nice. A branch slapped Em across the forehead and tangled in her hair, and she growled with irritation.</p><p>She caught up to Hadley as the smaller woman tried to climb over a rock wall. Hadley saw her coming, bent over and picked up a handful of something, then turned and shoved it in Em\u2019s face.</p><p>Dirt and snow. Gross.</p><p>Em grabbed her hand, twisted it behind her back and yanked her back against her. \u201cKnock it off,\u201d she said, spitting out some frozen moss. \u201cOr I\u2019m arresting you for drunk and disorderly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Jack!\u201d Hadley shrieked, struggling.</p><p>So. Getting a drunken, surprisingly strong woman out of the woods wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cCan you just walk, please?\u201d she said as Hadley writhed. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to have to carry you.\u201d She got kicked in the shin as an answer. Branches snapped underfoot, and a squirrel followed them from the tree branches, laughing at the idiocy. Some of the snow Hadley had shoved at her had slid down Em\u2019s shirt (of course), and there was a cold, wet lump sitting on her chest like a third breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Five minutes later, Emmaline had Hadley handcuffed and locked in the back of the cruiser, where Hadley was sobbing. At least she couldn\u2019t hurt herself (or the car) if she was cuffed, and she\u2019d done more than enough to earn it. There were a few leaves in Hadley\u2019s tangled hair and raccoon eyes from where her mascara had melted.</p><p>Em leaned against the cruiser, breathing hard. She wasn\u2019t much better off than her passenger. Her forehead stung, and her shin throbbed.</p><p>Okay, first things first. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she told her passenger.</p><p>Emmaline went inside to the bedroom with the broken window and picked up the glass, then closed the door so too much heat (and the cat) wouldn\u2019t get out. Debated on calling Levi, and then decided he didn\u2019t need to hear about this just yet. He had other things on his mind.</p> <p>She went back outside, opened the door of the cruiser for Sarge and got behind the wheel. \u201cIs your sister still in town?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019ve got no one and nowhere to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always depended on the kindness of strangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes!\u201d</p><p>Okay, Blanche DuBois. Em stifled an eye roll.</p> <p>She\u2019d take Hadley to the station, because she didn\u2019t have time to babysit her at her apartment. She was the officer on call today. Hadley could just sit tight in the holding cell and sober up.</p><p>Em rubbed a spot on her jaw where Hadley\u2019s head had slammed into her.</p><p>It was going to be a long day.</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were at the station.</p><p>\u201cYou must be freezing! Isn\u2019t she freezing?\u201d Carol Robinson asked when Emmaline brought Hadley in. Though Emmaline had tied Hadley\u2019s coat closed, it barely cleared her ass. Also, Hadley had refused to put on her shoes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Jack Holland\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife,\u201d Emmaline said tightly. \u201cEverett, unlock the cell for me.\u201d</p> <p>Hadley arched her back as they walked down the hall, still trying to get away. \u201cDon\u2019t! Not in there! Please! Not that! I can\u2019t stand that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a pit in the ground, Hadley,\u201d she said as Everett opened the holding cell door. \u201cYou\u2019ll just stay here for a little while. There\u2019s a blanket on the bed. Get warmed up, okay?\u201d She uncuffed her, gave her a gentle push in and closed the cell door. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! Please don\u2019t lock me up!\u201d Hadley pressed a fist to her mouth and sobbed like she\u2019d just seen The Notebook for the first time. Ev was staring at Hadley\u2019s outfit (or lack thereof), his mouth hanging open. Em smacked him on the head. \u201cEv. Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right, sorry,\u201d Everett said. \u201cWhat happened to you? You look awful. You\u2019re all dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline, you\u2019re filthy,\u201d Carol pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Em went to her locker, where she kept a clean uniform as well as a pair of yoga pants and a MPD sweatshirt. She pulled the latter two out and handed them to Carol. \u201cBring these to Meryl Streep, okay? And ask her if she\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Meryl Streep here?\u201d Everett asked.</p><p>Emmaline closed her eyes. \u201cNo, Ev. I meant Hadley. The woman in the cell.\u201d</p> <p>Carol went back down the hall, and a second later, Hadley bellowed, \u201cThese are way! Too! Big!\u201d followed by more sobbing. When Carol returned, she was trying hard not to giggle. \u201cShe wants to know if she gets a phone call,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe can have one when she sobers up a little.\u201d Em tried to be professional; Hadley was in custody and a guest of the town now, not just Jack\u2019s ex-wife.</p><p>But it was hard to know if she was treating Hadley like she\u2019d treat anyone else, because maybe she was being too nice. Hadley had driven under the influence; somewhere during her rant on the way to the station, she\u2019d admitted that, and her car was parked half on Blue Heron\u2019s lawn, half on the driveway. She\u2019d thrown a rock through a window, which constituted criminal mischief. Drunk and disorderly. Menacing a police officer, more or less.</p><p>What would Levi do?</p><p>Em thought he\u2019d do pretty much what she\u2019d already done. Give her time to cool down, then deliver a stern lecture, name-drop some of the charges that could be leveled against her and tell her to grow up.</p><p>Yeah. All in all, Em was pretty sure she\u2019d done a good job.</p><p>She washed up and changed into her uniform, brushed her hair and put it in its customary bun. Took a few deep breaths and left the locker room.</p><p>\u201cLevi called,\u201d Carol said. \u201cJohn Holland, the old one, had a heart attack, and he\u2019s being admitted, so he\u2019ll be at the hospital with Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Holland doing?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really say. Maybe you should ask Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Carol handed her a few messages, then sat back down at her desk.</p><p>Typical stuff for a weekday. Mrs. McPhales thought she saw a trespasser. Someone saw a stray dog or possibly a coyote in their backyard. A speeder past Phyllis Nebbins\u2019s house. The Knoxes\u2019 free-range chickens were causing traffic danger. Dalton hadn\u2019t shown up for school.</p><p>Em checked her phone.</p><p>Nothing from Jack.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go out on these calls. Everett, keep an eye on Hadley, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d he said, going back to his computer. She heard the Angry Birds music, gave him a look and left.</p><p>WHEN EMMALINE GOT back to the station a couple of hours later, Everett met her at the door. \u201cWe might have a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI just checked on Hadley, and she\u2019s not too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She ran down the hall to the holding cell.</p><p>Hadley was sitting on the floor, practically drowning in Em\u2019s clothes. She was rocking and whimpering, and the smell of vomit was unmistakable. \u201cHadley?\u201d Em said, going into the cell. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease let me out,\u201d she whispered, seeming completely different from before.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. You feeling all right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I make a phone call?\u201d She was shaking.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Emmaline led her out of the cell and into the station proper. \u201cWe\u2019re not charging you with anything. Not yet, anyway. I just wanted you to be safe. You were pretty...wild before. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Em sat her at the desk and handed her the receiver. \u201cJust dial nine to get an outside line,\u201d she said. Then she took a few steps away so as not to eavesdrop.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cShe threw up. I don\u2019t know what else. She\u2019s a lot quieter now. Everett, were you watching her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah! Yeah, I was. I mean, when she settled down, I was kinda glad, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you check on her last?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the clock and winced. \u201cAn hour ago, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Great. So Hadley could\u2019ve been sitting in puke for an hour.</p><p>There was a hard pit in her stomach. This wasn\u2019t going to end well.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d Emmaline asked Hadley when she hung up. \u201cSome water, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Hadley shook her head and just folded her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDo you need the bathroom? Want to get cleaned up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Her voice was a whisper.</p><p>The minutes ticked by. Em tried to take care of some paperwork, but dread was settling over her like a cold, damp fog.</p><p>Then the door opened. \u201cJack,\u201d Hadley whispered. She stood up and wobbled into his arms, looking more like an orphan than the irate prostitute she resembled earlier. Her feet were bare. Damn. Em should\u2019ve given her socks. Hadley was shaking like a leaf, all of her, right down to her toes.</p><p>For once, Emmaline didn\u2019t think she was faking.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline, what the hell happened here?\u201d Jack asked, his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cShe was drinking, Jack. She showed up at your house, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you arrested her?\u201d</p><p>As if they sensed a scene brewing, the four paid members of the Manningsport Fire Department, as well as Shannon and Kelly Murphy, who were training to become EMTs, wandered over. \u201cHey, Jack, how\u2019s your grandfather?\u201d Gerard asked.</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d Jack said. \u201cEmmaline? You gonna explain this?\u201d</p><p>Em glanced at the Murphy girls, who grimaced in sympathy. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually charge her. I just put her in the holding cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s claustrophobic, Emmaline!\u201d</p><p>Shit on rye. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell? Take a look at her.\u201d</p><p>Em ran a hand over her head. \u201cNo one likes going in the drunk tank, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was screaming and crying,\u201d Carol said, most unhelpfully. Sounded a lot like police brutality, the way Carol put it.</p><p>\u201cWell, she was screaming from the time she got to your house,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cSo you arrested her,\u201d Jack said, his mouth tight. \u201cShe said you chased her and handcuffed and locked her in a cell. Really, Em? Because she was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It was because she was... I thought she was a danger to herself. And possibly others. She was very aggressive. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably outweigh her by forty pounds, Em. You couldn\u2019t handle that?\u201d</p><p>The stutter opened its skeleton eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was acting in my capacity as a police officer,\u201d Emmaline said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you were acting like a jealous bully,\u201d he said, his voice calm and flat, and the words actually made her head jerk back.</p><p>Oh, God. Was he right? Her stomach curled in on itself. Hadley looked so small and ruined and...vulnerable. Her face was white. A person couldn\u2019t fake that.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Everett began.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Jack said tightly. \u201cMy grandfather is at death\u2019s door, and I have to get back to the hospital. But now I have to take care of her, because look at her! She\u2019s a wreck. Thanks, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-J-Jack, I d-d-didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Her voice stopped cold.</p><p>The stutter, her old enemy, laughed and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Then he opened the door, looked at Hadley\u2019s feet and scooped her into his arms so she wouldn\u2019t have to walk barefoot to the truck.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>THE GOOD NEWS was, Pops was still alive.</p><p>The bad news was everything else.</p><p>The past few days had passed in a tense blur of bad coffee and worse sleep. Jack went to the hospital, always careful to check the corridor for Mr. and Mrs. Deiner, not wanting to cause them any further upset than he had already. When he\u2019d finally returned home late that first night, he\u2019d found a broken window in the yellow room upstairs.</p><p>He\u2019d taped a sheet of plastic over it, the silence of his house pressing down on him, grateful for Lazarus\u2019s weird little croaks. Then he lay down on the couch and fell asleep, his phone on the coffee table set on the highest volume, and woke around five o\u2019clock, his cat sleeping on his chest.</p><p>There was a coffee cake on the counter, and the coffeepot was set up and ready to go.</p><p>That would\u2019ve been Emmaline\u2019s work.</p><p>He felt a pang of guilt, but goddamn it, he was tired of feeling guilty. The woman had turned off his phone. He didn\u2019t have a landline. She knew that. What if Pops hadn\u2019t made it? What if she\u2019d taken away his chance to say goodbye to his funny, crusty old grandfather?</p><p>Em had no right to decide when he could get calls. None.</p><p>Yeah, okay, taken by itself, it wasn\u2019t that big a deal. She hadn\u2019t known Pops was going to have a heart attack.</p><p>But what about arresting Hadley? Had all that really been necessary? Jack was well aware that his ex-wife was a drama queen, but she\u2019d been genuinely traumatized, and when Jack saw her there in the oversize clothes, tears streaming out of her eyes, he... Ah, screw it. Jack didn\u2019t know what. But he couldn\u2019t just leave her there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d driven her from the police station to her place at the Opera House, called Frankie and asked her to come. While Hadley was in the shower, he made her a grilled cheese sandwich and then waited till Frankie arrived. Hadley was pale and didn\u2019t seem to want to talk. She seemed, in fact, embarrassed. And something more, too. Whatever it was, Jack just wanted to get back to his grandfather, and the second Frankie arrived, he got back in his truck and returned to the hospital.</p><p>Since then, he\u2019d been swamped with family responsibilities. Dad was quite a softy, as everyone knew, and Jack spent as much time as he could with him, the two younger John Hollands keeping vigil over the eldest. Jack also made sure to check on the business end of Blue Heron, Honor\u2019s domain, to make sure his sister wasn\u2019t too swamped, but the ever-capable Jessica Dunn seemed to be holding down the fort just fine. He called Faith twice a day, because she was due momentarily, and he wanted to make sure she wasn\u2019t overdoing it, because she\u2019d been staying with Goggy. He dropped by Pru\u2019s house to see how Abby was; she\u2019d never lost anyone close to her.</p><p>Then he drove back to Blue Heron to filter the wine and check the sediment, because it was almost time to bottle and those things couldn\u2019t wait. He made his calls, stopped by Hadley\u2019s (she\u2019d been doing a lot of sleeping, according to Frankie), then went back to the hospital, then home.</p><p>Three days after the heart attack, Pops went back to the apartment at Rushing Creek. He was now on Lipitor and Coumadin with instructions to stop eating cheese, ice cream, whole milk and \u201canything good,\u201d in his words. He was weaker, but Jeremy called him \u201cridiculously healthy\u201d despite his horrifying cholesterol level. Jack checked in with him and Goggy every night, because, despite his grandmother\u2019s protestations, he was worried about her, too. Neither grandparent was young, and Pops\u2019s scare had reminded everyone of that.</p> <p>And now, four days after Pops\u2019s heart attack, Jack found himself driving from the hospital to Emmaline\u2019s little house on Water Street. Dusk was falling, and the lake was cobalt, a fat moon rising over the ridge.</p><p>He had the feeling he owed her an apology.</p><p>Being wrong wasn\u2019t a feeling Jack was used to. His sisters liked to call him the prince, the son and heir, and there was some truth to that. He knew his father had wanted a son\u2014Mom, too\u2014and he wasn\u2019t named John Noble Holland IV for nothing. All his life, he\u2019d tried to do the right thing. He\u2019d been an A student, an Eagle Scout, as good a brother as he could manage, having the occasional tea party with Faith, teaching Honor to drive, babysitting for Pru and Carl when Ned was a baby. His mom had thought he was pretty damn perfect, and Dad didn\u2019t think it\u2014he believed it with his whole heart.</p><p>In truth, Jack could think of two times he\u2019d made a significant mistake. One, the time he\u2019d jumped off the falls up near the ruins of the old stone barn and broken his arm. Two, marrying Hadley.</p><p>Calling Emmaline a bully...yeah, okay. That was number three.</p> <p>\u201cCAN I SEE you a minute?\u201d Emmaline asked, standing in the doorway of Levi\u2019s office. It was nearly quitting time.</p><p>\u201cSure. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>She did, closing the door behind her. Levi had heard about the incident with Hadley...and Jack\u2019s reaction. Of course he had. Carol had told him the second he walked through the door, and Gerard had come over five minutes later with the same gossip.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, then found that her throat was tight. Not with the stutter. With tears. The stutter had slunk back to its hole, though last night, when Angela had practically goose-stepped her to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, Em\u2019s heart had been thundering, positive someone was going to say \u201cH-h-hi, Eh-Eh-Emmaline,\u201d same as they had back in the day.</p><p>No one did. But people knew, anyway. Colleen even sent drinks on the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Deputy?\u201d Levi asked.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Holland?\u201d she asked, even though she already knew. Word was out that the old guy was back at Rushing Creek, complaining that he already missed the pretty cardiologist who\u2019d taken care of him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Levi said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery ripe.\u201d His mouth tugged up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make a great dad, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He kept looking at her\u2014it was a trick of his, that patient stare\u2014and she broke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I should quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis job.\u201d</p><p>More staring, then, \u201cUnacceptable, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI screwed up, Chief. With Hadley. I didn\u2019t handle the situation well, and things just escalated. I didn\u2019t check on her.\u201d She looked at her hands. Probably time to take off that old nail polish she\u2019d put on for stupid Kevin\u2019s wedding. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not a good cop,\u201d she said, her voice husky. \u201cShe was in crisis mode, and I didn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed and sat back in his chair. \u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to screw up from time to time on this job. It\u2019s impossible not to. You investigate a call where you know the guy is beating his wife, but you can\u2019t convince her to leave him. You cruise through a neighborhood, and you still miss the burglary.\u201d He tapped a pencil against his desk, not looking at her. \u201cYou give a kid a lecture and ticket him whenever you can, and he still crashes into the lake.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. Josh Deiner had had few brushes with the law.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make you a bad cop,\u201d Levi continued. \u201cHadley was drunk, you didn\u2019t know she\u2019d freak out the way she did and you had police business to take care of. If anyone screwed up here, it\u2019s Everett. He knows the drill. He was supposed to check on her every fifteen minutes, and if I know him, he was playing on his phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel like I...overreacted.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cLike maybe Jack was right. Maybe I did what I did because she\u2019s Jack\u2019s ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline,\u201d Levi said in that overly patient voice he used when he was irritated. \u201cJack wasn\u2019t right. You\u2019re not a bully. You couldn\u2019t be. If anything, you were too easy on her. So shut up about quitting, because if you leave me alone with Everett, I will hunt you down.\u201d He smiled, and Em felt herself smiling back.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, Chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now I have to get to the store because Faith is out of ice cream. You\u2019re a good cop, Emmaline. You\u2019re a very good cop. Are we done here?\u201d</p><p>She sat there another minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just...I love you, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I love you. You\u2019re the best boss ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hate yourself in the morning.\u201d He gave her a smile. \u201cYou still mad at Jack?\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cWho said I was mad at Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate an entire box of donuts yesterday. You\u2019ve traded in walking for stomping. You\u2019re mad at Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Jack was\u2014 Wait a second. Am I really so pathetic that you want to talk about my personal life?\u201d</p><p>Levi lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cGod. I\u2019m leaving. See you tomorrow, Chief.\u201d</p><p>Em waved to Everett, kissed Carol on her cute little head and got into her cruiser, feeling considerably better, at least on the work front. She drove home, went inside and was greeted by Sarge and Squeaky Chicken, who seemed to have lost an eye and half its beak. \u201cAngela?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cNamaste,\u201d Ange called. \u201cDoing yoga up here. Be down in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Em took off her belt and hung it up, then pulled out her bun and went into the kitchen. Poured herself a glass of wine\u2014Lyons Den, thank you very much; she was boycotting Blue Heron at the moment.</p><p>The phone rang, and without looking to see who it was, she answered, then immediately wished she hadn\u2019t when she heard the voice on the other end.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking for Angela?\u201d Sarge put Squeaky Chicken, soggy with drool, on her lap as a consolation prize.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s, uh...that\u2019s nice.\u201d She pulled a face at her dog, who raised his eyebrows, as surprised as she was. \u201cHow are you?\u201d She took a sip of wine. A big sip.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re moving to your area.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline choked, sputtering wine on the phone, Squeaky Chicken and Sarge\u2019s head. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith both you and Angela there, we may as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by \u2018your area,\u2019 what exactly are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cManningsport.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, I\u2019m ready. Hurl down that thunderbolt. Love, Emmaline.</p><p>Mom was talking about proximity and the maternal bond. The habit of affection as influenced by visual recognition of loved ones. Her extremely close relationship with Angela. The usual.</p><p>Not once during high school did Mom and Dad mention moving here, to be closer not just to Emmaline, but to Nana, too.</p><p>Not once in the past three years that she\u2019d made her life here had they ever talked about moving here. They\u2019d barely visited. But they\u2019d moved from Malibu to Palo Alto, sure. To be closer to Angela, and that hadn\u2019t bothered Em, not really.</p><p>But the fact that they were coming here, on her turf, to be closer to Angela... A sudden flare of anger burned in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYeah, do what you want,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to go. Someone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Without saying goodbye, she hung up, then nearly fell out of the kitchen chair as someone knocked, as if she\u2019d summoned them. Sarge galloped out of the kitchen, then hurled himself against the front door, and Em followed. \u201cDown, killer,\u201d she said as he whined and wagged. \u201cAt least pretend to be fierce, okay? You\u2019re going to be a police dog someday, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door, and her stomach burned again.</p><p>Jack.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked. A little hard to play it frosty when her dog had wrapped both front paws around Jack\u2019s work boot and was chewing on the laces.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmaline. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He came into the foyer and glanced around. \u201cIs Angela here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs doing yoga. Sarge, stop.\u201d Sarge did stop, froze right in place, then raced into the other room and returned with Squeaky Chicken, whipping his head from side to side. Not the most dignified backdrop in the world, but hey.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your grandfather?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. Doing well.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I know, because Levi told me, and Faith told me, but you didn\u2019t say squat, Jack. \u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She tried pulling Levi\u2019s trick of staring and waiting.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, running a hand through his hair, \u201cI may have overreacted a little the other day. I was under a lot of stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>Jack sighed, that \u201cwomen are so difficult\u201d sigh. Hell yeah, they were.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShould there be more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Have a good night.\u201d She opened the door again.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline, wait. Can I come in and actually sit down? Have a conversation with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because you called me a bully when I was only trying to help you and that idiot you married. Because you made me feel stupid and mean and unimportant. Because having you chew me out in front of my coworkers made me feel like I was in middle school again. Because you brought my stutter back. That\u2019s why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cI hate when women lead with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck it up. Here\u2019s the thing. Jack.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cI told you this would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me what would happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis! This messy, upsetting thing between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t spoken to me in four days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy the past four days! By the way, why would you turn off my phone without telling me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you remember the reason, Jack? No? The kitchen floor mean anything to you? The bathtub? Nothing\u2019s coming back?\u201d Sarge whipped her with Squeaky\u2019s leg. \u201cLook. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. It was an impulse, and I am sorry about it, and I did apologize.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I forgive you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGosh, how great. But the thing is, Jack,\u201d she said, her voice getting tighter, because of course he was a man and would try to hang this on details when the big picture was staring him right in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the thing, Emmaline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is that at first this was a fake relationship. Then you needed a distraction. Then you wanted fun. Then I fell in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit on a steak sandwich. She hadn\u2019t meant to say that.</p><p>Jack\u2019s mouth opened. Nana\u2019s grandfather clock ticked from the living room. Sarge growled and bit Squeaky on the head, getting a soft hiccupping sound.</p> <p>Otherwise, nada. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cMoving along.\u201d She looked at the wallpaper pattern, the little white cherry blossoms against the brown backdrop, and tried not to cry.</p><p>\u201cEmmaline\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d give him this chance. This one microscopic chance to say he loved her, too.</p><p>He looked at the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up! Of course I do. You\u2019re Jack Holland. Everyone loves you.\u201d Tears stung her eyes. Stupid, stupid, stupid Emmaline. \u201cAnd you\u2019re never going to feel that way for me, and you want to know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense a trap.\u201d</p><p>Now was not the time for jokes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m never going to be that woman who needs saving. If I twist my ankle, I can tape it up all by myself. If my ancient pet dies, I won\u2019t wrap myself around you like a python.\u201d She glanced apologetically at Sarge. \u201cEven though I\u2019d be very sad, puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I cheat on you and my lover dies, I won\u2019t need you to hold my hand in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back. \u201cHow did you hear about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s heard about that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, her face hot, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not your type. You get off on being a white knight, and I don\u2019t need one. Not everyone has to be in a relationship to feel good about themselves. Some people are better off on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Glad you figured that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Hadley will always need you. She\u2019s the damsel in distress, and you\u2019re her hero, and part of you gets off on that. And guess what? I hate that you\u2019ve put me in this position. I told you we shouldn\u2019t have started this. I\u2019ve already competed for a man\u2019s love, and I lost. I\u2019m not doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Hadley,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen why is she still in town?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019ll always have some kind of crisis, and you can always rescue her and be the big hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that word!\u201d he barked, and Em actually jumped, she was so surprised. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a hero? Josh Deiner is dying a little more each day, literally rotting away on life support, because I\u2019m not a hero. Because my best wasn\u2019t good enough. Because when the time came, I failed. You think Hadley on a bender makes up for that? Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>Sarge barked, thinking this was terribly exciting, and dropped Squeaky Chicken on Jack\u2019s shoe. Jack looked down.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said, his voice quiet now. \u201cThis is fine. You\u2019re right. We should be done. I wasn\u2019t really looking for a relationship and neither were you. You just wanted a date for a wedding, and I pushed it, and I\u2019m sorry, and that\u2019s fine. Take care.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and went into the foyer, just as Angela was coming downstairs, clad in black yoga pants and a yellow T-shirt. \u201cNamaste, ass**le,\u201d she said, the curse word sounding quite elegant with her accent. \u201cStop yelling at my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d With that, he opened the door and went down the steps.</p><p>Em followed him out. \u201cJack.\u201d</p><p>He stopped but didn\u2019t turn.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d see someone about that PTSD.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t acknowledge her, just started walking down the street to his truck.</p><p>From the soot-colored sky, snowflakes, swollen and tired, began to fall.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>EM WENT BACK inside and sat on the couch, not chastising Sarge as he jumped up next to her and rolled on his belly for a scratch.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Angela said. \u201cI\u2019m calling the Chicken King\u2014they deliver, did you know that?\u2014and making martinis, and then we\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>Then she put a box of tissues next to Emmaline. \u201cThere. Just in case you feel like having a little cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not the type,\u201d Emmaline said, then promptly burst into tears. Yuck. She hated crying; it was so hot and embarrassing and uncontrollable, and yet here she was, sobbing on her sister\u2019s shoulder while Sarge licked her tears.</p><p>A half hour later, the fattening and delicious chicken had been delivered and Angela was making a second batch of martinis and Emmaline was surrounded by tissues and a solemn-looking puppy. Sarge\u2019s left ear was turned inside out, and she fixed it, getting a hand lick in return. Dogs were the best.</p><p>Sisters, too.</p><p>Angela came back, pressed a cold martini glass into Emmaline\u2019s hand, then folded her supermodel frame into Nana\u2019s rose-patterned chair. \u201cI think you\u2019re right about him having a white-knight complex. Men. You should become a lesbian, Em. It\u2019s so much easier on this side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the woman who fled across the country to avoid her ex,\u201d Emmaline muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou have a point.\u201d She sipped, looking like Africa\u2019s answer to Audrey Hepburn. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this once, darling, and keep in mind that my IQ was measured at 158 when I was fifteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready throwing around your creds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have them, flaunt them. Have you considered that perhaps\u2014only perhaps\u2014that you might have let this go a bit easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Explain it for us imbeciles with IQs in the normal range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Kevin broke your heart, the horrible man. You\u2019ve avoided relationships since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Not on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t insult my extremely high intelligence. As I was saying, now you\u2019ve fallen for Jack, and at the first sign of his not being absolutely lovely and perfect, you jettison him from your life to avoid further distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you Mom and Dad want to move to Manningsport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try at changing the subject. Does any of what I say ring true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Emmaline blew her nose and had another slug of martini. \u201cThe thing is, Ange, I walked right into this. I knew he was kind of messed up, and I knew I\u2019m not really his type, but I fell for him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. He\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Another hot line of tears streaked down her face. \u201cHe made me stutter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhen he got mad at me the other day, I stuttered in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did the world stop spinning? Did you get fired? Did everyone throw trash at you?\u201d</p><p>Em rolled her eyes. They may have gotten stuck, but her face was rather numb\u2014Angela made a mean martini\u2014so she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cNo, smart-ass.\u201d Another sip. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sign of weakness just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that you care very much about how he feels, especially in regard to you. That\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s being human.\u201d</p><p>Sarge put his cute little nose on her knee. Her baby dog was getting enormous. She gave him a bite of drumstick in exchange for the drool-covered Squeaky Chicken.</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough lecturing,\u201d Angela announced. \u201cLet\u2019s watch Titanic. I have a terrible crush on Kate Winslet.\u201d</p><p>They put the movie on, and just as Jack first saw Rose on the rich-people deck, Emmaline said, \u201cAngela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad my parents adopted you.\u201d</p><p>Then it was Angela\u2019s turn to cry.</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, there was a cheerful note from Angela on the kitchen table saying she\u2019d be at Cornell for two nights to do some intensive research, but if Em needed her to come home, she would come as fast as a bumblebee, or if Em wanted to come to Ithaca, that would be lovely, too.</p><p>Angela. She really was flawless. Except she was a horrible slob in the bathroom and something of a flirt, from what Em had seen.</p><p>It would actually be nice to be alone for a night or two. Angela\u2019s insight and brilliance made it a little hard for Em to know what to think.</p><p>She had the day off, and the sun was shining. Last night\u2019s snow squall had melted, and it might even hit forty-five today, according to the notoriously unreliable forecasters.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go for a run?\u201d she asked Sarge, smiling as the dog immediately grabbed his hideous chicken and ran to the door. She got changed, tucked her phone into her running shorts pocket, leashed up Wonder Pup and set out. People called to her and waved, and a few folks in the Village stopped to admire Squeaky Chicken and pet the dog.</p><p>The air smelled like spring. Sure, there\u2019d be the heartbreak storm in April, there always was, but for now, it was warm (for New York) and soft and smelled earthy, the sharp scent of shale cutting through. She ran out of town, settling into a pace, Sarge easily keeping up beside her. Past the blue-and-purple Victorian where the nice Murphy family lived, crocuses peeking up from their lawn, past the old school that was possibly being turned into a community center. Shelayne Schanta was in her yard on Buttermilk Road, scooping soggy leaves from a flower bed. \u201cAny news on the adoption front?\u201d Emmaline asked, stopping.</p><p>\u201cJust passed the home visitation,\u201d Shelayne said, beaming.</p><p>\u201cFantastic! If you need a character reference, let me know, okay? Since I\u2019m an upstanding citizen and officer of the law.\u201d</p><p>She continued running, her legs strong and sure, despite it being a few weeks since her last outing. Nice mindless running.</p><p>Kept her mind off Jack.</p><p>She might not be his girlfriend anymore, but she was still worried about him. Even if he was a lost cause.</p><p>When she got to Meering Falls, she stopped, breathing hard. Sarge dropped Squeaky long enough to drink from the heavy stream of water.</p><p>She loved it here. Not just here at the base of the beautiful gorge, carved out by water and time, but here in Manningsport. In New York. The perfect weather and excessive wealth of Malibu had never felt right, and she said a silent prayer of thanks to Nana for taking her in, a heartsick fourteen-year-old who could barely get a sentence out.</p><p>Her phone rang, startling her. Given that she was a cop, you\u2019d think that the phone wouldn\u2019t scare her half to death, but such was not the case. Great. Mom again. She briefly considered letting it go to voice mail, but after the incident with Jack\u2019s phone, she was a little wary of doing that. \u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know you think we love Angela more,\u201d Mom started, her voice prim, indicating hurt feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Em closed her eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I never knew how to fix you. I hated seeing you struggle, and I couldn\u2019t help you, and if there was ever a worse feeling in the world than failing your only child, I don\u2019t know what it is, Emmaline. Please cut me some slack. I did my best, and I\u2019m well aware it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you didn\u2019t fail me. You replaced me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were more than happy to ditch me on Nana, and then four months later, you have a new and improved daughter. How is that not replacing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to live with my mother. You were so much happier out there. How could I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve at least pretended to miss me.\u201d Sarge lay down at her feet and sighed, biting down softly so Squeaky Chicken seemed to mew.</p><p>\u201cI did miss you,\u201d her mother snapped. \u201cBut what good would it have done to tell you that when you were so obviously improving? I hated that f**king stutter. I wanted to kill it for all the trouble it gave you, and when you called home and it was so much easier for you to talk, I couldn\u2019t burst into tears and tell you that I slept in your bed, could I? How would that have helped?\u201d</p><p>Emmaline paused. \u201cDid you just drop the F-bomb, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdopting Angela was a somewhat impulsive decision. I felt like a failure as a mother, so, yes, I tried again. If I\u2019d have known it would hurt you, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give her back?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joke. I actually love Angela, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>The rushing of the falls was full and lovely. \u201cI love you, too, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing. There was no sound from the other end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a happy way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline found that she was smiling. \u201cCome and visit, okay? Soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mom said. There was a pause. \u201cEmmie, I\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t help you with the stutter.\u201d</p><p>Em stroked her dog\u2019s soft fur. It had been a very, very long time since her mother had used that nickname. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t yours to fix, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, it built character.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother laughed, then blew her nose. \u201cIt sure did. No one has more character than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Flawless Angela?\u201d Em teased.</p><p>\u201cOh, her. She\u2019s so boringly flawless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept she\u2019s pretty fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. All right, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cCan I call you again tomorrow?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me again tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Angela I said she was boring. She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was a joke, Mom. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>When she hung up, she knew where she had to go. \u201cUp and at \u2019em, Sarge,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have places to go, people to see.\u201d</p><p>SHE BROUGHT FLOWERS. Yellow tulips, because nothing seemed more cheerful than that.</p><p>They didn\u2019t work of course. Em realized that the second she knocked on the door of Room 405.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Deiner? It\u2019s me, Emmaline Neal. Officer Neal? I was on call the night of the accident.\u201d</p><p>Gloria Deiner looked up from where she sat at the side of the bed. \u201cOh. Hello.\u201d Her voice was flat and quiet.</p><p>The Deiners were not particularly popular in Manningsport. They\u2019d moved here six or seven years ago, from what Emmaline had heard. Too rich, too showy. They\u2019d bought a perfectly lovely farmhouse way up on the farming side of the lake, away from the vineyards where the Mennonite farms dotted the land, then torn it down, much to the heartbreak of the former owners. In its place was a garish McMansion with a five-car garage and eight bedrooms, eleven bathrooms, an indoor pool and an outdoor pool, just for the three of them.</p><p>From what Em knew (and had heard), Josh was the worst of the spoiled rich-kid clich\u00e9\u2014drugs and drinking and sex and the insanely fast car. Trips to Vail and Turks and Caicos and London. His parents would pull him out of school for vacations, sometimes for weeks on end, then throw a hissy fit when he stayed back a grade. Nothing was too good for their boy, who deserved everything just because he\u2019d been born.</p><p>Guess the Deiners were rethinking their child-rearing philosophy now.</p><p>But the fact that Gloria Deiner was here alone... That was just too sad. \u201cWould you like some company?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cOh. All right.\u201d</p><p>The respirator breathed in...then out. In...then out. A beeping alarm of some kind went off in the next room, then stopped.</p><p>Em set the vase of flowers, which now looked obscenely happy, on the windowsill. It was the only arrangement there. She went over to the bed and looked down at Josh.</p><p>Oh. Oh.</p><p>He looked so small under all that equipment, the tubes and lines and swath of blankets. A downy beard sprung in patches on his face, and his eyes were open a slit but didn\u2019t move. His hands curled in toward his chest, which itself was sunken and thin. His hair was ragged and greasy, and he smelled of body odor and Ivory soap.</p><p>\u201cHi, Josh,\u201d she said, touching his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Emmaline Neal. One of the cops in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hear you,\u201d Mrs. Deiner spat. \u201cHe\u2019s brain-dead. But I\u2019m praying for a miracle.\u201d Her words were heavy with bitterness, as if she wanted Emmaline to start spouting facts and tell her to accept reality.</p><p>In...then out.</p><p>It was chilly in here. Em pulled up the blanket a little bit. A Star Wars comforter, probably once much beloved. She swallowed. \u201cCan I sit down?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mrs. Deiner shrugged, so Em sat.</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like when he was little?\u201d Em asked, and the woman\u2019s head jerked back in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She paused. \u201cI was there that night. I guess I\u2019d just like to hear about him.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s face didn\u2019t change for a second; then it softened, and her eyes smiled with memory. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and her voice was young again. \u201cHe was so beautiful. And mischievous!\u201d She reached out to touch Josh\u2019s hand. \u201cHe had this laugh that let him get away with murder. Always running, always breaking things, but then he\u2019d look at me with that smile, and I just couldn\u2019t be mad at him.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t. I loved him so much. I still do.\u201d She started to cry. \u201cMy husband says we have to let him go, but I can\u2019t! How can I let my baby die? How do I stop being a mother?\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Em knelt by Mrs. Deiner\u2019s side and hugged her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, her own voice shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctors say he\u2019s already gone,\u201d Gloria whispered, clutching Em\u2019s shirt. \u201cMy husband says the same thing.\u201d She looked at Emmaline. \u201cDo you think he is?\u201d</p><p>This was her chance to say the right thing. To make all the difference to Gloria Deiner, whose son was surely dying. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut whatever the right thing is, you\u2019ll know. You\u2019re his mother.\u201d</p><p>But Gloria just looked at her son, her face so full of sorrow that Em couldn\u2019t understand how she bore it. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019d like to be alone now.\u201d She looked back at Em. \u201cAnd thank you for talking to him. No one does that anymore.\u201d</p><p>Em hugged her again, but Mrs. Deiner was locked back into her vigil.</p><p>She was almost out of the room when Gloria\u2019s faint voice stopped her. \u201cYou were there that night?\u201d</p><p>Em turned. \u201cYes. Chief Cooper and I. We...we took over for Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Holland.\u201d Her voice hardened. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here if it hadn\u2019t been for Jack Holland.\u201d</p><p>No, Emmaline thought. You\u2019d be visiting a grave.</p><p>\u201cJack left him for last,\u201d Gloria said in an odd lilting voice, as if she were trying to remember a song. \u201cThe one who needed him the most, and Jack left him for last. My baby was all alone.\u201d</p><p>The respirator breathed in and out, in and out.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d Em said very, very softly. \u201cJack was in the water the whole time.\u201d</p><p>But Gloria\u2019s head was turned to her son, and Em doubted that the grieving mother even heard.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>JACK KNOCKED ON the door of 3-C. A second later, Hadley opened the door. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>She looked different. Younger and tired. And she wasn\u2019t beaming at the sight of him.</p><p>It had been a week since her incident at the police station, and while Jack had seen her every day, they hadn\u2019t really talked.</p><p>Today, they would.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything? Coffee or water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cSit down, Hadley.\u201d</p><p>She did, taking a throw pillow and holding it over her stomach. \u201cThis weather, huh? Crazy.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been particularly crazy, not for western New York, anyway. Then again, people always talked about the weather when they were nervous.</p><p>\u201cHadley, it\u2019s time for you to move on,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes filled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to Savannah, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you do that for me, after all the trouble I caused?\u201d</p><p>A good question. He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel responsible for you. For us. For how our marriage didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cheated on you, Jack. I\u2019m the one to blame for our divorce.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never admitted that before. \u201cPeople don\u2019t cheat for no reason,\u201d he said, looking out the window. \u201cYou weren\u2019t happy, so you looked elsewhere. I\u2019m not excusing it, Hadley. But I understand. You were lonely and bored and wanted more attention than I could give.\u201d Than any human could give, he guessed.</p><p>\u201cMy parents barely spoke to me, they were so mad,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey thought you were the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we were just...wrong for each other. No matter how it seemed at first.\u201d</p><p>A tear ran down her cheek.</p><p>If he\u2019d listened a little more carefully to smart people like Honor and his grandparents, to Mrs. Johnson and Connor O\u2019Rourke, he might have picked up on their subtle (and not-so-subtle) notes of caution. If he\u2019d taken longer to get to know Hadley, had her spend more time here rather than one idyllic weekend, the truth would\u2019ve come out. And the truth was, they\u2019d both seen what they wanted to see and not what was actually there.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you come back here, Hadley?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes. \u201cIt seemed like everyone around me was married and having babies or a fabulous career or both, and you know what I was doing? Part-time clerk at Bed, Bath and Beyond. I was thirty years old with nothing and no one, divorced before our first anniversary. A failure.\u201d</p><p>He could\u2019ve pointed out that there was no shame in hard work, or that she could\u2019ve gone back to school for something else, but he knew from experience those words would fall on deaf ears. Hadley had always had a picture of how life was supposed to be, and anything less was just what she said. A failure.</p><p>Hadley swallowed. \u201cWhen I saw you on the news, that handsome Anderson Cooper standing right there in front of the lake, and they were showing pictures of the vineyard and that photo of you from the website, and I thought, \u2018Hadley Boudreau, you blew it.\u2019\u201d She grabbed a tissue and blew her nose. \u201cSo I came up here to get back what we had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat we had wasn\u2019t that great, Hadley. We fought a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade up a lot, too.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cJack, is there any way you could forgive me and get past what I did? I do love you.\u201d</p><p>His heart gave an unwilling tug of sympathy. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou love the idea of me. Just like I loved the idea of you. And I forgave you a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Until he said the words, he hadn\u2019t realized they were true.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what I did, Jack,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou deserved better.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a sincere apology, something she\u2019d never offered before.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He stood up. \u201cGet packed, okay? I\u2019ll call your folks.\u201d</p><p>THAT NIGHT, EM left O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, where Lucas Campbell had graciously flirted with her for fifteen minutes, then been spelled by Jeremy Lyon and then Tom Barlow while Honor talked to Colleen. And to her surprise, Em flirted back, offering to give Lucas a demonstration on how handcuffs worked, fixing Jeremy\u2019s collar, telling Tom his accent made him unfairly attractive.</p><p>It was easy to flirt with nice men who were spoken for.</p> <p>The night was clear, no moon yet, and the stars were bright and sharp over the lake. She\u2019d take Sarge down to the park for his nighttime walk, then maybe give Angela a ring, see how things were going in Ithaca. Maybe call Mom, too, for that matter.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d drive up to Jack\u2019s.</p><p>No. Or yes?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t quite sure who had broken up with whom the other day. Either way, she wanted to see him. Just to check in, doing her civic duty, etc., etc. Maybe strip-search him. Now, now. None of that, she reminded herself. Except he was awfully good-looking, especially naked.</p><p>Maybe just talk to him, more calmly this time. Really see how he was doing, see if the shadows in those clear blue eyes had faded a little bit. Whether or not they were together, she did love him. Missed him horribly.</p><p>This was only the second time in her life she\u2019d been in love.</p> <p>That had to say something. She obviously wasn\u2019t the type to fall for every guy who gave her the time of day. But all those songs and books and movies were right. The sun shone brighter, flowers smelled sweeter, yada yada, it was true.</p><p>And Jack...hell. They didn\u2019t make guys like that every day. A man who loved his family, was good with children, who\u2019d be the date for any lonely woman who needed one. Who\u2019d jump into a frigid lake and save three lives, and only focus on the one who didn\u2019t make it.</p><p>She started down the street to her place, figuring she\u2019d pop Wonder Pup in the car with her, then jerked to a halt.</p><p>Speak of the devil, there was Jack\u2019s truck, parked in front of the Opera House.</p><p>Em instinctively stepped into the doorway of Presque Antiques, the better to spy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait. Hadley came out a second or two later, looking gorgeous in her cream coat and high boots. Jack followed, carrying a suitcase.</p><p>\u201cYou got our tickets?\u201d Hadley asked, her voice carrying easily across the tiny green.</p><p>\u201cAll done online,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSavannah, here we come.\u201d He opened the door for Hadley and handed her in, ever the gentleman. Walked around to the driver\u2019s side, stowed the suitcase and got behind the wheel.</p> <p>And off they went.</p><p>Emmaline swallowed hard. Pressed her lips together to keep from crying. She had to hand it to Hadley.</p><p>It\u2019s just that she hadn\u2019t really believed Jack would fall for her again. And though it had been years since Kevin had taken up with Naomi, Emmaline couldn\u2019t help the thought that roared to mind.</p><p>The beautiful woman won again.</p><p>EMMALINE WAS WITH her at-risk kids the next day, trying to pay attention. But it was hard. Three of the four kids were being tutored by Jack, and every time his name was mentioned, it felt like someone had zapped her with the Taser. Kelsey was sullen, Dalton\u2019s ADD was enjoying a high spell\u2014he was doing headstands. Cory was cleaning his nails with a Swiss Army knife, which Em was considering confiscating, and Tamara was texting.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I get detention for missing school?\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant. I deserve to miss school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you sick?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kelsey said as if it were the stupidest question in the world (which it might\u2019ve been). \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re discriminating against you. You should sue,\u201d said Dalton, flipping upright. \u201cYou got any more popcorn, Officer Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate it all,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>\u201cAlyssa missed way more school than me, and you don\u2019t see Dr. Didier up her ass, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she\u2019s got a better reason than you,\u201d Tamara said without looking up from her phone.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t!\u201d Kelsey snapped. \u201cI\u2019m pulling off the miracle of life here. She\u2019s sad. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Alyssa?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p><p>\u201cJosh Deiner\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s totes destroyed over this.\u201d Tamara paused. \u201cWe all were. Like, all of us girls? We were so crying and stuff. It was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh is an ass**le,\u201d Cory said calmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s dying, so does that make you happy?\u201d Tamara asked.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Cory answered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Cory,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cHonest, you mean?\u201d Cory said. \u201cHe beat me up when I was a freshman.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline murmured something, but part of her was buzzing, humming with instinct. \u201cWhat\u2019s Alyssa\u2019s last name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>After group got out, Emmaline drove to an upscale development on the west side of town. Come to think of it, this area had had a series of break-ins not too long ago. Josh Deiner himself had been the culprit, but being a juvie, only got community service.</p><p>She knocked on the door of 67 Barn Circle Road and waited. No cars in the driveway, no lights on inside except for one room upstairs. She knocked again.</p><p>After another long minute, she heard feet thumping on stairs, and the door opened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlyssa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Officer Neal. Manningsport Police.\u201d She pointed to her badge. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay, but I was wondering if I could talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre my parents all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m here to talk to you. Is it okay if I come in?\u201d</p><p>The girls eyes were swollen from crying, and her brown hair was lank and flat. She wore pajama pants and a Manningsport High sweatshirt several sizes too big\u2014Josh\u2019s, Em would bet.</p><p>Alyssa opened the door and padded into the living room, sat down and drew her knees to her chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you here alone, honey?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. My brother\u2019s in college. Did the school send you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I just wanted to check in with you. You\u2019re Josh\u2019s girlfriend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She burst into tears. Nodded.</p><p>Em wished she\u2019d brought Sarge. He was good for this sort of thing. \u201cIt must be really hard,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t visit him anymore,\u201d Alyssa sobbed. \u201cI just can\u2019t stand seeing him like that. I wish his mother would just pull the plug and let him die already.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline nodded. She grabbed a box of tissues from the end table and handed it to the girl, who snatched a tissue. Her nails were bitten past the quick. \u201cHave you been going to school?\u201d she asked. \u201cMaybe it would help to be around some other friends.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa shook her head. \u201cEveryone stares at me like I\u2019m a freak. I just feel wrong all the time. My parents never liked him, and they\u2019re, like, relieved or something. I mean, they didn\u2019t say that, but I think they worried that Josh was going to turn me into a drug addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must feel really lonely.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa gave her a surprised look, as if she\u2019d expected Emmaline to stick up for her parents. \u201cI am. I miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. I heard you guys were really in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were. Everyone thinks he was such a jerk, and, you know, he had his moments. He wasn\u2019t the easiest person in the world. But he could be so...so...\u201d Her face crumpled again, and she grabbed another tissue.</p><p>\u201cHe had some nice qualities, too,\u201d Emmaline said.</p><p>Alyssa looked up, her eyes huge and wet. \u201cYeah. He did. Like, he never let me pay for anything. And I know it was his parents\u2019 money, but it was nice anyway. It felt really grown-up, having a boyfriend who didn\u2019t have to scrape around for change just to buy you coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was sweet. He really didn\u2019t mind hanging out and just doing nothing.\u201d She started to sob again. \u201cI loved him. My mom says I have to get over this, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a boyfriend in high school,\u201d Em said, stretching the timeline just a bit. \u201cWhen he moved away, I felt like I\u2019d never be happy again, and my mom was not sympathetic. Not that it\u2019s the same situation for you. But I remember the feelings.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pictures of Josh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Of course. Want to see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Em said.</p><p>They went up the curving staircase to the girl\u2019s bedroom, which was unusually neat, the bed made, nothing on the bureaus except four gift bags, each tied with a different colored ribbon.</p><p>The buzzing in Em\u2019s knees intensified. \u201cIs it your birthday?\u201d she asked Alyssa.</p><p>\u201cNo. Um, I\u2019m just clearing out some of my stuff. Figured I\u2019d give some jewelry away.\u201d She bit her nail, then stopped.</p><p>There was, however, a framed eight-by-ten picture of her and Josh in the middle of the desk, as well as a single sheet of notepaper.</p><p>Hot pink notepaper.</p><p>Alyssa slid that into a drawer, then handed her the photo.</p><p>Josh Deiner grinned out at her, blond and handsome, his arm around Alyssa. From the sound of it, he was a spoiled, entitled bully...but that wasn\u2019t really his fault. And now he\u2019d never have the chance to be anything else. \u201cYou guys are gorgeous together,\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cWere gorgeous,\u201d Alyssa corrected dully.</p><p>\u201cThis is a really pretty room. Do you have your own bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d Because that tingling was getting stronger. The room was too neat, and those gift bags...</p><p>\u201cNo! Um, it\u2019s kind of messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t care. Through here?\u201d She put her hand on the doorknob, and Alyssa jumped.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go in there,\u201d she said, covering Em\u2019s hand with her own.</p><p>Em looked at the girl. \u201cSweetheart, are you planning to hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>Alyssa bit her lip hard. Her eyes filled with tears once more. \u201cI\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline put her arms around her. \u201cOh, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I know you feel alone right now, but you\u2019re not. I\u2019ll help you however I can.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa shook with sobs. \u201cI\u2019m just so tired of being sad.\u201d She wept. \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it feels that way. I really do. But it\u2019s not always going to be this bad.\u201d She kissed the top of the girl\u2019s head. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>TURNED OUT ALYSSA had swiped some sleeping pills from her aunt and was planning to swallow them that night. The pills were lined up on the bathroom counter, along with a bottle of wine. The pink paper on the desk was a note to her parents, and the gift bags on the bureau were her favorite pieces of jewelry for her two best friends and two cousins.</p><p>Em called Alyssa\u2019s parents and told them their daughter was safe, then explained the situation. Both of them screeched into the driveway within seconds of each other, raced through the door and hugged their daughter against them. Lots of tears. Alyssa had been seeing a psychologist, though she\u2019d skipped her last two appointments, and because she was eighteen, the doctor hadn\u2019t been able to tell Mr. and Mrs. Pierson. They called the doctor and put Alyssa on with her, watching and wringing their hands. But the girl promised not to hurt herself and made an appointment to see her first thing in the morning. Her dad called Jeremy Lyon to see if he could prescribe an antidepressant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time Em was preparing to go, Alyssa looked relieved, if exhausted, bundled up on the couch, sipping a cup of cocoa.</p><p>Mrs. Pierson walked her to the front door. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d she said, her hands still shaking. \u201cWe knew she was struggling, but we didn\u2019t know how bad it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s getting help. It\u2019s not easy to get through something like this on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer Neal?\u201d Alyssa said, appearing in the foyer.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, go sit down,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou look as weak as a newborn kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will just take a minute, Mom. Maybe you could make me a grilled cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, angel.\u201d She kissed her daughter on the cheek and went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cI, uh...I did some things to Jack Holland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa blinked. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe note, leaving his lights on, the possum?\u201d</p><p>The girl flushed, and her eyes welled again. \u201cI was just so...mad that he couldn\u2019t save Josh, too. Am I in trouble for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might press charges and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. I can guarantee that. Now go sit down and let your mom take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming over,\u201d Alyssa whispered, and much to Em\u2019s surprise, the girl hugged her. \u201cThanks for guessing.\u201d</p><p>WHEN EM GOT to the car, she found that her heart was clattering like an old tractor. Her hands were shaking, and her face felt flushed. She couldn\u2019t tell if she was exhilarated or terrified or both.</p><p>What if she hadn\u2019t gone over? What if she hadn\u2019t asked to see the bathroom?</p><p>But she had. She\u2019d listened to that prickling sense of warning, and Alyssa was going to be okay. She started the car and drove to the cow path by the old barn where the Manningsport police held their Memorial Day speed trap, turned off the engine and reached for her phone to call Jack.</p><p>Oh. Right. She couldn\u2019t do that anymore. She dumped him. Or he dumped her. Either way, he was with Hadley again.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d saved a girl\u2019s life, and you know what? That mattered more. She called Levi. \u201cHi. It\u2019s Em,\u201d she said the second he answered. \u201cI just left the Piersons\u2019 house.\u201d In a rush of blathering, she told him what happened.</p><p>Levi was quiet when she finally stopped talking. \u201cExcellent job, Deputy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Emmaline smiled. Typical chief. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You want a gold sticker? You deserve one. Write it up and we\u2019ll talk tomorrow. And Em...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember this. This was a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chief.\u201d</p><p>She called Jamie next, and her hostage instructor was thrilled. \u201cI knew you had the stuff, Em! You have to come work for us. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy here. But thanks, Jamie. It means a lot.\u201d</p><p>She drove home, the adrenaline still pumping through her limbs. Too bad Angela was still in Ithaca\u2014Em suspected she might be having dinner with Frankie Boudreau. She\u2019d call her later, but for now, a nice glass of wine was called for. Slippers. Pajamas. A Gerard Butler movie.</p><p>A figure rose from one of the Adirondack chairs on her porch, and Em\u2019s hand went to her holster. Just before she drew, she realized who it was.</p><p>\u201cKevin. I almost shot you,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cHi, Emmaline,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, Em was in her pajamas (screw Kevin, he\u2019d seen her in worse), had a glass of wine in one hand and had poured Kevin a glass of water, since he was still alcohol-free, dairy-free, etc., etc. He was petting Sarge, who didn\u2019t seem to care that this was the man who\u2019d once broken Mommy\u2019s heart and was mooing a love song as Kevin scratched his ears. Em planned to have a firm talk with her puppy later on.</p><p>\u201cSo what brings you to Manningsport?\u201d she asked, sitting down.</p><p>\u201cI have an Ironman in Buffalo,\u201d he said, smiling. Still had those damn beautiful eyes. Otherwise, the shock of his physical state was still, well, shocking. \u201cFigured I\u2019d come by and say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like living here?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn your grandmother\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Why are you here, Kev? You and Naomi split up already?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, no. We\u2019re really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour date? At the wedding? Your fake fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. He\u2019s fine.\u201d She took a sip of wine. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t answer my question, Kev. Why would you come see me? Aside from your wedding, I haven\u2019t talked to you in three years.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at Sarge\u2019s head, which was resting on his knee as the faithless cur gazed up adoringly. \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d</p><p>He gave a little snort of laughter. \u201cYou always were direct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the many things you said you loved about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did love you. I\u2019m sorry I stopped.\u201d</p><p>Em took another largeish sip of her wine. Blue Heron. She\u2019d run out of her Lyons Den stash, and this had been in the fridge. It was excellent. Steely and bright with notes of fairy\u2019s breath and sunrises. Whatever the case, it slid past the lump in her throat quite easily.</p><p>Kevin was just looking at her, a faint regretful smile on his face.</p><p>She put the glass down. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand what happened with us. I mean, I\u2019m over you\u2014now\u2014but I never could figure that out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe thing is, Em...I hated myself. I couldn\u2019t think of anything except food and how disgusting I was. Everything else was fake, was just a very brief distraction from food and fat. I hated how fat I was, and I couldn\u2019t wait to eat again. When I started to lose the weight and rework my life, I...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI hated you for loving the lazy, sad, pathetic person that I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you loved Naomi for hating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ironic, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ironic. Well, thanks for coming by. What is it, two hours to Buffalo?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cNot every love is meant to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have that on a T-shirt somewhere?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, surprising her, and she felt an unwilling (and small) rush of affection for him. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Em,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my first love. I\u2019ll always be glad I knew you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stung.</p><p>That was a damn fine apology. Or a line from a Nicholas Sparks book. Or both. \u201cRight back at you.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI wish you all the best, Kevin. I really do.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cAnd, Em...I\u2019m sorry for what I said in the People article. You were never unsupportive. You were pretty great, in fact. And I wish you all the best, too.\u201d</p><p>She gave his hand a squeeze. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve made it through eighth grade without you,\u201d she said. She might\u2019ve been like Alyssa, in fact. But because of the love and acceptance Kevin gave her, she\u2019d never had to find out.</p><p>She looked up, and, for a second, he looked like the boy she\u2019d loved when she was so young, and her heart swelled. She and Alyssa both knew the might of first love, the huge, beautiful, terrible power it had.</p><p>And then the feeling was gone, and in its place was...nothing. Not in the bad way...in the way a room feels after you\u2019ve tossed out the old furniture and put on a fresh coat of paint.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d Kevin said.</p><p>\u201cIt was good to see you.\u201d And even better to mean it.</p><p>She hugged him quickly at the door. \u201cGive Naomi my best,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t even feel the urge to choke or roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd good luck in the race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks! It\u2019s a tough one, all right. But you know how it is. Excuses are for people who don\u2019t want it bad enough. Naomi says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safely!\u201d she said and closed the door.</p><p>Sarge came over and licked her knee.</p><p>\u201cThat went well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cMe, too. And this, my friend, calls for some Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. We can talk about your whorish ways later.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>JACK GOT BACK from Savannah just in time for dinner with Dad and Mrs. Johnson. \u201cHow was your trip, my darling boy?\u201d Mrs. J. asked after he finished his third helping of roast pork, peas and salt potatoes, his favorite.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s done. That\u2019s the best part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her family?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always liked them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut not her,\u201d Mrs. J. said. \u201cI told you, Jack, that woman wasn\u2019t good enough for you, but you didn\u2019t listen to me, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mrs. J. And I should have. I\u2019m sorry. Please can I have some pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment, you ungrateful child.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s this nonsense I hear about you and Emmaline Neal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s over.\u201d His voice was casual, but the words caused an odd tightness in his chest. He and Emmaline hadn\u2019t been together very long, really. He shouldn\u2019t feel so...hollow.</p><p>Mrs. Johnson turned to the counter and cut him a piece of pie. \u201cIt being over is the nonsense to which I\u2019m referring, Jackie.\u201d She put her hand on his shoulder, and Jack looked down. He was used to glossing over things where the Coven was concerned. Mrs. Johnson, though...she wasn\u2019t so easy to brush off.</p><p>\u201cHyacinth,\u201d Dad said, \u201ccould you give us a moment, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my darling. Jackie, listen to your father.\u201d She kissed Jack on the cheek, then left the kitchen. If Jack knew her (and he did) she\u2019d eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Dad gave him a long look. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be,\u201d he said, too quickly. Somehow, his father\u2019s kind eyes made Jack feel a thousand times worse.</p><p>\u201cI am, son. You seem lost.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Jack\u2019s throat tightened. \u201cI\u2019m doing okay.\u201d</p><p>Dad didn\u2019t speak right away, but when he did, his voice was soft. \u201cWhen your mother died,\u201d he said, \u201cthere were days when I didn\u2019t know how I got from one place to the next. I\u2019d be down in the barn and think, \u2018How did I get here? Did I eat breakfast? Did I drive here?\u2019 Sometimes I\u2019d see my face in the mirror and I wouldn\u2019t even recognize myself.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew the feeling. He just didn\u2019t want his father\u2014or anyone in his family\u2014to lose sleep over him.</p><p>\u201cSo I see you these days, son, and I recognize that lost look.\u201d His father put his hand over Jack\u2019s. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurting. We all do. I know it\u2019s not going to go away overnight, either. What happened with those kids was terrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking,\u201d Jack said, and the words were hard to get out, \u201cif I\u2019d done something different, if I\u2019d been even twenty or thirty seconds faster, or even ten, maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only human. You did everything you could. You helped them. Those other boys would all be dead without you, Jack. You saved three lives that night. Those matter, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. Swallowed. He knew his father was right. Feeling that, though...believing it was harder.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stop in at Honor\u2019s,\u201d Dad said. \u201cShe has the name of a couple of therapists who specialize in PTSD. Will you do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack nodded again. He stood up, and Dad did, too, and Jack hugged his father. Dad, who was as solid and enduring as an oak tree. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about me, Dad,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Dad murmured, hugging him back. \u201cI\u2019m your father. Mrs. J.\u2019s your stepmother. Your sisters adore you, and you\u2019ve always been here for us. Let us take care of you for once.\u201d</p><p>HONOR HAD A LIST, of course, complete with phone numbers, emails and office hours. \u201cCome on, brother,\u201d she said after she handed it to him. \u201cLet\u2019s walk up to the cemetery.\u201d She clipped the leash on Spike, who bounced and pranced and bit Jack\u2019s boot.</p><p>The night was cool, but spring was coming. Tomorrow, Ned was planning to tap the trees so they could make maple syrup, and in another month, the Hollands would gather for the blessing of the crops. Pops was still with them, Faith and Levi\u2019s baby would be here, Tom and Honor were married now and Charlie was living with them full-time.</p> <p>Josh would be dead by then, Jack guessed.</p><p>Honor opened the gate to the cemetery, and they sat on one of the benches. There were flowers on Mom\u2019s grave. There always were.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna lecture me, too?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so good at it,\u201d Honor said, linking her arm through his.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Her dog nuzzled its way into Jack\u2019s coat. \u201cYou and Tom seem happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. We are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty great.\u201d She leaned her head against his shoulder. \u201cI was surprised you and Em broke up,\u201d she said. \u201cShe seemed kind of perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>An image of Emmaline coming through his door, a smile on her face, rolled over Jack like a truck. Her in the bathtub, up to her neck in suds. In the hotel room in Malibu, that smear of chocolate on her cheek. Laughing with her teenagers.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really plan on this,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was with Hadley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Honor said, her tone dry.</p> <p>\u201cIf I ask you a question, will you tell the rest of the Coven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on how much you spend on my next birthday present.\u201d She nudged his arm. \u201cNo, of course I won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know with Tom?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away, which was good, because unlike his other two sisters, it meant she was actually thinking. Pru would say something about the raw animal attraction between her and Carl. Faith would say something dreamy and mushy.</p><p>Honor would tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI guess it was pretty simple. I pictured what I wanted in the future, and he was it. His smile, his laugh, his voice. I couldn\u2019t see me with anyone else. We, um...we didn\u2019t have the most typical start, but when it came down to it, he was just...the one.\u201d</p><p>There had been a night with Emmaline...a completely unremarkable night at his house. He\u2019d cooked dinner, and she told him about a call involving a squirrel that had somehow gotten into Barb Nelson\u2019s china cabinet, and the subsequent rubble the rodent caused. Jack had laughed long and hard when she told him how she had to trip Everett and take his gun so he wouldn\u2019t shoot the wee beastie, Barb snapping pictures for the newspaper. They\u2019d watched a movie after dinner. Well, half a movie. Maybe a third, because they\u2019d ended up doing it on the couch, Em\u2019s skin so soft, her eyes big and dark.</p><p>An unremarkable night, except it was perfect.</p> <p>\u201cI screwed up with her,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to fix that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a guy. Of course you screwed up. It goes with the territory.\u201d She straightened up. \u201cBut you\u2019ll make things right.\u201d She stood up. \u201cI have to get back to the house. Tree Bark Man is on, and I don\u2019t want to miss it. Why don\u2019t you come watch it with us?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><p>Jeremy Lyon. \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cCan you get to the hospital?\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cGloria Deiner wants to see you, and you should come now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way,\u201d he said, hanging up. \u201cSorry, Honor. I have to run. Another time, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPENED to the fourth floor. Jeremy was right there, waiting, looking oddly official in his white doctor\u2019s coat. \u201cJosh is winding down,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cHis parents are going to take him off life support, and Gloria asked to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But yes.\u201d In fact, his heart was pounding, and his T-shirt was damp with sweat.</p><p>Jeremy smiled sadly, gave his shoulder a squeeze and led the way down the dimly lit hallway. \u201cGloria? Jack\u2019s here,\u201d he said outside room 405.</p><p>There was a whispered exchange, and then Mr. Deiner came out. He nodded at Jack, his eyes wet, and went down the hall.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Mrs. Deiner said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go stay with Alan,\u201d Jeremy said. He lowered his voice. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Jack went in.</p><p>And there he was. For the first time in all these weeks, Jack saw Josh Deiner, the boy whose life he didn\u2019t save.</p><p>What was left of Josh, that was. Weeks on a feeding tube, weeks of profound brain damage and respirators and muscle wasting had reduced Josh to near-skeletal proportions.</p><p>Jack looked at Mrs. Deiner, who was staring at her son. \u201cMrs. Deiner?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI thought you might want to see him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack said, then cleared his throat. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen have a seat,\u201d she said. Her voice was oddly calm. \u201cYou can talk to him if you want. They say hearing is the last thing to go.\u201d</p><p>Jack sat on the hard wooden chair. Mrs. Deiner didn\u2019t say anything else. The rhythmic wheeze of the respirator counted the seconds.</p><p>It was hard to see past the medical equipment, and the spooky, half-closed eyes. The respirator obscured much of Josh\u2019s face. His hands curled inward, and his arms seemed too long, they were so thin.</p><p>But his eyelashes were long and blond, and he looked more like a child than the eighteen-year-old Jack had pulled from the lake. He had a freckle under his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jack whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He put his hand over Josh\u2019s. The skin was cool and too smooth.</p><p>And then Jack bent his head and covered his mouth with one hand so Josh\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t hear him crying. But the hot tears spilled out of his eyes, and even though it had been twenty years since Jack had cried, he couldn\u2019t now seem to stop. The best he could do was try to keep quiet, even as his shoulders shook.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cWas he scared?\u201d</p><p>Jack straightened up and cleared his throat. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice husky. \u201cHe was unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Deiner adjusted the blanket, pulling it over Josh\u2019s sunken chest. She smoothed his hair back, her hand lingering for a minute on her son\u2019s forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die,\u201d she said, then gave Jack an almost embarrassed smile. \u201cObviously.\u201d Her eyes filled. \u201cEven if he stayed like this, I\u2019d take care of him. I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m his mother. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s dying anyway. He never did listen to me.\u201d She stared at her son, petting his too-long hair. \u201cI know you did your best, Jack,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cThank you for trying.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Jack bent his head and gripped the cold metal bar of the bed hard.</p><p>And then Gloria Deiner came to his side of the bed and put her hand on Jack\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou should go now,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack nodded. He stood up, then kissed Josh on the forehead. He turned and hugged the boy\u2019s mother, felt her sob against him. Tears sliced down his face again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said once more.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>ON AN OBSCENELY sunny day in the last week of winter, when it seemed impossible that the birds could be singing and the sky so pure and blue, Josh Deiner was buried.</p><p>The whole town turned out for his funeral. Em was on traffic duty and led the procession to the cemetery. She parked the cruiser outside the gates, leaving the lights flashing, and got out. Right behind her was the funeral home limo, and as Mr. and Mrs. Deiner got out, Em swallowed hard. Mr. Deiner was bent by the weight of his grief, bowed like an old tree that would fall in the next storm, and Gloria looked right through Em without a flicker of recognition, her face tight, lips trembling.</p><p>Em\u2019s chest ached with suppressed sobs.</p><p>The entire senior class was there, each kid holding a white rose. Alyssa Pierson walked past, flanked by her parents, tears streaming down her face. Mr. Pierson nodded to Em, and Em murmured a hello. Mrs. Pierson had called Em to tell her Alyssa was doing better, and, indeed, the girl looked less unkempt. Devastated, of course. Everyone was, because though Josh wasn\u2019t the best kid, it was an unavoidable, wrenching truth\u2014today, two parents were burying their only child. Josh would never get to be more than a reckless kid who broke his parents\u2019 hearts, ruined their lives, leaving a legacy of \u201cdon\u2019t be like me.\u201d</p><p>Emmaline lifted her sunglasses and wiped her eyes.</p><p>There were the Hollands, and her heart ached even more.</p><p>Jack\u2019s blond hair shone in the sunlight. He wore sunglasses and a suit, easy to spot, since he was taller than most. Did the Deiners know he was here? Please, God, there wouldn\u2019t be another scene like the one at the hospital, when Mrs. Deiner had screamed at him. He was too far away for Em to tell if he had that awful haunted look in his eyes that she\u2019d seen so many times these past couple of months. This funeral must be agonizing for him.</p><p>Levi stood next to him, maybe as a guard, handsome and solemn in his dress uniform. He said something, eliciting a nod from Jack. Faith was right there, as well, recognizable by her red hair and enormous belly, and she put her hand on her brother\u2019s arm. Any day now for her, and it was good, a new baby in that family. Something for Jack to smile about, because that smile was one of the best things in the world, and, God, Emmaline missed seeing it, missed it so much in that second that it was hard to breathe.</p><p>Reverend White began the prayers, and Em looked down. She could hear the muffled sobs of some of Josh\u2019s classmates.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d Everett\u2019s voice was a whisper over the radio. He was at the tail end of the funeral procession, which curved around the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cThis is so sad.\u201d It sounded like he might be crying.</p><p>\u201cI know, buddy. Hang in there.\u201d</p><p>A short time later, the crowd began walking slowly back to their cars. A few people stopped at other graves, brushing off some leaves or bowing their heads in prayer. A little boy, maybe four years old, ran ahead of his parents, laughing. He grabbed a pinwheel off one grave, and his mother ran up to him and put it back, then knelt down for a lecture.</p><p>Was that what Josh had been like? His mom had said he\u2019d been full of mischief, always naughty, but with a smile that let him get away with it. From now on, Gloria Deiner would have to look at other children, and Em knew she\u2019d always compare them to her son, her lost boy.</p><p>\u201cHi, Emmaline.\u201d</p><p>Em started a little. \u201cHey, Jack,\u201d she whispered around the lump in her throat. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>He took off his sunglasses, and, though he looked tired, his eyes were clear. \u201cI\u2019m doing okay. Better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s...that\u2019s good, Jack.\u201d She paused, her hand going to her Taser. Nervous habit. God, she was as bad as Everett. \u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to come today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got to see him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou were right, Emmaline,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI haven\u2019t been...myself. I\u2019m sorry you got caught in the middle of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her a long minute, his eyes the same color as the bright March sky.</p><p>She wanted to ask him how it was, seeing Josh. What had changed Mrs. Deiner\u2019s mind. If it had been awful. If he was sleeping at all. If he was back with Hadley, and if he was with Hadley, she hoped the other woman was taking good care of him, because Jack...Jack was one of a kind.</p><p>Her radio blipped. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she said, and her voice was husky. \u201cTraffic duty.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt was good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>And then, because she didn\u2019t want him to see her cry, when other people had much better reason to be sad today than she did, she got into the cruiser and did her job.</p> <p>A WEEK AFTER Josh\u2019s funeral, Emmaline was sitting in the police station, trying to show Everett how to correctly upload a report. It was the perfect time to teach Everett some basic computer skills. Mindless work. Levi had taken the day off, so it was just Emmaline, Ev and Carol, and no crime to keep them busy. Manningsport had been somber since Josh died\u2014no speeders, no crime, no DUIs.</p><p>Em hadn\u2019t seen Jack. The other night, Angela asked if she wanted to go to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s and Em said no, just in case Jack was there. She was glad he\u2019d had some closure with Josh, glad he was doing better. But it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was in love with him, and he didn\u2019t feel the same way. You\u2019re right, he\u2019d said. We should be done. I wasn\u2019t really looking for a relationship and neither were you.</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Everett asked, dragging her back to the present.</p><p>\u201cJust click Upload. Right there. No, not Escape! Great. Now you have to enter it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you know more about this than I do?\u201d Everett asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been working here longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you have the IQ of a chicken,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cNow, Carol,\u201d Em said. \u201cEverett has many qualities.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and Carol pounced. \u201cManningsport Police Department, is this an emergency?...Oh, hi, Levi!...Really? Finally! I thought she\u2019d never\u2014okay, fine, don\u2019t yell at me. She\u2019s right here.\u201d Carol gave Em a long-suffering look. \u201cFaith\u2019s in labor and Levi wants a police escort.\u201d</p><p>Em picked up the phone. \u201cFaith\u2019s in labor and I want a police escort,\u201d Levi ordered. \u201cGet your ass here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d She ran out to the parking lot and got into the cruiser. Lights and sirens, and it was exactly as much fun as it sounded. She sped into town, blipped at intersections and turned onto Levi and Faith\u2019s street. Their cute little bungalow was a few blocks off the green.</p><p>But apparently, word had gotten out, because the street was mobbed. John Holland\u2019s dilapidated red truck, Prudence\u2019s equally abused blue truck, Honor\u2019s white Prius, Jack\u2019s gray pickup. Furthermore, Colleen was standing on the lawn with the Barretts, who lived next door, as well as Faith\u2019s grandparents and nephew and Levi\u2019s sister. \u201cSo Sarah, we should go out sometime,\u201d Ned was saying.</p><p>\u201cMy brother will make sure your body is never found,\u201d Sarah Cooper answered. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to risk it, so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed some crowd control?\u201d Emmaline asked.</p> <p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThere are a dozen people in there.\u201d</p><p>Just then, the front door banged open, and Levi appeared, Faith in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s hot,\u201d Colleen murmured. \u201cI want Lucas to do that for me when my time comes.\u201d</p><p>Various and sundry Hollands streamed after them\u2014Abby, Pru, Honor, Mrs. Johnson, Faith\u2019s dad.</p><p>Jack.</p><p>He was smiling, and Em felt it like she\u2019d just stepped into a patch of sunlight.</p><p>Well. He wasn\u2019t smiling at her. She wrenched her eyes off him. She was on duty, after all. She was needed.</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop her stomach from tightening. She tried to ignore it. \u201cYou doing okay, Faith?\u201d she asked, trotting next to Levi as he strode to the car.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s overreacting,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBut I do kind of want to push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push!\u201d Levi barked. \u201cDo not push, honey. Please. No pushing. We have fifteen minutes to the hospital. You can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we thought about an ambulance?\u201d Em asked.</p><p>\u201cGerard Chartier is not seeing my girl parts,\u201d Faith said firmly. \u201cI can hold it in. Oh! Wow! This hurts! Hurry up, babe. Not you, baby. You, babe.\u201d</p><p>Jack opened the backseat of Faith\u2019s car, and Levi lowered her in. \u201cI\u2019m driving,\u201d Jack said. \u201cStay in the back with your wife.\u201d He looked at Emmaline. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>She got into the cruiser and let the siren rip. Glanced back from time to time to make sure Jack was behind her and slowed for intersections, making sure all was clear.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t think about Jack. Not that way, not now.</p><p>But it did dawn on her that Hadley hadn\u2019t seemed to be among the crowd.</p><p>The trick was to go fast but not too fast, and basically to just clear the runway, so to speak. Jack had his hazards on, and it looked like a colorful presidential entourage, with all the Holland vehicles following him.</p><p>They made it to the hospital in twelve minutes instead of fifteen, and Em ran in to get a gurney. Crowded day, of course. Full moon. Shelayne was on duty, surveying the waiting room with a frown.</p><p>\u201cBaby coming,\u201d Emmaline called. \u201cFaith and Levi\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout time!\u201d Shelayne said. Small towns. No secrets.</p><p>Emmaline ran out with the gurney and Levi put his wife on it. She was clinging to his hand, doing that hee-hee-hoo-hoo thing that couldn\u2019t possibly work. Probably just to distract the woman from the fact that she was in labor.</p><p>Jack fell into step next to her, one hand on the gurney. Em could smell his good Jack smell\u2014grapes and laundry detergent and sun. He smoothed some hair off Faith\u2019s forehead, and the gesture made Em\u2019s throat tighten.</p><p>He was such a good guy.</p><p>They went through the automatic doors of the hospital, Levi murmuring to his wife. Behind them, the Holland clan followed, chattering like magpies.</p><p>A couple of kids were waiting to be seen, one of them running around with a paper airplane, the other holding gauze on his chin as he wiggled his front tooth. Crazy Matthias Pembry was talking animatedly to himself\u2014time for a medication adjustment, no doubt. An old lady in a wheelchair was glaring at the runner, and a man clutched a bloody dishcloth to his ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you a nurse?\u201d he asked. \u201cI seem to have torn off part of my ear.\u201d He held something up. Ah. The ear. A small trail of blood ran down his neck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nasty,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cStep away from my wife,\u201d Levi said, not nicely. So cute, men!</p><p>\u201cOh, another contraction. God, I\u2019m amazing. Look at me, talking through these. I rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ego problems here,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cI really want to push,\u201d Faith said, a little breathlessly. \u201cCan I push? Technically, we\u2019re at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push yet,\u201d Emmaline said. \u201cShelayne? You want this baby born here, or shall we get moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s a critic,\u201d Shelayne said, coming over. \u201cHi, Faith. About time. You ready to meet the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, guys,\u201d Em said. Suddenly, she was choked up. She punched Levi on the shoulder, and off they went, a chorus of \u201cGood luck, Faithie!\u201d and \u201cWe love you!\u201d floating behind them.</p><p>\u201cI still think I should be her birthing coach,\u201d Prudence said, flopping into a chair. \u201cI\u2019ve done this twice. Ned slid out like he was greased, all bloody and cute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother. Cease,\u201d Ned said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d the grandfather said. \u201cWho brought food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred Norbertson?\u201d a nurse called.</p><p>The man with the ear wound started forward, but his, um, fragment fell to the ground. He didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your ear,\u201d Em said. Abby dry heaved.</p><p>\u201cOh! Thanks.\u201d He picked it up and smiled at Emmaline, giving her a quick up-and-down scan.</p><p>The entrance doors opened, and Colleen came in, sliding her phone into her bag. \u201cThe vigil begins! Connor\u2019s sending over sandwiches. Are we waiting here, or are we going upstairs to Maternity? How many of us are there?\u201d</p><p>Time for Emmaline to go. She was the outsider here. \u201cGood luck, Team Holland,\u201d she said with a self-conscious wave.</p><p>A chorus of goodbyes and thanks rose up from the ranks.</p><p>Her eyes stopped on Jack. \u201cBye,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Emmaline,\u201d he said. He smiled. And that was it. For a second, she thought he was going to say something more.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>The drive back to the station seemed long and lonely.</p><p>It was after five, so technically, she was off duty. Carol and Everett were gone, though Ev was on call tonight.</p><p>She tidied up the department kitchen and sat down at her desk. As she filled out a few reports, her mind kept going back to the hospital. She hoped everything would go okay. Nice, that whole mob there, waiting for news of the baby. Hard to imagine, being a part of that, when her own family was so small.</p><p>Speaking of her family, maybe Ange wanted to do something tonight. Go for a run with Sarge, maybe get some nachos at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s afterward. She picked up the phone.</p><p>Then the station door opened, and Jack came in. Em stood up fast. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the baby come already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Em took a quick breath. \u201cThen what are you doing here? You should be at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you want your brother there?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can go over later. When everyone\u2019s clean and not bloody.\u201d He put his hands in his pockets. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sank back into her seat. \u201cUm...hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled, just a little, his eyes crinkling before his mouth moved.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... That\u2019s...yeah... Good, I mean.\u201d So smooth.</p><p>Jack came closer. As in, right next to her desk. \u201cI took Hadley back to Savannah. She won\u2019t be back. In case you didn\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. That\u2019s...that\u2019s great. I mean, it\u2019s great if you say it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her hands, then back up at her. \u201cEmmaline, I\u2019m so sorry for what I said about you being a bully. You\u2019re not. You couldn\u2019t be if you tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Her voice was a whisper now. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right. Wait. What did you say?\u201d She felt her face flush, and her heart, God, it was hummingbird fast.</p><p>He smiled, a full-on, 100 percent smile, a smile so good she felt it in every molecule. \u201cI love you, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I thought you weren\u2019t, uh, looking for a relationship.\u201d Her eyes seemed to be filling up.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I seem to have found one anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I...that\u2019s...that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you think so.\u201d He reached into his pocket. \u201cI brought you a present.\u201d</p><p>He handed it to her, and she had to laugh, because it was a bag of Skittles. \u201cGot any chocolate cake to go with that?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do at home.\u201d</p><p>Home. Now that was a nice word. There was a whole future in that word. He took her hand and looked at it for a second. \u201cI got you this, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then he dropped on one knee, and Em found that she was shaking, and this was quite a surprise. But holy bleep, Jack was proposing. Or he had just lost a contact.</p><p>Except he didn\u2019t wear contacts.</p> <p>He looked up at her with those blue, blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the best person I know, Emmaline Neal. Give me another chance. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>He had a ring. A ring. Good God, he had a ring.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, and it came out in a squeak, but it didn\u2019t matter, because he slid the ring on her finger, and then he stood up and was kissing her, his mouth warm and firm and smiling against hers.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Well, of course we\u2019re here at Jack and Emmaline\u2019s wedding! Where else would we be? What a beautiful day they got, too! The barn looks beautiful, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a Holland family tradition to get married here. Faith did, and so did Honor, just last year, remember?</p><p>Hmm. The wedding party\u2019s a little big, but with Jack\u2019s family, how can you blame them? Look at the program. The groomsmen are his three brothers-in-law\u2014Levi, Tom and Carl\u2014and his nephew, Prudence\u2019s son. And Connor O\u2019Rourke, they\u2019re old friends, of course. I see Emmaline made his sisters and niece bridesmaids. Doesn\u2019t Faith look wonderful, and with little Noah just a few months old. Good for her.</p><p>No, the maid of honor is Emmaline\u2019s sister. Gorgeous girl! We heard she modeled in college, and we believe it! She\u2019s practically a celebrity around here. No, no, don\u2019t fix her up with your grandson. She likes girls. She lives in their grandmother\u2019s house now, down on Water Street, and their parents just bought a place a little ways out of town. Well, of course Emmaline will be living at Jack\u2019s! Have you seen that place? It\u2019s stunning.</p><p>Oh, and look at this. She included the members of that book club that never reads anything. Grace Knapton isn\u2019t here... No, she got married! She lives in Hawaii now! You didn\u2019t hear? Well, she does. Dr. Whitaker\u2019s doing a reading; that\u2019s nice. There\u2019s Shelayne, that nice nurse from the E.R. who just adopted Kelsey Byrd\u2019s baby. I guess they have one of those \u201copen arrangements\u201d so Kelsey can come see the baby from time to time. Got to hand it to Emmaline; we never thought those kids would graduate, but they made it.</p><p>Colleen O\u2019Rourke is about ready to pop, speaking of babies, and look at the way her husband looks at her. Isn\u2019t that sweet? Soon we\u2019ll have another baby in town. Practically a population boom!</p> <p>Oh, I missed this. \u201cParents of the groom, John and Hyacinth Holland.\u201d Well, she deserves it, Mrs. Johnson does. Jack dotes on her. He\u2019s always been her favorite. I heard she made the wedding cake\u2014wouldn\u2019t let Lorelei near it. And it\u2019s just so sweet that Jack asked his father to be the best man. John Holland\u2019s been blessed with those four kids of his.</p><p>Shh! The music\u2019s starting!</p><p>Well, now, look at Emmaline! She\u2019s beautiful! That dress is amazing. Nice to see her out of a uniform! Who knew she had such a gorgeous figure? Yes, she does play hockey\u2014look at those shoulders. That\u2019s how she and Jack met, I heard. Turns out he always had a thing for her.</p><p>And look at Jack. Oh, what a smile! He looks so happy.</p><p>Kind of brings a tear to your eyes, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>That\u2019s the kind of love you usually only see in your dreams.</p>  </body></html>"]
