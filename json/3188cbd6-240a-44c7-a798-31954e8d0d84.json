She dialed and hunkered underneath the covers, counting the rings.</p><p>Pick up. Please pick up.</p><p>\u201cDomini?\u201d Cam McKay said with a surprised tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>The deep timbre of his voice allowed her to focus on something besides her fear. \u201cI think someone is breaking into the restaurant. There\u2019s loud noises and breaking glass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you locked in your apartment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Should I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t move. Stay right there, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Domini started to answer but he beat her to the punch.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Cam said sharply. \u201cStay put and stay quiet until you hear from me. Keep your phone close to you and on vibrate. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Click.</p><p>For the next thirty minutes, Domini cowered in her bed, hating that the incident had transported her back to the sleepless nights of her childhood. Hearing the violence in the streets below. Sirens in the distance.</p><p>As terror beat in her chest like a living thing, trying to claw its way out, she realized she hadn\u2019t exorcised that scared little girl at all. No place on earth was far enough away from those horrid memories because she carried them inside her.</p> <p>Domini\u2019s phone buzzed in her hand and she nearly screamed. The caller ID read: Cam. Thank God. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m outside your apartment. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>She tossed back the quilt and raced to the living room. After releasing the deadbolts, she opened the door. The gigantic silhouette slunk into the room and she instinctively backed up, because the guy took up a serious amount of space.</p><p>Cam McKay was imposing, even in near darkness. The dominant male animal. The ultimate guardian. A pillar of strength. A bona fide warrior.</p><p>His deep frown and shrewd gaze read all business. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I am now. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He kept looking at her as if he expected her to get hysterical. \u201cDomini\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. Just shaky. I\u2019ll umm...make tea.\u201d</p><p>Tea? How lame. But she was so flustered from being scared, and from Cam being right there, she wasn\u2019t thinking straight.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need a shot of whiskey,\u201d he muttered as he followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>Maybe I need a shot of you to settle me down.</p><p>Domini filled the kettle and fired up the stove. Her hand shook like crazy when she put a jasmine teabag in each mug before she faced him, knowing she looked calmer than she felt. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear sirens. Does that mean there wasn\u2019t a break in?\u201d</p><p>Cam watched her carefully and shook his head.</p><p>Her relief warred with frustration. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine those noises. I\u2019m not the type of woman who just\u2014\u201d she gestured distractedly, searching for the right phrase, \u201c\u2014who just calls the law on a whim.\u201d</p><p>But Domini hadn\u2019t called 911...she\u2019d called Deputy McKay. At home. Did Cam think she\u2019d tricked him to get him to show up alone at her apartment at midnight? On a night she knew he hadn\u2019t been on duty? Her chin fell to her chest.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Cam shuffled closer. His warm fingers tipped her face up. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know you\u2019d never cry wolf? Don\u2019t you think I know what type of woman you are, Domini?\u201d</p><p>No. I don\u2019t think you have a clue.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine anything. You heard somebody throwing stuff in the Dumpster. Inside the container were a bunch of broken glass and rotten wood from old window frames. Either the Dumpster rolled away as they were loading the bigger stuff into it, or they used it as bumper car, because it\u2019s crossways in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. There are a couple of big chunks out of the sandstone where the Dumpster smacked into it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cBut that was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably think I\u2019m just another paranoid woman who overreacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. I heard the fear in your voice when you called me. That\u2019s what got me over here so damn fast.\u201d</p><p>And despite her resolve not to act wimpy, Domini launched herself at him. She circled her arms around his neck, pressing her face into his sturdy chest as she shuddered with relief.</p><p>It took a minute for Cam to respond. Then one hand stroked her hair with gentleness that belied his size, and his other hand gripped her hip.</p><p>At five foot ten, Domini had always been considered tall. But sheltered within Cam\u2019s height and breadth, she felt positively petite. Surrounded by his warmth and his scent she felt completely...safe.</p><p>Neither one said a word. But their body language spoke volumes. Cam\u2019s heart thumped wildly beneath her ear. Her breathing was as choppy as his.</p><p>Domini angled her head back gradually, not wanting to scare him away from touching her. When he sensed her looking at him, those sinfully long eyelashes lifted and he studied her from beneath the half-lidded gaze.</p><p>Here\u2019s your chance. Take it.</p><p>She stood on the tips of her bare toes until their mouths were a breath apart. \u201cThank you for coming, Cam.\u201d Without breaking eye contact, Domini brushed her lips over his. Slowly the first time. Even more leisurely on the second pass. The third time she\u2019d intended to leave her mouth pressed to his, just to see if he\u2019d kiss her back.</p><p>But Cam stole that third kiss from her. His velvety tongue snaked out and traced the seam of her lips. She gasped and that wicked tongue dove straight into her open mouth.</p><p>For so long she\u2019d wondered what Cam tasted like. Now she knew\u2014delicious. All hot musky male. The kiss wasn\u2019t aggressive, but a curious dance of tangling tongues and sliding lips. When Cam playfully suckled her tongue, her curiosity vanished and spiraled into hunger.</p><p>Cam\u2019s fingers tightened in her hair. He tilted her head,, devouring her mouth with wet sucking kisses. The hand on her hip slid around to caress her lower back. The heat of his rough palm on her bare skin was as potent as an electric charge as his hand glided beneath her pajama bottoms. His middle finger used the crack of her butt as a sensual guide until just the tip of his finger rested on her tailbone. Then he urged her pelvis closer to his by pressing on that bone.</p><p>The odd pressure on that erogenous spot, coupled with Cam\u2019s greedy kisses set her blood on fire. The man could inflame her entire body with just one finger.</p><p>He briefly lifted his lips. \u201cMore,\u201d he growled against her mouth. \u201cGive me all of you.\u201d Cam kissed her harder. Deeper. Plastering her body to his. Grinding their hips together in a show of raw sexual power. He cranked her need higher, tighter, hotter with each consuming kiss.</p><p>Yes yes yes. This is what she\u2019d been dying for.</p><p>Domini dug her fingernails into his scalp, returning his passion. Then she let her eager hands drift down the angular lines of his skull to cup his face between her palms. She traced the outer shell of his ears. When her thumb brushed the raised ridge of the scar on his left cheek, he quickly turned his head away.</p><p>The teakettle whistled and Cam abruptly released her.</p><p>She understood without looking at him the foray into testing the water as lovers was over.</p><p>\u201cDomini. I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t apologize. Don\u2019t you dare apologize.</p><p>\u201cLook. I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it did.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Cam said tightly.</p><p>Great. He\u2019d reset his persona back to Cam, the helpful deputy, a far cry from Cam, the demanding man who\u2019d just turned her inside out with a simple kiss. Now he\u2019d run. Was he running from her? Or from himself? And would she just let him go?</p><p>After removing the kettle from the burner, Domini mustered the courage to meet his eyes. \u201cI assume you\u2019re not staying for tea?\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for showing up at this crazy hour. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me, princess. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for saying so, but your job sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how true that statement is right now.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s gaze scanned her from bedhead to bare toes. He rubbed his mouth with his knuckle, almost as if he was wiping her kiss from his lips and his memory.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>Domini kept her emotions in check as she walked to the living room. She stood pointedly beside the open door.</p><p>Cam said, \u201cLook. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re about to say, Deputy McKay. I won\u2019t forget to lock the door behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what...\u201d He sighed. \u201cFine. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Immediately after Cam cleared the doorjamb, she slammed the door, flipped the locks and stomped back to her bedroom.</p><p>Idiotic man. He wanted her. She wanted him. So what was his problem?</p><p>What\u2019s your problem? Why can\u2019t you just tell him you want him?</p><p>I did! I kissed him first.</p><p>And it hadn\u2019t changed anything\u2014unless she counted how fast he ran out on her. Evidently actions didn\u2019t speak louder than words.</p><p>Maybe she should just be patient. Maybe now that she\u2019d made the first move, Cam would jump on board and take their flirtation to the next level. Or jump on her.</p><p>Domini just hoped it wouldn\u2019t take another two years.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Eight months later...</p><p>At times like these, Deputy Cameron McKay suspected his life would\u2019ve been easier if he\u2019d stayed a simple cowboy.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>He managed to stop the woman\u2019s wild right hook from connecting with the man\u2019s jaw. Grabbing her fist, he jerked her arms behind her back. \u201cAssault in front of an officer will get you tossed in jail tonight, Opal, guaranteed, so knock it off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you since you were in diapers, boy, don\u2019t you dare smart mouth me,\u201d Opal retorted.</p><p>Yep, riding the range alone, dealing with animals that didn\u2019t talk back...some days Cam regretted not taking the offer to join the family cattle business. His gun dug into his hip as he shifted off his bum leg to reach his cuffs.</p><p>\u201cOpal. Leave the poor deputy alone,\u201d the man behind him snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhy ain\u2019t you arresting him?\u201d Opal demanded. \u201cHe started it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not, you crazy old bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? He\u2019s calling me names again.\u201d</p><p>Cam glanced at the gray-haired man holding an ice pack to the goose egg on his forehead. \u201cNow, Ralph, you know I won\u2019t tolerate that kinda talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! Told you he\u2019d be on my side,\u201d Opal said gleefully.</p> <p>Ralph muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere are no \u2018sides\u2019 here, Opal. I haven\u2019t made an arrest. Yet. Not until someone tells me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d the couple said simultaneously, and started arguing simultaneously.</p><p>Cam tried to listen to the heated exchange, but the accusations flung back and forth had nothing to do with the issue at hand: Opal Stancil smacking Ralph, her husband of five decades, with her umbrella. Why Opal had an umbrella handy when Crook County had suffered from severe drought for the last ten years remained a mystery.</p><p>Domestic disturbance calls weren\u2019t a mystery or all that unusual. Most incidents were cleared up fairly quickly once the participants were forced to talk to each other in front of an unbiased third party.</p> <p>It also helped that Cam wore a gun.</p><p>But Opal and Ralph were too busy shouting to listen to each other, let alone him.</p><p>Cam let loose an ear-piercing whistle. \u201cI\u2019m out of patience. Ralph, since you\u2019re injured, you can ride up front with me. Opal, I\u2019m gonna have to cuff you and you\u2019ll ride in the back.\u201d</p><p>More silence. Then a meek, \u201cYou mean, you\u2019re gonna arrest us? Both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cam waited. Rumor in the Crook County Sheriff\u2019s office was Opal and Ralph repeated this same row on their anniversary, every summer, going back fifty-four years. But as there were no arrest records, none of his fellow officers would confirm or deny. They\u2019d just laughed when the call came in on his rotation.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stomach the idea of her goin\u2019 to the hoosegow.\u201d Ralph lowered the ice pack and dropped his double chin to his chest. \u201cAw, Opal, you know I didn\u2019t mean it when I said I wished I woulda married Marion Lutter. She ain\u2019t never held a candle to you in the looks department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she can\u2019t cook worth a damn either,\u201d Opal said.</p><p>\u201cMakes you wonder how she\u2019s so gol-durned, fat, huh?\u201d Ralph peeped at her, wearing a hangdog look.</p> <p>Opal cackled. \u201cYou\u2019re so bad, C-bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, snooker-pie. I shoulda stayed outta the whiskey on our special night,\u201d Ralph said.</p><p>C-bear? Snooker-pie? Sweet baby Jesus. He\u2019d rather jam sticks in his ears than listen to geriatric foreplay.</p><p>\u201cGood thing my aim ain\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that.\u201d Ralph squinted at Cam. \u201cI reckon you can let her go now, Deputy, since I ain\u2019t pressing charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Ralph patted the floral couch cushion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on over here, my bee-yoo-ti-ful blushin\u2019 bride, so we can kiss and make up proper?\u201d</p><p>Opal blew Ralph a kiss. \u201cGive me a minute to see him out.\u201d She practically shoved Cam off the porch. \u201cSorry to trouble you, Deputy. Say hello to your folks from us.\u201d</p><p>Then she slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Stunned, Cam stood on the steps. But when giggles, grunts and the sounds of slapping flesh drifted through the living room window, he practically ran to his patrol car.</p><p>Dust kicked up behind him as he drove away. Fast. His radio crackled before he\u2019d gone too far. \u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy, this is dispatch. Do you need backup for...snooker-pie and C-bear?\u201d Deep belly laughs and kissing noises echoed in the background.</p><p>Assholes.</p><p>Mindful of being on the radio where anyone with a scanner could hear his response, Cam said, \u201cThat\u2019s a ten-four,\u201d rather than his usual, \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne other thing. This just came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a situation over at the Twin Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like a bar fight.\u201d</p><p>It figured. Nothing cowboys liked better than a good fight. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Cam spun a U-turn. Maybe he\u2019d stick around for a stiff drink after he broke up the brawl. God knew he needed one now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s toast.\u201d Keely McKay held her bottle of Bud Light to the center of the table. \u201cTo Hudson McKay, the newest addition to the family. The darling boy of Colt and Indy. He\u2019s beautiful and healthy, but damn, do I wish one of ya\u2019ll would birth me a niece.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rang out as bottles and glasses chinked together.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing we need is another wild McKay girl,\u201d Skylar said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut nine boys in a row? Ten, if I count Chassie\u2019s precious Westin? Come on. There\u2019s something in the water in Sundance for sure.\u201d Keely skewered her sisters in law, Channing, Macie and AJ, with a look. \u201cMaybe ya\u2019ll oughta grab your collective spouses\u2014my beloved brothers\u2014and head over to Moorcroft for a night or two when you plan on getting knocked up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue, Keely McKay,\u201d AJ replied haughtily.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. We\u2019re done for a while,\u201d Macie said. \u201cA long while.\u201d</p><p>Channing piped in, \u201cUs too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. If you three aren\u2019t pregnant again by the end of the year I\u2019ll kiss a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Remember not all pigs are of the bovine variety.\u201d Keely grinned and downed her beer.</p><p>Domini sipped her rum and Coke, secretly pleased to be included in the first annual \u201cCowgirl\u2019s Night Out\u201d, the brainchild of wild child Keely.</p><p>Keely had arranged the shindig at a semi-private table in the back room, inviting her brother\u2019s wives, Channing, Macie, AJ and India, as well as her cousin Kade\u2019s wife, Skylar. Domini didn\u2019t know Quinn McKay\u2019s wife, Libby, or Luke\u2019s wife, Jessie. Poor Jessie appeared as wide-eyed as Domini felt.</p><p>In addition to Keely\u2019s cousins, Chassie West Glanzer and Ramona West, the group included Ginger Paulson, a local attorney who was pals with Libby and Dr. Joely Monroe. Domini was grateful the chatty doc sat on the other side of the table. The woman had rubbed her the wrong way from the first time they\u2019d met.</p><p>Wrong. You\u2019re just jealous because you think she\u2019s been rubbing on Cam McKay, not in an official medical capacity, even when he claims they\u2019re just friends.</p><p>Yeah, Cam was friends with everyone it seemed.</p><p>Cam. He\u2019d rocked her world with that stunningly passionate kiss months ago. Since then? Nothing. Deputy McKay still showed up at Dewey\u2019s every day, friendly as ever. Her own hide-in-the-kitchen reaction bothered her more than his nonchalance. Why couldn\u2019t she just buck up and proposition him?</p><p>Because you made the first move last time and he scampered away like a scalded cat. Obviously he\u2019s not interested in you. Get over it and move on.</p><p>Stupid voice of reason. She scowled at her drink, wishing it were pure rum.</p><p>India warned, \u201cSlap on a happy face, Domini, or Keely will whip out the party games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Keely and Carolyn have this bizarre fixation on forcing everyone to play games at family gatherings. God save us from suffering though another round of \u2018pin the dick on the cowboy\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey really play that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Keely\u2019s in charge we do.\u201d</p><p>Domini beamed a totally fake smile at India. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Just keep it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you guys conspiring against?\u201d Macie demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo one. Just having a rip roarin\u2019 good \u2019ol time,\u201d India answered.</p><p>Domini\u2019s toothy grin widened and she gave Macie two thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you two are up to. This is fun.\u201d Macie downed her drink. \u201cIt\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve been out with adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a place without placemats to color on and balloons bobbing everywhere,\u201d Channing added.</p><p>\u201cOh pooh, you guys wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d Keely inserted. \u201cAm I right?\u201d She elbowed AJ, who\u2019d just knocked back another shot.</p><p>\u201cTotally. I love my guys, but I forced myself not to skip out the door because I was so looking forward to this girl\u2019s night. Damn this is good. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cherry bomb. Blake got me hooked on them over at the Rusty Spur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Blake like living in Nebraska?\u201d Doc Monroe asked Keely.</p><p>\u201cYep. He\u2019s bought into his buddy\u2019s bar. He\u2019s head over heels in love with Willow. She\u2019s a real firecracker. When he returned to load up his stuff, I\u2019ve never seen him more...content. He deserves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Ramona West said, lifting her glass.</p><p>Keely ordered another round in Blake\u2019s honor and insisted everyone but India drink up.</p><p>Everyone bowed to Keely\u2019s will. Keely McKay was a force to be reckoned with, a whirlwind of fun, a woman who seized life by the balls and did whatever struck her fancy. Not for the first time Domini wished she could be more like Keely. Freer. Looser. Bolder. Willing to go after what she wanted.</p><p>Willing to go after Cam.</p><p>Right. Like that\u2019d ever happen. Domini had overcome many things in her life; unfortunately, shyness wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Someone cranked the music. They all got up and danced, the booze and the laughter flowed freely as they cut loose. But even a semi-private room didn\u2019t stop every cowboy in the place from sauntering over to flirt with Keely, who flirted right back. Easily. With complete confidence. Domini could hate her if she wasn\u2019t so much fun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Keely tucked away yet another hot cowboy\u2019s phone number into her jeans pocket, Chassie said, \u201cYou\u2019re so bad.\u201d</p><p>The bad girl batted her eyelashes. \u201cWhy, whatever do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many men do you have on a string right now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming from a woman who lives with two guys,\u201d Keely shot back.</p><p>\u201cOoh.

But most of us here do have babies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you, Jessie?\u201d Skylar asked. \u201cYou and Luke talked about kids?\u201d</p><p>Jessie shrugged. \u201cOff and on. We\u2019re \u2018off\u2019 right now. We\u2019ve got some really cute baby llamas. You should bring the girls over to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLlamas?\u201d Domini repeated.</p><p>\u201cJessie was the saving grace for the llamas Chase won in some rodeo last fall. He dumped them off with his folks and expected Charlie and Vi to take care of them.\u201d Libby pointed with her beer bottle. \u201cGood thing your father-in-law didn\u2019t get his way. Quinn said he was pissed you kept them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper is always pissed off at me about something I\u2019ve done. Or not done.\u201d She frowned, dipping her head toward her drink so her hair obscured her face.</p><p>As the time and drinks passed, Domini couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d had such a blast. Even India, who rarely set foot in a bar/supper club, was still hanging out two hours later.</p> <p>Domini heard her name and broke her conversation with Jessie to focus on Skylar and India.</p><p>\u201cEven if you are my sister, and I love your offbeat sense of humor, you can be mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen am I ever mean?\u201d India demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did to Kade was mean,\u201d Skylar chided. \u201cKade actually told people that Domini was a refugee because she was kicked out of Bosnia for political persecution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Kade embellished it, claiming she barely spoke English, so any shit he got for sharing misinformation was well deserved,\u201d India retorted. \u201cAnd people around here don\u2019t know the difference between Bosnia, the Ukraine and Timbuktu. A foreigner is a foreigner.\u201d</p><p>How true that was. Because Domini had shared a house with her friend Nadia, who\u2019d emigrated from Bosnia, everyone assumed they were from the same country. Everyone except for Cam. Cam had pegged Domini\u2019s accent and country of origin right away. Not that it meant anything.</p><p>\u201cKade wasn\u2019t the only one India pranked. She told Lettie from the Golden Boot that Domini was a dethroned Russian princess and to never say the word vodka in front of her or she\u2019d burst into tears and go on a bloody rampage.\u201d</p><p>Domini smiled. That\u2019d been a good one. In fact, that\u2019s why Cam had taken to calling her princess\u2014a nickname that\u2019d stuck even after he\u2019d ferreted out the truth.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t as bad as what she told Dewey.\u201d Macie leaned forward. \u201cIndia swore Domini was a former Soviet spy posing as a chef. And she was in Wyoming hiding from her checkered, murderous past with the Russian mob.\u201d</p><p>India snorted. \u201cCome on, can you blame me? People were gossiping about her. I just made the gossip more...colorful. I added a virtual tattoo to her, if you will.\u201d</p><p>Skylar groaned. \u201cDoes everybody have to be tattooed in your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It makes the world so much more colorful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anybody ever guessed the truth?\u201d Jessie asked. \u201cOr does everyone believe you\u2019re a deposed Russian princess who used to be a knife-wielding Soviet spy and who was kicked out of Bosnia?\u201d</p><p>Domini squirmed at their curious looks and being the rare center of attention. \u201cIf they ask I tell them I immigrated to the U.S. from the Ukraine with a church group when I was eighteen, which is the boring truth. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t mind when India created a more dynamic...virtual tattoo for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t make up a tale about your past as a hot Ukrainian mail-order bride,\u201d India said.</p><p>Dr. Monroe\u2019s pager went off and she bailed. Then Jessie turned milk pale when a group of women blustered into the restaurant and insisted on departing immediately. Skylar begged off since she had the longest drive. Libby was the next to take her leave.</p><p>Keely sighed. \u201cLooks like things are winding down. Maybe I should take\u2014\u201d she dug in her pocket for the folded piece of paper, \u201c\u2014Davis up on his offer of a midnight rendezvous. It really sucks goin\u2019 home alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Ramona said. \u201cAlthough, I imagine I go home alone way more nights than you do, little cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised if you knew how untrue that statement was in the last two years,\u201d Keely said softly. \u201cEspecially since I don\u2019t have a place of my own to go home to when I\u2019m in Sundance. I\u2019m pretty sure Dad would disembowel any man he found me havin\u2019 wild monkey sex with in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beat you both,\u201d Domini said. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone home with any man since I moved to Sundance and I\u2019ve never had wild monkey sex.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Shoot. Maybe she should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut.</p><p>Keely\u2019s brooding expression vanished. \u201cSo nothin\u2019s goin\u2019 on between you and Cam? Not even a fuck buddy type thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely!\u201d Macie said.</p><p>\u201cIgnore her.\u201d AJ added, \u201cWe all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Domini, I\u2019m serious. Whenever I\u2019m in the diner with Cam, he can\u2019t keep his eyes off you. And you do some serious staring and stammering of your own. So what gives?\u201d She paused thoughtfully. \u201cDoes his handicap bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely!\u201d that protest came from Channing.</p><p>But Keely ignored her sister-in-law, focusing intently on Domini. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s a little bit attractive?\u201d</p><p>Domini nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d Domini said evenly.</p><p>The air went still.</p><p>\u201cGet out. Big, bad, bold, take charge Cam...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuns as hot and cold as the broken pie case when it comes to our comrade Domini,\u201d Macie said wryly.</p><p>Keely rolled her eyes. \u201cI hoped I\u2019d have a least one brother who wasn\u2019t a complete bonehead when it came to women.\u201d</p><p>Channing, Macie, AJ and India pelted Keely with snack mix and booed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Cam that he\u2019s shied away from you? \u2019Cause, honey, you\u2019re gorgeous. And sweet. Plus, you have that sexy, mysterious accent. Hell, you can even cook. You\u2019re like, perfect for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, leave Domini alone,\u201d India warned.</p><p>But Keely was undeterred. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in the down and dirty details, Indy, maybe you oughta conjure an I-just-got-laid virtual tattoo for her,\u201d Keely retorted. \u201cHowever, I wanna know why she and Cam aren\u2019t knocking combat boots.\u201d</p><p>There was no way Domini was avoiding this conversation. Maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing. Despite her embarrassment, she told them how Cam had backtracked after he\u2019d kissed her, apologized and never approached her again.</p><p>Another bout of silence lasted a minute and then they all chattered at once.</p><p>\u201cCam\u2019s got it bad for sure,\u201d Chassie said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. No wonder he\u2019s always working out. Working off all that sexual frustration,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>Ginger Paulson cocked her head. \u201cIs that why Cam passed off the cooking lessons he won from you to Buck and Hayden? Because he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014cringes at the thought of being alone with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a better explanation is he\u2019s scared he won\u2019t be able to keep his hands off you if you\u2019re alone together,\u201d Ginger countered.</p><p>Keely squinted at India. \u201cHas Cam said anything to Colt about this thing with Domini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Guy talk is sacred. Colt wouldn\u2019t tell me anything, especially when it comes to divulging details about his precious little wounded hero brother, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>AJ nodded. \u201cCam isn\u2019t talking to Cord about anything either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr to Colby,\u201d Channing added.</p><p>Wow. Maybe Cam\u2019s rejection had nothing to do with her. Sounds like he steered clear of his family too, which made no sense because his family was great.</p><p>\u201cPut Carter on the \u2018no talking\u2019 list. However, I\u2019m impressed you\u2019ve managed to stay professional around him at the diner, Domini,\u201d Macie said.</p><p>\u201cReal professional. I want to jump that man every single time he walks through the door,\u201d Domini muttered.</p><p>Ramona grinned. \u201cSo do it. Grab him by the hand, drag him upstairs and force him to finish what he started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Keely mused. \u201cYou\u2019re a modern woman. Take control.\u201d</p><p>Domini understood what these helpful, experienced ladies were saying...in theory. But the truth was, she needed Cam to take charge. That\u2019s what had attracted her to him from the start. His bold, bossy nature.</p><p>Advice was bantered about. Keely angled forward and spoke very softly just to Domini. \u201cI\u2019ll bet a million bucks you both want the same thing. Cam is staying away from you in some misguided attempt to protect you\u2014probably from himself. Tell him what you need, Domini, and he\u2019ll move heaven and earth to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t believe me?\u201d Or want me?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where actions speak louder than words. Never ever underestimate the power of getting naked. Get him alone, strip to nothin\u2019 but skin, and I guarantee he won\u2019t look away, let alone walk away.\u201d Keely scowled at someone over Domini\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs Cam on duty tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d Keely pointed to Domini\u2019s empty glass. \u201cYou ready for another drink? Something with more kick to it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bizarre conversational change, but then again, it was typical Keely behavior, so Domini went with it. \u201cUmm. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. What the hell happened to our waitress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered the same thing, K,\u201d Ramona said.</p> <p>\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Keely popped up and exited into the main part of the bar.</p><p>While she was gone, the ladies dispensed more detailed advice on how to handle Cam. Some of the raunchier suggestions made Domini blush, but were very intriguing. Mostly because these seemingly mild-mannered mothers were obviously very sexually satisfied with their McKay men. Hard not to be even more jealous of them.</p><p>Keely returned with a pack of unfriendly women on her bootheels. She slid the tray on the table and faced the gatecrashers.</p><p>Ramona hopped up in a show of support. \u201cWhat the fuck are they doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrazing,\u201d Keely said.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is where the skank meeting is,\u201d a chubby blonde sneered.</p><p>\u201cWe saved a seat for you, Amanda, but damn, I don\u2019t think your fat ass will fit in the chair,\u201d Keely shot back.</p><p>India coughed to cover a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou could always get on your knees,\u201d Ramona suggested, \u201csince we all know that\u2019s a natural position for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ramona. Your mouth has always been bigger than your brain,\u201d another woman snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m all talk, Margo? Try me.\u201d</p> <p>Holy cow. Domini had never seen a real live bar fight, let alone seen women in a bar fight.</p><p>The sneering blonde\u2014Amanda\u2014crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019d still break you like a twig. I\u2019ll spare you the pain and humiliation in front of your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerous of you. But you\u2019re a fucking idiot if you think I\u2019m scared of you now. I no longer play nice because God and Mommy say I have to.\u201d</p><p>Domini swallowed a laugh. Man. She\u2019d lived that statement.</p><p>Amanda shuffled closer. \u201cBring it. I owe you serious payback anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayback for what?\u201d Ramona asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019ve forgotten, after you rubbed it in my face for months afterward.\u201d</p><p>Ramona shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that you haven\u2019t gotten over it by now. Old news, Amanda.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGotten over what?\u201d Ginger asked.</p><p>\u201cMe and Ramona banged their boyfriends a couple years back,\u201d Keely said. \u201cSome people hold a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan and me were practically engaged!\u201d Margo shrieked.</p><p>\u201cNot according to him. Besides, it\u2019s not my problem your lover boy couldn\u2019t keep his little winky in his pants,\u201d Ramona cooed.</p><p>Amanda\u2019s upper lip curled with disgust. \u201cSluts.\u201d</p><p>Keely and Ramona exchanged a look and laughed. \u201cWas that supposed to be an insult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a McKay would take that as a compliment,\u201d Margo said. \u201cEveryone in the entire state knows a McKay or West will fuck anything that walks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for you, apparently,\u201d Keely retorted. \u201cHow many of my brothers and cousins have you propositioned? And how many turned you down flat? All of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all.\u201d Margo smiled nastily. \u201cApparently you haven\u2019t been talking to Luke lately. Where is sweet little Jessie? Did she run on home? Does she even know where her husband is?\u201d</p><p>The group of women behind the two in the front guffawed.</p><p>Keely\u2019s stance changed, as did her demeanor\u2014to absolute fury. \u201cGet the fuck out of my sight, Margo, or I will beat you bloody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. The odds look pretty good.\u201d Margo\u2019s gaze swept the women seated around the table. \u201cNone of your other \u2018friends\u2019 have jumped in to save your smart mouth from getting your dumb butt kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Keely knows we have her back,\u201d AJ said, and stood up on the other side of Keely.</p><p>Amanda\u2019s eyes widened with recognition. \u201cAmy Jo Foster. Still a McKay hanger-on I see. How pathetic.\u201d</p><p>Chassie pushed to her feet. \u201cNo one here gives a shit about your opinions, so crawl back to the swamp you slithered out of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the little squaw is allowed to speak?\u201d Margo tsk-tsked. \u201cBut I see they\u2019re still makin\u2019 you sit at the back of the table.\u201d</p><p>Domini caught Chassie as she lunged at Margo.</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you load up your freakshow friends\u2014\u201d Margo jerked her head toward India, \u201c\u2014and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t budge. \u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that when you\u2019re cryin\u2019 for your mama, McKay.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>This was going to get ugly.</p><p>\u201cAfraid to take the first swing?\u201d Margo taunted.</p><p>Casually, Ginger said, \u201cKeely? Can I offer a suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick her ass. I\u2019ll bail you out.\u201d</p><p>All hell broke loose.</p><p>Keely lunged for Margo; Ramona charged Amanda. Chairs were kicked aside. Tables fell over. Drink glasses and beer bottles crashed to the floor. Shrieks, grunts, sounds of flesh hitting flesh, cries and curses bounced off the concrete walls.</p><p>AJ, Chassie, and India yelled encouragement to Keely, while Domini, Channing, and Macie closed off the circle, keeping Margo\u2019s friends from joining the fray.</p><p>Someone pushed Domini from behind. She turned and got a fist to the jaw. Rather than turning the other cheek, she slammed her hands on the woman\u2019s shoulders and sent her flying with a terse, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Macie said, \u201cWhoa. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Domini touched the spot and winced. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The fight didn\u2019t last long. The noise brought staff running from the restaurant to break it up.</p><p>But not before Keely McKay beat the living crap out of Margo. Margo\u2019s hair stuck up every which way. Her shirt was ripped. Her mouth was bleeding. She\u2019d curled into a ball on the floor. And she was crying, not Keely.</p><p>Ramona had pinned Amanda\u2019s arms behind her back. Some man separated them and immediately herded Ramona through the wall of people between the two warring groups.</p><p>When Keely wobbled backward, her head smacked into Domini\u2019s jaw and Domini sucked in a surprised breath. Holy crap that hurt.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit.\u201d Domini snagged a napkin and handed it to Keely. \u201cYour nose is bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Keely half swayed, half fell to the floor. She patted the open space. \u201cFirst bar fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Domini hunkered down next to her.</p><p>\u201cThey get easier.\u201d When Keely tried to smile, she hissed in a breath and blood trickled out of her mouth. \u201cDamn. I\u2019m getting to old for this shit.\u201d</p><p>The room buzzed with confusion and excitement.</p><p>Ramona ambled over, a shit-eating grin on her face, still looking as if she\u2019d just stepped out of a western fashion magazine. Not a wrinkle on her clothes, not an auburn curl out of place. Her brown eyes sparkled with victory. \u201cYou okay, cuz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been better. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. I\u2019ve been wanting to do that forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Felt good. Damn good. And we\u2019re the ones who owed them payback.\u201d</p><p>At Domini\u2019s quizzical look, Keely explained, \u201cThis rivalry has been going on forever. We didn\u2019t go to the same school but we attended the same church. Summer church camp was torture. Our moms forced us to go every year until we got kicked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys were kicked out of church camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Keely and Ramona high-fived each other.</p><p>\u201cFighting with them was totally worth whatever time we spend in jail.\u201d</p><p>Keely scowled at Ramona. \u201cJail? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be goddamn lucky if hauling you to jail is all I do to you, little sis.\u201d</p><p>Domini looked up.</p><p>An infuriated Cam loomed over them.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cI can explain,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>Cam held up his hand. \u201cSave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot another word, Keely West McKay, or so help me God, I will cuff you and gag you.\u201d</p><p>Ramona snickered.</p><p>He whirled on her. \u201cGot something to say, Miz West?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, cuz. Umm. I mean, no, sir, Deputy, sir.\u201d Ramona snapped to attention and mimed zipping her lip.</p><p>Chassie giggled.</p><p>Cam\u2019s gaze encompassed the motley crew of women, who were trying very hard to look...sober. \u201cSweet Jesus. Are you all drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. It was a party. We\u2019re in a bar. You do the math,\u201d Keely responded with a loud hiccup.</p><p>Which sent them all into gales of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d India said.</p><p>AJ waggled her fingers. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Macie laughed. \u201cThose cherry bombs were the bomb, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Channing swayed as she craned her neck to look toward the bar. \u201cThink we can have one more for the road? To toast Keely\u2019s victory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is sucking down any more booze,\u201d Cam barked. He glared at Domini. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>His gaze landed on a bump on Domini\u2019s jaw. Briefly his focus jumped to her succulent mouth\u2014bad idea\u2014and lust squeezed his balls. \u201cWere you in on this bar fight too?\u201d</p><p>Those full pink lips flattened. Those aquamarine eyes became chips of ice. \u201cNever confuse being soft-spoken with being weak-willed. I stand up for my friends. I don\u2019t run away.\u201d</p><p>A female chorus of ooooh rang out.</p><p>\u201cFine. All of you stay here while I straighten this out.\u201d He tossed a quick look over his shoulder and dropped his voice. \u201cAnd off the record? Thanks a helluva lot. You think I wanna call my brothers and tell them their wives got drunk and were in a bar fight tonight? While I was on duty?\u201d</p><p>Silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then they descended on Cam like a pack of hyenas.</p><p>AJ drilled him in the chest with her finger. \u201cFYI Deputy McKay, I\u2019m a big girl.

Now they were outnumbered.</p> <p>Cam stalked off, but not before he heard another round of high fives and drunken whoops of victory.</p><p>No one pressed charges, no surprise. It didn\u2019t take long to assess the damages. He handed his sister a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re keeping your deposit for the party and you\u2019ve been banned from Twin Pines indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged and folded the paper. \u201cThe food sucks here anyway. And if Margo and Amanda are regular customers? Then their clientele sucks too.\u201d</p><p>Cam took India aside. \u201cBein\u2019s you\u2019re sober, can you get the rest of your sisters in drunken arms home? Since I\u2019ve been barred from calling their husbands to pick them up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll take Chass too, since we\u2019re neighbors.\u201d India\u2019s gaze flicked between Cam and Domini. \u201cYou\u2019ll make sure if Domini\u2019s walking home she gets there all right?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cDomini ain\u2019t walking home. She\u2019s riding with me when I drop Keely and Ginger off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have witnesses I didn\u2019t kill my baby sis and dump her body out in the boondocks for her latest stunt.\u201d</p><p>India whistled, directing the women riding in her SUV to the side door. She scorched Cam with a look. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Cameron McKay. You\u2019ve been fucking with her head long enough. Either go for it, or let her go. But it\u2019s selfish to try and have it both ways.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response, but spun on her heel and left.</p><p>No explanation necessary. Only one woman had him tied up in knots. His gaze automatically sought her out.</p><p>Domini was already staring at him.</p><p>He crooked his finger at her.</p> <p>She sauntered over without delay. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Cam had a hard time breathing when she looked at him like that. Like she\u2019d do anything he asked her. Anything he demanded of her. His gaze roamed over her pretty face, she could be a princess with her regal looks: jutting cheekbones, a high forehead, a thin nose and a delicate jaw. Pale skin, pale eyes, pale hair. Domini should look washed out. She should blend into the background. But she didn\u2019t\u2014she was a beacon of light and beauty in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cCam? Can I go now?\u201d</p><p>He refocused on her arctic blue eyes. \u201cNo. You\u2019re riding with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk home. Unless there\u2019s a law against that?\u201d</p><p>God. Her voice alone could bring him to the edge of ecstasy. The measured enunciation, accented with the sexy, husky hint of her native tongue. Did she cry out in English when she came? Or in Ukrainian?</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Keely and Ginger waited by the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ramona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe caught a ride from a friend.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Cam opened the rear door of the patrol car. \u201cYou two are in the back.\u201d</p><p>Ginger climbed in without objection. Not his mouthy baby sister. Her protest, \u201cHey! That\u2019s not f\u2014\u201d was lost in the cab as Cam slammed the door.</p><p>Smiling, he shoved his key in the door lock on the passenger\u2019s side. His belly jumped when Domini placed her hand on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cI can open my own door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a key you can\u2019t. It\u2019s self-locking for security reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Cam glanced at the stubborn slant of her mouth. His gut twisted seeing the bump on her jaw. Without thinking, he cupped her neck, stroking his thumb across the swollen spot. \u201cNext time, stay out of the line of fire, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a direct order, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lightly swept over the protrusion again, just because he could. \u201cI\u2019m bossy. It\u2019s a habit, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you. How easily you take charge.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away even when his head screamed retreat and his dick pulsed against his zipper.</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t look away either. \u201cDoes it mean anything? You touching me like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>God help me, I don\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to mean something, Domini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her lashes fluttered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s liquid courage allowing me to say this, but do you know how many times I\u2019ve imagined the different ways you\u2019d touch me? Softly. Firmly. Sweetly. Roughly.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s heart beat a million times faster. He wanted to pull her closer and devour her mouth. He wanted to trace her every curve, with meticulous attention to every dip and hollow. He wanted to see her elegant fingers mapping his body with equal curiosity.</p><p>Four loud smacks on the rear window brought him back to reality. He reluctantly let his hand fall from her face and opened Domini\u2019s door.</p><p>Ginger and Keely gabbed nonstop during the ride. Domini didn\u2019t say a word, choosing to gaze out the window into the darkness, her hands primly folded in her lap, the picture of sweetness. Of innocence. Of perfection. Of total fucking hotness.</p><p>That\u2019s what I like about you. How easily you take charge.</p><p>He half feared, half hoped she\u2019d been telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cTurn here,\u201d Ginger said.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s one-level ranch house had a detached garage off to one side and a wheelchair ramp running the perimeter. The sight of that wheelchair ramp caused Cam\u2019s stump to twitch and the word never to echo in his head.</p><p>Keely said, \u201cHey. Isn\u2019t that Buck\u2019s rig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yes. But he\u2019s supposed to be camping with Hayden.\u201d Ginger yanked on the door handle. \u201cGoddammit let me out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Cam shifted his weight, getting out of the vehicle with his bum leg was harder than climbing in. By the time he\u2019d opened the door, Buck met them in front of the patrol car.</p><p>Ginger nearly plowed Buck over. \u201cWhere is he? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Buck set his hands on Ginger\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhoa there, Red, settle down. Everything is fine. Hayden\u2019s stomach was actin\u2019 up again, so we canned the campin\u2019 trip. No biggie. I gave him some 7-Up and soda crackers. He\u2019s sleeping in his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden was worried about you. He said you never go out. He made a big ruckus about the never part of it.\u201d</p><p>She muttered, \u201cThat little tattletale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I promised him I\u2019d wait until you were home safely.\u201d Buck glanced at the patrol car. \u201cMaybe you oughta tell me why my cousin is bringing you home in a cop car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a little liquid fun with your cousin\u2019s wives and then there was this bar fight...\u201d</p><p>Buck squinted. \u201cIs that Keely waving at me through the cage?\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen that explains everything. Thanks for bringing Red back. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d Buck steered Ginger toward the porch. She tried to jerk away from his hold, but he just yanked her flush with his body and spoke in her ear.</p><p>The second Cam was back in his patrol car, Keely bombarded him with excuses, explanations, and justifications, until he said, \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>She sighed despairingly. \u201cLook. I know you\u2019re mad as hell at me right now, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I have no right to ask this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019ve no right to ask me...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a favor.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Keely spoke through the steel cage. \u201cEven though I\u2019m an adult, if I show up drunk, bloody and bruised at Mom and Dad\u2019s, they\u2019ll both have a fit. It\u2019ll be a big ugly scene and I cannot deal with it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you expect me to do? Run interference for you, Miz Adult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Let me stay at your place. Please? Just for one night? I\u2019m so tired I\u2019ll probably crash and I promise I won\u2019t be any trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble follows you everywhere, so no dice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that your house is your haven, but Cam, you have an extra bedroom that no one uses. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini, help me out here,\u201d Keely pleaded.</p><p>Domini faced him. \u201cI think you should listen to her since she is letting you off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is allowing her to crash at my place letting me off the hook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you just dump her off at your parent\u2019s place, they\u2019ll be angry you didn\u2019t come in and explain why Keely is a drunken mess. If you escort her into the house, your parents will still be angry and expect you to explain why she\u2019s a drunken mess. So calling them to say she\u2019s staying with you is the best solution all around.\u201d</p><p>Damn women sticking together.</p><p>\u201cSee? It makes perfect sense,\u201d Keely said. \u201cExcept I\u2019m not that much of a drunken mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam? Please? I\u2019ll never ask you for anything ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He gave in. He always did when it came to Keely. \u201cFine. You can stay one night. But if one thing is out of place in my house, or if I see any other person besides you in my home? I will tell everyone in the family and the whole damn county what I saw at Colt and Indy\u2019s wedding reception.\u201d</p> <p>Keely gasped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I most definitely would. With absolute glee.\u201d Cam flashed her a cocky grin. \u201cSo do we have a deal, little sis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I am entitled to point out you\u2019re a lot meaner than my other brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just not buffaloed as easily as they are.\u201d</p><p>Keely harrumphed and remained unusually quiet for the rest of the drive.</p> <p>When Cam pulled up the driveway leading to his house, he experienced a sense of joy, a swell of pride, a feeling of peace. This place was the first thing he\u2019d owned outright, finally obtaining the space, freedom and solitude he\u2019d given up during his years in the army. He\u2019d spent his adult years living in barracks or in tents with just a cot and a footlocker to call his own. Meals, showers, hell even sleep was a group affair.</p><p>Not here. Cam rarely had visitors and he preferred it that way. Sometimes on his days off he stretched out on his couch and stared at the walls in complete silence just because he could. He\u2019d created an island of peace for himself even surrounded by the turbulent sea of his family.</p><p>He parked on the concrete slab and the yard light clicked on. His dog, Gracie, raced back and forth along the fence, yipping with excitement. Cam turned to Domini. \u201cSit tight. I\u2019ll be right back and then I\u2019ll run you home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same could be said about me, Deputy,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>Was that a...challenge? From sweet Domini?</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna let me out, or what?\u201d Keely complained. \u201cI hafta piss like a racehorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy, Keely.\u201d Grumbling under his breath, Cam exited the car quickly, wincing at the sharp pain in his hip. Upon opening the rear door, he heard, \u201c\u2014what I said about getting naked.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t ask what Keely is babbling about. You\u2019re better off if you don\u2019t know.</p><p>At the front door he rattled off, \u201cStay out of my room. Stay out of my bathroom. Stay out of the liquor cabinet. Don\u2019t fuck with my TV. Leave Gracie outside. I\u2019ll deal with her when I get home in a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you hurry back, bro. I can take care of Gracie.\u201d Keely stepped into the foyer. \u201cIn fact, I hope I don\u2019t see you until well after the sun rises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and slammed the door in his face.</p> <p>Cam counted to ten and backtracked to the car. He took his time getting in, not because he was stalling, but because his stump was starting to chafe inside the socket.</p><p>As soon as they were on the paved road, Domini said, \u201cIs your leg hurting?\u201d</p><p>How had she picked up on that so fast? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think so, bein\u2019s half of the damn thing is gone.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you off duty now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been off since I finished up at Twin Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not.</p><p>The conversation died. Cam flipped on the defroster. Why was his windshield fogging up at the end of freakin\u2019 August?</p><p>Because Domini Katzinski is smokin\u2019 hot. She makes your heart pound. She makes you sweat. She makes you breathe hard. She makes you imagine what it\u2019d be like pounding into her, both of you covered in sweat as you breathe in the scent of her.</p><p>Dammit. Think of something else. Do something else.</p><p>He fiddled with the police radio. Then he drummed his fingers on the dash.</p><p>Domini placed her cool palm over his knuckles.</p><p>Cam looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I make you nervous, deputy?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you constantly fuss whenever you\u2019re around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn annoying habit.\u201d She threaded her soft fingers through his until her palm rested on the back of his hand. \u201cCan you keep still now?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. But he didn\u2019t remove his hand. Actually, he was shocked she\u2019d touched him so freely. Domini was usually so...reserved.</p><p>Normally silence didn\u2019t bother him, in fact, Cam preferred it. But tonight, he wanted to talk, if only to hear her voice. \u201cDid you have fun before the cops showed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We danced and drank and gossiped. I\u2019ve never actually seen a bar fight.\u201d</p><p>Cam snorted. \u201cYou must not hang out with Keely much. That girl is always finding trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed pretty pleased she\u2019d popped my cherry tonight.\u201d</p><p>He nearly wrecked the car. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Domini blushed. \u201cIt was my first Wyoming bar brawl. Keely came up with the cherry-popping phrase, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt figures. I\u2019m curious. What else did you ladies gossip about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily. Babies. Men. Sex.\u201d Domini\u2019s gaze pierced him. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister asked if something was going on between us.\u201d</p><p>His stomach dropped at the thought of his family gossiping about him. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Cam eased the patrol car alongside her building.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I did say I wished something was going on between us.\u201d</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t know how to respond. Evidently saying nothing was the wrong response, because Domini attempted to bail out of the car.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah.\u201d Cam caught her wrist, holding her in place. \u201cWait just a damn minute. You don\u2019t get to say something like that and then just leave.\u201d</p><p>Domini just stared at him intently.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to start something with a gimped-up, scarred man like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I see when I look at you.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. This is what unnerved him about Domini. She saw too much. \u201cMaybe you need glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s blind.\u201d</p><p>He winced internally, but managed, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the fire in your eyes when you look at me, Cam. I feel it when you allow yourself to touch me. Yet, you won\u2019t take what you so badly want.\u201d Domini cocked her head. \u201cWhy? Are you a martyr? Or a masochist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I\u2019m just a man.\u201d Not even a whole man.</p><p>\u201cIf I begged you to prove your manhood to me you\u2019d run again, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Heat rose up his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You apologized first and then you ran. Which was way worse.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He had no idea how much she\u2019d misunderstood his reaction to her months ago. \u201cDomini, let me explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop right there.\u201d She drew away from him until her back rested against the door. \u201cNo more excuses. You either want me, or you don\u2019t. You will either come upstairs right now and we can explore this\u2014\u201d she gestured to the space between them, \u201c\u2014or you can drive away and we will never speak of it again.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s anger surfaced. \u201cAnd if I drive off, you\u2019ll what? Find another man?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulder hitched in a half-shrug. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarold Henderson is always flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever see that fucking pervert looking at any part of you, I\u2019ll gouge his goddamn eyes out,\u201d Cam snarled.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better add Deke Nealon to that list because he asked me to a movie last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arrested Deke before and got no problem doin\u2019 it again if he messes with you.\u201d His head spun. No one touched Domini but him. No one.</p><p>Really? You haven\u2019t been touching her either. She\u2019s supposed to wait around for you to get your head out of your ass?</p><p>India\u2019s comment, Either go for it, or let her go. But it\u2019s selfish to try and have it both ways, haunted him because he knew she was exactly right. The time had come for him to fish or cut bait, as Colt always said. \u201cWho else?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLast night Marshall Benson offered to take me to Ziggy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall Benson? He cheats at pool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. You going to arrest me too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, if it\u2019ll keep you from going out with a loser like him.\u201d Stay calm. \u201cWhat are you trying to do, Domini? Piss me off by naming all the guys who want to do you?\u201d</p><p>She jabbed her finger at him. \u201cYou asked, Deputy. And I\u2019m tired of waiting for you to come to terms with what you want to do to me. I especially want you to get over your mistaken belief that I am somehow...too fragile to handle you. I told you I like that you take charge, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really wanna see that side of me, princess? The rough man who expects his demands to be met without question or hesitation?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Lightning fast, Cam curled his hand around her neck and hauled her close enough to kiss. \u201cI don\u2019t play at this. It\u2019s not a phase, not bedroom games. This is who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that is who I want,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>His resistance shattered. \u201cI\u2019m giving you one last chance to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mind has been made up for a lot longer than yours has.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth on her ear and growled, \u201cGet upstairs. Get naked. Wait for me.\u201d</p><p>Domini slipped from the car with such grace and determination Cam wondered what he\u2019d gotten himself into.</p><p>After he plodded up the staircase, he stopped to catch his breath. Why could he run ten miles with no problem but a climb up a set of stairs made him ache like he\u2019d scaled Mt. Everest? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because you\u2019re a cripple.

She was beautiful. And even better, she was obedient. He grinned and crooked his finger at her.</p><p>Domini pushed to her feet and sauntered over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me to be.\u201d</p><p>He traced the line of her jaw down her throat. \u201cWhat are you thinking right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really here.\u201d The desire darkening her pale blue irises staggered him. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Cam gripped her shoulders and crushed his mouth to hers.</p><p>The sweet taste of mint teased his tongue as he dove straight in for a hungry, openmouthed kiss that was eight goddamn months overdue.</p><p>Domini wound her arms around his waist, kissing him back with greediness only matched by his. Her tongue dueled and retreated as she kissed him from every possible angle. Her fingertips dug into the muscles of his back.</p><p>As much as Cam ached to explore every inch of her sinuous body, first with his hands and then with his tongue, he had to demonstrate from the start his take-charge side was his real sexual side.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips meandered to her chin. He let his mouth skim the curve of her jaw, taking a minute to kiss the welt she\u2019d received at the bar.</p><p>Domini\u2019s soft moan stirred the air by his ear.</p><p>\u201cCouch. Now.\u201d</p><p>She laced their fingers together, not caring his left pinky was gone as she tugged him to the living room.</p> <p>Cam trailed his fingertips across her collarbone, then he took a step back until his right calf hit the bottom of the couch. He\u2019d already removed his gun and stashed it in the car. Next he unclipped the cuff pouch and tossed the handcuffs on the cushion behind him. Almost in slow motion, he pulled the end of the belt out of the first loop and released the buckle.</p><p>Her gaze never wavered from his crotch.</p><p>He unsnapped the button on the waistband of his uniform pants and eased the zipper down. Jesus. He needed relief; his dick had been straining against his pants for an hour. The two halves of fabric separated, exposing his white boxer briefs. He watched her expression change as she caught her first glimpse of his cock.</p><p>Cam kept his pants and briefs high on his upper thighs as he lowered to the couch, but he yanked them down his ass in the back. \u201cTurn around and put your wrists together.\u201d Two quick snaps and the handcuffs were locked behind her back. \u201cFace me.\u201d</p><p>She looked amazing completely naked, half bound and fully willing.</p><p>And she\u2019ll look damn good with your cock in her throat.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know. I received a clean bill of health last month when I was at the VA in Cheyenne. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t...been with anyone since I moved here from Denver a few years back.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cA bunch of real sorry guys around these parts who let a beautiful woman spend her nights alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you include yourself on that list, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Domini smiled serenely.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth on me. I don\u2019t care if you weren\u2019t the swallowing type before, because now, you are. On your knees.\u201d</p><p>She dropped between his thighs and Cam noticed she was careful not to bump his prosthesis. Or was she avoiding touching it entirely?</p><p>Shoving aside his doubts, Cam swept the hair from her flushed face, crushing the silky, fragrant strands in his hand. He wanted an unobstructed view of her mouth working him because he\u2019d fantasized about this for too damn long and he was damn impatient to have it all right fucking now. \u201cLick the head.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out and rimmed the tip, lapping at the bead of moisture gathered in the center. She suckled the ruddy head, flicking her rough tongue over the sweet spot.</p><p>Cam hissed. \u201cI like it wet. I wanna feel you sucking me all the way into your hot mouth. Slowly. Make it last.\u201d</p><p>She sucked. She licked. She used her teeth. Her tongue. Oh man, that wicked, naughty tongue might break him. She kept her lips tight around his shaft from tip to base. Saliva ran down her chin and neck as she bobbed her head. Over and over. Domini worked Cam over until he could barely see straight and his dick was ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cYou really do get off with me telling you what to do, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The affirmative noise vibrating in the back of her throat settled in his balls, drawing them up tight.</p><p>He traced the outline of her upper lip as his cock plunged in and out of that wet, suctioning heat. He lost track of the number of strokes but the buzz began in his balls and zipped up his abdomen. He shoved until her mouth was around the root.</p><p>Domini gagged.</p><p>\u201cBreathe through it, baby. Come on. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d relaxed her throat muscles, he pulled out halfway and rammed in again. Faster, but with shallow thrusts.</p><p>\u201cTighten your lips more. Fuck, that\u2019s good. Goddammit, here it comes.\u201d Lost in sensation, he plunged deep and hissed, \u201cSwallow. Now. All of it. Let your throat muscles work me.\u201d Cam kept his grip on her head as his seed pulsed out and she swallowed every spurt.</p><p>As he floated back to sanity, the arousing scent of her body drifted up. His hands fell away. His cock slipped from her mouth and he sagged into the couch cushions. Sweating. Breathing hard. Totally spent.</p><p>But nowhere near done.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Domini watched pleasure soften the harsh angles of Cam\u2019s face. She\u2019d fantasized about this moment, but fantasies paled in comparison to the reality of being bound and on her knees before this strong, sexy, demanding man.</p><p>Surrender created the rush she\u2019d been searching for.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Cam\u2019s big hands curled around her upper arms and he helped her to her feet. \u201cLemme touch you.\u201d</p><p>Please. Yes. Now. Everywhere.</p><p>He settled her high on his lap, a knee on either side of his hips.</p><p>His cock, still semi-erect, rested against his abdomen. The heat from his groin tempted her to grind hard into that thick shaft.</p><p>\u201cDomini. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze tracked the line of brass buttons from the bottom of his khaki uniform shirt to his face. His eyes were usually bright blue, but right now, those eyes were dark with lust.</p><p>Domini\u2019s heart rate accelerated.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hands glided down her arms, behind her back to her wrists. \u201cThe cuffs aren\u2019t chafing you?\u201d</p><p>Cuffs? What cuffs? Oh. Right. She was handcuffed. How had she forgotten that?</p><p>Because you were immersed in a blissful, sexual haze.</p><p>\u201cMy hands are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear. Although, we seemed to\u2019ve lost our momentum,\u201d Cam murmured. His fingers trailed beneath her bound arms. He spread his hands across her naked back and gently urged her forward.</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m falling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, but his lips didn\u2019t seek hers. His mouth zeroed in on her right nipple.</p><p>She gasped when his wet tongue flicked the tip. Again and again. She arched and began to rock into him, trying to connect her sex to his.</p><p>Cam lifted his mouth long enough to command, \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>How was she was supposed to stay still with the soft suction and heat of his hungry mouth? And the rasp of his five o\u2019clock shadow on her flesh?</p><p>\u201cYou are as perfect everywhere as I imagined.\u201d Cam lightly scraped his teeth over the beaded tip.</p><p>\u201cYou imagined me...naked?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head back. \u201cAll the damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together. Comprehension dawned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t honestly believe I wasn\u2019t attracted to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would you think that?\u201d</p><p>Because I redefine insecure. \u201cBecause you left after the one time you kissed me and never attempted to touch me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t attracted to you. That was out of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you thought I might hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. But I ain\u2019t exactly in the mood to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d</p><p>Then Cam was kissing her fiercely. One hand held her in place by the back of the neck. His other hand skimmed her torso and his fingers slipped straight between her legs.</p><p>Domini canted her hips, allowing him total access to whatever part he desired, giving him everything without having to ask.</p><p>Cam stroked her pussy with soft exploratory touches. He kissed a path to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re wet. Did you get off havin\u2019 my cock in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reconnected their lips as his middle finger swirled in the cream coating the mouth of her sex. He dragged that wet finger up and drew circles around her clit.</p><p>Domini\u2019s thighs clenched and she suppressed a moan.</p><p>As Cam\u2019s mouth languidly moved over hers, he pushed one finger inside her slick channel, then two. He pumped the digits deep, stretching her delicate tissues, while the base of his thumb continually rubbed against her clit.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt such urgency, yet didn\u2019t want the probing touches to end. The heat and fullness of his stroking fingers inflamed her as much as his lazy, seductive kisses.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips broke free and he nuzzled her throat. \u201cCome apart for me, Domini.\u201d More kisses sizzled across her skin as his fingers worked magic inside her. \u201cTell me what\u2019ll get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. Just...don\u2019t stop. Please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you beg for it\u2014\u201d he licked the cords straining in her neck, \u201c\u2014this time. Next time I\u2019d like to string you along and see how long it takes before you unravel.\u201d</p><p>His words rushed her to the next level of need. \u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. Arch back.\u201d</p> <p>His rhythmic fingers, his sucking kisses, his confidence in seeing to her pleasure, unlocked a place inside her she\u2019d never trusted another man to access. She closed her eyes and let go.</p><p>When the first searing ripple started, she tightened her thighs, her interior muscles, her butt cheeks and cried out as the strength of the orgasm sideswiped her.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Obeying Cam\u2019s gruff command, she stared into his fiery eyes while her pussy pulsed around his skillful fingers and saw her satisfaction and lust reflected on his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, princess. Give it all to me.\u201d</p> <p>After the last throb faded, Domini wanted to bury her face in the side of his neck. Lick the salt from his skin, familiarizing her senses with his taste, drown in his scent. Memorize every intimate detail about him.</p><p>But Cam had other plans. He fumbled for the handcuff key. A soft snick sounded and her arms were freed. The cuffs plopped on the couch cushion and he urged, \u201cPut your hands on my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Domini wished Cam had ditched his shirt, allowing her a chance to explore the sculpted muscles of his chest. But when he widened her knees and pressed his cock into her cleft, she forgot about everything except the sensation of the hard length of his shaft grinding against her clit. She countered his rocking motion, sliding down as he thrust up, increasing the friction.</p><p>Cam plunged two fingers into her pussy from behind, stroking with unerring accuracy the hot spot inside her vaginal walls that sent heated shivers of need spreading outward.</p><p>Panting, mindless, she lost herself to the moment. The smooth, fast glide of his velvety cock against her swollen sex. His greedy mouth sucking on her throat.</p><p>They rocked in tandem. In opposition. He nipped, licked and rubbed on her neck like a gigantic cat. A hungry cat if the scrape of his teeth from her earlobe to her nipples was any indication.</p> <p>But Domini liked that he hungered for her. She liked his unintelligible mutters that sent tingles racing across her bare skin. She liked everything about being with this man.</p><p>Her belly tightened in warning. Gripping his closely shorn scalp, Domini tipped Cam\u2019s head back and smashed her mouth to his, kissing him crazily as her second orgasm hit.</p><p>He swallowed her cries and his rhythm never faltered as he rode out the storm with her.</p><p>Just as she was about to rip her mouth free, a shiver worked through Cam like he\u2019d been zapped with an electric current. Hot liquid spurted on her belly as he came with a drawn-out groan. His hips bumped up three more times, slowed, and stopped.</p><p>He nestled his forehead in the curve of her neck and breathed hard. She breathed hard.</p><p>Her whole body shook with the glow of two fantastic orgasms. Would Cam run if she told him he was exactly the type of lover she\u2019d been searching for?</p><p>Probably. Especially since he\u2019d played it cool for months after that steamy kiss.</p><p>Yet, another part of her wondered if he\u2019d run if she didn\u2019t say anything. If she didn\u2019t reassure him that she didn\u2019t want this to be a onetime thing.</p> <p>Take a chance. Tell him the truth.</p><p>Domini hitched her shoulders back. Her smile died and her hopes fell when she noticed Cam\u2019s face read pure panic.</p><p>In fact, he stayed frozen, not even looking at her face.</p><p>She ignored the urge to flee. Instead she slowly swung her left knee over his lap and rolled to her feet. Keeping her back to him, she tried to figure out what she\u2019d done wrong.</p><p>Why do you always assume you\u2019re to blame?</p><p>When Domini faced Cam, she noticed he\u2019d already yanked his pants up and was hastily stuffing the handcuffs in the leather pouch.</p><p>Maybe Cam was just distracted and he\u2019d murmur something sweet and normal when he wasn\u2019t so flustered.</p><p>But it seemed to be a long wait.</p><p>Almost nervously, Cam rubbed the top of his head and glanced at his watch. \u201cWow. I didn\u2019t realize it was so late.\u201d</p><p>Lame excuse, Cam.</p><p>Domini retreated to her bedroom for a robe, allowing Cam time to get his head in order. He stood by the door when she returned. If he\u2019d worn a hat, he\u2019d be wringing it in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI better get home and see if Keely has destroyed my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Liar. \u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Remember to lock up after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second you leave, the door will be shut, locked, and I won\u2019t reopen it for you, Deputy. Not even if you beg.\u201d</p><p>Cam frowned at her rare sarcasm but didn\u2019t comment. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>After Domini slammed the door and flipped the locks, she listened as he lumbered down the stairs. She pressed her head to the cool wood frame until she heard him land safely at the bottom. Stairs gave him fits with his prosthesis, not that he\u2019d ever admit it.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s the type of man who won\u2019t ever admit anything, especially his feelings.</p><p>The outer door shut. She listened. Sure enough. Cam tested the outside doorknob to make sure the door locked behind him.</p><p>Why was he so concerned about her safety if he didn\u2019t care?</p><p>Because Cam McKay is a cop. He cares about everyone\u2019s safety.</p><p>The truth of that statement didn\u2019t sit well with her.</p><p>Domini trudged into the bathroom and didn\u2019t like the confusion and bleakness staring back at her from the mirror.</p><p>Her hair was a tangled mess. Her lips were swollen from giving Cam a blowjob and his harsh, deliciously wicked kisses. Marks from his razor stubble scored her chest. He\u2019d even sucked a big purple hickey above her collarbone. Under other circumstances, with Cam standing behind her, kissing his passionate marks, she might\u2019ve laughed. Or begged for more. But now? She just looked used.</p><p>Used. Right. Cam didn\u2019t even want to have sex with her. He got off and he got gone.</p><p>Why?</p><p>You\u2019re defective. He knows it. He doesn\u2019t want to get tangled up with you because it can\u2019t go anywhere. So if he comes back for more, retain the upper hand. Keep it casual.</p><p>Come back. Right. Cam had left so fast he\u2019d probably scorched her carpet.</p><p>Better burn marks there than on your heart.</p><p>True. She clicked off the light and crawled in bed.</p><p>Domini hadn\u2019t scheduled herself to work in the diner the next day. But after spending part of the morning at the park with her friend Nadia\u2019s son, Anton, while Nadia ran some mysterious errands, she knew she\u2019d go stir-crazy sitting in her apartment, obsessing over Cam\u2019s retreat.</p><p>Cooking appeased her. She waited until the lunch rush ended and snuck into Dewey\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>\u201cJust can\u2019t stay away, can you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sheepishly at Beatrice, her second-in-command.</p><p>Beatrice set her elbows on the steel prep counter. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re whipping up goodies full of chocolate and sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoody! Lucky me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m lucky to have you and that sweet tooth as my secret taste tester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as good as having a secret admirer.\u201d Beatrice winked, casting a look over her shoulder. \u201cLemme know when you need me to lick the spoon.\u201d</p><p>Creaming butter and powdered sugar together released a familiar sugary scent, way better than any expensive aromatherapy. Domini sifted the dry ingredients into the industrial mixer. She poured in white chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips and hand stirred the thick mixture, keeping the consistency between cake batter and cookie dough.</p><p>She dumped the mix into a rectangular cake pan and set it on the middle rack of the smallest oven. She grabbed a saucepan, determined to nail down a souped-up version of mole sauce she\u2019d been messing with for months.</p><p>After the timer dinged, she deposited the brownies on a wire rack to cool. She\u2019d finished the sauce but wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d gotten the proportions equal. She yelled, \u201cBea, could you please come here?\u201d</p><p>Beatrice peered around the corner. \u201cYou bellowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Domini waved a spoon coated with dark sauce. \u201cTaste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your service.\u201d Beatrice popped the spoon in her mouth. She swallowed and licked her lips. Then her face became fire-engine red. She sputtered, \u201cToo much chili powder!\u201d and raced for the sink to gulp from the stream of water.</p><p>Domini sighed. \u201cSorry. I always screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d came from behind her.</p><p>She whirled around.</p><p>Cam.</p><p>And didn\u2019t he just look good enough to eat? Talk about hotness and sweetness perfectly proportioned. He wore faded jeans and a black tank top that showed off his beefy biceps, triceps and bulging pectorals. His hands were jammed in his back pockets and he watched her with a guarded expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini!\u201d Bea gasped. \u201cWhat on earth is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, snapping was so unlike her, but she couldn\u2019t quell the surly feeling.</p><p>Beatrice wiped her mouth on her apron. \u201cShe\u2019s always testy when things don\u2019t turn out the way she\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda sounds like the way my night went last night,\u201d he said softly, never taking his eyes from Domini\u2019s.</p><p>Her heart beat as fast as a mixer on high speed.</p><p>\u201cBeatrice, could you give us a couple of minutes?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll just be out front icing down my tongue.\u201d She flounced off.</p><p>When Cam remained quiet, Domini said, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting in the dining room for you for over an hour,\u201d Cam said. \u201cYou ignoring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to do when I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p><p>Cam edged closer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you if you were avoiding me after the shitty way I acted last night.\u201d His gaze dipped to the collar of her shirt. \u201cI\u2019m here to apologize.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Cam\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not obvious to me, so why don\u2019t you explain it?\u201d</p> <p>An incredulous look appeared only to be replaced with an irritated one. \u201cWhat? You expect me to grovel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I expect nothing from you, which is why it\u2019s so ironic that I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a damn minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go.\u201d Stupid chili pepper powder must\u2019ve blown in her face; her eyes smarted with tears. She sidestepped him, muttering, wishing she was the type of woman who could rant and rave and throw things to relay her frustrations.</p><p>Cam wheeled her around, boxing her between his body and the steel door of the walk-in cooler. \u201cWill you at least let me apologize before you storm off and start swearing at me in Ukrainian?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m an idiot all the way around, okay? Look, I\u2019m sorry...\u201d His gaze lingered on her neck. \u201cI\u2019m so goddamn sorry I was such an animal and marked you last night. First thing. You deserve better than a man who mauls you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach swooped at the self-recrimination in his words. \u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I stayed away from you, Domini. You\u2019re so soft and sweet. And I\u2019m too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014much man for me to handle?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo am I. At any point last night did I say, \u2018Cam, you\u2019re hurting me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I am incapable of being honest with you? Do you think I am so desperate for your touch that I would allow you to...hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. You\u2019re twisting my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am being honest. And you still don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes. \u201cThe only thing that upset me about last night was that you left again.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with complete confusion. But he didn\u2019t back away. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not very bold, which means I\u2019ve been waiting to see if you would make a move on me. And when you finally did, and I saw the passionate, demanding side you keep hidden because you think I can\u2019t handle it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>Domini snapped, \u201cYou haven\u2019t given me a chance to prove otherwise, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. You assumed. Did you consider I have needs and desires that you might not be able to meet?\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s face slackened with shock. Then his male pride leapt to the surface all hot and dangerous and in her face. \u201cOh, princess, don\u2019t go there. I can satisfy all your needs and desires and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>A pause followed as Cam looked at her. Almost as if he was seeing her for the first time. Then Cam framed her face in his large, rough hands. \u201cYou deserve a man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014who makes me come so hard I see stars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron.\u201d</p><p>He muttered, \u201cI\u2019m so goddamn tired of fighting this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t fight it.\u201d</p><p>The soft brush of his lips over hers was in direct contrast to the heat in his eyes. \u201cAll right. You win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll both be winners, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming home with me right now.\u201d</p><p>Cam grabbed her hand and strode out the front door, towing Domini behind him. He opened the passenger side of his truck and loomed over her. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to get involved with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m the one having doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He bent to kiss the hollow of her throat. \u201cI still say you\u2019re too good for a broken war bum like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Deputy, I know a thing or two about being broken.\u201d Domini didn\u2019t wait for his response before she climbed in.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Domini mashed herself next to Cam in the cab. The air from the open window blew wisps of her silky hair across his cheek, teasing him with a reminder of her fragrant softness. It was damn close to heaven being alone with her, with dust kicking up behind them and miles of grazing lands on the horizon in front of them, beneath the cloudless Wyoming sky.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said much on the drive out to his place. Most women would be compelled to fill the quiet with mindless chatter. Not Domini. Her silence wasn\u2019t unsettling. In fact, Cam found it comforting.</p><p>Cam parked on the concrete slab in front of the garage and shut the truck off.</p><p>Domini faced him and smiled softly.</p><p>Every time she gazed at him as if she could read his soul, his breath stalled in his lungs.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the moment to clear my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to talk first? Or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what? You think I\u2019m gonna truss you up and fuck right out here in the truck? Give me some damn credit, Domini. I do have some damn restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much restraint sometimes.\u201d</p><p>In another bout of silence between them, his dog yipped along the fence.</p><p>\u201cGracie,\u201d he yelled out the window. \u201cHush. We\u2019ll be there in a sec so you can sniff her and make sure she\u2019s not a threat.\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s whole body went rigid beside him.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You probably think it\u2019s silly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Cam bent his head to peer into her alarmed eyes. \u201cNothin\u2019 silly about it. I\u2019ll keep her in the yard if it\u2019ll ease your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do that, the dog will have another reason to hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily Gracie doesn\u2019t hate anybody.\u201d He smiled. \u201cJust let me know when you\u2019re ready to meet her, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to assure me she is the best dog ever and I will immediately love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Although she is the best dog ever, I\u2019m serious about not pressuring you about her. I know what it\u2019s like to have that \u2018just get over it\u2019 mentality thrust at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s gaze descended to her lips. He couldn\u2019t resist stealing a kiss. Her mouth was so warm and supple moving beneath his that he stole another one. And another.</p><p>She sank into him, welcoming his attentions with a dreamy sigh.</p><p>After several long, deep, wet kisses, he playfully nipped her bottom lip. \u201cLet\u2019s take this inside.\u201d</p><p>She paused at the base of the stairs. The bottom was divided into two sections. Half was a set of steps, half was a wheelchair ramp. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you use a wheelchair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t use one.\u201d Ever.</p><p>\u201cThen why have a ramp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a daily reminder I could end up in a chair if I don\u2019t work hard every damn day at staying out of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you build it?\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cBlake did at Colt\u2019s request. Right after I got back to the States and was discharged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Colt think you wouldn\u2019t walk again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he knew I needed a place that was accessible just in case.\u201d</p><p>She curled her palm over the handrail. \u201cIt must be nice to have that kind of unconditional support from your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But living around all of them can drive me nuts.\u201d Domini didn\u2019t avert her eyes as Cam ascended the stairs, and oddly, her scrutiny didn\u2019t bother him. He opened the door. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>Domini ducked under his arm and stopped on the edge of the carpet, taking it all in.</p><p>Cam tried to see his refuge through her eyes. His cousins Chet and Remy West had gutted the inside of the house after he\u2019d purchased it from Colt and Buck. Any resemblance to the infamous Boars Nest party house had been completely eradicated.</p><p>The structure of the living room hadn\u2019t changed much, besides replacing the sagging bay window with a newer, larger window. Modern track lighting ran along the center of the ceiling. The rectangular room was anchored at one end by a gigantic flat screen TV and a stack of audio/visual components, and on the other end by a fireplace. A wood coffee table was centered between reclining chairs and a plush, oversized couch the color of tobacco.</p><p>\u201cThis is awesome. Did you pick out the colors and the furniture and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely helped. Said she didn\u2019t want me living in a man cave with white walls, a TV and cheap bean bag chairs.\u201d</p><p>Domini laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome see the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The wall between the formal dining room and the kitchen had been demolished, creating one large open space. New appliances, pine cabinetry, bigger windows and tile flooring showcased modern amenities, yet the eat-in breakfast bar uniting the two areas retained a rustic, country feel. A sliding glass door led to an enormous covered deck that wrapped around the entire backside of the house.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you use this fabulous kitchen for more than zapping microwave meals and cooking frozen pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Not really.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve taken the cooking lessons you won. It would be a dream to teach you to cook in this kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Cam slid his hands around her hips to cup her ass and urged her lower body against his. \u201cYou really think we would\u2019ve gotten any cooking done? Or maybe I just would\u2019ve spread you out across my table and feasted on you. \u2019Cause princess, you look mighty tasty.\u201d</p><p>A shuddering breath left her lungs.</p><p>He kissed the corners of her mouth. \u201cI want you like crazy. I wanna tie you to my bed for days. But before any of that happens, we need to get some things straight.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCan we sit outside and talk? It\u2019s such a beautiful day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. Would you like a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beer would be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead out onto the back deck and I\u2019ll bring it to you.\u201d</p> <p>Cam heard the sliding glass door open, forgetting Gracie was penned in the backyard until Domini shrieked. He turned just in time to see Domini leap on the antique oak table.</p><p>Gracie barked and raced around excitedly, thinking it was a game.</p><p>\u201cGracie! Sit.\u201d</p><p>A disbelieving whimper sounded and then the Border collie obeyed.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Cam crossed to the dog, ignoring Domini crouched like a cat about to pounce. He ruffled Gracie\u2019s silky ears. \u201cListen up, pup. Domini hasn\u2019t been around dogs as cool as you, so give her some time to adjust. Be on your best behavior and before you know it, you\u2019ll have Domini sneakin\u2019 you treats and rubbing your fat belly. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>Gracie barked twice.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Stay.\u201d Cam grabbed a new rawhide chew out of the pantry. The second Gracie saw it her tail thumped. Her tongue flopped past her gums in a doggie version of a smile. He couldn\u2019t help but grin. The damn dog cracked him up. \u201cIf I let you out in the pasture, you can\u2019t be sneakin\u2019 up on Colby\u2019s cattle.\u201d</p><p>A tiny, sad noise hummed from Gracie.</p><p>Domini said, \u201cShe\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Her breed is great for herding. Since I don\u2019t have cattle she tries to herd everyone else\u2019s cattle. Back here. The first couple times my brothers were amused. After that, not so much.\u201d</p><p>Gracie whined pitifully again.</p> <p>\u201cI mean it, Gracie. No chasing cows.\u201d</p><p>Two more barks.</p><p>Cam shot a look over his shoulder at Domini. \u201cBe right back without the mutt. Grab the beer and I\u2019ll meetcha outside.\u201d He whistled loudly and Gracie raced out of the house hell bent for leather.</p><p>When he returned, Domini had curled up in a lounge chair in the far corner of the deck. Sunglasses covered her eyes and she\u2019d wrapped both hands around a bottle of Bud Light.</p><p>He snagged a beer and eased himself into the chair beside her. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault I freaked out about a dog. I should be apologizing because I jumped on the table like a spooked cat.\u201d She muttered in Ukrainian and gulped her beer.</p><p>\u201cWe all have fears, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEspecially me.\u201d Cam pried her fingers away from the beer bottle so he could hold her hand. \u201cBut maybe you oughta come clean about what happened that makes you so afraid of dogs.\u201d</p><p>Domini gazed off into the distance, as if gauging her words. \u201cWhen I was six, we were relocating from Kiev to Kharkiv because everything was in chaos due to the Chernobyl incident. We were waiting outside the train station, when two Soviet policemen showed up with a German shepherd police dog. A big, mean, snarly attack dog. Although I\u2019d done nothing wrong, I...ran.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s throat closed up.</p><p>\u201cThe dog chased me until it caught me. By the time the police and my parents separated me from the dog\u2019s jaws, I was already bleeding badly. I remember little of the hospital except the excruciating pain when they stitched me up. The next day the same Soviet police came by and wrote my father a ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome trumped-up missing paperwork charge. Mostly they needed an excuse to explain why a dog that was supposed to be protecting people, attacked a child unprovoked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. The police twisted it around so it was your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff like that happened all the time when we were under Soviet rule. Law enforcement there is nothing like it is here. So, we had to stay in Kiev another three weeks, during which I got an infection.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI ended up back in the hospital and almost died. I\u2019ve had...issues with dogs ever since, which is why my first instinct is to run.\u201d</p><p>Rage filled him. Yet he managed a calm, \u201cWhere did the dog bite you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked, I answered, so can we drop it now? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Cam stood. He braced his hands on the armrest of her chair and demanded, \u201cWhere did the dog bite you?\u201d</p><p>Her pale eyebrows lifted above the rims of her sunglasses. \u201cThe first mark is on the back of my left shoulder and the second one is on my hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. It\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it shouldn\u2019t be such a big goddamned deal to let me see it.\u201d Why was he pushing her on this?</p><p>Because you want her to be physically scarred, same as you. You want to see it so you don\u2019t feel like such a freak.</p><p>In angry, jerky movements, Domini slid the shirt down her left shoulder. She dropped her chin to her chest, leaving the nape of her neck exposed.</p><p>Oh fuck. His stomach clenched. The jagged edges of the white scar tissue showed where the dog had ripped a huge chunk of her skin off. Whatever sawbones had treated her in the Ukraine managed to piece it together, but not very well. How had he missed feeling those ridged scars last night?</p><p>Because you were selfish and then you were gone.</p><p>Seeing that broken section of her skin broke something inside him. He placed his mouth against her warm, sweet-smelling flesh and tenderly pressed kisses across every inch of the scar. And when he finished the first pass, he did it again.</p><p>Domini\u2019s breath caught.</p><p>Cam dragged his mouth over the sexy arch of her neck, pushing aside the baby-fine strands of hair. He brushed his damp lips to her ear and murmured, \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard,\u201d before easing back and retaking his seat.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t removed her sunglasses, but he knew she was watching him very closely.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s churning inside that pretty head of yours, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking I still run from situations that scare me. Dogs. People.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I scare you because I\u2019m a cop?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not entirely true. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat situation is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking you for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou afraid I\u2019ll deny you?\u201d</p><p>Domini shrugged. \u201cGiven our past...situation, maybe I am a little afraid you\u2019ll think I\u2019m weird for what I want.\u201d</p><p>Cam reached out to reassure her, but thought better of it. Now was the time for talking, not touching. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about sex. At least, I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to have sex.\u201d</p><p>Sweet Jesus. Hopefully she wasn\u2019t one of those stump fetish freaks who could only get off with amputees. He\u2019d never been with a woman like that, but lots of guys he\u2019d met at the VA talked about being approached by women\u2014and men\u2014with that bizarre fetish. \u201cSo if I say, yes, I\u2019m ready to nail you right now...you\u2019d say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She removed her sunglasses and locked her gaze to his. \u201cI\u2019d say what I really want is for you to take control of me during sex. Just like you did last night when you handcuffed me, pushed me to my knees and made me suck you off.\u201d</p><p>His heart began to race. \u201cYou liked that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to really let go in any kind of sexual situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to think it was because I was with a church organization for a lot of years and they taught us sex\u2014wanting it, doing it\u2014was totally wrong. But my real problem is I worry too much I won\u2019t measure up because I\u2019m so inexperienced. And if you haven\u2019t realized it yet, I\u2019m also shy.\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled. \u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>Domini rolled her eyes. \u201cSo I\u2019ve always fantasized about finding a man who will take away my choice, who won\u2019t let me be shy about any aspect of sex. A man who will command me to please him and myself, but who won\u2019t physically hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looking at playing master and slave? The boot licking, collar-wearing type of role-playing and pretend punishments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just...don\u2019t want to have to think about sex. I want to surrender my body to a man who pushes me to my sexual limits so I can experience the ultimate pleasure and give it back to him in return any way he wants it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in this type of sexual relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t had many lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>It figured. Domini was as innocent as he\u2019d feared. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve had little sexual experience or exposure to a dominant male, how do you know so much about this?\u201d</p><p>Color tinged her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t...well...besides reading romance novels with a bit of a domination theme. I realized that type of sexual relationship was what I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmissive?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay the word. If you want to be submissive to me, you\u2019ll say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re submissive, that makes me...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Do you know what it means to be under the rule of a dominant male, Domini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I know you\u2019ll teach me. I want you to teach me.\u201d</p><p>That little remark made his dick hard. \u201cYou wanna know why I stayed away from you? Because I couldn\u2019t imagine you\u2014sweet, kind, timid Domini\u2014letting me have my way with you however I wanted. Letting me fuck your mouth, your cunt, your ass. I couldn\u2019t fathom you\u2019d be willing to let me call the shots and play rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow rough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never use my rougher edges as an excuse to hurt you. Spanking your ass with my hand is one thing, making you bleed by punching you in the face falls into a whole nother realm.</p><p>\u201cFor example.\u201d He leaned forward, using his voice as a lure. \u201cIf I wanna handcuff you to my bed all night or all day, I will. If I wanna fuck you against the truck, I will. If I want you to go down on me in my patrol car when no one else is around, you will. If you agree to this, my rules are simple. Any time, any place, any position I say, you say, \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a growl of approval. \u201cYou oughta know I\u2019m beyond demanding when it comes to getting what I need from my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been in a relationship like this before?\u201d</p> <p>Cam debated on how much to tell her. But if he expected honesty from her, he\u2019d better reciprocate. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been in several. Not since\u2014\u201d I lost my leg and my nerve, \u201c\u2014my injury.\u201d</p><p>Domini regarded him pensively. \u201cSo we would fulfill each other\u2019s sexual needs and that\u2019s all? No relationship beyond that?\u201d</p><p>Hell no. Little did Domini know now that he\u2019d uncovered this surprising side of her, after he got her in his bed, he\u2019d never let her out. She\u2019d belong to him. But his reassurance he wouldn\u2019t attempt to turn this into a traditional dating relationship seemed important to her. It went against everything Cam was to lie. But because he wanted her with an acute ache, an unfathomable need, a sense of rightness he\u2019d never felt in his life, he lied with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small town, Domini. If my truck is parked outside your apartment all night people will know something is goin\u2019 on with us. Denial would just increase the speculation. So I ain\u2019t gonna hide the fact we\u2019re seeing each other. What we do when we\u2019re alone together ain\u2019t anybody\u2019s business. I don\u2019t tell locker room stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I trust you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m curious. Why don\u2019t you want a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause any kind of long-term relationship always falls apart. Always. I watched my parent\u2019s marriage implode before they died. I saw my friends in the Ukraine marry themselves off to the highest bidder and they were no better off than a prostitute or a maid. I witnessed verbal abuse repeatedly in so-called Christian marriages and relationships, actions that were sanctioned by the church. And don\u2019t get me started on the physical abuse issues Nadia suffered before she escaped that awful relationship. So I\u2019ll pass on the trappings of marriage, because from what I\u2019ve seen, it is a trap.\u201d</p><p>Cam let her vehemence sink in. It chilled him to the bone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get married, Cam. That\u2019s not the life for me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cCompletely. And we are on the exact same page, there, princess. I\u2019ve worked hard to turn my house into my sanctuary, and it might make me a bastard, but I\u2019m not eager to share.\u201d</p><p>Relief softened the hard set to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m glad. And I\u2019m good with pretending we\u2019re dating, when we\u2019re really having lots of hot sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich brings us back to my next question. What about birth control?\u201d</p><p>A stark look briefly flashed in her eyes. \u201cWe are covered as far as no accidental pregnancy and I haven\u2019t had a lover in three years, so no STDs.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been nearly that long on the \u201cno sex\u201d wagon for Cam too, but confessing the truth smacked of desperation. \u201cSo, we agree no condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cam finished his beer. He set it on the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019m done talkin\u2019. How about if I finish the rest of the tour?\u201d</p><p>Domini clasped Cam\u2019s outstretched hand and followed him back into the house.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>A house tour.</p> <p>Maybe Cam would show her his bedroom. And then demonstrate how wickedly ruthless he can be in bed.</p><p>Focus, Domini.</p><p>That was nearly impossible when the ragged edge of Cam\u2019s thumb continually stroked the inside of her wrist\u2014an erotic touch she felt tugging between her legs. As they meandered the brightly lit hallway, Domini looked up to see skylights spaced a foot apart. \u201cThose are unusual. I like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Chet and Remy add them. I can\u2019t stand living in darkness.\u201d He gestured to the bathroom. \u201cPretty much everything from here back is a total remodel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just build a whole new house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the location. The house has a solid foundation. It just needed a little cosmetic work and someone to care about it.\u201d He pushed open a door that\u2019d been left ajar. \u201cSpare bedroom.\u201d The plaid denim bedspread hung off one end and pillows spilled onto the carpeted floor. \u201cI see Keely managed to bail without cleaning up after herself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really hate having people in your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hate. It\u2019s just...I went from living at home to living in barracks and tents. I\u2019ve never lived by myself. I tend to get protective of my space. My family doesn\u2019t get that. So I had to state the rules about them staying away without a specific invitation from the moment I moved back here.\u201d Cam opened another door and hit the lights. \u201cHere\u2019s my bedroom. We combined the two smaller bedrooms into a larger one.\u201d</p><p>The bed dwarfed the room. Rising from each corner of the bed frame were thick wooden posts. A plain cotton quilt in a vivid bronze covered the massive space from headboard to footrest.</p><p>A pair of crutches were propped between the headboard and the nightstand. Contrary to what he\u2019d said, Domini suspected the real reason Cam preferred to be alone in his house was so he could wander around minus his prosthesis without embarrassment.</p><p>Domini refocused on the furniture. A tall rough-hewn pine dresser, with wrought-iron accents, matched the nightstands book-ending the bed. An oversized, overstuffed corduroy recliner faced the window rather than into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I could crawl right into that puffy bed and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, when I get you in my bed the last thing we\u2019re gonna be doin\u2019 is sleeping.\u201d</p><p>His husky tone dripped of raw sex and sent a shiver of fresh desire rippling through her.</p><p>The door she assumed led to a closet was actually a pocket door that revealed a sun-drenched bathroom. An enormous slate-tiled shower, encased in glass blocks, took up one side of the room. A deep Jacuzzi tub the other. A toilet was secreted behind half walls in the corner. Along the back wall was a double sink in a soft gray, sunk into a glossy, black, high countertop and surrounded by mirrors. She checked out the bathtub, looking longingly at the jets and nozzles. Outside around the rim, a conglomeration of silver-colored tubes were imbedded in the tiled floor, curving around the front end and backside of the tub.</p><p>Domini started to ask Cam why he needed so many handrails, when she realized climbing in and out of a slippery tub with one leg would be difficult. She\u2019d forgotten about his handicap. A positive sign in her mind, but she knew Cam wouldn\u2019t appreciate her mentioning it so she didn\u2019t.</p><p>She faced the mirror and Cam wedged his body right behind hers, nestling his groin into her butt. He gripped her hips. \u201cBend forward until your palms are flat to the wall.\u201d</p><p>Keeping their gazes connected in the mirror, Domini did as he told her.</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cCompliant. I like that.\u201d He rocked his pelvis, grinding his cock against the cleft of her ass. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you like this, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Please. Now.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSoon.\u201d Cam tugged her upright, keeping her back pressed against his chest as he trailed openmouthed kisses up her throat. \u201cI knew this countertop height would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>She was dying to ask if he\u2019d had other women in the bathroom to test the height and strength of the marble. Her gaze flickered over him and she had her answer. A man as sexy, virile and commanding as Cam McKay wouldn\u2019t lack for sex partners. Ever.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get back to the kitchen. I could use another beer. Maybe we could play cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCards?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYep. The best way to get to know a person is to play cards with them. You learn their tells\u2014\u201d he licked the cord straining in her neck and she moaned, \u201c\u2014like that one. Or figure out when they\u2019re bluffing.\u201d He slid his hand into her hair and pulled.</p><p>Domini stiffened with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like that, do you?\u201d</p><p>She tried to jerk out of his hold, which only made her scalp sting worse. Then she attempted to relax.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t have much experience with aggressive\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cam increased his grip and pulled again. Harder.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Let go.\u201d</p><p>Immediately his hand dropped. He scattered sweet kisses across her scalp. \u201cYou don\u2019t bluff worth a shit, Domini,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell if I\u2019ve pushed you too far.\u201d He spun her and sealed his mouth to hers in a hot, wet kiss.</p><p>Domini arched her breasts into his chest, rubbing the center of her pelvis over his erection, tempting him to forget all about card games so they could indulge in other games.</p><p>His deep groan vibrated in her mouth. He slid his lips across her cheek to whisper, \u201cSoon,\u201d and abruptly dragged them from the bathroom.</p><p>An hour later, Domini was ready to climb out of her skin. Talk about extended foreplay. While they played cards, Cam touched her. Constantly. Running his callused palm down her arm. Trailing his fingertips up the ticklish inside of her thigh. Twirling a section of her hair around his fingers. Letting his thumb linger on the pulse points of her throat. Tracing her soft, damp lips after he\u2019d scrambled her mind with a powerfully seductive kiss.</p><p>She was holding her cards without really seeing them. His husky command, \u201cDomini, look at me,\u201d completely destroyed what little concentration she\u2019d managed. She raised her gaze to his.</p><p>Cam stood, grabbed her hand, and brought her to her feet. Then he swept the cards from the table and lifted her onto it, crushing her lips beneath his.</p><p>Domini gave herself over to him, aware he\u2019d already built her to a level of sexual awareness she\u2019d never experienced.</p><p>He broke the kiss. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>When her legs dangled off the table, and she stared at the antelope-horn chandelier above her, Cam spoke again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProp yourself on your elbows.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Cam across the length of her body.</p><p>He curled his hands around her knees and set her feet on the table. In a purposefully drawn-out and sexy move, he teased her sundress up over her thighs and hips until it bunched at her waist.</p><p>Thank God she\u2019d worn decent underwear.</p> <p>Cam idly traced the triangle of fabric stretched over her groin. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have pegged you as the black lace type. But it looks damn good against your snowy white skin.\u201d He urged to her raise her hips, slipped the scrap of lace from her body and tossed it aside. Cam lowered his head and kissed her belly button. He paused at the surgical scar below it.</p><p>Please don\u2019t ask. Please don\u2019t ask now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this from?\u201d His thumb followed the white slash.</p><p>\u201cAppendix,\u201d she said automatically.</p><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s a weird place for it.\u201d He tickled it with his tongue. \u201cThey must do surgery different in the Ukraine, huh?\u201d While he teased her skin with little licks and nipping kisses, he noticed the other dog bite scar on her hip. Next thing she knew, he lovingly placed sweet, healing kisses over every inch. Her heart soared as she melted.</p> <p>\u201cCam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, I\u2019m getting there.\u201d The kisses ventured southward, over the blonde hair covering her mound. He stopped to suck the hidden nub at the top of her sex, just once, very gently. Then he used his tongue to separate her pussy lips until the tip of his tongue hit the mouth of her sex. He groaned. \u201cYou taste as sweet and hot between your legs as I imagined.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body trembled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you come fast this first time.\u201d He burrowed his tongue deep into her channel. Once. Twice. Three times. \u201cAfter that, the wait\u2019ll be longer but the payoff will be sweeter.\u201d His hands slipped under her butt cheeks and he brought her weeping sex to his mouth. \u201cWatch.\u201d Cam lapped. He licked. He sucked. He fucked her with his tongue, lavishing attention on every quivering millimeter of her swollen flesh...except her clitoris.</p><p>So much for letting her come soon. Her disgruntled sigh caught his notice.</p><p>\u201cSomething you need, princess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo come! You said fast. This isn\u2019t fast, this is torture!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna have such a great time teaching you patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I learn it later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Now hold tight.\u201d He formed a small circle with his lips and pressed his mouth directly over her clit. He flicked his tongue across it. Let his teeth graze it. Cam closed his eyes as if he were in heaven and started to suck.</p><p>Domini\u2019s pelvis shot up at the escalating rhythmic pulls of his mouth. The slow hum of sensation beneath the surface of her skin picked up heat and speed. Her hands, her thighs, her teeth clenched hard and then all at once, she detonated.</p><p>Cam steadily sucked through every twist of her hips, every hoarse cry tumbling from her lips. Sweat coated her body, blood pounded in her ears. When the last pulse weakened, Cam nuzzled the inside of her leg. Domini flopped back on the table and tried to catch her breath.</p><p>But her respite didn\u2019t last more than fifteen seconds. The heat from Cam\u2019s body radiated above hers. \u201cDomini.\u201d</p><p>She pried her eyelids open at the sexy sound of her name rumbling from his throat. The passion in the depths of his eyes sent a shiver through her.</p> <p>He drawled, \u201cMy turn.\u201d He slid her down and flipped her on her belly. \u201cGrab the edge of the table. Like that. Don\u2019t move your hands, your body, anything.\u201d Cam widened her stance. Even as tall as she was, her tiptoes barely touched the floor. She felt a little wanton. A little helpless. More than a little turned on.</p><p>Cam rolled the dress up to her hipbones. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about goin\u2019 down on you since the first time I saw you in Dewey\u2019s with a smudge of flour on your cheek.\u201d He traced her moist cleft and he plunged one finger inside. \u201cI wondered how you\u2019d taste. Now every time I look at you I\u2019ll remember the tang of you on my tongue. The smell of your sweet juices on my face.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse spiked hearing the metallic jangle as he unbuckled his belt.</p><p>\u201cWhen you started to come against my mouth? Showing me you\u2019re not shy about grinding that juicy pussy into my face, showing me how much you loved what I was doin\u2019 to you...I damn near came right along with you.\u201d</p><p>Domini almost came again from his dirty-talking play-by-play.</p><p>A long zip was followed by the shuffling whisper of his clothing hitting the floor. Then all that hot, male hardness was crowded against her backside.</p><p>When Cam leaned closer to bury his face in her hair, she wished they were naked so she could feel his chest against her back. He didn\u2019t move his body even as she felt tension vibrating within him. \u201cCam? You okay?\u201d</p><p>A kiss bussed the top of her ear. \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I\u2019ve wanted to be for too damn long.\u201d He positioned the tip of his cock at her entrance and worked his thick shaft inside to the hilt. Cam pulled all the way out. He eased back in as slowly as he did the first time. Twice more. Without warning his hips flexed hard, rocking her to the core as he rocked the table.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hands were curled around her hips to protect her hipbones from banging into the table edge. He never altered in his pace. And Cam had been right in one respect: this time was all about him. No sweet kisses. No murmured words of encouragement. No loving caresses. Just pure fucking.</p><p>Domini\u2019s vision wavered. She wanted to wrap her fingers around some part of Cam\u2019s hard body, not the hard table. Even the stroke of his hand on hers would deepen their connection.</p><p>There is no deeper connection. It\u2019s just sex.</p><p>Her body didn\u2019t care about any kind of connection beyond purely physical. A small orgasm pulsed and the contraction sent Cam over the edge, he grunted and bumped his pelvis as his cock emptied, coating her insides with a blast of liquid heat.</p><p>Neither attempted to move. Their labored breathing was the only sound in the room.</p><p>Finally, Cam said, \u201cHang on. I\u2019ll get a towel.\u201d A gush of wetness ran down her leg. She heard him yank his pants up and fumble with the belt. Water ran in the kitchen sink.</p><p>She pushed up, unnerved by his rapid retreat. Would he reset the distance between them again? An anxious feeling bloomed, but when she spun around, Cam was right there. Kissing her in that sinful way of his. Gently mopping the stickiness between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou said it\u2019d been a while. Are you sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore enough to keep me from having you again?\u201d</p><p>Immediately her nipples hardened with interest. \u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could get it up right now, it\u2019d be right now. And then I\u2019d wanna do it again right after that. But I need a little recovery time first.\u201d He smoothed her dress down. \u201cI\u2019m getting old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween thirty and death,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d She spied her panties on the floor. As she reached for them, Cam\u2019s rough-skinned hand circled her wrist.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. No panties while you\u2019re here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope we\u2019re not going horseback riding.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m minus an article of clothing, you should be too.\u201d</p><p>A cool appraisal settled on Cam\u2019s face. \u201cOh yeah? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitch your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Chances were good Domini didn\u2019t have the nerve to push him on this issue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not backing down. Show me your chest.\u201d</p><p>Secretly pleased to see feistiness lurking beneath her placid demeanor, Cam yanked the tank top over his head.</p><p>She whistled.</p><p>He blushed, grateful she didn\u2019t focus on the ugly shrapnel marks and gouges marring the skin on his belly. And on his chest. Marks that were all over the goddamn place.</p><p>Those marks aren\u2019t nearly as ugly as your stump.</p><p>She flattened her palms on his chest and kissed his scowling mouth.</p><p>Naturally his stomach chose that moment to rumble with hunger. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry too. What do you have to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could figure something out. Mind if I poke around in your kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it.\u201d</p><p>Cam stood behind Domini as she surveyed the meager contents of his refrigerator. Milk. Beer. Condiments. Cheese. Lunch meat. Grapes. A half a loaf of wheat bread.</p><p>\u201cPretty sad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever needed to learn.\u201d</p><p>She tossed sandwich fixings on the counter and washed her hands. \u201cSome of us had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you know so much about cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Can you get me a knife?\u201d</p><p>Cam rummaged in a drawer and set a dull butcher knife and a bread knife on the counter. \u201cWhere did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands on mostly. The church group that brought me to the U.S. had missionary outreach posts all over the states. We traveled a lot. We\u2019d have to fix three meals a day for the church leaders and members who were out spreading the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay in, day out for years. Until I realized I could apply for citizenship and escaped.\u201d She gestured to the cupboards. \u201cWill you grab plates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Cam didn\u2019t ask questions but he knew there was way more to the story than the bits she\u2019d shared.</p><p>They sat side by side and ate. His ham and cheese sandwiches never tasted this good, even if he used the same damn ingredients. Might be sappy, but little domestic things like this made him feel cared for, probably because these cozy moments were so rare in his life. He glanced over at her and his glass of milk stopped halfway to his mouth.</p><p>Domini\u2019s fingers fondled the two fat purple grapes left on her plate. Gauging the tightness and fullness of the globes containing all that sweet juice, she plucked one from the vine and popped it in her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lust slammed into him. Instantly Cam envisioned her long fingers rolling his balls like that. Teasing them with feathery touches. He imagined the moist heat of her breath, down low between his inner thighs, right before she sucked the sac into her mouth.</p><p>He must\u2019ve groaned because Domini whipped around.</p><p>Her eyes widened as if she\u2019d peeked inside his brain. But he didn\u2019t see shock in the pale blue depths, just interest. When her mouth softened, Cam couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her another second.</p> <p>His glass hit the counter. He stood and lifted her to her feet, then his mouth claimed hers in blistering kiss. God he loved how wickedly eager her tongue was sliding beside his. How recklessly and hotly she writhed against him.</p><p>So crazed was his need for her, his hands trembled as he yanked her sundress down. It fluttered to the floor, allowing her pert breasts and hard-tipped nipples to fill his greedy hands.</p><p>Domini sucked in a surprised breath.</p><p>Cam flicked little whips of his tongue around the point of her left nipple. Each lick, each suckling touch of his mouth to any part of her breasts drove Domini wild. She gyrated her hips. She gouged her fingernails into his shoulders. He changed it up, keeping her guessing on whether he\u2019d use his teeth, mouth or tongue. Her sexy purrs caused everything male inside him to roar with primal need to satisfy her.</p><p>He pushed her back to the fridge, still sucking on her sweet little tits. \u201cNow. Right fucking now.\u201d</p> <p>She just moaned.</p><p>Cam moved his hand between her legs and he found her hot and slick and ready. No reason to wait. She was wet, he was hard. Cam held her wrists behind her back. He let his tongue tease the shell of her ear until she shivered. Oh yeah, he was learning all her secret hot spots.</p><p>He turned her, and pressed her against the refrigerator door.</p><p>Domini gasped when her bare breasts met the door\u2019s cold metal front.</p><p>\u201cFeels good and naughty on your hot skin, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Cam placed her palms flat on the top of the door. \u201cKeep your hands there and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s feet slid out.</p> <p>Cam layered his face to the side of hers while he quickly worked his belt and pants. They hit the tile with a resounding thud. His right hand snuck around her hip and flattened over her abdomen, urging her pelvis to angle back. His left hand guided his cock to that tight channel weeping for him.</p><p>He drove into her hard and deep.</p><p>\u201cOh. God. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Using his right hand to stroke her clit, he followed the line of her arm up with his other hand and threaded his fingers through her left hand braced on the top of the refrigerator. Then Cam began a series of shallow thrusts. Slow thrusts.</p><p>Her head fell onto his shoulder. \u201cYour bare chest feels so good against my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cunt feels hot and wet and tight around my dick.\u201d He pumped his hips and circled his finger over her clit, wondering how quickly it\u2019d take to get her off.</p><p>\u201cCam. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, that\u2019s what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>Domini groaned.</p><p>As much as he\u2019d love to build her to the point of detonation, chances were high once he began pounding into her, he wouldn\u2019t last either.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s kick this up a notch.\u201d</p><p>Between the constant attention to her clitoris and the deeper thrusts, Domini\u2019s body trembled, she cried out as she shot like a rocket.</p><p>Cam blinked the sweat from his eyes and managed to hold off until the tail end of her orgasm. The internal vibrations jerked him right over the edge into sweet oblivion. They were still locked together, with Cam scattering kisses across the sexy slope of her bare shoulder, when he heard his work cell phone ringing. In his pants. On the floor.</p><p>Shit. Perfect fucking timing as usual.</p><p>He eased out of her and jerked his pants up, fastening them in record time. He dug for his cell phone but it\u2019d already quit ringing. Before he hit call back, he scooped up Domini\u2019s clothes and grabbed a couple of napkins from the counter. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Cam called the station and paced to the sliding glass door. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? No. That sucks. I understand. I\u2019ll be there in half an hour.\u201d He sighed and walked back to the kitchen.</p><p>Domini\u2019s hair obscured her face while she righted her dress. She didn\u2019t acknowledge him at all.</p><p>Screw that. They\u2019d had too many misunderstandings already; he\u2019d be damned if this would be another one.</p><p>Cam crowded her against the refrigerator until she looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was a pretty abrupt dismount, huh?\u201d</p><p>She allowed a smile. \u201cBut the ride was good while it lasted, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a cowboy, I\u2019m a cop. In fact, that\u2019s what the call was about. Another deputy is sick, they\u2019re shorthanded so I\u2019ve been drafted to duty.\u201d He smoothed her hair back from her face. \u201cWhich is too bad because I was kinda hoping we could hang out the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked beating me at cards that much?\u201d</p><p>I liked being with you that much. Too much. He let his lips toy with hers. \u201cI knew the sex would be smokin\u2019 hot between us.\u201d</p><p>Domini peered up at him. \u201cYou sure it wasn\u2019t...ho-hum for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo-hum? Jesus. My cock gets as hard as a fucking bullet if you so much as look at me, Domini. I\u2019ve fucked you twice in an hour. If I wasn\u2019t goin\u2019 to work, I\u2019d probably fuck you at least twice more. So ho-hum is the last goddamn way it is between us.\u201d</p><p>A flirty, smug smile tilted her lips. \u201cGood to know. You can make it up to me later. Now put your shirt on, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>Cam grabbed his uniform. He\u2019d change at the station. Once again Domini sat right next to him in the truck, constantly touching him, but not saying much.</p><p>It never failed. This shit always happened on his shift. Even when it was a fill-in shift.</p><p>Since they were short-staffed, both he and Sheriff Shortbull responded to the 10-54.</p><p>The red and blue lights threw shadows on the pavement. His patrol car sat sideways in the road, Sheriff Shortbull\u2019s patrol car sat sideways three hundred yards down from his. Between the two vehicles? A herd of cattle. Cattle, which weren\u2019t moving at all, hence the dispatch call.</p><p>Cam wiped his brow and punched the talk button on the radio. \u201cDispatch, how we coming on that cattle prod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, Deputy McKay, no one is bringing you a cattle prod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a bull whip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a negative, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just supposed to sit here and shoo them outta the road with my bare hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy, sit tight. The owner is en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been saying that for thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have an issue with the time frame, Deputy McKay, I suggest you bring it up with your cousin, Luke McKay, once he arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen-four.\u201d</p><p>Cam tossed the handset on the seat. Headlights bobbing up the road caught his eye. Too close together to be a truck. He waited and a big Yamaha four-wheeler parked. The driver ripped off the helmet and long brown hair spilled out.</p><p>\u201cJessie? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I thought Luke was coming?\u201d Cam said.</p><p>\u201cSo did I, but apparently he\u2019s screwing around again, who knows when he\u2019ll make an appearance. You guys have better things to do than to look after our cattle. Especially since Luke was supposed to fix this section of fence last week so this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you guys are busy, we just don\u2019t want anyone getting hurt.\u201d Two years previous, loose cattle wandering into the road had caused the deaths of a young married couple and their baby. Escaped cattle were a fact of life in Wyoming, but a fact that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>Jessie reached into the back of the ATV and extracted an enormous pair of bolt cutters. \u201cI\u2019ll cut that bad section of fence away so I can herd the cattle back through it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to hear his opinion on her solution; she just took off on foot. Five minutes later she returned and tossed the cutters in the back end.</p><p>\u201cIf you guys turn on your sirens, the noise will make them uneasy and I can probably get them rounded up easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Cam whistled at the sheriff and relayed the message. Once the sirens were on full blast, the cattle began to get restless. They started to move when Jessie honked and circled them with the ATV. She chased one cow through the broken fence line as a signal for the rest of the cattle to follow.</p><p>Within twenty minutes, steaming piles of cow shit were all that was left. Sheriff Shortbull drove off. Just as Cam rounded the front end of the patrol car, another set of headlights approached. The truck parked and the owner jumped from the cab, leaving the vehicle running.</p><p>Cam wasn\u2019t particularly surprised to see his cousin, Luke McKay. Although Cam had always gotten along fine with Luke, the man\u2019s late appearance rankled.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cam. Did you round up my cattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we waited on you, but Jessie handled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie?\u201d Luke\u2019s laugh sounded bitter. \u201cGotta hand it to her, sometimes that girl shows all sorts of gumption.\u201d</p><p>Cam waited for Luke to clarify the condescending comment, and when he didn\u2019t, Cam said, \u201cGumption or not, Jessie had it under control in no time flat.\u201d No thanks to you. \u201cYou should be proud of her for handling it when you weren\u2019t around.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly freakin\u2019 wait for the silent treatment the next week because she had to handle it.\u201d Luke rubbed the section of skin between his eyebrows. \u201cBe the smart one in the family, Cam, since you\u2019re the last of your brothers who ain\u2019t wrapped that ball and chain around your ankle. Don\u2019t get married. Ever.\u201d</p><p>That shocked the crap out of Cam. He had no clue what he was supposed to say. Luke and Jessie had only been married a couple of years and they were already having problems?</p><p>You\u2019d know what was going on if you kept up with family business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke squinted at the gaping hole in the fence line. \u201cI suppose she\u2019ll give me hell about that too.\u201d</p><p>Cam thought Luke deserved all kinds of hell, but he didn\u2019t see sweet, soft-spoken Jessie standing up to him. \u201cHow long has the fence been down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Luke\u2019s gaze snapped back to his. \u201cDid Jessie say something to you about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got eyes, cuz. I\u2019ll remind you the rest of your damn fences can be falling down all over the place, but it\u2019s your responsibility as a landowner on this section of highway to keep these fences maintained. It\u2019s dangerous to let \u2019em go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe you oughta mention that responsibility to your brother, Cord, as there are plenty of rickety-ass sections of fence line runnin\u2019 along his portion of the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will mention it to him, trust me. Meantime, if this fence isn\u2019t fixed within forty-eight hours, I will ticket you, Luke, count on it.\u201d</p><p>Luke didn\u2019t snap off another comment. He merely nodded, climbed in his truck, and roared off.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Ah, the glamorous, exciting life of a single woman.</p><p>Domini had scrubbed her apartment from top to bottom and finished laundry. Then she\u2019d indulged in a long, hot bath in perfumed water. For dinner she\u2019d grilled a juicy steak, loaded a baked sweet potato with butter and brown sugar, poured a glass of Shiraz and finished off the meal with a slice of chocolate peanut-butter pie.</p><p>Normally she\u2019d consider that a perfect day. The sense of accomplishment balanced with a touch of personal indulgence. But after spending yesterday afternoon hanging out with Cam McKay, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling her life lacked something.</p><p>Was it just sex? Or was it something scarier? Like the beginning of a relationship?</p><p>Nah. Definitely sex. Cam was a confirmed bachelor. He wasn\u2019t looking for a white picket fence, a wife and two point five kids any more than she was.</p><p>Not that she could pop out even the point five portion of a kid. Was that why she\u2019d gone off on a tangent about the evils of marriage? Probably. She excelled at deflection. She swirled the claret-colored liquid, studying the light refraction in the crystal facets of the wineglass.</p><p>Soft rapping jarred her out of her melancholy. She straightened the lapels of her silk robe as she strode to the door.</p><p>\u201cDomini? It\u2019s Cam.\u201d</p><p>She unlocked the deadbolt. Man, he looked positively lip smacking in his uniform.</p><p>Cam smiled. \u201cHey. I was hopin\u2019 you were still up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to head off to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t say stuff like that to me. It gives a man all sorts of ideas.\u201d His eyes traced the V neckline of her robe. \u201cWhatcha wearing under that silky robe?\u201d</p><p>Her pulse spiked. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>That was all the invitation Cam needed. Before she blinked, his hands cupped her face and his mouth was hungry on hers.</p><p>Domini\u2019s body seemed to go completely boneless.</p> <p>The kiss evolved from ravenous to seductive. His hands drifted. One lightly circled her throat as he idly swept his thumb back and forth over the pulse point. The other slipped straight down the center of her body. His middle finger coaxed her clit.</p><p>She must\u2019ve moaned because Cam ended the kiss, but he didn\u2019t move his hands. He kept fondling her, gauging how each stroke between her legs caused her pulse to jump beneath his thumb.</p><p>Domini wanted to demand he quit playing and whisk her off to bed. But this was a test of her obedience. She forced herself to stay still.</p><p>His breath tickled her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve a mind to reward such good behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d escaped before she could bite it back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Cam nuzzled her jawline. \u201cI need you to do something for me. Dig out a scarf or two. Something that\u2019s soft and won\u2019t chafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChafe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis beautiful skin of yours.\u201d He paused, allowing that to sink in. \u201cAfter you find what I need, wait on the bed.\u201d Cam pecked her on the mouth and stepped back.</p><p>She chanced a look at his face.</p><p>The lust burning in his eyes stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he rasped, \u201cbefore you make me lose my ever lovin\u2019 mind and I fuck you standing up right here.\u201d</p><p>The robe flapped around Domini\u2019s hips and she forced herself to take measured steps to her bedroom. She frenetically searched her dresser drawers for the articles of clothing he\u2019d demanded.</p><p>Demanded. Oh wow. Was she really ready for this?</p><p>If the swollen folds of her pussy and the slickness coating the inside of her legs were any indication, the answer was a categorical yes.</p><p>She unearthed a striped silk scarf and one crafted from combed cotton with fringe dangling from the edges. She\u2019d just seated herself on the edge of the bed when Cam sauntered in.</p><p>He still wore his uniform. No matter how sexy and commanding Cam looked in his deputy duds, she wished he\u2019d taken them off.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a look I love to see on your face. No fear. Just anticipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019d cut off a limb before I\u2019d ever hurt you, but that seems a little farfetched coming from me, huh?\u201d Cam tugged the satin tie free from her robe. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need this one too. Stand up and turn around.\u201d</p><p>The first thing he did was tie the satin scarf around her eyes. She tried not to panic at the sudden darkness and the sense that nothing was familiar\u2014even in her own bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTell me if you can see at all. Light, anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the dog bite scar on her bare shoulder as he used the tie from her robe to bind her wrists behind her back. \u201cHang tight.\u201d</p><p>Domini heard the soft rustle of clothes. Would she finally get an up close and personal view of Cam\u2019s body?</p><p>Shoot. She was blindfolded.</p><p>\u201cClimb on the bed and lay on your back, facing the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>She struggled with the position.</p><p>\u201cTip your head off the end of the bed. Good. Stay just like that.\u201d</p><p>Domini flinched when his hands palmed her breasts and his cool lips landed between her belly button and the start of her bikini line. Then she smelled the heady, intoxicating male aroma that was uniquely Cam.</p><p>\u201cPart those pretty pink lips for me.\u201d</p><p>The instant her lips parted, the bulbous tip of his cock forced her mouth open wider. That thick, male hardness brushed the soft palate on the roof of her mouth, slid over her tongue, and stopped when it hit the back of her throat.</p><p>The gag reflex wasn\u2019t as pronounced in this position and she managed to swallow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Breathe through your nose. Jesus, it\u2019s hot as hell seeing you take me this way. It keeps your neck arched at the perfect angle when your hands are underneath you.\u201d</p><p>At her humming noise of agreement, he hissed in a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me. All of me. Which means I\u2019m gonna pick up speed.\u201d As Cam pulled out with every fast stroke, his hand dipped between her thighs. \u201cExtend your legs so I can touch you.\u201d</p><p>Coherent thoughts deserted her as Cam\u2019s cock shuttled in and out of her mouth, and her face was pressing into his groin. She couldn\u2019t see. She couldn\u2019t move. She had to remember to breathe. She couldn\u2019t do anything but feel.</p><p>And oh what a feeling, she\u2019d never been so thoroughly...taken. So thoroughly controlled.</p><p>Cam traced the outline of her pussy lips and plunged one finger into her core. She bowed up only to get his hand planted in the center of her chest, pushing her back down.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I\u2019ll get you there. This is part of surrender. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as his words took meaning, he added another finger and matched the rhythm in her pussy to how he fucked her mouth. \u201cSo wet for me. You\u2019re liking this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Enjoying her own helplessness was as shocking as her quick acceptance of how much her submission pleased Cam.</p><p>He withdrew his fingers from her cunt and began to pinch her nipples. Harder than she was used to, but she existed on a whole new plane of sensation, part pleasure, part pain.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I wanna feel those gorgeous throat muscles teasing my dick as you swallow every drop of my seed, I want to see my come marking you.\u201d</p><p>At his visual, Domini sucked harder. With his cock halfway out, she used her teeth on the sensitive rim lining the head. She relaxed her jaw when his pelvis thrust and he buried his cock balls deep in her throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck. I\u2019m not gonna last.\u201d</p><p>His cock disappeared from her mouth and she heard the fast slap slap slap of Cam\u2019s fist beating on his shaft as he jacked off. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>A guttural groan rumbled, followed by warm liquid splattering on her stomach and nipples. One droplet landed on her chin. Given the angle of her head, the sticky bead rolled to the curve of her lower lip. Domini\u2019s tongue darted out and she moaned at the salty proof of Cam\u2019s passion.</p><p>He swore and his thumb smeared more come over her lips. \u201cLick it off.\u201d His harsh breathing echoed above her. She sensed him gloating at the image of his come cooling on her skin.</p><p>Before Domini could speak, Cam pushed her upright. He licked the shell of her ear and his hands tracked her bound arms from her shoulders to her wrists. \u201cSweet Domini, who has a hankering to be dominated, I am so gonna fuck you until you scream. But first\u2014\u201d he tugged her arms down and sank his teeth into the nape of her neck, \u201c\u2014I\u2019m gonna play hard and dirty with you.\u201d</p><p>A whimper escaped.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d Cam rolled her to her side, then he hiked her hips up. Way up. He managed to wedge a pillow under her knees, arranging her at the angle he preferred.</p><p>Domini gasped for breath beneath the mass of hair covering her face. Her cheek was pressed into the comforter. Her ass, her pussy\u2014every intimate inch of her was completely exposed. She should be blushing, but the buzz of anticipation overruled any other feeling besides need.</p><p>His gentle hands brushed the tangles free from her damp face, allowing her to suck in a lungful of air. With sweetness and tenderness, he kissed her temple, letting his warm lips follow the curve of her jaw before he retreated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wait for his next move was excruciating. Her body throbbed with pent-up sexual need. Cam wouldn\u2019t hurt her, but she figured he\u2019d drive her to the point where she needed to come so badly it might actually hurt.</p><p>Without warning, the fringed end of the scarf swept across the bottoms of her feet, then her calves and the backs of her thighs. Cam arced the scarf so it tickled the outside of her hips, the inside of her arms and her shoulder blades. The change in his demeanor from demanding to teasing didn\u2019t calm her; it electrified her. With each lingering pass of the fringe, new goose bumps arose. Did Cam plan on changing things up with a dreamy, lazy bout of lovemaking?</p><p>His big hands landed on her ass with a loud smack.</p><p>Domini jumped.</p><p>Then Cam\u2019s fingers were holding her pussy open so he could lick her sex. The wet sounds of his sucking kisses caused her belly to quiver and sent another rush of cream flowing into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI could lick these sweet juices from you all damn night. I lose my mind when I hear your sexy squeaks and moans when I\u2019m tasting you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was everywhere. His teeth, oh man, the gentle scrape of his teeth across her clit brought every bit of her body\u2019s focus to that throbbing bundle of nerves.</p><p>He stopped his intense attention and licked straight up the crack of her ass, rubbing his face over her butt cheeks, first one side, then the other. The razor stubble felt coarse on her skin, which was in direct contrast to the soft kisses and hot breath he bestowed to every inch. Of her butt.</p><p>\u201cDamn I love your ass. I wanna bite it.\u201d He sank his teeth into her left butt cheek. \u201cI wanna feel every curve of it on my face.\u201d Cam rubbed his cheek and chin from the top of her right hip and down to the back of her right thigh. \u201cI wanna kiss it.\u201d He placed loud smacking kisses on each butt cheek. \u201cI wanna lick it.\u201d Once again his tongue traced the crack. When his tongue met the hidden pucker, he swirled the very tip around it.</p><p>Domini gasped. Loudly. She\u2019d never... Lord she couldn\u2019t think straight. It felt so strange. So naughty.</p><p>So damn good.</p><p>\u201cBut mostly I wanna mark this ass as mine, Domini. I wanna suck it, fuck it, spank it.\u201d He used the flat of his tongue to slowly lick down.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d burst out on a breathy sigh, before Domini realized it wasn\u2019t really a question.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my obedient girl.\u201d Cam buried his face in her pussy, zeroing in on her clit. The delicate butterfly licks morphed into continual sucking.</p><p>Her limbs shook. She was so primed that the orgasm didn\u2019t build slowly; it blindsided her. Starting at full throttle and escalating to warp speed.</p><p>And Cam didn\u2019t let up. She didn\u2019t know how he took a breath because the angle of his head seemed all wrong, but man-oh-man was it ever right.</p><p>After the last orgasmic twinge, Cam knocked the pillow from beneath her knees, and scooted her lower half off the edge of the mattress. With the pillow bracing her belly, he canted her hips and impaled her.</p><p>\u201cYou feel good. So wet and tight, like you were made to take me like this.\u201d Cam\u2019s hips hammered into her.</p><p>Covered in sweat, shaking from head to toe, surrounded by the slap of flesh meeting flesh and the intimacy of total darkness, Domini was dangling by a thread again.</p><p>Cam sensed it. He jerked on her restrained wrists, lifting her upper body off the bed as he kept fucking her. \u201cCome for me again. Come hard. Lemme hear you.\u201d</p><p>Her clitoris rubbed on the pillow and matched the cadence of his energetic thrusts. She was blind and bound to everything but the pleasure bombarding her from all sides. It was too much.</p><p>Domini flat out screamed as the orgasm rocketed through her, setting every nerve ending in her body to the same frequency as the vibrations shocking her from head to toe. Never in her life had she experienced something so earth-shattering. A feeling so addictive she\u2019d do anything to have it again and again.</p> <p>Cam\u2019s primal roar followed and the heat of his ejaculate prompted another tiny orgasm to flare, which he prolonged with short snaps of his hips.</p><p>She went limp as the synapses in her brain shorted out. Cam released his hold on her. After she fell face first on the mattress, Cam withdrew and a rush of wetness trickled down the inside of her thigh.</p><p>Undone. She was completely spent. He\u2019d most likely ruined her for all other men the sex was so volatile. In the hazy aftermath of such explosive passion, she heard the sound of clothing being righted.</p><p>No. That couldn\u2019t be right. Cam wasn\u2019t just...leaving after he\u2019d screwed her nearly unconscious, was he?</p><p>He tugged the robe tie, freeing her arms. He massaged her shoulders and slid the silk scarf off her eyes.</p><p>Blinking several times, Domini let Cam roll her onto her back. Very gingerly, he untangled the strands of her hair covering her face. Then his thumb followed the arch of her eyebrow as he cradled her head in his hand. \u201cJesus, Domini. You\u2019re beautiful. You stun me.\u201d</p><p>Not what she was expecting. Nor did she anticipate his achingly gentle kiss that lingered on her mouth and seemed to seep into her soul.</p><p>Domini lifted her hand, needing to touch him, but the second her fingers connected with the scar, he retreated.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said, as if he were trying to convince himself. \u201cSleep well and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Before she pushed herself upright, she heard the door close and he was gone.</p><p>What the hell had just happened?</p><p>She\u2019d done everything he\u2019d demanded or asked of her\u2014true, she\u2019d done it because she\u2019d wanted to, not just because he\u2019d commandeered her sexual responses as his right.</p><p>Why had Cam dressed fast and raced out like he suddenly remembered he had another engagement?</p><p>Dressed. Wait a minute. That was the third time they\u2019d had sex. The fourth time they\u2019d had sexual contact if she counted the time they\u2019d messed around on the couch. By all rights she should\u2019ve already explored his remarkable body. Sucked his nipples and raked her fingernails down his muscular back. Licked the bulging muscles in his arms. Traced his rippled six-pack abs with her tongue. Kissed her way from his belly button to his hipbones. Scraped her nails down his thighs. Nibbled on his knees. Tested his feet to see if they were ticklish.</p><p>Knees and feet? Cam only has one knee and one foot.</p><p>Domini clapped her hand over her mouth as the truth jarred her. His reaction tonight wasn\u2019t an oversight in a moment of passion; it\u2019d been calculated, like all their sexual encounters had been.</p><p>Cam, that sneaky jerk, didn\u2019t want her to see his prosthesis. Tonight he\u2019d blindfolded her so when he did strip down, she couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Domini tried to wrap her head around the fact he always bent her over the closest horizontal surface. He\u2019d not allowed additional touching, no eye contact. And by bending her over, three freakin\u2019 times now, she wouldn\u2019t feel the difference of his artificial leg as he pounded into her from behind. She\u2019d just remember how hot and kinky it was that he fucked her so thoroughly.</p><p>Don\u2019t move. Keep your hands just like that.</p><p>If he commanded her during the actual act of sex as well as foreplay, then she\u2019d be less inclined to disobey and reach back to grab his thigh. Or the stump where his thigh used to be.</p><p>Damn him. Cam could continue keeping her off balance by seeing to her sexual needs, especially when she\u2019d already given him control. Was Cam hoping all Domini would remember in the aftermath when she was alone was the blazing hot sex?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well, she had news for him. Not happening. Next time he\u2019d come to her honestly, with the same trust she\u2019d shown him, the same willingness to put himself out there, or he wouldn\u2019t come to her at all.</p><p>And neither of them would come.</p><p>Domini grabbed her robe off the floor and hoped a shower would cool her burst of anger.</p><p>But somehow she doubted it.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cDomini, can I have a glass of milk?\u201d</p><p>She set the blue marker in the crack of the coloring book. \u201cPretty soon you\u2019ll start mooing.\u201d</p><p>Anton shrugged. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>She ruffled his blond hair. \u201cTo be honest, your milk addiction gives me an excuse to keep cookies around.\u201d She filled Anton\u2019s favorite Denver Broncos mug. As she plunked it on the table, she peered over his shoulder at what he\u2019d been working on with such diligence.</p><p>Her jaw dropped. She\u2019d always considered Anton\u2019s artistic skills advanced for a seven-year-old boy, but this was beyond anything she\u2019d seen so far. It was a pencil drawing of the road leading out of town. In the left hand corner was a small rendering of the building she lived in, which had a glow about it.</p><p>The depth perception was incredible, the telephone poles, the fence line, the pavement decreased in size and breadth, fading away until it was barely a speck. The landscape was stark and minimal, but it was the overall tone of the picture that left Domini feeling bleak.</p><p>Did Anton feel that way? Or was this just a picture?</p><p>Domini realized he\u2019d gone utterly still. Was he waiting for her to criticize his work? \u201cAnton, this is amazing. Did you just do that today?\u201d</p><p>He reached for his milk and his legs began to swing under the table again. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have it when you\u2019re done with it?\u201d</p><p>A beat of hesitation, then, \u201cYou really want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause it\u2019s not happy. My mom only wants the happy pictures I draw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like all kinds of pictures.\u201d Domini couldn\u2019t resist smoothing his cowlick. \u201cWhat were you thinking about when you drew this?\u201d</p><p>Another drink of milk. \u201cSometimes I watch out the back window when mom is driving home. I keep watching until your building is tiny. Just like this.\u201d He pointed at the drawing. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you because I miss you.\u201d He paused and said softly, \u201cI wish you still lived with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too. But I understand why your mom wanted to have a place for just the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Anton\u2019s head whipped up. His pale blue eyes shone with accusation. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t just the two of us. He comes over all the time now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Domini froze. Only one nameless he in Anton\u2019s life. \u201cYour father has been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetcha she didn\u2019t tell you that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Nadia and Rex. There was a good reason Nadia kept her contact with her ex to the absolute minimum\u2014the man was an abusive asshole. \u201cIs she trying to make you spend time with him?\u201d</p> <p>His shoulder lifted. \u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t talk to me at all, but I don\u2019t care. Really. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Although she was upset with Nadia, she pasted on a smile for Anton. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s letting you spend time with me, even if my artistic skills are limited to coloring inside the lines.\u201d</p><p>Anton hopped up and used a magnet to attach the picture to the fridge.</p><p>Domini set her hands on his shoulders. \u201cLooks good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Anton cranked his head around and smirked. \u201cSo were you lyin\u2019 about the cookies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk about impatient.\u201d She snagged a cookie from the breadbox and slid it into the microwave, so the dough would be warm and the chips inside gooey, just the way Anton liked it.</p><p>After the snack, they watched TV. Domini covered Anton up with an afghan when he conked out.</p><p>About ten o\u2019clock, Nadia knocked on the door. \u201cIs he asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You want a cup of tea before you go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Nadia dropped into a dining room chair with a heavy sigh.</p><p>Domini turned up the kettle and gathered her thoughts as she lined up mugs, sugar cubes and milk. She poured and sat across from her friend.</p> <p>She and Nadia had met in Sundance right after Domini relocated. At the time, Nadia had been in an abusive relationship with her ex-husband, desperate to get out. After Nadia wised up, left the man and filed for divorce, she and Anton had moved in with Domini.</p><p>Things had worked out well as roommates, but something changed and Nadia started hinting about finding a new place to live for just her and her son.</p><p>Around that same time, India Ellison married Colt McKay, and the apartment above the restaurant sat vacant. Domini let Nadia take over the lease on the house they rented and moved out. It eased her loneliness that she saw Anton frequently, but the close relationship she shared with Nadia had cooled considerably. Now Domini knew why.</p><p>Nadia sighed after the first sip of tea. \u201cI miss having tea with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Domini fingered the handle of her mug, dreading this conversation. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Anton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem the same the last couple times I\u2019ve seen him. Tonight he told me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nadia asked sharply.</p> <p>Domini\u2019s eyes connected with Nadia\u2019s. \u201cThat Rex has been coming around a lot lately. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Normally the \u201cstay out of it\u201d train of thought won out and Domini would shut her mouth and seethe in silence. Not this time. \u201cDo you really need me to remind you that Rex used to beat you? And verbally abuse you? And a big part of the reason you left him was because you were worried about Anton\u2019s safety?\u201d</p><p>When Nadia\u2019s gaze fell, Domini\u2019s hopes fell right along with it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>No he hasn\u2019t! Domini bit the words back even when it seemed she\u2019d choke on them.</p><p>\u201cHe loves me. He wants me back. He wants us to be a family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about what Anton wants? Does that matter to you at all?\u201d</p><p>Nadia became defiant. \u201cAnton is seven years old. Rex is Anton\u2019s father. He has a right to know his son. And Anton needs to get to know his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if that means going back into an unsafe situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unsafe. He\u2019s changed,\u201d Nadia repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cThis man threatened to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was in the past.\u201d</p><p>Domini dug her fingernails into her palms to keep from grabbing Nadia and shaking her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asked me to give him another chance,\u201d Nadia said softly. \u201cI\u2019m just supposed to say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you should say no. I\u2019d say no.\u201d</p><p>Nadia drained her tea. \u201cI\u2019m not you. I\u2019m tired of being alone, Domini. Maybe if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing, it\u2019s not so bad, living alone all the time. But I do know what I\u2019m missing. I want someone to hold me. I want an adult to talk to at the end of the day. I want to share my life with someone. We have a history. That means something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a violent history,\u201d Domini retorted. \u201cAnd if I remember correctly, he used to hold you down and smack you. That is not holding you, Nadia. Is that really what you want? For yourself? For Anton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Nadia stood stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m tired. Thanks for watching my son tonight.\u201d</p><p>Domini wanted to keep the dialogue open, but she knew Nadia well enough to recognize the conversation was over. She swallowed her anger. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I love having him. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Nadia\u2019s defiant posture softened. \u201cI do. Sometimes I think you\u2019ve been his mother more than I have been.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like something Nadia would say; that sounded like something Rex would say to undermine Nadia\u2019s confidence. But pointing it out would be...pointless.</p><p>At the doorway, Anton hugged Domini fiercely before allowing his mother to lead him out into the night.</p><p>As Domini tidied up the kitchen, her gaze landed on the picture on the refrigerator. Was Anton facing backward in the car, watching her building disappear? Fearing she\u2019d disappear?</p><p>A sob escaped. She slid to the floor, curled into a ball and cried, not for herself, but for the little boy who\u2019d bear the brunt of his mother\u2019s bad decision.</p><p>Her cell phone buzzed in her back pocket, jarring her out of her crying jag. She dug the phone out and stared at the caller ID. Cam. She debated on answering, but if she let the call roll to voicemail, he\u2019d stop by to check on her. She couldn\u2019t face him right now. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Sorry to be calling so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You sound like you\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>The man had radar-like instincts when it came to reading her emotions. Part of being a cop? Or part of being so tuned in to her needs?</p><p>Right. Wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cCam, it\u2019s been a long day, but I appreciate the good night call. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hang up on me.\u201d</p><p>Domini sighed. \u201cLook, Cam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in five goddamn minutes. Stay put. I mean it.\u201d Then he hung up on her.</p><p>Pushy jerk.</p><p>By the time Cam arrived, Domini had worked herself up into a rare frenzy. She flung open the apartment door before he knocked. Once he was inside, she sidestepped him before he had a chance to grab her, kiss her, and cool down her temper.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think something happened?\u201d she volleyed back.</p><p>Cam lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWell, for starters, you\u2019re pacing and snapping like a dog on a leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you did not just compare me to a dog.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cShit. Sorry. But you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened. Then shut.</p><p>Domini scanned his clothes. Sweat pants. Tight T-shirt, the armpits and neck hole ringed with sweat. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking out with Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt waits until Hudson and Indy are asleep before he comes to town. So are you gonna tell me what\u2019s wrong? Or are you gonna keep changing the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, princess, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I knew you wouldn\u2019t ask me.\u201d</p><p>The soft concern in Cam\u2019s eyes did her in. Tears fell again. Before her sobs became incoherent, Cam enclosed her in his arms. He stroked her hair as he rained kisses on the crown of her head. \u201cTalk to me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t be such a pushover. You\u2019ll never tell him what\u2019s bugging you if he\u2019s touching you.</p><p>She wiped her eyes and attempted to retreat but Cam wouldn\u2019t release her.</p><p>\u201cNo harm in letting me hold you until you calm down, is there?\u201d</p><p>Yes. I\u2019ll start to depend on you for comfort and support and that\u2019s never turned out well for me.</p><p>Domini squirmed away. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk to me. You watched Anton tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe was really quiet. He\u2019s been that way the last couple times I\u2019ve seen him. So he let it slip his father has started coming around again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t have to explain to Cam what a bastard Rex DeMarco was. The man had harassed her a couple of times when she\u2019d lived with Nadia and Anton. But Rex was smart and careful enough not to step over the legal line.</p><p>\u201cI asked Nadia and she admitted she\u2019s considering reconciling with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNadia claims he\u2019s changed. He quit drinking. Now he wants them to be one big happy family. She just doesn\u2019t see it. Men like him don\u2019t change.\u201d Her eyes searched Cam\u2019s. \u201cDo you think he can change?\u201d</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s a tricky question. Even my own family didn\u2019t believe my brother Colt had changed. Only recently have they accepted Colt is not the same guy he was. So on one hand, yes, I honestly believe some people can change. But this guy? My gut reaction is no. Rex has way too many issues, coupled with a history of violence and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Nadia had you as a roommate, Rex didn\u2019t have much chance to be alone with her. My worry was for you in case he decided to push this issue. So I was goddamn glad to hear you\u2019d gotten out of that dangerous situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The warmth of Cam\u2019s concern didn\u2019t loosen the fear knotting her belly. \u201cNadia said she\u2019s lonely. She claims I don\u2019t understand loneliness because I\u2019ve never been in a long-term relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people are lonely even in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! So it\u2019s ridiculous and sad and...stupid she\u2019s willing to go back to a man who beat her just because she doesn\u2019t want to watch TV alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s why this asshole doesn\u2019t want you around her, influencing her to think for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this. I hate that she\u2019s putting Anton\u2019s needs last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would put Anton\u2019s needs first.\u201d Cam\u2019s fingers caressed the side of her face so tenderly she felt tears welling again. \u201cHe\u2019s been blessed to have you in his life, Domini.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been blessed. She loved that sweet little boy. He was the closest she\u2019d get to having a child of her own. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now can I kiss you hello?\u201d</p> <p>Domini parted her lips and Cam\u2019s velvety hot tongue slipped inside her mouth. She wanted to make love with him like this\u2014face to face, skin to skin, mouth on mouth.</p><p>After scrambling her brain for several tongue tangling minutes, he broke the kiss. \u201cBedroom. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to drag it out.\u201d Her hands floated down his chest. \u201cStrip you slowly. Lick and taste and tease you all over. Maybe you should make me do it.\u201d</p><p>His body went stone still. Then his voice was low, warm and persistent in her ear. \u201cI said bed. Now. We do this my way. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Domini recognized this wasn\u2019t about sexual control with Cam. Heck, it wasn\u2019t even about her. She stepped back and challenged, \u201cAnd how is your way, Cam? With me bent over the table, or against the refrigerator, or on my knees, or draped face first across the bed? Or are we actually going to have sex some other way for a change?\u201d</p><p>His eyes tapered to fine points. \u201cFor a change? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p> <p>It was difficult to stay the course, faced with his angry surprise, but she dug in her heels, bracing for a fight. \u201cEvery time, every single time we\u2019ve had sex, it\u2019s been from behind. I\u2019ve never kissed you, or whispered in your ear, or even touched you when you got me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a complaint?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t back down. She notched her chin higher. \u201cYes. I guess it is.\u201d</p><p>Color dotted his cheekbones and his eyes glittered with something that looked like resentment, but she suspected was embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you wanted to surrender to me, Domini. Me. Which means I get to call the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently that also means you get to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you naked. Never. You can blame it on being tied up or blindfolded or whatever you did to restrain me, but the truth is: you\u2019re hiding yourself from me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve opened myself up to you, Cam. More than I ever have with any man. And while I\u2019m grateful you proved my trust in you was justified, I know you don\u2019t feel the same about me.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw jumped as he stared at her with those hard, dark, cop eyes that scared the crap out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me, do you?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Domini purposely let her gaze drop to his left thigh. She let it linger before she looked at him again. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll laugh when I see your prosthesis? Or are you afraid I\u2019d be grossed out by your missing leg and run? Help me understand, Cam, because as much as I like you and trust you, I can\u2019t do this anymore. It\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d</p><p>Two-hundred-odd pounds of aggressive, challenged male was right in her face. \u201cWhy are you pushing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need it.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>The air stayed still and quiet.</p><p>It broke Domini\u2019s heart to see him retreat. To watch that strong, chiseled face lower to his chest, almost in defeat.</p><p>After a couple minutes passed, Cam said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat again; she breathed again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hidden my injury, my stump, my disability, whatever the hell you wanna call it, from everyone, not just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt embarrasses me that I\u2019m...broken. Most the time when I\u2019m wearing the prosthesis and it\u2019s covered with regular clothes I can pretend I\u2019m normal. But when that shit is off and I\u2019m completely naked? I see I\u2019m not a whole man. I can\u2019t lie to myself. And I sure as hell can\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><p>His anguished tone nearly broke her resolve. Be strong for him now because he needs it.</p><p>\u201cThe only person in my family who\u2019s seen it is Keely. And that\u2019s only because she moved to Cheyenne and became my personal physical therapist. She kept everyone in our family away. She helped me deal with all the doctors and the prosthetic specialists, the millions of prostheses fittings, the excruciating rehab and learning to walk again. She...pushed me.</p><p>\u201cKeely wouldn\u2019t let me give up even when I wanted to give up on myself.\u201d He briefly squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cJesus, did I want to just fucking hide myself and my ugly stump from the world.\u201d</p><p>Even though Domini ached to go to him, she stayed put.</p><p>\u201cAfter a few months of Keely working her \u2018rah rah you can do anything\u2019 magic on me, I tried to reclaim the sexually charged guy I\u2019d been.\u201d He laughed bitterly. \u201cWhat a joke. I had sex one time after I had the hang of walking on my prosthesis. One. Fucking. Time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got her clothes off. I went down on her. She came. I thought all was going great...then she reached for the button on my jeans and I totally fucking panicked. I mean, the type of panic that\u2019s pure debilitating fear. I knew I should\u2019ve told her about my stump. I knew I should\u2019ve practiced getting naked because when faced with it with a stranger the first time...I couldn\u2019t fucking do it.\u201d</p><p>Domini was well versed in those types of panic attacks, but she still didn\u2019t go to him. He needed to get this all out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, what a fucking loser I am. Somehow, I managed to pull it together and insisted we do it from behind. I only dropped my pants far enough she felt my cock and a little of my upper thighs. I fucked her fast and left. She probably never knew. But I did. The worst part was I realized I\u2019d never be the same man. I\u2019d be half a man. I never wanted to try again...until I met you.\u201d</p><p>A million thoughts raced around in her head and she couldn\u2019t seem to voice a single one.</p><p>Finally, Cam said, \u201cSay something. Your silence is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as encouraging as it is that you want to return to being that sexually charged man with me, you\u2019ve still been selfish.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>No doubt he\u2019d expected her to coo sympathy. To be sweet, soft-spoken and pat him on the head while clucking there there, it\u2019ll be all right little soldier, all is forgiven.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>\u201cNot sharing your body or yourself with me is selfish. Oh, I understand you wanting to maintain the illusion of male perfection, but know something? I don\u2019t want an illusion, Cam. I want a real man. I want you. I don\u2019t care what kind of lover you used to be. I care what kind of lover you are now. And I can\u2019t be the kind of lover you need if the only part of you I\u2019m allowed access to is your cock.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with absolute shock.</p><p>\u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Usually you\u2019re so s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say shy I\u2019ll brain you,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled slyly. \u201cI was gonna say subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am subtle and diplomatic most of the time, but there comes a point where in your face is the only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Miss In-Your-Face, have I fucked this up completely by being a selfish and clueless dickhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by a long shot. Not since you\u2019re willing to admit some things need to be different between us.\u201d</p><p>Cam released a long, slow breath. \u201cThank you. I...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He laughed self-consciously. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Humbling, that this formidable man looked to her for direction. The sudden boost of confidence allowed her to erase the distance between them. She twined her arms around his neck and held him until he stopped shaking. \u201cFirst we get completely naked. Then we see how smokin\u2019 hot it is to have sex in missionary position. Then we test out my cowgirl skills as I ride you. All within the parameters of your control, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound like a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the best plan I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Cam lowered his head and kissed her stupid.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Sweet baby Jesus. If Cam was crazy about Domini before, it was nothing\u2014nothing\u2014compared to the way he felt about her now.</p><p>He flat out fucking loved her.</p><p>Loved. Her.</p><p>The woman had guts. No one in his life said shit like that to him. Not even his in-your-face sister, not even at his lowest point. And the hell of it was she\u2019d been exactly right. He had been a selfish bastard in bed. Even Domini\u2019s surrender had been about him.</p><p>No more. He would lay himself bare for her. Completely. He ripped his mouth away and mumbled, \u201cStay with me tonight. At my house. All night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It depends on a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the spike of fear and said, \u201cAnything. Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can I touch you as much as I want? Because I have a lot of catching up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you can handle.\u201d</p><p>Cam tried to remain calm at the thought of her waking up and staring at his stump while he was still asleep.</p><p>This is about trust. You have to start someplace or you\u2019ll lose her and never have to worry about her staring at any part of you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He headed downstairs and waited for her while she grabbed her stuff.</p><p>She bounded around the front end of his truck. Moonlight glinted off her hair, making her look like a goddess. An angel.</p><p>Mine, roared in his head, she\u2019s all mine.</p> <p>Not that Miss I\u2019m-Never-Getting-Married would appreciate his claim on her.</p><p>Domini climbed in, scooting right next to him like she always did. He grinned. She was cuddly as a kitten. Oh yeah, this woman was most definitely his, whether she knew it yet or not, whether she liked it or not.</p><p>On the drive Cam draped his arm across the back of the seat and his fingers toyed with her hair.</p><p>She said, \u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Do you think that makes me a pussy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I think it makes you real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning...I sort of lied when I said I wasn\u2019t afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Cam frowned.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you scare me, the larger than life persona. Cam McKay, the injured war hero. The model cop. The dutiful son and brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re makin\u2019 me sound like John Wayne or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I am who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who I want.\u201d</p><p>He nudged her shoulder. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t have some sweet-talkin\u2019 cowboy heritage hiding in that Ukrainian background?\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>When they pulled up to his house, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you inside but I\u2019ve gotta take care of Gracie first.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence followed and then she blurted, \u201cCan I come with?\u201d</p><p>Cam squinted at her. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. Sure. You\u2019re facing your fears tonight, maybe I should face mine too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you scare me, Domini Katzinski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019m so in love with you that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll do anything to keep you forever.</p><p>\u201cCam? Are you going to answer me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Gracie was penned in the backyard. Although Domini winced when she heard the happy yips, she trucked along.</p><p>\u201cHey Gracie. Sit. Good girl.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at Domini. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t going to chew it off, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. However, she probably will slobber all over it.\u201d</p><p>Domini held very still as Cam guided her hand through the chain link fence. Gracie sniffed. And sniffed. Then she whimpered and licked Domini\u2019s palm. \u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>She petted Gracie as if she\u2019d done it a million times before, but he knew what a huge leap of faith it was for her. Cam said, \u201cGo inside. I\u2019ll finish up and be right there.\u201d</p><p>He cleaned up before he headed to his bedroom. Damn. His heart was pounding something fierce. He froze in the doorjamb at the sight of Domini stripped to nothing and perched on the edge of his bed.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back, feeling totally lame. \u201cMan. I am more nervous right now than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But I\u2019m not backing down. So strip. Oh, and come closer so I can see every muscle ripple. Because you can\u2019t know how often I\u2019ve wanted to lick you from head to toe.\u201d She smiled cheekily. \u201cWith your permission, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I doubt I\u2019ll deny you anything.\u201d Keeping his gaze on hers, he yanked his T-shirt over his head and tossed it behind him.</p><p>Domini reached for his bare chest. She made a little purring sound as her hands skated over his pecs and his ribcage, then lower to trace the defined lines of his abs. \u201cDo you do anything when you\u2019re off duty besides work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI harass my favorite cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cLose the sweats.\u201d</p><p>Blood rushed into his head as loud as a raging river. His heart galloped a million miles an hour. His body quaked. Hell, even his voice was thready. \u201cI\u2014I...Domini...Dammit. I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014\u201d Shit. He was such a fucking pansy-assed loser.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Hold on to the post and let me do this for you.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded and shut his eyes.</p><p>Cool fingers traced the elastic band sitting low on his hipbones and his belly quaked from her gentle touch. One fast, hard tug and the sweats were down around his ankles.</p><p>\u201cLift your right foot. Good. Now your left. Good.\u201d</p><p>How many times had he suffered the dream where he\u2019d gone to school naked? A dozen times perhaps. This was worse. Way worse. Standing naked before a beautiful woman and exposing his flaws?</p><p>A tender kiss landed on his belly button. Followed by a series of harder, insistent nipping kisses as she moved south. But she didn\u2019t go straight down his groin. She didn\u2019t kiss or lick or nuzzle his cock. She detoured to his left thigh.</p><p>His whole body flamed with embarrassment. He wanted to apologize for being crippled. To tell her to stop.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. Domini kept going until she reached the band of the sock above his stump.</p><p>Cam gathered the courage to open his eyes. He looked down at her. And saw nothing but concentration. He smoothed her hair away from her cheek. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wear that to bed, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let me watch you take it off?\u201d When he frowned she added, \u201cI don\u2019t have some kind of weird stump fetish, okay? It\u2019s part of you. I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable with me or in your own bed. Especially if I\u2019m going to be in your bed often.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cI may never let you out of my bed.\u201d</p><p>Domini smiled.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t look at her while he went through the play by play of removing the prosthesis. The thick prosthetic socks. The silicone sleeve. Releasing the suction that attached his residual limb to the socket.</p><p>But at the moment of truth, when his limb would be out there uncovered, scarred, naked and ugly, he hesitated.</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t. She hopped off the bed and stood in front of him. \u201cWhat do you do with it at night? Turn it into a crazy leg lamp like in that movie A Christmas Story?\u201d</p><p>He laughed with relief. \u201cNo. I just toss it on the chair and make sure my crutches are close by.\u201d He jerked his stump out and waited.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Sure.\u201d He\u2019d had the prosthetic specialist touch it. Nurses touched it. Doctors touched it. Even Keely had touched it. But never a lover. He found himself holding his breath as her fingers connected with his skin.</p><p>\u201cHow much can you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything from about two inches up.\u201d</p><p>Domini seemed absorbed in the process. Just when he was starting to get freaked out, she pressed her mouth to his and kissed him with the same softness and consideration as she caressed him. When the kiss heated up, she pulled back. \u201cWill you tell me all about this robotic leg after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She scrambled back into the middle of the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re both naked. I want to feel you on top of me, Cam. In me.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn. He was so touched by everything she said, everything she did, everything she was, he felt tears stinging his eyes.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a fucking cry-baby. Man up. Mount up.</p><p>He sat, swung his right leg up and was flat on his back, thinking about his next move, when Domini straddled him.</p><p>His cock jerked toward her like a heat-seeking missile.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, just let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>His hands mapped the curves of her body, starting with her breasts. He played with her nipples, watching the tips pucker beneath his stroking thumb. \u201cBring them to my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Domini placed her hands above his head on the mattress. She teased his lips with the peaks, one side, then the other until he sucked her deep and hard. She arched her neck, sending her silken hair cascading down her back as her eyes closed in bliss. It was the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He clamped his hands on her hips and brought the hot, wet, center of her sex down on his cock. He urged her to slide along the length of his shaft as he lavished attention on her breasts.</p><p>Her breathing changed and her body went taut. Cam knew she was about to come. He lifted her up.</p><p>She emitted a protesting squeak. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking this last more than fourteen seconds for both of us, Miz Impatient. Slide your legs down. Hold tight.\u201d He carefully rolled them using his right leg, so she was on the bottom.</p><p>Domini blinked up at him. Then her hands were everywhere. On his shoulders. Traveling down his back. Gripping his ass. \u201cYou have such an amazing body.\u201d She lightly whapped him on the butt. \u201cDo you know what torture that was for me? Knowing you were built like this? You\u2019re the sexiest, hottest man I\u2019ve ever known and I wasn\u2019t able to get my hands on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can touch me all you want now.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cSpread your legs wider.\u201d Cam kissed her as he pushed in to the hilt. He groaned. She groaned.</p><p>At first it felt weird in this position, one foot bare, one foot not there, as he steadily rocked into her. Cam used his upper body strength to propel him into her tight sheath with each thrust. \u201cYou feel good, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like looking in your eyes and feeling every part of your body rubbing on mine.\u201d</p><p>He crushed his mouth to hers and used his tongue the same way he was using his cock. Slowly and steadily. Waiting for that moment when Domini\u2019s body signaled him to pound into her.</p><p>She ripped her lips free and whispered something low and husky in Ukrainian in his ear.</p><p>Cam lost it. He slammed into her.</p><p>Domini arched, meeting his every hard stroke, keeping her legs wrapped around his hips. \u201cYes!\u201d She gasped and started to come; her pussy muscles squeezed his cock, sucking it in deeper.</p><p>He rode out the waves with her. When the tension left her body, she gave him a dazed smile. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Cam pushed up off her, separating their chests. \u201cYou wanted to touch me, princess. Play with my nipples.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Domini didn\u2019t use her fingers; she used her mouth. She sucked, licked and bit his nipples until his balls drew up tight and he bowed back as he came in long, slow bursts of liquid heat.</p><p>His arms shook and he collapsed, sinking into the soft cushion of her body. He breathed in the perfume of her skin mixed with the musky scent of sex filling the air.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how much time passed as they remained intimately connected, caressing and kissing, but it was long enough for his cock to stir with intent. Cam pinned her hands above her head and growled, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p> <p>This go around wasn\u2019t sweet and lazy. It was an intense pounding, thrusting, clash of bodies. Of wills. Cam made Domini come twice before he followed suit in a blinding rush of pleasure that left him exhausted and lightheaded.</p><p>Then Domini\u2019s mouth searched for his, kissing him so sweetly, but with such underlying hunger that Cam knew he\u2019d take her at least one more time before dawn broke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you fucked me so thoroughly that I can\u2019t feel my legs,\u201d Domini muttered, \u201cbut that seems sort of unfair to you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHere I thought you were shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m plenty shy. Look how long it took me to work up the courage to approach you. Almost two years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut offering yourself up to me any way I wanted was a great icebreaker, princess.\u201d</p><p>He flopped onto his back and sighed. He hadn\u2019t felt this good, this sated, this relaxed...since before his injury. Maybe not ever.</p><p>Domini rolled to her side and propped her head on her elbow. \u201cWill you tell me about your injury and recovery?\u201d</p><p>Cam rarely talked about his war experiences. Mostly because people who hadn\u2019t lived it wouldn\u2019t understand it. But with Domini growing up in a turbulent eastern-bloc country, she wasn\u2019t innocent to the harsh reality of the world outside the U.S. borders.</p><p>\u201cIt was a late patrol in Baghdad. I was teaching one of the new kids protocol for an unsecured urban area when a bomb went off in front of us. We stopped and got out, only to have another detonation behind us. The dirt and debris cut us off from the rest of the caravan. Before we\u2019d gotten too far off the road, I heard that distinctive whistling noise that meant someone had launched a rocket. I grabbed the kid, Jenks, and we hit the ground. But not fast enough. The jeep exploded behind us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of blurry after that. The explosion knocked us both out. When I came to, I had a big chunk of metal embedded in my left calf. It was bleeding, but I knew if I tried to pull it out, I\u2019d bleed out, so I left it in. I couldn\u2019t hear, I could barely see, but I knew there was still fighting going on all around us. I also knew we were sitting ducks after the ambush. We limped our way off the road into an abandoned building, figuring we\u2019d sit tight until the fighting died down and we could reestablish radio contact.</p> <p>\u201cNo one realized we were missing until they did a head count at the base later that night. By then the gates were locked up and they couldn\u2019t come back looking for us. Then a three day sandstorm hit that kept us cut off from any rescue attempt. Which was good and bad\u2014the Iraqis weren\u2019t able to find us any more than the patrols were.</p><p>\u201cJenks and I stayed put. It wasn\u2019t like I could walk anywhere with a big hunk of metal sticking out of my leg, even though it was mostly numb. Once we realized the storm had ended I told Jenks to leave me because he only had surface injuries, but he wouldn\u2019t. Then a goddamn rainstorm hit, which is how he managed to get water for us when we didn\u2019t have food. The week of unscheduled leave was a gritty haze of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddy, Brock, wouldn\u2019t give up on finding me\u2014either dead or alive. Once the storms passed, he was out looking discreetly, randomly checking through the buildings in the area, so as not tip off anyone there were a couple of American army soldiers MIA. He stumbled across us after we\u2019d been gone for six days. Shrapnel wounds coupled with being a pint or so low on blood, a low body temp and I was in a coma when the medics got a hold of me. When I woke up four days later, I found out they\u2019d removed my lower left leg below the knee, as well as my pulverized left pinky.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI still have goddamn nightmares about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d Her gaze moved to his stump. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got me stabilized, called my family, and put me on a plane to the amputee specialist docs at Walter Reed as soon as possible. I was only there a couple of days before another infection set in. The docs decided it\u2019d be better in the long run to remove my knee joint entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a say in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so doped up and in so much pain that I didn\u2019t give a shit.\u201d And he was seriously pissed off about the wrong turn his life had taken. At first he\u2019d refused to talk to anyone. Then he went a step further and denied all access to him. No visitors. Period. Cam knew it\u2019d hurt his family, but at the time he didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass. He wanted to be left the hell alone.</p> <p>But his sister wouldn\u2019t accept his decree. She\u2019d charmed her way into Ward 57 at Walter Reed Hospital and chewed him out, refusing to leave until he made some decisions about his life.</p><p>Talk about being yanked up by his bootstraps. At the time, he\u2019d almost hated her.</p><p>Now Cam admitted he wouldn\u2019t be where he was if not for Keely. If she\u2019d shown up bawling her eyes out and wringing her hands, he\u2019d\u2019ve kicked her to the curb without apology. Her grim determination made him face the harsh realities. His life as a soldier was over. Period. He was handicapped. Period. So in Keely\u2019s mind, that meant the sooner he learned to live with his disability, the sooner he\u2019d be able to live a better life.</p><p>Keely rented an apartment for them in Cheyenne after he\u2019d been discharged from Walter Reed and his medical records transferred to the VA hospital. She ran interference with their family. She dealt with his doctor appointments, his army discharge paperwork, his VA benefits. And she personally oversaw his physical therapy, including convincing a prosthetic specialist from Denver to offer Cam a second opinion. She pushed him until they both broke down. She was there when he took his first steps on his new prosthesis. She argued with the doctors about the fit issues when he probably would\u2019ve walked away and suffered in silence. She gave up six months of her life for him and never once complained. Never once did she throw her sacrifice in his face. It humbled him.</p><p>\u201cCam? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He ran his hand down her body, pleased when her skin broke out in goose bumps. \u201cIt\u2019s late. We should probably try to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I\u2019ll get the lights.\u201d</p><p>The bed dipped and Domini snuggled into his right side, forcing him to wrap his arms around her. Not that he minded. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d held a woman in his arms all night.</p><p>Domini was quiet, but it was a purposeful quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost more intimate to share a bed with someone than it is to have sex, isn\u2019t it? Because when you\u2019re asleep you\u2019re vulnerable. It\u2019s back to that trust thing.\u201d</p><p>Cam kissed her forehead. \u201cSleep. You\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t talking about me, Cam.\u201d</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to sleep now?</p><p>The scream woke him. Disoriented, Cam realized it\u2019d come from him.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Not now. Please. Not now.</p><p>Too late. His body was covered in sweat, yet he trembled so violently with cold that the mattress shook.</p><p>\u201cCam? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Rather than look even more weak, he turned on his side, away from her and shivered like a wet dog. Squeezing his eyes tight didn\u2019t stop the images from flashing in his mind. Fuck. He hated this nightmare shit. He kept waiting for it to go away and it never did.</p><p>\u201cSsh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d She stroked his back in silence. Supporting him. Calming him. Soothing him.</p><p>Pink and orange rays lightened the bedroom windows as the sun rose. Finally he quit shaking, but he hid his tearstained face from her.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me I\u2019ll understand. But if you do want to talk about it, remember I\u2019m not going anywhere, Cam. Nothing you can say will make me leave you like this. I\u2019ll be right here if you need me. For as long as you need me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like her to push and it wasn\u2019t like him to blurt out every horrid fucking detail, yet he found himself doing just that. \u201cI was back there, helpless, knowing what was coming but unable to stop it from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>Say the words. Say them out loud.</p><p>\u201cThe amputation. I woke up in the hospital and the docs said my leg was gone. But I felt it. I knew it was there but no one would listen to me. They called it phantom limb pain but they were all a bunch of fucking liars. I fought so hard to get out of that goddamned hospital bed. I couldn\u2019t breathe and when I finally sucked air in, all I could smell was dirty flesh and blood and antiseptic. Then the nurse put me in restraints. That much is true. That really happened when I woke up. But then the dream...changes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost, walking on a road in Iraq, the same road where the RPG hit us. I\u2019m wearing my new leg and a...Jeep pulls up behind me. Full of American soldiers. I\u2019m relieved to see them until I notice they\u2019re all holding chainsaws.</p><p>\u201cThey knock me to the dirt. One guy puts his boot on my chest to hold me down. The others...\u201d Cam swallowed. \u201cThey start to cut off my other leg. Then they cut off both my arms. I can feel every fucking inch of that chainsaw blade digging into my skin and slicing through the bone. I\u2019m screaming. Not only can I see my blood leaving puddles where my limbs used to be, I smell it. I smell the sand and the heat and my own blood and the exhaust from the Jeep as they drive off and leave me there to die. That\u2019s when I always wake up.\u201d</p><p>Domini tugged on his shoulder until he rolled to his back. The horror and sympathy\u2014not pity\u2014in her eyes punched him in the gut. She wiped the beads of sweat from his brow, the tears from his eyes and traced the curve of his jaw. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He whispered, \u201cMake it go away. Please, just help me forget.\u201d</p><p>She fell back to the mattress and attempted to yank him on top of her, apparently forgetting half his ability to balance was propped against the chair.</p><p>\u201cBe with me now. Like this. There\u2019s nobody in the world but us, Cam. You\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p> <p>The movement of her body was so sweetly urgent, so loving and caring that Cam aligned his cock and plunged into her without preamble. \u201cHold on to the headboard. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>When Domini arched back for it, Cam anchored his foot against the footboard and fucked her so hard the headboard slammed into the wall. Over and over. And since he was sprouting morning wood, he felt as if he could fuck her for hours. Fuck her until she passed out. Fuck her until he forgot every shitty thing in the world but her.</p><p>The first orgasm rippled through her quickly. He sank his teeth into the delicate sweep of her neck and bit down on the magic spot that sent her spiraling into a second orgasm.</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. Again. Come for me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis was supposed to be for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for me. Being with you like this is the best thing that\u2019s happened to me in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a sweet-talking soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for you.\u201d His hair was damp, as were the sheets as their bodies slapped together. The sexiest, neediest sounds tumbled from her perfect lips.</p><p>When she started to bear down on him during her third orgasm, Cam rammed into her and let her swollen, pulsing pussy muscles milk him of every last drop of seed. Milk every single care in the world clean away.</p><p>Eventually their breathing returned to normal. Domini\u2019s hands traced the contour of his spine. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled against her neck and scattered kisses across her shoulders, down to her breasts and back up to her mouth. \u201cMuch. Thank you.\u201d He breathed in the scent of her, let himself absorb her softness and strength.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He pushed up on his palms. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>A sneaky smile crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed some help getting a leg up on your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar har.\u201d He smooched her nose, secretly thrilled that she was already comfortable enough to tease him...and he was comfortable enough to take it. \u201cJust for that comment, I expect breakfast.\u201d He kissed her nose again. \u201cA big breakfast. Pancakes. Eggs.\u201d One last kiss. \u201cAnd you will hand feed me while you\u2019re nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an order?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d better get cracking, huh?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Cam dropped Domini off in the alley behind her apartment with a promise he\u2019d see her later.</p><p>She rested her forehead against the tile wall in the shower and the let water beat down on her. For such an outwardly resilient man, Cam had a wide streak of vulnerability. As much as she hated to see him hurting, it gave her a sense of...purpose that he\u2019d leaned on her, confided in her, needed her. That he could rely on her to be the strong one for him for a change.</p><p>During the course of the day would Cam decide he needed a break to regroup after opening himself up to her? Especially after she\u2019d seen him reliving his worst nightmare?</p><p>She\u2019d ached for him, knowing exactly how it felt to wake up in the hospital with a piece of yourself missing.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t you tell him?</p><p>Because the early morning breakdown wasn\u2019t about her or what she\u2019d experienced, it was about what Cam needed.</p><p>Clean, dressed, loaded with caffeine, Domini grabbed her laptop and tackled the grocery order for the following week. She emailed the invoices to Macie in Canyon River, along with a note about payroll changes.</p><p>After juggling next week\u2019s employee schedules, Domini powered down her computer. She locked up her apartment and paused at the bottom of the staircase when she heard a baby wailing. She grinned and detoured to the back door leading to India\u2019s Ink and Sky Blue. \u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Chances were good given the baby boy\u2019s set of lungs that India hadn\u2019t heard her. Domini followed the crying to the retail store at the front of the building.</p><p>But India wasn\u2019t holding the squalling baby. Colt was.</p><p>\u201cColt?\u201d</p><p>He circled around slowly as he continued to pat Hudson\u2019s back. \u201cTell me he wasn\u2019t loud enough that you heard him clear upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was in the stairway. I thought India was closing the shop today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. We\u2019re just waitin\u2019 for Mama to get back.\u201d</p><p>The drop-dead gorgeous cowboy looked like hell. Colt wore stained cut-off sweats, flip-flops and a wrinkled sleeveless T-shirt. The ball cap pulled low on his forehead didn\u2019t hide the dark circles under his eyes. The second he quit moving, the baby fussed.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>His bleary gaze connected with hers and it hit her that Colt and Cam had the same midnight blue eyes.</p><p>Colt smiled at her crookedly. \u201cEverything is fine, except Hudson doesn\u2019t sleep much. Which means Indy and I don\u2019t sleep much.\u201d He dropped a kiss on the baby\u2019s dark head. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t either. \u201cWhere is India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Doc Monroe\u2019s getting her post-baby check up\u2014three weeks late.\u201d</p><p>Domini bit back a smile. \u201cMy offer to babysit any time still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be shocked when we take you up on that one of these days.\u201d Colt gave her an odd look. \u201cSo, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you and Cam?\u201d</p><p>Domini blushed. Dammit. She was pretty sure red cheeks and stammering was a dead giveaway something was going on.</p><p>\u201cThat sneaky little shit,\u201d Colt said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t told me nothin\u2019 about this.\u201d</p><p>How was she supposed to answer? What if Cam didn\u2019t want his family to know? \u201cMaybe there\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Seein\u2019 as his pickup has been parked outside your apartment late at night for the last week...well, sweetheart, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s gonna escape notice in this gossipy town or in the gossipy McKay family,\u201d Colt drawled.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter that my shades are drawn?\u201d</p><p>Colt grinned. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. There\u2019s lots of shocking things goin\u2019 on behind closed doors that are better left to the imagination.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. \u201cTell Indy I said hello,\u201d she said and ducked out the back door.</p><p>Domini snuck in the delivery entrance to Dewey\u2019s. She watched David\u2019s knife flash as the scents of onions and green peppers filled the prep area.</p><p>David didn\u2019t look up when he said, \u201cHey, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dave. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid lunch go okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow. So I have a feeling you\u2019ll be busy tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re cooking.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI forgot. Is there any chance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m prepping until five and then I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I have a date with a hot number from Spearfish. She\u2019s staying over at my place and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d David scooped the mix into a white plastic bucket.</p><p>Domini wandered out front. The place was empty, typical for the time of day. Myra, the night waitress, sat in a booth rolling silverware. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say no if you\u2019re offerin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She slid across from Myra and grabbed a stack of napkins. \u201cHow was the lunch crowd today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating someplace else according to Bea.\u201d Myra peered at her over the rim of her leopard-print eyeglasses. \u201cBobby is slacking big time when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>That was disconcerting. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard customer complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t bother to complain. They just don\u2019t bother to come back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid says we\u2019ll be busy tonight because I\u2019m cooking.\u201d</p><p>Myra rolled the silverware into the napkin and dropped it into the bucket with a muffled clank. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hire another cook if you don\u2019t want to do it anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I\u2019d rather just cook. It\u2019s the management stuff that I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Domini almost clapped her hand over her mouth. Why had she admitted that? To an employee?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell Macie? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t. After what happened with Cat, she needs someone she can trust to manage this place. I had to promise David the moon to stay on as a prep cook because no one else has applied. I know it\u2019s the exact same story on the management side.\u201d Domini sighed. Unemployment rates may be skyrocketing everywhere else in the country, but not in Wyoming. For the most part, skilled workers in the restaurant industry could pick and choose where they hung their apron.</p><p>The doorbell chimed.</p><p>\u201cRight on time.\u201d Myra\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cChin up, boss. Maybe a knight in shining armor will ride to your rescue and sweep you away from this mundane existence.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t have to turn around to know who\u2019d walked in.</p><p>Cam.</p><p>Silly, but her heart did a little flip.</p><p>\u201cHey, Deputy,\u201d Myra called out. \u201cWant coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She waited until Myra delivered Cam\u2019s coffee before she sauntered over. Her body flushed hot as the griddle when his hungry eyes ate her up. \u201cDeputy. May I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer I sat beside you or across from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He blew across his coffee. \u201cOn which side offers the easiest access for me to cop a feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cop copping a feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She sat across from him. \u201cHow has your day been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started off with a bang.\u201d His sexy bad-boy grin made her stomach cartwheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your day been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I saw Colt and Hudson a little while ago. Colt grilled me on what was going on with us.\u201d She swiped his mug and took a drink. \u201cThe rumor mill has been churning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it has. My mother called today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I didn\u2019t answer her call. I just...\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t want to tell her it\u2019s just sex between us?</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cI want to keep you to myself for a little bit longer before they start meddling. Does that sound stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Before she choked up at another glimpse of the sweet side of this gruff man, she changed the subject. \u201cSo, did you arrest anyone today, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ticketed two kids for drag racin\u2019 out by the old cemetery. Then I finished paperwork. I got tired of listening to Shortbull and Reeves arguing about baseball so I took a break and came here. What time do you get done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen thirty. I\u2019m cooking tonight, which I\u2019ll admit I am not looking forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I always look forward to your cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So is that why you\u2019ve been coming in at least once a day for the last two years? Because of my culinary skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bachelor. Half the time I eat Cap\u2019n Crunch for supper.\u201d</p><p>Domini leaned across the table. \u201cThat is not an answer, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I don\u2019t guess you\u2019d like to hear how seeing your pretty face never fails to make my day, no matter what else happens to me during the course of that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Sometimes I want to hear mushy stuff.\u201d</p><p>Cam touched her face. \u201cAnything you want, Domini. Name it.\u201d</p> <p>The doorbell pinged. Cam dropped his hand and threaded their fingers together. Before Domini tore her gaze away from Cam\u2019s compelling blue eyes, a blond ball of energy stopped short of tackling her in the booth.</p><p>\u201cGuess what? Mom said next week I can spend the night and you can take me to school\u2014\u201d Anton caught sight of Cam. His teeth clamped together so fast Domini feared he might have chipped a molar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Anton. Do you know Deputy McKay?\u201d</p><p>Anton shook his head.</p><p>Cam stuck out his right hand. \u201cPleased to meet you Anton.\u201d</p><p>He shook Cam\u2019s hand, albeit reluctantly.</p><p>The bell pinged again and Nadia hustled in. The second Nadia saw Cam, she froze too. She gathered herself and stood behind Anton.</p><p>\u201cNadia, you remember Deputy McKay?\u201d</p><p>Cam returned Nadia\u2019s quick nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you guys by?\u201d Domini asked to fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cWe were out and about and thought we\u2019d see if you had time to eat with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I\u2019m working in the kitchen tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal, it was a spur of the moment idea anyway. Another time.\u201d Nadia squeezed Anton\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d She aimed a cool gaze at Cam. \u201cDeputy.\u201d</p><p>Then Nadia and Anton were gone. Weird.</p><p>Half a dozen people came in. She sighed. \u201cTime to get to work.\u201d Domini tried to tug her hand free. Her breath caught when Cam brought their joined hands to his mouth, licking and nibbling her knuckles like he was kissing her sex.</p><p>He flashed her a cocky grin. \u201cSee you at ten thirty.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s cell phone rang right after he\u2019d climbed into his patrol car. \u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Cam McKay? The war hero?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBrock Tennyson, you bastard. Were your ears burning? Because I was just talking about you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I hope you were talking me up to that hot sister of yours, because, man-oh-man that cowgirl she has got it going on, whoo-ee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt you after you saved my life. I will rip your arms outta the sockets and beat you with them if you lay so much as a single finger on Keely.\u201d</p><p>Brock laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to rile, McKay. So what\u2019s up with you? Been busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You miss my humor. How goes the deputy job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, most days. Better than chasing cattle, that\u2019s for damn sure. What about you? It\u2019s a little early to be calling about setting up our bi-annual hunting trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I apologize for giving you such late notice. I\u2019m on my way to Seattle and I\u2019ve got an extra day to burn, so I thought I\u2019d stop off in Sundance, see if you\u2019re gonna be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. I\u2019m scheduled off that day so if you wanna hit Colt\u2019s fishin\u2019 hole\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d rather chill. Drink a couple of beers. Shoot the shit. Relax.\u201d</p><p>The word relax wasn\u2019t in Brock\u2019s vocabulary. Cam\u2019s alarm bells started ringing. \u201cIs everything okay, B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. Hell, some stuff I need to figure out, which is why I\u2019m driving across country instead of flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to crash at my place for as long as you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it. Look forward to catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Brock hung up.</p><p>Cam stared at the screen on his phone listing missed calls.</p><p>Besides Brock, his mother had called. Twice. That was it. Sad really, that his brothers and cousins weren\u2019t ringing him up just to chat. Even Keely had given up calling him for the most part.</p><p>Can you blame them? You don\u2019t exactly encourage that type of behavior with anyone in your family.</p><p>Big fucking deal. Didn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><p>He shut the phone off and returned to work.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Cleaning the grill was her least favorite part of shutting the restaurant down. Thank God she was done. Domini scoured the grease from her hands and fantasized about a hot sudsy shower. Right. Like that\u2019d happen. She\u2019d sent Cam upstairs to wait for her an hour ago. He\u2019d had that look in his eye then and she expected cooling his boots had only increased his ardor.</p><p>A tremor of desire rolled down her spine.</p><p>As Domini scaled the stairs to her apartment, she wondered if she should\u2019ve doused herself with perfume. Did she reek like a fryer?</p><p>The door opened. Cam wore the look of an impatient man. He circled her wrist and tugged her inside, immediately scorching her lips with a blistering kiss. He released the band holding her hair, and used his fingers to loosen the strands.</p><p>Okay. Maybe fryer grease was an aphrodisiac.</p><p>Cam herded her until her back met the wall. Being on the receiving end of such passion was still so new and exciting, she welcomed the rush of moisture in her panties whenever this man touched her. Domini generated a hungry noise as she worked his buttons, want want want echoed in her head.</p><p>Cam ripped his mouth free. \u201cShirts off.\u201d Within seconds they were pressed naked chest to naked chest. His lips flirted with hers, sending an electric buzz from her mouth to her core. \u201cI want to hoist you against this wall and fuck you right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Domini toed off her shoes. She unsnapped the clasp and her pants fell to the floor.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can. It\u2019ll put too much pressure on my leg.\u201d</p><p>She shimmied out of her underwear and watched Cam watching her. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouch. Now.\u201d He set her on the edge. It wasn\u2019t wide, but the height was ideal. Keeping their eyes locked, Cam unbuckled his belt, shucked his pants and his briefs.</p><p>His callused finger drew a line from the dent in her chin to the opening of her sex. He swirled two fingers into the stickiness and swallowed her gasp of surprise when those fingers slid in and began fucking her. He feathered his thumb across her clit. Slowly at first, and then quicker, shorter, more precise movements.</p><p>Every drop of blood in her body seemed to gather in the bundle of nerves. Just when she bumped her hips up, clenching her pussy muscles in anticipation of a killer orgasm, he stopped.</p><p>Domini whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come on my timeframe not yours. Watch.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down as he thumbed his erection and pushed the head of his cock into her.</p><p>\u201cSo hot. So wet.\u201d He fed her an inch at a time, both of them looking until they were completely, intimately joined.</p><p>When Domini raised her chin, wanting to see Cam\u2019s eyes, Cam\u2019s fingers squeezed her upper thighs.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Watch.\u201d He withdrew until just the tip rested in her opening. \u201cDo you know what a fucking turn on it is to see your sweet cream coating my cock?\u201d</p><p>Seeing the swirls of white smeared against the dark skin of his shaft was highly erotic. She couldn\u2019t remember caring what the mechanics of sex looked like; she\u2019d only cared what it felt like. Yes, it felt amazing, but leave it to him to bring her every sensual nuance she\u2019d missed.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you to get on your knees right now? What if I wanted to see you licking the taste of yourself off my dick?\u201d He alternately sucked and blew in her ear, sending tremors straight to her sex. \u201cWould you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight answer, princess.\u201d Cam kicked up the pace. He nuzzled the sensitive skin beneath her jaw, allowing his teeth to graze her neck. His hand slid up to the juncture of her thighs, while the other hand pushed against the small of her back, subtly changing the angle of her pelvis.</p><p>Domini dug her fingernails into his biceps when he started stroking her clit. \u201cOh God. I like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pumped into her. Not faster but with precision and finesse. \u201cSay my name when you come.\u201d</p><p>His harsh breathing in her ear, the sucking sounds of his sex driving into hers, the scent of his skin, the feel of his hard chest muscles and fingers and cock...she couldn\u2019t even think straight.</p><p>\u201cI wanna hear you say it, Domini.\u201d Cam teasingly licked the column of her throat as his fingers strummed her clit. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel those cunt muscles gripping my cock, trying to bring me all the way inside you. Until all you feel is me. In you. On you.\u201d His hoarse whisper, \u201cSay my name,\u201d was a sexy command she ached to obey. \u201cOr better yet\u2014\u201d he lightly pinched her clit, \u201c\u2014scream it.\u201d</p><p>That tiny pinch of pain sent her rushing into pleasure so dark and sharp she did scream.</p><p>Cam hammered into her, whispering sweet, dirty nothings into her ear as her body pulsed around his. He slanted his mouth open wider and kissed her in a hot, wet, clashing of tongues. Her insides were flooded with the heat of his ejaculate.</p><p>Domini brought her arms around his neck and held on.</p><p>After he broke the kiss, he murmured, \u201cYou never fail to amaze me, Domini.\u201d He pulled out and stepped back.</p><p>Suddenly off balance, she windmilled her arms to no avail. She yelped, fell backward, narrowly missing kicking Cam in the head as she bounced on the couch cushion and crashed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cShit! Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Domini started to giggle.</p><p>Cam seemed wary of her laughter as he skirted the couch, fumbling with his belt buckle after he refastened his pants. He loomed over her. \u201cDid you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my pride.\u201d</p><p>He jammed his hands on his hips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve tried to catch you. It\u2019s just...I have this thing about falling. I did it a lot when I first... Sometimes I still fall and I fucking hate it. Makes me feel helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been paying attention.\u201d She rolled to her feet, noticing he\u2019d dressed his lower half. \u201cSo are you leaving now?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>What was he thinking about with that far-off look? \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>Which ticked her off. \u201cIs this where you tell me you hate to screw and run, but you\u2019ve got to be up early tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Then Cam was right there. \u201cExcuse me? Did I say we were done?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cWho has the say so in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I didn\u2019t say it, then we\u2019re not done, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d When her eyes darted away, he held her chin, forcing her to lock onto his dark and dangerous gaze.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need a reminder of who\u2019s in charge.\u201d He leaned forward, taking his time, until finally his lips grazed her hairline. \u201cGo wait for me in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Domini knew better than to argue. But the truth was, she didn\u2019t want to argue. She wondered if he\u2019d dally. Probably not. Cam liked to play, but he didn\u2019t play games. Right after she\u2019d arranged herself on the bed, she glanced up and saw him propped against the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cPull the covers back and get your vibrator.\u201d</p><p>His bossy tone shouldn\u2019t have hardened her nipples, made her wet, caused her skin to tighten with anticipation, but those short, terse, commanding words did it for her.</p><p>Boy did they ever do it for her.</p><p>Cam sauntered into the room. He set a bottle of vegetable oil on the nightstand. His gaze never wavered from hers as he dropped his pants and his shorts to his ankles. He sat in the chair and yanked them off.</p><p>Now they were both naked. Yet, they weren\u2019t on a level playing field because Cam had the upper hand. She allowed her gaze to drop to his cock.</p><p>His fully erect cock.</p><p>He wrapped his fingers around it and stroked. \u201cSit on the edge of the bed and spread your knees so I can see every bit of that sweet pussy.\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s heart raced at the wild look in Cam\u2019s eyes. This was the predator. The alpha. She, shy Domini Katzinski, brought out that beastly side in Cameron McKay.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever masturbated for a man?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He emitted a pleased-sounding growl. \u201cYou will for me. Use the vibrator and show me how you get yourself off.\u201d</p><p>Even after all they\u2019d done with each other, she blushed at the idea of performing such an intimate act in front of him. She turned the vibrator on and let the buzzing tip follow the rise of her pubic bone down to the opening of her sex. She rimmed the outer edges of her pussy, leisurely. Thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cDo you always draw it out like that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me how you do it when you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to see how fast I can get off with a vibrator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cam cocked his head. \u201cYou say that like my ego will take a hit when I see what battery power can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, when they manufacture one that can do all the things my hot, wet tongue and my soft lips and sucking mouth can do, well, then I might be worried.\u201d He grinned with pure male confidence. \u201cThen again, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Cocky man.</p><p>If Cam wanted fast, she\u2019d give him fast. Switching it to high, Domini set it directly on the swollen nub of flesh. She rubbed up and down, back and forth mostly for show. The sensation of her tissues pulling tight built and her clit was pulsating beneath the vibrating tip. Her head fell back and she moaned. The short, intense orgasm was nothing like having Cam\u2019s cock pounding into her or his tongue bringing her to climax, but it was good nonetheless.</p><p>She peeked from beneath her lashes and saw Cam still stroking himself, still watching her.</p><p>\u201cHow soon before you can go again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually one is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is never enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Well, it might take a while.\u201d</p><p>Cam shrugged. \u201cI doubt it, but I\u2019m in no hurry. Show me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Another command. Another overpowering need to please him. Another wave of desire swamped her. Domini gave him a raunchy show as she played with herself and her vibrator. He\u2019d been right; it didn\u2019t take long to get off a second time. After she clicked the toy off, Cam was there. Right there. All dangerous, hungry, challenged male.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d He pushed her flat on the mattress, slapped his hands on the inside of her thighs and set his mouth on her.</p><p>Oh he had something to prove. Cam used his tongue in so many naughty, delectable ways, keeping her dangling on the precipice of bliss. If he suspected she was close to careening into pleasure, he\u2019d stop, yank her back to sanity, and start over.</p><p>While his busy mouth tended to her clit, his fingers pumped in and out of her wet pussy. She swore he was fucking and sucking her at the same time. And his wicked thumb brushed across her bottom hole, bringing her awareness to those sensitive nerve endings. She noticed his probing of that untried area became more insistent with each pass.</p><p>Her stomach muscles were quivering. Her legs were doing this weird, twitchy thing. And she absolutely couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cCam. Please.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his face from between her thighs and his mouth was shiny with her juices. \u201cPlease what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease make me come.\u201d</p><p>Cam blew a cool stream of air across her hot, wet folds. Teasing. Tormenting. Proving his mastery over her.</p><p>Then he bent his head.</p><p>He\u2019d kept her on the edge for so long, when he sealed his mouth to her clit and sucked, Domini started to come immediately. She gasped when a finger breached the first ring of anal muscles and slid deep.</p><p>That added stimulation catapulted her to another level of pleasure. She placed one hand on Cam\u2019s head, wrapping the other hand around his thick wrist, not sure if she was trying to pull that probing finger out, or making sure he kept it in.</p><p>As soon as the last twinge faded, she propped herself on her elbows and looked at him.</p><p>He wore a funny little smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 to worry about from a piece of plastic, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now that you\u2019re all relaxed, we\u2019re gonna try something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>Cam dipped his head to her right nipple. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it involve the bottle of oil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He lapped around the areola, loving her greedy hum of approval. His lips skimmed the shallow dent above her sternum and he licked the left nipple. Her breasts were small, but proportioned perfectly, and Cam never considered himself a tit man anyway. Give him a firm, shapely ass over enormous jugs any day. Speaking of ass...he wasn\u2019t surprised to see Domini looking down at him curiously as he enjoyed her body.</p><p>He kept eye contact with her. \u201cYou know what I want?\u201d</p><p>Domini nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay it. Straight up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass. You want to fuck my ass.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSee? We\u2019re getting good at this communication stuff, ain\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back and laughed like he\u2019d said the funniest thing in the history of the world.</p><p>Her pure, unrestrained joy was one of the most beautiful sounds Cam had ever heard.</p><p>He was past the point of no return with this woman and she hadn\u2019t a clue how he felt about her. Not a freakin\u2019 clue.</p><p>When Domini gifted him with a sweet smile, he kissed her. The glide of her lush mouth on his always brought his arousal to fever pitch, but it seemed sharper tonight. Deeper. Almost desperate.</p><p>Cam brushed his nose by her ear. He loved the feel of her silky, baby-fine hair on his skin. When wisps stuck to the whiskers on his face and tickled his neck. Or crushed in his hands and twined through his fingers. Trailing down his body. And the scent. Lord. The cool scent of her hair drove him insane. Or maybe it was the perfume of her skin that seeped into his brain, making him absolutely crazed for everything about her.</p><p>\u201cDomini,\u201d he murmured against her throat. \u201cI need this from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. I want to give you what you need. I want to be what you need, Cam.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself from the temptation of her pliant body only long enough to grab the bottle of oil. His hand shook as he poured the golden liquid into his cupped palm and coated his cock and his fingers.</p><p>Her heels rested against the wooden footboard and he tapped her butt as a signal to lift her hips and he placed a pillow beneath her. The long expanse of her belly tempted him to lick and kiss until he reached those sweet, tasty little breasts. As he sucked on a peaked nipple, he lightly circled her anus. He worked his middle finger in a little at a time until it was imbedded to the webbing of his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tense up, relax those muscles. There, just like that.\u201d Cam knew it\u2019d take more than just one finger to prepare her, so he slipped another finger inside.</p><p>He caught Domini\u2019s gasp of surprise in a hungry kiss.</p><p>She squirmed as he scissored his fingers. Curling, twisting and stroking inside that tight channel, pushing her toward the sharp bite of pain that would turn into pleasure.</p><p>Cam slipped his fingers from her loosened hole and nipped at her bottom lip. He stood, hoping like hell he didn\u2019t look as unsteady on his feet as he felt. Goddamn he wanted this from her. Needed it. He circled her ankles in his hands and positioned her feet on either side of his shoulders. He stepped between her thighs, poising his cockhead at that enticing pucker.</p><p>Domini frowned.</p><p>He swept his hand across her belly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d do this...from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As you\u2019ve pointed out, we\u2019ve done it from behind enough times. I want to see your face as I\u2019m taking you this way. I want to touch your clit when I\u2019m buried balls deep in your ass.\u201d Cam pressed the tip to the rosette and slid his hand beneath her butt cheeks, opening her ass fully. He pushed until the head of his cock disappeared inside the first ring of muscle.</p><p>Domini hissed.</p><p>\u201cBreathe out, princess, come on, lemme make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burns.\u201d</p><p>Going slow wouldn\u2019t make a difference now, so he shoved until his cock was lodged completely inside her.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>Ah fuck. She was so tight. And hot. And tight. And goddamn he had the urge to rut on her. Slam into that vise-like heat. Feel that snug channel gripping his cock as he eased out slowly, so she felt every inch scraping against those tight tissues. Then he\u2019d ram back in over and over. Hard and fast and deep. Relishing the loud slapping of his balls as he fucked her until she screamed.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he held off on that raunchy scenario, allowing her untried channel to adjust around his impatient dick. Once he\u2019d controlled his urge to pound into her without mercy, he glanced at her.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her eyes were closed and her teeth were biting into her bottom lip so hard he expected to see blood.</p><p>\u201cDomini. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTouch me. I want your hands on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you lean closer will that put too much pressure on your leg?\u201d</p><p>Leg? What leg? Cam froze. For the first time, he\u2019d forgotten about his stump. He\u2019d forgotten he wore a prosthesis. He\u2019d forgotten to be self-conscious. He was so lost in her and all she brought to him he\u2019d simply...forgotten.</p><p>She did this for him. To him. Domini made the world melt away. His vision wavered at the sudden rush of emotion.</p><p>\u201cCam? You okay?\u201d</p><p>His gaze zoomed to hers. Hell. He sure as fuck hoped she hadn\u2019t seen him tear up. During sex. Yeah. That\u2019d be sexy as shit. Bawling on her. While he fucked her in the ass.</p><p>That actually brought a smile to his face. Cam angled his head and kissed the inside of her left ankle, and then he kissed the right. He slid her feet down his biceps until they were braced in the crooks of his arms. He eased out, feeling the sphincter muscle surround just the fat head of his cock. He leaned forward and thrust into her ass to the hilt.</p><p>Domini gasped, pressing her palms against his pectorals, as if trying to push him back. \u201cDammit, Cam, I wasn\u2019t ready for that!\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand between their bodies and murmured, \u201cSorry, baby. Lemme make it up to you.\u201d He stroked her clit in the lazy way he\u2019d discovered she liked best. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cam let the natural rhythm of their bodies take over. He flicked her clit with each thrust into her ass; she raked her nails down his chest, grinding her pussy into his groin on every upstroke.</p><p>That tight tingling in his balls indicated he couldn\u2019t last much longer. When the buzzing sensation brushed his fingers, his eyes flipped open.</p><p>Domini positioned the vibrator directly over her clit. \u201cLet me see you lose that last bit of control.\u201d</p><p>And he did. He hammered into her without caution, without finesse, his head thrown back, sweat trickled down his throat and not into his eyes. Almost there. Almost...</p><p>Contractions from her orgasm tightened her cunt muscles with enough force he felt them in her bowels.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d Cam shoved into her ass and went still. He groaned, hell, he howled when those rigid anal muscles clamped his cock and milked every drop of seed.</p><p>A bunch of nonsensical words filled the air and then she flopped back on the mattress.</p><p>Cam slipped out of her ass and pressed his lips to her throat. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Tired. Worn out.\u201d She cracked an eye open. \u201cSore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll refrain from swatting your ass tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwatting? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into spanking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. There\u2019s something sexy about seeing a handprint\u2014my handprint\u2014on your ass. Then the skin feels hot to the touch. Just think how good my tongue would feel cooling you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I demanded you let me spank you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes held a rare challenge. \u201cI\u2019d let you...but I\u2019d demand equal time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. In fact, the thought of you smacking my ass turns me on. Everything about you turns me on, princess.\u201d He nuzzled her hairline and just breathed her in. \u201cStay put. I\u2019ll get stuff to clean up.\u201d</p><p>Domini stretched with that sated, smug expression of a well-fucked woman.</p><p>Heh heh. His well-fucked woman. If he had that cock-of-the-walk swagger, he\u2019d earned it. About damn time too.</p><p>Cam washed up in the bathroom before he dressed. He brought a warm washcloth and teased Domini with flirty kisses as he swabbed between her legs. He tucked her between the sheets, wondering if she\u2019d have regrets about his rough behavior when she noticed the finger-shaped bruises on her thighs tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI must\u2019ve done something right, because you were babbling in Ukrainian when you came that last time.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him sleepily. \u201cI wish you could stay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time. Can I make it up to you tomorrow night? By taking you to supper? Someplace besides Dewey\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could cook for us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, we\u2019d just end up in bed. And I don\u2019t see how you cooking for me is a night off for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me on a date, Deputy McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>That skeptical look returned to her icy blue eyes. \u201cWhy? You promised me this wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say no if you don\u2019t wanna have supper with me tomorrow night, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll pick you up at six.\u201d He kissed her softly and left.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out with him?\u201d</p><p>Like Nadia had a right to judge her on men. Domini sighed quietly. \u201cCameron McKay is a good man, Nadia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also police,\u201d Nadia retorted, reverting to Russian in case Anton was listening. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what they\u2019re capable of?\u201d</p><p>Domini absentmindedly rubbed her shoulder where the German shepherd had taken his pound of flesh. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. He\u2019s nothing like the men who were terrorizing and brutalizing innocents.\u201d</p><p>Nadia muttered in Bosnian. Domini understood enough to realize she\u2019d been called a fool. She let it slide and changed the subject. \u201cSo Anton likes school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing with kids his own age is better for him than being with the so-called \u2018babies\u2019 at Sky Blue daycare this summer.\u201d Nadia smiled at Anton over her shoulder. \u201cHe wishes he could ride the bus home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he making friends?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t say. He is disappointed he isn\u2019t hanging out with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t watch him and you had to cancel.\u201d Why had Rex insisted Nadia cancel their date? Wouldn\u2019t he encourage Nadia to bring his son along? Even one time? Especially if he was serious about making them a family again?</p><p>The thought of Rex living in the same house with Nadia and Anton turned Domini\u2019s stomach. She knew what Rex used to do to Nadia. She saw what he\u2019d done to Anton and how that beating had finally forced Nadia into leaving the man for good.</p><p>Or so she\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too. Anton likes coming here. You spoil him.\u201d</p><p>Spending time with Anton didn\u2019t equal spoiled in her book.</p><p>Anton raced into the kitchen. \u201cAny cookies left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You ate them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go home anyway. Get your stuff,\u201d Nadia said.</p><p>\u201cBut we just got here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini has a life, Anton, don\u2019t whine.\u201d</p><p>His chin fell to his chest.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Domini tugged him until he was sitting on her lap. \u201cYou are part of my life too. You\u2019ll see me again soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>She smooched his head and laughed when he made a face. \u201cI promise.

Cam would just undo it at the first chance.</p><p>She tidied the kitchen, setting the plates in the dish rack to dry as she waited for Cam to arrive.</p> <p>Three distinctive raps echoed...forty-five minutes later.</p><p>Domini opened the door.</p><p>Oh yum. Look at the sexy man on her doorstep. Double yum. The spicy scent of aftershave drifted from the open collar of his white button-down shirt. He wore dark blue jeans, combat boots and a wolfish grin.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s eyes met his. \u201cUm. What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said double yum and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s some kind of Ukrainian slang for \u2018dumb ass you\u2019re late\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s American slang for you look and smell yummy.\u201d</p><p>Cam actually blushed. The man could fuck her like an animal and demand all sorts of kinky things from her, but a compliment caused him to blush? She bit back a grin. \u201cCome in. We must\u2019ve been on the same wavelength because we even dressed alike tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often thought about how you\u2019d look wearing my shirt...and nothin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d She kissed his smoothly shaven cheek. \u201cYou want a beer?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cShit. I was probably supposed to bring you wine or flowers or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d In the kitchen she passed a bottle to him. \u201cNeed a glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He rested his backside against the counter and sipped.</p><p>She sipped.</p><p>Drip drip drip echoed in the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that faucet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s it been leaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I moved in.\u201d</p> <p>Cam walked over and inspected it. \u201cJust needs to be tightened. Checked for corrosion. Your landlord oughta be able to fix it pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would mean something if I\u2019d ever seen the landlord. I send rent checks to a post-office box in Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Cam set down his beer. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a toolbox around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Colt or Blake left one in the utility room.\u201d</p><p>He left the kitchen and returned a couple minutes later with a rusty-looking toolbox.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFixing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to. It\u2019ll just take a minute and then we\u2019ll go, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He rummaged in the toolbox and fit the mouth of several wrenches to the base, discarding each one with a loud clank until he found the one that worked.</p><p>Cam muttered under his breath as he cranked the metal. Once the handle was off, he took a small steel bristled brush and scrubbed the inside. Domini couldn\u2019t see exactly what Cam was doing, but it gave her an odd feeling of domesticity to see him with his sleeves rolled up. She\u2019d never had a guy around to do manly things for her.</p><p>She sipped her beer as he reassembled the parts and wrenched it all back together.</p><p>He grinned as he tested the handle. \u201cSee? No leaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that, but thank you.\u201d She frowned at his chest. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got grease on that shirt.\u201d</p><p>Cam attempted to rub the spot away.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t do that. Take if off and I\u2019ll get the stain out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d She began unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cAfter spending my life working in a restaurant, I know a thing or two about removing grease stains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you just wanna get my shirt off,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a side benefit. Or it would be if you didn\u2019t always wear a T-shirt underneath everything. Maybe you could skip it next time.\u201d She waited while he peeled the shirt off and handed it to her. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Domini treated the stain and tossed it in the washer. Cam casually leaned against the counter, arms crossed over his chest defensively, not looking particularly happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t exactly dressed for a night out. Not that I was Mr. GQ before but...\u201d He sighed. \u201cI always seem to fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t screwed up anything.\u201d She stopped in front of him and debated. If she ran her hands up his arms would he see it as a sexual advance? Or the reassuring gesture she intended?</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>Domini set her palms on his biceps and perused the thick muscles to the wide curve of his shoulder. When he didn\u2019t flinch, she kept going until she reached his neck. With her hands at the base of his jaw, she feathered her thumbs over his jawline. Every inch of him was utterly masculine. Body. Face. Stance.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t budge. He appeared to have quit breathing. But he watched her, very closely, with those dark, hooded eyes.</p><p>Her left thumb arced over his plump lower lip, and the dip in his full upper lip. Then both together until Cam\u2019s damp lips parted and she could feel the heat drifting from his mouth.</p><p>She shifted her hand to trace the hollowed shadow of his cheek beneath his cheekbone. She caressed his temple with her fingertips. His eyebrow. His hairline. That tender section of skin in front of his ear.</p><p>Before Domini touched the other side of his face, she locked her gaze to his. \u201cTrust me. Let me.\u201d</p><p>His long, dark lashes fluttered as he closed his eyes in silent consent.</p><p>\u201cNo. Open your eyes. I want you to look at me, Cam. I want you to see it as I see it. I want you to watch me touching you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was a little surprised he\u2019d obeyed.</p><p>Using a light touch, Domini followed the scar on the left side of his face. She smoothed the jagged edges from the corner of his mouth up to the ridged section where the scar hooked sharply. Then she slowly tracked the bump where it cut back and the gouge was deeper, the scar was thicker. She mapped every inch of his warrior\u2019s mark until it ended at the apex of his eye socket.</p><p>Before Cam could speak, or before she lost her nerve, Domini repeated the process with her mouth, scattering kisses from top to bottom and finally pressing her lips to his.</p><p>As she kissed him, she reveled in the sweetness of his surrender. Domini dropped her cheek to his chest, listening to the strong, steady beat of Cam\u2019s heart.</p><p>After a bit, he said, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to go anywhere. But I imagine you\u2019re hungry since I was damn near an hour late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a casserole in the freezer I could pop in the oven.\u201d</p><p>Cam tipped her chin up to look in her eyes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you don\u2019t mind tuna casserole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love homemade tuna casserole.\u201d</p><p>If the domestic scene made Cam uncomfortable, he hid it well. They ate. They cuddled up on the couch and watched TV. She didn\u2019t attempt to wrestle the remote from his grasp. She didn\u2019t attempt to turn his closeness into something sexual.</p><p>The DVD clock flashed eleven o\u2019clock. Cam kissed the top of her head and pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go. My buddy Brock is gonna swing through on his way to Seattle tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for a great date.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cSome date. You washed my shirt, cooked me dinner, cleaned up and you didn\u2019t even get lucky.\u201d</p><p>She felt very lucky to have him in her life, even temporarily, but she\u2019d never say it out loud.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Gracie\u2019s barks forced Cam out of his easy chair. He opened the sliding glass, allowing her to check out the visitor from behind the safety of the fence in the backyard. Some guard dog. Gracie would lick him to death.</p><p>Cam watched as Brock\u2019s bright red Audi TT putted up the gravel driveway. Idiot babied that damn car. Although he probably rodded the piss out of it as he zipped across the country. Out here in the Wild West, where the paved roads were long and empty, law enforcement officers had better things to do than issue speeding tickets.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean Cam wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed the hell out of writing him a ticket just because he could.</p><p>Brock\u2019s six-foot two-inch frame unfolded from the sports car. He wore his usual aviator shades, jungle print camo pants, and combat boots. The difference between this uniform and his official army uniform was the dark green tank top with \u201cThat\u2019s MISTER Asshole to you\u201d emblazoned on the front.</p><p>\u201cMcKay, you ever gonna pave that goat path you call a driveway?\u201d</p><p>Cam grinned. \u201cNope. It wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you drove a truck and not a wussy foreign car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d Brock scaled the stairs in two giant steps. He dropped his duffel bag, threw his arms open. \u201cWhat? Ain\u2019t you gonna show me the love, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a scrawny thing, I didn\u2019t wanna crush you.\u201d Brock didn\u2019t allow one of those awkward male hugs, where they barely touched, beat each other on the back\u2014hard\u2014and then stepped away quickly. No. The bastard actually hugged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deeply touched by that sentiment, Hop-along.\u201d Brock pushed the shades on top of his closely shaved head. His gaze swept Cam from crew cut to boots. \u201cSeriously, man, how you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo issues with the new leg?\u201d</p><p>Brock was one of the few people who\u2019d seen Cam right after the amputation surgery in Iraq. He was also one of the few people Cam let visit him in Cheyenne during his rehab. Brock and Keely were the only ones besides hospital personnel who\u2019d seen him without his prosthesis.</p><p>And now Domini was on that very short list.</p><p>Her tenderness and penchant for pleasing him was disconcerting because it had nothing to do with sex. Things had changed. Scary thing was, he wasn\u2019t sure if either of them were ready for those changes so soon.</p><p>\u201cCam? Buddy?\u201d</p><p>Cam refocused. Although Domini was in the forefront of his mind, he\u2019d make a concentrated effort to keep her out of any discussions with Brock today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, sorry, I spaced out.

Man, I saw a guy who\u2019d had both legs blown off in Afghanistan, and he could haul serious ass when he had those babies strapped on. He was a regular bionic man.\u201d</p><p>Cam snorted. \u201cHe\u2019d have to be the six million dollar man to pay for it, because those super high tech prostheses are serious bank.\u201d</p><p>Brock looked at him quizzically. \u201cYou telling me the VA isn\u2019t ponying up cash for the latest advances in prosthetics for our injured war veterans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m telling you. And since I\u2019m a low-paid public servant, I ain\u2019t rolling in dough neither, so I\u2019ll be wearin\u2019 the leg I\u2019ve got for a long damn time.\u201d Cam changed the subject. \u201cAnything you\u2019re burning to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince a tumble in the hay with your sexy cowgirl sister ain\u2019t in the cards, I\u2019m up for other suggestions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a while since I\u2019ve taken the four-wheelers out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Brock hefted the strap of the duffel bag over his shoulder. \u201cLemme dump my gear.\u201d</p><p>They grabbed jackets before loading up. Gracie hopped on her usual place on Cam\u2019s ATV and Brock shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou spoil her.\u201d</p> <p>Cam ruffled the fur between Gracie\u2019s ears. \u201cShe deserves it. She\u2019s a good girl, aren\u2019t ya, Gracie?\u201d</p><p>Gracie barked twice.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you sometimes, McKay, out here alone in Wyoming, a dog as your only companion. You need a woman. And a whole houseful of kids.\u201d</p><p>Cam revved the engine, cutting off Brock\u2019s diatribe about how Cam needed to start \u201cliving\u201d again. Wouldn\u2019t his buddy be shocked to hear how Cam had been spending his nights? Relearning how to be the sexual man he\u2019d been in the past?</p><p>Except it\u2019s not all about sex with Domini.</p><p>Was that why he was hesitant to tell Brock about her?</p><p>Putting such girly thoughts out of his mind, he gunned it through the pasture, following the rutted tracks. Since there were plenty of paths to choose from, Cam picked one that zigzagged from the hills and the plains to the valley marking the end of McKay land.</p><p>They rode in silence, as was their custom. Brock\u2019s life as a soldier didn\u2019t allow much time for quiet contemplation. Everything Brock did had specific purpose\u2014usually as a result of a direct order. When Brock was on patrol in the sandboxes of the world, he sure as hell wasn\u2019t enjoying the scenery. So Cam knew aimless wandering appealed to him.</p> <p>A bank of clouds covered the sun and Cam shook off an odd feeling of...foreboding.</p><p>Brock shouted, \u201cUp there?\u201d breaking Cam\u2019s reverie. Cam nodded and dropped behind Brock\u2019s ATV.</p><p>They detoured to the top of the ridge and parked. Brock practically ran up the last hill. Cam lumbered to the ledge and let his gaze encompass the area.</p><p>A valley spread out below. The tall grass was mostly burned away from the summer sun; what remained was bleached out and trampled down. Outcroppings of boulders in shades of pewter and russet popped up across the rock-strewn field. No water ran in the empty riverbed, it was merely a deep gouge in the landscape. Scrub oaks and cedar brush sporadically lined the hillside. Clumps of sagebrush and yucca were scattered here and there. The wind blew, as it always seemed to do in Wyoming. Bugs and birds and critters were conspicuously absent.</p><p>\u201cI forget how damn beautiful it is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I live here and I never get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Brock swigged from his water bottle, staring across the vista. \u201cTell me, Cam. Are you happy? Living around home?\u201d</p><p>Weird question, but if Brock asked it, he needed an answer. \u201cMost days I guess I\u2019m pretty content. My job isn\u2019t bad. I respect the hell out of the guys I work with. And they don\u2019t give me much shit for fulfilling the county\u2019s ADA quota.\u201d Cam paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta decide whether to re-up in the next couple months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re headed to Seattle? To see if you could live around your family on a permanent basis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Lemme ask you something else. If you hadn\u2019t gotten injured, would you be here right now?\u201d</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNope. I\u2019d still be a soldier.\u201d</p><p>Brock nodded.</p><p>No further explanation was necessary.</p><p>A cold, damp wind whipped up from the canyon and they headed back. They\u2019d crossed the halfway point when the skies opened and drenched them. Gracie couldn\u2019t stay on the back of the vehicle with muddy paws, so Cam had no choice but to let her run home. He kept turning around to check on her, ignoring Brock\u2019s taunts, \u201cShe\u2019s a dog! She\u2019s supposed to run!\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s concern for Gracie meant he wasn\u2019t watching out for his own safety. Brock\u2019s warning shout about the sinkhole was too late. The front right tire of Cam\u2019s ATV hit the hole, bouncing the vehicle up and ejecting Cam out of his seat. He crash-landed on his ass right in a puddle of mud.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d That smarted. The kill switch from the ATV hung from his wrist and the vehicle was silent, flipped on its side. He shoved Gracie from licking his face with a stern, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Brock parked close and slogged over. \u201cBuddy, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed help up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I got it.\u201d Cam pushed to his right side and rolled up. But he\u2019d misjudged the angle of the hill. Once he was upright, all his weight was on his left side. He heard that familiar sickening pop and the suction broke, separating the socket from his stump. He fell into the mud again.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ!\u201d He wasn\u2019t hurt so much as he was embarrassed and pissed as hell. This was what he fucking hated. He hated being helpless. He hated that someone had seen him helpless. He grabbed onto his useless leg and pulled. Nothing happened. \u201cFuck!\u201d He yanked harder but his prosthetic foot was lodged in the mud. Great. Not only was he sitting on his ass, not even the sheer brute strength of his upper body would move the goddamn useless thing.</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Cam said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so goddamned stubborn. Let me help you.\u201d Brock crouched. \u201cIt\u2019s me, remember? We\u2019ve been down this \u2018I don\u2019t need your fucking help\u2019 road before and the result is always the same: you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are one fucking pushy-ass bastard, Tennyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try and kick my ass for it later.\u201d Without asking, Brock gently worked the prosthetic out of the mud. Even though it\u2019d mostly detached from Cam\u2019s stump, he still felt a sting of pain.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>\u201cUp you go.\u201d Brock clasped Cam\u2019s hands and hauled him upright. He wrapped an arm around Cam\u2019s back, steadying him as Cam bunny hopped to the vehicle. Brock\u2019s focus stayed on Cam\u2019s lower half, not the blush discoloring his face, and for that Cam was immensely grateful.</p><p>\u201cNow, Hop-along, we\u2019re both gonna have to ride side saddle on the four-wheeler.\u201d</p><p>Cam lurched toward the ATV. He was sweating, muddy and livid he was gasping for air after walking ten fucking steps. Once his lungs weren\u2019t failing him, he forced words out through his compressed teeth, \u201cThanks. It\u2019d be easiest if I sat on the left side so I can brace myself with my right leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d Brock waited until Cam situated himself before he climbed on the four-wheeler. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Brock drove like a little old lady. They bumped through the field so slowly that Gracie\u2014who\u2019d raced ahead\u2014was napping on the back deck by the time they\u2019d returned to the house. Cam fought another burst of temper while Brock trudged inside for his crutches.</p><p>At least Cam could hobble into his house under his own steam. He\u2019d barely cleared the welcome mat when Brock spoke behind him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t need my help, I\u2019ll run back and get that other four-wheeler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun? It\u2019s like five miles in,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done PT today so it\u2019ll be good for me.\u201d Brock\u2019s pearly whites flashed. \u201cPlus, it ain\u2019t often I get a chance to run in the rain and sling mud from the tires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a ball.\u201d Truthfully, Cam needed time to put himself back together. Literally.</p><p>A few hours later, after Cam and Brock cleaned up, they were glued to an MMA event on the big screen. Things were back to normal, placing bets and shouting insults about the opposing competitor. Cam\u2019s work phone buzzed in his pocket. \u201cShit.\u201d He hit mute on the TV. \u201cMcKay. Uh-huh. No. It\u2019s okay, I know exactly where it is. I\u2019ll be there in a bit.\u201d He shut the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeb can\u2019t find a file and since Sheriff Shortbull is in the office, she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable picking the lock on my desk to get it. So I have to go in. Won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Brock\u2019s gaze fell to Cam\u2019s left side. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up for it? You did crash today. Maybe you should tell them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better get some beer while you\u2019re out. I\u2019ll just hold down the couch\u2014ooh, Jesus that had to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Cam rolled his eyes. Brock was obsessed with MMA; he probably wouldn\u2019t notice Cam was gone.</p><p>Brock shouted, \u201cHey, pick up some food too. I\u2019m starving and neither of us can cook worth a shit.\u201d</p><p>Domini had driven out to return Cam\u2019s shirt, which she\u2019d washed, pressed and hung up. But Cam\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t around and a cute red sports car sat next to the garage.</p><p>And yes, maybe she wanted to meet the guy who hadn\u2019t given up on Cam in Iraq. But Cam hadn\u2019t invited her over. Maybe Cam didn\u2019t want his friend to know about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just drop off the shirt and leave.</p><p>Cursing her flip-flopping behavior, she grabbed the plastic bag and headed for the front door.</p><p>Several minutes passed before a nearly bald man, wearing camo and a Vin Diesel scowl, loomed in the doorway. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Cam here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.

Too bad she didn\u2019t have the guts to snap off, \u201cI\u2019m fucking Cam.

Then his mouth broke into an enormous grin that would\u2019ve made her weak-kneed\u2014if she hadn\u2019t already succumbed to the power of Cam McKay\u2019s smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nec\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d The guy strong-armed her into the house.

Cam and I go back to basic training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam mentioned you\u2019d planned to visit.\u201d This Brock guy was absolutely mouthwatering. Brown eyes and skin the color of rich coffee. He was built like a dream, deeply cut muscular arms, a contoured chest, trim hips and waist, yet he wasn\u2019t as impossibly muscle bound as Cam.</p><p>\u201cFunny, Cam didn\u2019t mention you, sweet Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Since it\u2019s just sex between us.</p><p>\u201cCam\u2019ll be back any minute. Would you like a beer while you wait?\u201d</p><p>Say no. \u201cMaybe just one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>Domini followed Brock and froze in the entryway into the kitchen. \u201cIs Gracie here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping on the deck out back. She did a lot of running today. Why? Did you want me to bring her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, that\u2019s good she\u2019s outside. I don\u2019t really...get along with dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Gracie isn\u2019t just any dog.\u201d</p><p>Where had she heard that before?</p><p>Brock popped the cap on a bottle of Corona and handed it over. \u201cDidn\u2019t Cam tell you how he ended up with Gracie?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen Cam was rehabilitating in Cheyenne, this do-gooder group began showing up with \u2018therapy animals\u2019. At that time Cam was in his bitter stage and he didn\u2019t want anything to do with anyone, let alone an animal. He refused the therapy, but one day Gracie escaped from her handler and cowered under his bed.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t rat her out. He realized she didn\u2019t want to be a therapy animal any more than he wanted one. Long story short, they bonded and the people were more than happy to pass Gracie off to Cam, because she\u2019d broken the rules and attached herself to one person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how she feels,\u201d Domini muttered.</p><p>Brock\u2019s eyebrows drew together but he didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>Domini stayed mum and swigged her beer.</p><p>\u201cYou an MMA fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to whip that white boy for your lack of education. Come into the living room and prepare to be enlightened on the ways of the ring warrior.\u201d</p><p>She perched on the edge of the couch and watched two guys beating the crap out of one another with punches, kicks and wrestling moves. Brock cheered them. Booed them. It wasn\u2019t her thing, but she saw how it\u2019d appeal to men with an abundance of testosterone. Like Brock. Like Cam.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you known Cam?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been coming into the restaurant I manage for a while. Only recently have we...started seeing each other outside of working hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very diplomatic, Domini. Where are you from? Switzerland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the Ukraine.\u201d Her head snapped up. Blood tinged her cheeks. \u201cI get it. Neutral. Switzerland. Funny.\u201d</p><p>Brock shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a picnic living in the Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster and the fall of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad, which was why I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as a mail-order Ukrainian bride, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That was never an option for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m damaged goods. \u201cThe Evangelical Church of Hope got their hooks in me before the marriage brokers did and they offered me a better way out of the country. I eventually found a way to escape them too.\u201d She chugged her beer and boldly changed the subject. \u201cYou\u2019ve known Cam for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p><p>That flip reply might\u2019ve stung if she hadn\u2019t suspected Brock\u2019s passive aggressive responses were his way of protecting his friend. \u201cWas Cam always...such a...\u201d Domini struggled with the right word.</p><p>Brock\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSuch a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe type of guy who\u2019s loyal. Polite. Thoughtful. Generous. He\u2019d walk a little old lady across the street. He\u2019d jump in front of a bus to save a baby in a runaway stroller. He\u2019d give up his seat to a pregnant woman. He\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow himself on a grenade to save your life?\u201d Brock supplied.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Has he always been that way? Or did he become that way after his injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked without guile.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s always been the selfless guy who does the right thing. No matter what. No matter the personal cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be exactly right. And you\u2019re the first person who\u2019s picked up on that...except for me, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe him my life. He\u2019ll tell you the reverse is true, but it\u2019s not. He saved my dumb ass more times than I care to count. I will do anything for that man. Cam is one of a kind and he deserves the best\u2014\u201d his cool appraisal moved over her and he frowned, \u201c\u2014in everything.\u201d</p><p>Stung by his less than flattering perception that she wasn\u2019t good enough for Cam, she stood. \u201cI should go. Please give Cam the shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out. Finish your beer. I didn\u2019t mean to run you off.\u201d</p><p>She allowed him time to consider his statement, then challenged, \u201cDidn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you really?\u201d</p><p>Brock attempted to stare her down, but gave up and laughed. \u201cMan, you ain\u2019t a pushover at all, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people confuse a quiet nature with timidity. There is a difference, Mr. Tennyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that now.\u201d Brock snatched her hand and kissed her knuckles with exaggeration. \u201cCall me Brock. I owe you an apology, delectable Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>His right eyebrow winged up. \u201cI\u2019m forgiven that fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point in holding a grudge. You were only looking out for Cam\u2019s best interest and I can\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Gorgeous, quiet and forgiving. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s stick to being friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh woman, I am so gonna try to change your mind. Let\u2019s have a toast to celebrate our new friendship.\u201d He leapt to his feet. \u201cHave any idea where Cam keeps the tequila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I hope his liquor cabinet is better stocked than his refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me are gonna get along just fine.\u201d</p><p>Cam was surprised to see Domini\u2019s car parked in the drive. He was even more surprised to enter the kitchen and see Brock and Domini laughing over a row of empty shot glasses.</p><p>A possessive roar filled his head.</p><p>\u201cCam! My man. I was just telling Domini about the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked your butt for drinkin\u2019 all my tequila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, about the time we got into that bar fight in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Domini ain\u2019t interested in hearing our old war stories, Brock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I am.\u201d</p><p>Damn she looked good. Color on her cheeks. A sparkle in her eyes. Amusement tilting the corners of her mouth.</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cLooks like I have some catching up to do. Pass me that bottle, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Brock poured three fingers of tequila and slid it across the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me one of your wild stories?\u201d Domini asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass because I don\u2019t lie nearly as smoothly as Brock does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Brock said. \u201cWe called him George behind his back because of that \u2018I cannot tell a lie\u2019 bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Cam confided, \u201cAnd we called him Pinocchio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m stunned. All your stories have been an outrageous...lie?\u201d she said with mock shock.</p><p>\u201cNot all. Once I wrassled a bear with my bare hands. I have pictures.\u201d Brock peeped at her with those big, dark puppy dog eyes that always got him laid. \u201cWanna see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re bare naked on the bear skin rug after you killed the beast with your bare hands?\u201d Domini mused.</p><p>\u201cYep, but unlike the pictures of those white boys who ain\u2019t smart enough to hunt bears the right color, like polar bears, my brown ass blends perfectly with the grizzly I slayed.\u201d Brock leaned closer. \u201cIs this getting me anywhere with you, hot stuff?\u201d</p><p>Domini and Brock continued to flirt like Cam wasn\u2019t in the room. This playful side of Domini fascinated him. He\u2019d seen her various sides, sweet and fiery and obedient and occasionally pushy, but never shamelessly charming. Or was it just shameless? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Regardless, it was hot as sin watching her enchant Brock\u2014a man who was not easily enchanted.</p><p>An hour later, Cam was on his third shot and Domini and Brock had quit drinking entirely.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t stopped the sexy banter, arguing the pros and cons of mail-order brides. \u201cNot speaking the same language would be a huge bonus,\u201d Brock pointed out. \u201cThen she couldn\u2019t nag me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Brock Tennyson, are trying to get under my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, I\u2019m trying to get into your pants.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows suggestively. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>She laughed\u2014a little nervously\u2014but she didn\u2019t say no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take your silence as a yes. Hot damn!\u201d Brock grabbed her hand, acting like he was dragging her away.</p><p>\u201cStop. I know you were kidding.\u201d Domini sent Cam a questioning look. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Tension hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a big girl, Domini. Do what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She looked torn. \u201cDon\u2019t...aren\u2019t you supposed to...\u201d</p><p>Scream no, you\u2019re mine! Yes. Cam tossed off a cool, \u201cGive you permission?\u201d</p><p>She nodded warily.</p><p>Brock sucked in a breath. \u201cShit, Cam. She said you two had one date and I thought... Why didn\u2019t you tell me it was that way between you two?\u201d</p><p>Domini spun on Brock. \u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve known him a long time, Domini, and I know what he prefers.\u201d</p><p>Cam flashed Domini a wolfish smile. \u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head before addressing Brock. \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t like Cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brock slurped from a water bottle. \u201cI like to watch. Damn, do I like to watch. Sometimes I join in. When control freak here lets me.\u201d</p><p>Cam caught the flare of interest in Domini\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Whoa. That reaction was unexpected. But then again, Cam hadn\u2019t delved much into finding out Domini\u2019s sexual fantasies because he\u2019d been fulfilling his role as her dominant lover and that\u2019d been enough for him.</p><p>But was it enough for her?</p><p>Right then Cam knew he\u2019d have to decide how far he was willing to let them take this flirtation. He and Brock had shared women in the past. It\u2019d been no big deal.</p><p>But now it was different. Could he orchestrate a sexual situation between his best friend and the woman he\u2019d fallen in love with? Or would he want to rip the hands off the man who\u2019d saved his life just because he\u2019d put them on her?</p><p>Did Domini think she could handle a threesome?</p><p>Too fucking bad. No way in hell was Brock touching her, no matter what she thought she wanted. No. Way.</p><p>What kind of lover would you be if you didn\u2019t see to her sexual needs? Even if they were in direct conflict with yours?</p><p>Fuck that. She\u2019s mine.</p><p>Is she? Does she know that?</p><p>No.</p><p>Dammit. If he snarled and showed jealousy, not only would Domini realize he\u2019d developed serious feelings for her, but so would Brock.</p><p>What better way to prove his control over her than to command her to satisfy another man? And bonus: it\u2019d prove to Brock that Cam McKay might\u2019ve lost his leg, but he hadn\u2019t lost his edge. He still owned the ability to bend a woman to his sexual whims.</p><p>Decision made, Cam casually asked, \u201cDomini. Have you ever been with two men at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the thought of two men fucking you at the same time turn you on?\u201d When her response was a long time coming, he said, \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t look away. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were to demand you blow me while Brock watches, you\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>Not a question, yet she nodded anyway.</p><p>\u201cThen come here.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered over, her head held high, her white-blonde hair flowing around her angelic face, her arctic eyes bright, her mouth curved in a small smile.</p><p>Cam curled his hand around her neck and centered her body between his legs. He brought his mouth down on hers hard, taking the brutal kiss he craved. When he\u2019d thoroughly flustered her with his possessive kiss, he slid his lips to her ear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, princess, say so now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was so subdued he strained to hear it. \u201cI gave myself to you without restriction. Whatever you want, you can have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer, baby. And you can show me. Now.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the fireplace in the living room, expecting Domini to follow. From the corner of his eye, he saw Brock flop on the couch. The move looked lazy. Bored. Cam knew it was anything but.</p><p>As Domini approached him, he unbuttoned his shirt. She didn\u2019t lower her eyes or keep her hands clasped behind her back. The subservient posture and attitude crap didn\u2019t appeal to either of them, thank God. But she did not balk at letting him have complete control.</p><p>She said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t wear a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled. \u201cSee? I listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Her fingers trailed over the sprinkling of chest hair. Her palms smoothed his pecs, his ribs, and his belly. She angled her head to lap at the hollow of his throat.</p><p>A tremor threatened to break free from that sexy innocent lick.</p><p>Domini\u2019s delicate butterfly touches were a stunning contrast to the hard nips and deep sucking kisses she used on his nipples.</p><p>\u201cEnough. Unbutton my pants.\u201d The khakis were loose enough once she\u2019d released the snap, they pooled around his ankles. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d She looked up at him and Cam couldn\u2019t resist brushing the hair from her face. \u201cYour hands can be on my hips or my ass. Choose.\u201d</p><p>She peeled the boxers down and didn\u2019t spend significant time gawking at his prosthesis, but neither did she ignore it. She mouthed the length of his shaft, teasing it with hot breath and firm nibbles. Then she sucked it into the wetness and heat that never failed to make his breath catch.</p><p>Cam braced his right hand on the oak mantel and gathered her hair in his left hand, keeping a clear shot for Brock. He knew how hot the visual looked\u2014Domini\u2019s bobbing head as his cock pumped in and out of her hungry mouth.</p><p>But the visual wasn\u2019t nearly as hot as the reality of her sucking him off.</p><p>\u201cBaby, your mouth is pure heaven. You know how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Domini kept him wet, she kept him deep, and she kept sucking until Cam felt his balls lift.</p><p>He shoved his cock until her lips were stretched around the base. He tightened his hold on her hair, but not hard enough to sting her scalp. \u201cSuck it all down, every fuckin\u2019 drop. Swallow. More, baby, don\u2019t choke. Breathe. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Hot pulse after hot pulse shot out the end of his dick, and she sucked in tandem to every pulsation, leaving him depleted. Sated. Dizzy. He would\u2019ve staggered and probably crashed to the ground if not for the hold Domini maintained on his hips.</p><p>The supreme glow of satisfaction she wore whenever she\u2019d pleased him was heady stuff and it humbled him. He murmured, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, Domini nuzzled his left thigh, then his right.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him. \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me and Brock to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Being with two men? At the same time?</p><p>A million thoughts spun crazily in Domini\u2019s head.</p><p>First: yes! I want this. Followed quickly by: no! I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>What about after the fun and sexual games ended? Would she be hot and happy in the moment but feel used when it was over? Could she look Brock in the eye without embarrassment? What about Cam? How would he react after his friend fucked her?</p><p>Even as Domini considered the repercussions, she knew she\u2019d do it. Not for Cam, not for Brock, for her own curiosity.</p><p>Cam helped her to her feet. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014done anything remotely close to this.\u201d</p><p>His deep chuckle vibrated throughout her body. \u201cBrock and I have. Trust us.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d in a breathless rush.</p><p>Cam placed his mouth on her ear. \u201cRemember something. I decide what I\u2019ll let him to do you. Not you. Definitely not him.\u201d After a lingering kiss, Cam said, \u201cTake your shirt and bra off.\u201d</p><p>Domini stripped and hated the burning in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBrock, grab a towel and the vegetable oil from the kitchen. Get the captain\u2019s chair out of the dining room and bring it in here.\u201d</p><p>Brock grinned and returned promptly, setting the chair by the end of the couch and the other items on the side table.</p><p>Cam lowered into the seat and motioned to Domini. He zigzagged his rough-skinned finger from her left hipbone to her right and her belly trembled beneath his sure touch. He clamped his hands on her waist and turned her sideways.</p><p>Brock sauntered forward. Naked. When had he gotten naked? His left hand pumped his cock, his gaze fixed firmly on her face. \u201cI\u2019d like to taste your pretty mouth, lick those full pink lips before I see them wrapped around my dick, but since that\u2019s not the way Cam plays...can I touch them?\u201d</p><p>Domini opened her mouth to respond, only to have Cam answer for her. \u201cJust her lips, nothin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s possessive answer sent a shiver through her.</p><p>Brock\u2019s right hand came up. He outlined her lips with a languid sweep of his thumb. He brushed it just far enough inside her mouth that the wet rim of her lip dampened the pad. He hissed when she darted her tongue and licked it.</p><p>\u201cEver had a black man, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say...\u201d</p><p>Brock laughed and ignored Cam\u2019s warning growl as his hand followed the line of her throat to her shoulder. He gently pushed until she fell to her knees.</p><p>Then that black cock was in her face. It wasn\u2019t as long as Cam\u2019s, which meant she\u2019d have an easier time deep throating him. But the cockhead was plumper. The shaft was thicker. Brock\u2019s skin tone was beautiful, a rich dark brown. His shortly trimmed pubic hair was pure black. She had just latched onto his hips when Cam\u2019s voice broke through the sounds of Brock\u2019s heavy breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou hands are on me, not him.\u201d Cam circled her wrists and placed her hands behind her; one on Cam\u2019s right thigh, one high on the left. \u201cI\u2019ll touch you while you\u2019re sucking him.\u201d</p><p>The position would\u2019ve been awkward if not for the arch in her spine which caused her nipples to brush the bristly hair on Brock\u2019s legs and tingle deliciously in response. She smiled. Cam knew how much she loved nipple play. Even now he was seeing to her sexual needs.</p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d Brock directed.</p><p>She closed her eyes, dropped her jaw in anticipation of all that smooth, hot, hard flesh pushing past her lips and teeth, over her tongue until it filled her mouth completely. Brock swirled the cockhead over her lips and plunged in to the root.</p><p>Domini started to gag.</p><p>Cam\u2019s voice drifted to her. \u201cRelax. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>Brock wasn\u2019t expecting a slow tease. He pumped in and out in a smooth rhythm that Domini knew would get him off quickly.</p><p>Cam twined his hands in her hair, holding it out of her face. \u201cYou have no idea how fucking hot it is to see his dick in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>A slight hum from her had Brock groaning, \u201cJesus. Do that again.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>Domini looked up at Brock. A little thrill shot through her, seeing him lost in pleasure. She understood Cam was giving this intimate moment to Brock as much as she was.</p><p>Was it easier for Cam to show his gratitude for his friendship when he was proving to Brock that Cam McKay was still one hundred percent dominant male?</p><p>\u201cMore, come on, take it all,\u201d Brock urged, forcing her to refocus.</p><p>As she created tight suction on every withdrawal, she slackened her throat muscles when Brock plunged back in to the root. His hardness filled her mouth over and over, sending her into hazy subspace where she existed on a whole different plane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Cam whispered. \u201cSo damn beautiful I can\u2019t think for wanting you. Two men so fucking hot for you that we\u2019re both gonna fuck you at once. Me in that tight pussy. Brock in your tight ass. You\u2019re getting wet thinking about it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She moaned. The sensations were devastating. The constant wet suction of Brock\u2019s slippery cock fucking her mouth. The rasp of her nipples against Brock\u2019s legs. Cam\u2019s hand fisted in her hair. The ache in her arms. The feel of Cam\u2019s rough skin as she dug her nails into his upper thighs. Three distinctively different breathing patterns distorted the air. Three different scents filled her lungs.</p><p>But it was the simple eroticism of Cam\u2019s words and his fingertips dancing up and down her arms that made her hot.</p><p>She saw Brock\u2019s hand reach between his legs and adjust his balls.</p><p>\u201cI need it faster.\u201d Brock picked up the pace, and his fingers curled around her neck, his thumbs pressed on the spot her jawbone hinged, keeping her jaw open. \u201cI\u2019m so close...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on her chest.\u201d</p><p>Brock groaned and eased out of Domini\u2019s mouth. His left hand wrapped around his cock and he jacked off in short, fast strokes. The sound of his flesh slapping and his grunt of completion gave way to spurts of warm come landing on her chest as Brock watched through hooded eyes. His hand slowed, but didn\u2019t stop, as if he didn\u2019t want the moment to end. \u201cDamn, woman. You\u2019re something.\u201d</p><p>Cam rubbed the quivering muscles in her arms. \u201cStand up.\u201d</p> <p>Brock snagged the towel, intending to wipe his come from Domini\u2019s chest, but Cam snatched it. \u201cLet me.\u201d After he\u2019d wiped her down, those intense blue eyes locked on hers. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled. Could she do this? She looked at Cam. Fire danced in his eyes. He wanted this. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of your pants.\u201d</p><p>Domini shimmied them off.</p><p>Cam hooked a finger under the elastic band of her panties and tugged her closer. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d He pressed his mouth to the section of skin below her belly button and sucked hard, holding her lower back so she couldn\u2019t squirm away.</p><p>Not that Domini tried to escape any time he put his hands or mouth on her. He\u2019d sucked hard enough to leave a reddish-purple love bruise behind.</p><p>\u201cMy mark looks pretty on your creamy skin. I\u2019d like to leave love bites all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t stop you,\u201d Domini said, reaching out to caress the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He kissed her belly one last time. \u201cClimb up on my lap.\u201d</p><p>Cam widened his legs to fit outside of the chair legs. He brought her high up on his thighs; his erection nestled into the crack of her butt.</p><p>Domini tried desperately not to put weight on Cam\u2019s left side. She gasped when Cam hooked her legs over the arms of the chair, baring her most intimate parts completely.</p><p>\u201cLook at that.\u201d Brock stood a few feet away, hot eyes drawn to and devouring her sex.</p><p>\u201cPretty pink isn\u2019t it? Soft. Wet. Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou offering me a taste?\u201d</p><p>Again, Cam answered for her. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn.\u201d Brock dropped to his knees.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to find her voice through the staccato beats of her heart.</p><p>Cam\u2019s large, work-roughed hands followed the curve of her legs from her ankles up to the crease of her thighs. He traced one finger up her slit and gently separated her pussy lips, exposing her clit.</p><p>Oh no. Surely they didn\u2019t plan on...double-teaming her.</p><p>Brock bent his head and lapped at the moisture pouring from the mouth of her sex, curling his long, pink tongue inside. Not only did Brock expertly use his tongue, the contrast of his dark face and light-colored mouth, centered between her milky white thighs, was an undeniably hot image.</p><p>Domini moaned when Brock wiggled his tongue inside her.</p><p>Then Brock licked the folds surrounding her core, suckling her pussy lips, stopping below the swollen nub throbbing for attention.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you to coming?\u201d Cam murmured in her ear.</p><p>\u201cA hair trigger away,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>A look passed between Cam and Brock, but Brock didn\u2019t look at her. He fastened his mouth to her clit.</p><p>No tongue swirling teases. No drawn out licks. Brock just kept sucking on that pearl until the orgasm steamrolled over her. Domini gasped through each strong pulse, listening to the sexy timbre of Cam\u2019s voice in her ear, which only heightened the heat in her groin. By the time the final throb ended, her body trembled. She wanted to crawl into Cam\u2019s big bed and sleep.</p><p>Naturally Cam and Brock had other plans.</p><p>Brock said, \u201cUp you go,\u201d and lifted her off the chair and to her feet. After that orgasm she didn\u2019t have enough breath in her lungs to protest and hardly the wherewithal to even stand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both gonna fuck you now.\u201d</p><p>The fog cleared from her head at that command. \u201cHere? But...\u201d Why not in his bed?</p><p>\u201cThis is more stable for my leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d But she knew there was more to his reasoning.</p><p>He whispered fiercely, \u201cMy bed is our space, Domini. I won\u2019t share you in it. Ever. Not even for an hour.\u201d He used his teeth on her earlobe. \u201cI\u2019m pushing you to the edge you wanted. To the place where your body knows what it wants even if you\u2019re unsure.\u201d Cam drew his finger from her chin down to her belly button. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Cam lay back on the sofa, she crawled up and managed to situate her legs on either side of his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to lean against me completely and angle your ass so Brock can reach you.\u201d</p><p>To please herself and to quell her nerves, she rubbed her breasts over his chest, loving his quick intake of breath when her nipples brushed his. \u201cI like being pressed against you like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFace to face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, princess.\u201d Cam\u2019s lips drifted across hers in an almost kiss. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>A tiny wave of apprehension flowed through her but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cBrock? You suited up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Suited up, slicked up and ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Cam sifted his fingers through her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to do most the work since I\u2019m flat on my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing naked with you is hardly work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, woman, sometimes you undo me,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Such raw emotion in his eyes. \u201cCam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Let\u2019s do this. Lower onto me.\u201d</p><p>His cock filled her and she closed her eyes with a sigh. This was familiar.</p><p>Cam tapped her chin with his finger. \u201cEyes on me. Always on me.\u201d His avid mouth controlled hers and coupled with his greedy hands roaming over her bare body, Domini almost didn\u2019t notice a slippery finger circling her anus until it wiggled inside. Her gasp was lost in Cam\u2019s mouth when a second finger joined the first. Stretching her. Fucking her steadily.</p><p>Brock didn\u2019t say a word as he prepared her. It was surreal, feeling him so intimately, but not seeing him.</p><p>Both fingers disappeared. She stiffened.</p><p>\u201cGotta relax,\u201d Cam murmured against her mouth.</p><p>When Cam threaded his hands though her hair, kissing her like she was the center of his universe, she forgot how big the head of Brock\u2019s penis was until it pressed past the ring of muscle.</p><p>Burning pain followed. Domini fought the urge to break free from Cam and buck Brock off.</p><p>Cam sensed her panic. \u201cYou can take him. Just like you took me.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. Her temple. Her ear. \u201cLoosen up, let go, let us make you feel good. Let me give you something you\u2019ve never had.\u201d He licked and teased the pulse point at the base of her throat. \u201cI love how you taste here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike fire. Like ice. Like mine.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes collided.</p><p>When Cam\u2019s tongue swept into her mouth, she fell headfirst into his powerful kiss.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of Domini\u2019s mind she realized Brock had been very quiet. Too quiet.</p><p>Cam kept a haze of passion floating between them she could almost touch. Then Brock snapped his hips and drove into her ass completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh God. Fire. Burning pain. Hot, deep thick burning in her rectum.</p><p>She ripped her mouth free and cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But I need a second.\u201d Domini attempted to relax and enjoy being stuffed with two cocks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d Cam nibbled her jaw, paying attention to the vulnerable skin beneath her chin that caused her to forget her own name.</p><p>Brock\u2019s fingers lightly traced each bump and hollow of her spinal cord. Waiting patiently for her to be ready, even when she felt tension vibrating from him. The male need for him to take what she\u2019d offered.</p><p>You wanted this experience; it\u2019s not fair you\u2019re being skittish now. They\u2019re waiting on your signal.</p><p>Domini began to move on Cam in a rocking motion. The grind of her clitoris on Cam\u2019s pubic hair tightened her abdominal muscles and made everything more pleasurable, less painful, as she kicked up the pace.</p><p>Brock didn\u2019t start ramming into her until she focused on squeezing her anal muscles around his cock. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at nonverbal signals, Domini,\u201d he said and began to ride her relentlessly.</p><p>Because Domini was fucking Cam and Brock was fucking her, she and Brock choreographed the movement. Brock shoved balls deep when Cam\u2019s cock wasn\u2019t buried fully inside her pussy. He pulled out completely, letting his cockhead rest against her spasming anus when Cam\u2019s cock glided into her. When Brock first reentered her ass, he caused an acute spark of pain every time, but Domini went from holding her breath against it to anticipating it. Craving it.</p><p>\u201cGotta have more,\u201d Brock panted. \u201cDomini, can you come like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed.</p><p>When Brock\u2019s strokes lengthened, Domini let her head fall back in a soft moan.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Cam demanded.</p><p>Domini knew if she saw the possession in Cam\u2019s eyes it\u2019d be over. She ignored his command, allowing Brock to take control.</p><p>Spreading her ass cheeks in each hand, Brock hammered into her without stopping. His cock jerked hard against her anal passage. He shouted, \u201cOh fuck,\u201d as he came. And came and rode her hard.</p><p>When Brock finally stilled, he sighed and pressed a kiss in the middle of Domini\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit Domini. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Sweating, panting, on the verge of meltdown, she opened her eyes.</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes were wild as he pumped his hips. The tip of his cock seemed to zero in on her G-spot. \u201cCome for me. Now.\u201d His rough voice unleashed the last string of restraint. She gasped as the climax ripped through her like a tidal wave. Her sex squeezed Cam\u2019s cock, her anal muscles clamped around Brock\u2019s dick. Her body pulsed from head to toe. She vaguely heard Cam\u2019s hoarse shout before she faded away into a blissful, relaxed, post orgasmic state.</p><p>Hands stroked and petted her as she floated back to earth.</p> <p>\u201cWow. That was...\u201d</p><p>No one else piped in. But some other wordless communication passed between the two men she was still sandwiched between.</p><p>Brock managed to sneak a quick kiss on her shoulder before withdrawing. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. Domini, you sure wear a man out, girl. I\u2019m gonna hit the shower and then the hay. I have a long drive ahead of me tomorrow. Thank you for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to keep you from resting,\u201d Domini apologized.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Brock bussed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019d forego sleep for the rest of my life if it meant we could do this again. Damn, Domini. You are sexy and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fun than wrassling a bear?\u201d she teased.</p><p>His warm laughter tickled her ear. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>After Brock was gone, Domini tried to get up, but Cam pressed her down until she was prone across his body. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it but I have to go too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you could spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work early shift tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that just figure? Because I\u2019m on the noon to ten shift tomorrow.\u201d His fingers idly traced her spine. \u201cWhat\u2019s your schedule the next day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly shift again, but I promised Nadia I\u2019d watch Anton after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I ever gonna have sex with you this week?\u201d</p><p>Domini smiled against his chest, elated he couldn\u2019t get enough of her. \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d After one last kiss to his amazingly hard pectoral, she rolled up. It was heartening to see him lounging naked, not trying at all to cover up his prosthesis as he watched her dress. But his gaze turned suspicious. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just like to look at your hot body, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hafta stop at lookin\u2019, princess. You can touch any time you want to.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over to peck him on the mouth. \u201cThank you for a great night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you had fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cam glanced over his shoulder when the shower kicked on. \u201cWould you be up for doin\u2019 it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No.\u201d</p><p>He went still. \u201cNo? Why not if you had a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s like eating rattlesnake. Fun to say you did it once but not something you\u2019d want to repeat.\u201d</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t say another word. He appeared to be lost in serious thought.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Domini had plenty to think about on the drive back to her apartment in Sundance.</p><p>Although Cam wasn\u2019t scheduled to work for a few hours, he popped up at the crack of dawn. Habit he supposed. But the truth was he didn\u2019t sleep much after he\u2019d crawled in bed alone.</p><p>The hallway floor creaked and Cam braced himself to see his friend. Who\u2019d fucked his girlfriend. He swallowed a snarl.</p><p>The fact Brock looked a little haggard cheered Cam considerably.</p><p>Petty, McKay.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019. There\u2019s coffee,\u201d Cam offered.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Brock snatched a mug off the dish rack and poured.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to head out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about.\u201d Brock rested his backside against the counter and studied Cam curiously. \u201cHow are you after last night?\u201d</p><p>Pissy. \u201cGood. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondered if you still had the urge to beat me bloody.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cSpray-painting your name on her couldn\u2019t have stated it more obviously you consider her yours. Or maybe...it could\u2019ve been your continual demands she focus only on you.\u201d</p><p>Cam said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna get into the dynamics of having three people involved in a sexual situation, but if you didn\u2019t want me to touch her why in the hell did we even mess around last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini wanted it.\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cOr I thought she wanted it. I\u2019m not so sure I did the right thing by pushing her to try it. I know I can\u2019t go through that again. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d Brock sipped his coffee but his eyes never wavered from Cam\u2019s. \u201cDoes Domini know you\u2019re in love with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are planning on telling her?\u201d</p><p>Cam shrugged.</p><p>\u201cJesus, McKay, don\u2019t be a fucktard about this.\u201d</p><p>That got Cam\u2019s back up. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I never would\u2019ve believed you\u2019d allow a woman to get that close. I ain\u2019t only talking physically. You didn\u2019t bat an eye about letting her see every part of you. You didn\u2019t bat an eye about letting me see how she reacted to that missing part of you. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the last time I saw you, I worried you\u2019d never get over whatever stupid embarrassment you have about being an injured vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid, Brock. You have no fucking idea what it\u2019s like to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, we\u2019ve beat that conversation to death. So fucking sue me; I worried about you okay? I worried you\u2019d never have a decent relationship and then Domini walked in. I\u2019ll admit when she first showed up I gave her a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Cam fought the immediate surge of anger. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s not like the women you used to date. She\u2019s...reserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you took as to mean what? She\u2019s stupid? She\u2019s a doormat?\u201d Even thinking those words in the same breath as her name had Cam seeing red.</p><p>\u201cChill out. I thought maybe she was one of those freaky amputee fanatics.\u201d</p><p>Cam scowled.</p><p>\u201cHey, we both know those women are out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re few and far between in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I changed my mind about Domini after I spent time talking to her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget how much more appealing she is after she\u2019s been sucking your cock,\u201d Cam retorted.</p><p>Brock wagged his finger at Cam. \u201cDon\u2019t go there. The three-way was a mutual decision last night and has no bearing on this conversation. All\u2019s I\u2019m saying is Domini gets you, in ways most people don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have to be part of a threesome to pick up on that. And you\u2019d be a fucking idiot if you didn\u2019t snatch her up right now.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cWhich is all great, but we\u2019ve been dating for like a week. I\u2019m supposed to beat on my chest, drag her off by her hair and demand she marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do all those things if you thought she\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fucking heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Brock sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, man, I love you like a brother. Do me a favor. Be selfish. Just this one time. Don\u2019t think about anybody but yourself and what you want. You don\u2019t have to put a ring on her finger right now, but make sure you do something besides giving her a fucking hickey so she knows you consider her yours.\u201d Brock ditched his coffee cup and retreated to the bedroom to get his duffel bag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam followed him and petted Gracie as they watched Brock load up. \u201cDrive safe, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.

Tell her how you feel. Go all caveman on her ass. At least one of us has a chance at being happy. Do something crazy and impulsive for once in your life.\u201d</p><p>Cam was on his way to work when Keely\u2019s F-250 extended cab diesel truck blocked him in. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a girl stop by her favorite brother\u2019s house and tell him she misses him?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m headed to Cheyenne. I wondered if you needed anything from the VA while I\u2019m there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He squinted at her behind his shades. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 at the VA again?\u201d For the last couple years Keely spent at least one week out of every month at the VA in Cheyenne, but she never divulged the details to anyone, which was completely unlike her.</p><p>\u201cMoonlighting. They\u2019re short staffed and I\u2019m short on cash so it\u2019s a perfect partnership. I work PT two days this week, then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d A weary sigh escaped. \u201cI sure am tired of living out of a suitcase with Mom and Dad while I\u2019m working out the details of going to work for Doc Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucks to be you.\u201d Now he knew what was behind her impromptu visit.</p><p>\u201cCam, I\u2019m just gonna say this flat out. Please let me live with you until I get my own place. I\u2019d pay rent. I\u2019d cook and clean and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, darlin\u2019. Stop. I love you. But it won\u2019t work. I need my own space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpace to do what? To keep your family out? How long are you going to make Mom and Dad and our other brothers suffer and hope you\u2019ll pull your head out of your ass and join the goddamn family again? How much longer are you going to wallow in misery? Jesus. Why don\u2019t you build a fuckin\u2019 moat to protect yourself from us? Do you really need this much space to hide in?\u201d</p> <p>No, I need it to fuck in was on the tip of his tongue but he bit it back. \u201cThat smartass answer ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 your cause, little sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothin\u2019. I\u2019m not exactly a hermit. I am seeing Domini. And Brock crashed here last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrock was here? Really? How is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Why?\u201d With Keely\u2019s suddenly chipper disposition, followed immediately by her hesitation, Cam guessed the truth. \u201cFor Christsake! You slept with him!\u201d</p><p>She drummed her fingers on the steering wheel\u2014the adult equivalent of jamming her fingers in her ears and singing la la la.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this. Jesus, Keely! He\u2019s like, ten years older than you. He\u2019s my best friend and you...what the fuck were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Keely lowered her sunglasses and glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not twelve, Cam. Yeah, Brock and I made mattress angels when he visited you in Cheyenne. I could bullshit you about how we comforted each other because we were torn up over your situation, but the truth is...Brock is really freakin\u2019 hot. He\u2019s sweet and sexy and I like him a lot. I trusted him. It sort of just happened. We both knew it\u2019d never go anywhere, and I have not a single regret.\u201d</p><p>Brock and his sister. Surreal.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go all psycho big brother on him and threaten to kick his ass or anything, okay? I know he\u2019s your best friend. I would never do anything to sabotage that friendship because I know how important it is to both of you. Which is why neither of us said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He pointed at her. \u201cBut this is the reason you can\u2019t live with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I slept with Brock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because your behavior drives me insane. And my house is the one place where no insanity exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cam smiled. \u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>Her tires spit gravel for twenty feet before the rubber caught pavement.</p><p>Safe. Right. Keely was a menace. He oughta write her a damn ticket.</p><p>Domini was restocking the pie case after the lunch rush when Deputy McKay strolled in.</p><p>Normally he\u2019d wave off the waitress and head to his favorite booth if it was unoccupied. Not today.</p><p>Today Cam strode directly to her. The gleam in his eye was unmistakable.</p><p>No hello. No smile. Cam just planted his lips on hers and kissed her with passion, hunger and total possession.</p><p>In public.</p><p>The only place they touched were lips and tongues until Cam reached for her hand, sweeping his ragged thumb across her knuckles. Domini\u2019s knees threatened to buckle. This man could undo her with a simple touch.</p><p>Finally, he eased back and smiled at her. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. Their faces were close enough his breath teased her damp lips. Seeing such pleasure in his eyes, his smile, even his posture, made her throw caution to the wind. She returned his kiss with the same potent lust.</p><p>Cam\u2019s growl was too low for anyone else to hear, but to her it sounded as loud as a lion\u2019s roar.</p><p>Domini broke the kiss in tiny nipping increments. She smiled up at him. \u201cHi yourself. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat and I\u2019ll bring you a cup.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cThat was a lie. I needed to see you. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach cartwheeled like a tumbleweed. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d Cam tossed a look over his shoulder. \u201cIs there someplace more private than the dining room?\u201d</p><p>Domini glanced around. Only three tables had customers, but everyone was watching them. The rumor about Cam\u2019s surprising public display of affection would fuel the gossip fires all day.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t this wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy office is in the back, but I\u2019ll warn you it\u2019s the size of a coat closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She stopped at the waitress station and poured two cups of coffee, handing one to him. They wove through the cardboard boxes of produce stacked in the prep area. She unlocked her office. \u201cI\u2019ll get another chair.\u201d</p><p>Cam pushed the door closed. And locked it. That unholy gleam was back in his eyes. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ll sit in the chair. You sit on the desk facing me.\u201d</p><p>His posture read: don\u2019t argue. Domini shoved aside the papers littering her desk and kicked the chair against the wall giving them both room.</p><p>But after Cam\u2019s ass hit the seat, he rolled the chair up to the desk. Right into her space. He didn\u2019t touch her. He studied her intently as he nonchalantly sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay after last night\u2019s threesome?\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cDoes that blush mean you\u2019re not okay with what happened?\u201d</p><p>Domini focused on him, but his eyes were flat, as if he were interrogating a suspect. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t okay with it what could I do about it now? It\u2019s over.\u201d Her hands tightened on the coffee mug. \u201cUnless that\u2019s why you\u2019re here? You\u2019re wanting to demand a three-peat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d He gulped his coffee and set the cup aside. He curled his hands around her knees. \u201cAfter you left I wondered if the situation with Brock bothered you...if I\u2019d gone too far because you practically ran out of my house when it was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I say yes, you\u2019d gone too far. What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask your forgiveness and assure you it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>The conversation sent a jolt of power zinging through her. Rather than remind him she\u2019d already confessed she wasn\u2019t a threesome girl, Domini decided to do something bold for a change and...toy with Cam a little. Make him sweat. She gazed at him with aloofness, casually finishing her coffee. \u201cAnd if I say...no? If I admit I liked it? What then?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Cam\u2019s jaw popped he\u2019d clenched his teeth so hard. His nostrils flared. His eyebrows were squished together. Yet for all his agitation, the pressure of his hands on her legs didn\u2019t increase at all.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, Domini prompted, \u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>Cam inched toward her. \u201cMy answer is still no. Fuck. No. I had plenty of time to think about it, too, and know what I\u2019ve determined, princess?\u201d</p><p>Holy moly. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have taunted him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to see another man\u2019s hands on you. I don\u2019t like to see another man\u2019s cock in you. Last night with Brock I realized I don\u2019t like to share, especially not you. And you don\u2019t need two men in your bed to satisfy you. You need one man. Me.\u201d He pushed out of the chair and crowded her. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>Was the thrilling sense of belonging only to Cam McKay...wrong? If so, too bad, Domini absolutely gloried in it.</p><p>\u201cI said, any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now c\u2019mere. I\u2019ll make you forget every man\u2019s touch but mine.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s mouth was hot and controlling. He clamped his hands on her behind, yanking her forward until barely an inch of her butt cheeks rested on the desk. He broke from marauding her mouth to demand, \u201cUndo your pants.\u201d</p><p>After loosening the drawstring, the white chefs pants were baggy enough Cam easily snuck his hand inside.</p><p>He lightly traced the seam of her panties before his fingers slipped beneath the lace band. He parted the wet folds of her sex and probed her entrance with one finger, then two. \u201cI love how fast you heat up for me.\u201d He pressed his fingers deeper and trailed openmouthed kisses down her throat. \u201cI love to make you come. I wish I had time to spread you across the desk and lick away all this sweet cream. Make you come against my tongue. Then I\u2019d do it again, making you wetter and hotter. Making you come over and over until I had to carry you out of here because you couldn\u2019t walk. I\u2019d carry you straight upstairs to your bed and fuck you until you screamed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let her head fall back and withheld a moan when Cam slid his middle finger to her clit and started the rapid flicking that caused her whole body to vibrate like a tuning fork.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Between his blistering kiss and the attention to her clit, Domini\u2019s speedy climax bowled her over. She whimpered through each pulse, grateful Cam\u2019s mouth muffled her cries.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Cam was staring at her. Very possessively.</p><p>\u201cI can look at you from here on out and know no man has touched you but me.\u201d</p><p>That statement was true in so many ways.</p><p>\u201cI want your hands on me, Domini. Now.\u201d</p> <p>She unhooked his belt buckle and lowered the zipper. The weight of his gun and cuffs on his pants dropped them to his hips. His cock jerked against her fingers as she slipped her hand beneath his briefs and circled his hard shaft.</p><p>He hissed. \u201cStroke me hard. Don\u2019t squeeze too tight but pull harder and faster than you think you should.\u201d He put his hand on top of hers. \u201cLike this.\u201d</p><p>Oh wow. That was more forceful than she dared try. But with Cam\u2019s guidance she created an unbroken rhythm that brought forth his deep groans and gave her that heady sense of power again.</p><p>He buried his lips in her hair and his choppy breathing drifted over her ear. His hips started pumping faster, \u201cYes. Don\u2019t stop. I\u2019m right...there. Jesus.\u201d He cupped his hand around the tip as she kept stroking until warm, thick liquid coated both their hands.</p><p>Domini squeezed one last time and he grunted.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips sought hers. His kiss wasn\u2019t sweet, but flirty. Teasing. He smiled against her mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t show up here hoping that\u2019d happen, but I won\u2019t complain it did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe either.\u201d She reached for the box of tissues and cleaned both their hands while she continued the playful kisses.</p><p>He stepped back and righted his clothing. \u201cI want to see you tonight. I\u2019m giving you fair warning that you\u2019re mine. All mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot big plans for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cam flashed a devilish grin. \u201cBut first, turn around and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat when he brushed her hair from the nape of her neck. Cool metal caressed her collarbone. Automatically her hand rose to touch it.</p><p>\u201cCam? What is this?\u201d She looked down at the delicate silver links that formed a chain necklace.</p><p>\u201cA gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His strong, warm hand closed over hers. \u201cI wanted to give you something that\u2019s a symbol. A reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he whispered silkily. \u201cWill you wear it for me, Domini?\u201d</p><p>Was this necklace a tangible symbol of his...ownership? And why in the heck didn\u2019t that very idea bother her? Why was she absurdly touched?</p><p>Domini squeezed his fingers. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll wear it for you, Cam.\u201d</p><p>She felt him grin against her cheek. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll pick you up after my shift ends tonight. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Three hours left on his shift. What a long boring night. Thank God he could spice up his dull thoughts by replaying last night\u2019s events.</p><p>Talk about a blazing encounter. He\u2019d taken Domini to his favorite spot, an overlook where the view of the high plains stretched for miles. The stars were bright, the air was cool and her body had been red-hot. Being in the great outdoors had stirred the beast in him. He\u2019d answered the call of the wild and shown her a truly dominant male.</p><p>Cam had made her strip then spread her out on a blanket in the back of his truck. While feasting on her juicy pussy, he\u2019d introduced her to one of his favorite toys\u2014a beaded butt plug. After she came with a sexy shriek that echoed across the plateau, he fucked her so hard the truck bounced. After he roared his release, he heated them both up again with the rough kisses and insistent caresses she craved. Then Cam removed the plug, pushed her over a fallen log and reamed her ass, riding her without mercy, keeping her head down, keeping his hand around her throat, around the necklace that was proof of his possession.</p><p>She\u2019d loved every second of her total surrender to him. He\u2019d made sure of it.</p><p>\u201cDeputy McKay, please respond.\u201d</p><p>Snapped out of his lewd thoughts, he responded, \u201cThis is Deputy McKay, dispatch, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMultiple vehicle accident on Highway 74A. Officer on scene is reporting multiple fatalities. We\u2019ve called in all available units, as well as first responders from Search and Rescue from Weston County. They\u2019ve confirmed they\u2019re en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA temperature inversion at the bottom of Shep\u2019s Canyon caused heavy fog. Due to slick road conditions, a semi misjudged the curve and jackknifed, blocking both lanes. Approaching vehicles didn\u2019t see the accident until they were right upon it. Sayzers is reporting at least four vehicles are involved at this point, two confirmed DOA, so use extreme caution when approaching scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMile marker forty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas the fog lifted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ETA at mile marker forty-one is approximately six minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that. And...Deputy, please be aware that if another law enforcement choice were available, we wouldn\u2019t be sending you to deal with this...situation.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s knuckles went white on the steering wheel. Son of a bitch. That was dispatch\u2019s way of warning he knew the victims.</p><p>Fuck. He tried to rein in his fear as his mind checked names off the list of possibilities. His parents were home. Ditto for Colby, Cord, and their families. Carter and his brood were in Canyon River. Keely was in Cheyenne. Colt and Indy were at an A.A. meeting in Sundance and wouldn\u2019t have reason to be on the back road going into Moorcroft.</p><p>His stomach twisted into a mass of knots. Kade traveled this road every day. As did his wife, Skylar. He swallowed hard against the bile rising in his throat.</p><p>Didn\u2019t mean it was them. It could be anyone.</p><p>That thought didn\u2019t alleviate his fears.</p><p>He looked up just as mile marker forty passed by. Less than a mile now.</p><p>There was no way to mentally prepare himself, but there was no way to blank it out either. The darkness of the isolated location morphed into an eerie otherworld as red, blue and amber strobe lights flashed. He slowed.</p><p>Pieces of twisted metal, chunks of plastic taillights littered the road. His gaze landed on the semi. One white mega-cab pickup was embedded in the side of the semi-trailer. His gaze tracked the headlights spilling across the road from an unnatural angle. Another car was upside down on the shoulder, the front end crushed into the front seat. The roof was caved in and glass from the broken windshield covered the roadway. Two workers were attempting to remove the driver\u2019s side door and they weren\u2019t hurrying.</p><p>His belly lurched. Chances were slim whoever was in that car had survived.</p><p>Orange cones and flashers lined the perimeter, although no one manned the area. Leaving his flashers on, he donned his reflective vest and forced himself out of the patrol car.</p><p>Cam\u2019s feet were dragging\u2014for once not because he had an artificial leg. He\u2019d seen car accidents in his time as a deputy. Hell, he\u2019d witnessed some damn gruesome car bombings in his years in the army, but none of the incidents involved someone he knew.</p><p>Fred, the part-time EMT, motioned him over. \u201cDeputy, are we taking the victims to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t mean to the hospital for treatment; he meant to the hospital since it also housed the county morgue. Cam cleared his throat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to tell you to track down Sheriff Shortbull right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the other side of the semi, dealing with the accidents over there.\u201d</p><p>A two-lane highway meant wreckage on both sides. His eyes flicked over the body on the stretcher, covered with a sheet.</p><p>As Cam debated the fastest, safest way to proceed to the other side, Sheriff Shortbull appeared around the front end of the semi. The normally gregarious man was dragging his feet too.</p><p>\u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff.\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>Shortbull rubbed his top lip with the back of his hand. \u201cDid Jolene tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She didn\u2019t tell me anything besides to prepare myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t any easy way to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just say it flat out.\u201d Just don\u2019t say Kade. Or Skylar. Or Buck. Or anyone else in my family. Please. Don\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cOne of the confirmed victims on the other side is Luke.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s chest constricted. \u201cLuke? As in my cousin Luke McKay? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dammit, Cam, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. What the hell was Luke doing out here? That thought vanished and Cam\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWas his wife Jessie with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh fuck. Ah Jesus. Ah Christ. I can\u2019t believe...\u201d Tears smarted. Cam couldn\u2019t think beyond dead dead dead. This tragic shit happened to other people, not to his family. Not this many goddamn times. First Dag. Now Luke? Fucking senseless accidents. Jesus. He spun away, clenching his hands into fists, shoving the anguish into the corner inside himself where darkness and misery dwelled.</p><p>\u201cUnder normal circumstances, I\u2019d notify next of kin. But in this case...are you up to doing it?\u201d</p><p>It never occurred to Cam to say no. It was his duty as an officer and a family member. \u201cYeah. It ain\u2019t gonna be easier on Jessie or my cousins or my uncle and aunt if the bad news comes from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to fucking God you didn\u2019t have to do it at all,\u201d Shortbull said wearily. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be making plenty of late night visits to other families.\u201d</p><p>A couple of shouts sounded, breaking the surreal silence.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean the other victims have been ID\u2019d?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke and the truck driver both positively ID\u2019d. There\u2019s an Indian guy on the other side we can\u2019t get info on. He didn\u2019t carry a wallet and the car is registered to the tribe, so that\u2019s no help. The couple in the crushed car...theirs was the first vehicle to hit the semi. Due to speed and lack of visibility, they hit hard and flipped. It\u2019s a real mess.\u201d</p><p>Still reeling from the news his cousin Luke was dead, Cam barely nodded to show that he was listening.</p><p>Deputy Sayzers trotted over with a piece of paper. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a registration name on the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRex DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>That caught Cam\u2019s attention. \u201cWho did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRex DeMarco. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot personally. His ex-wife put a restraining order on him a few years back before I started working here. He had issues with domestic disturbances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow I remember. So the woman in the car...who is she?\u201d</p><p>Grimly, Cam said, \u201cI\u2019d bet money it\u2019s his ex-wife, Nadia DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini is friends with Nadia, and Nadia recently started spending time with her ex again. As a matter of fact, Domini agreed to watch their son tonight so they could go out.\u201d</p><p>Shortbull whistled. \u201cThat poor kid. With both his parents dead, who\u2019s his next of kin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Nadia emigrated from Bosnia so she\u2019s it as far as family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo local family for him either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the call to Social Services and give them the heads up.\u201d Shortbull sighed. \u201cThat boy is gonna go through hell.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s brain was stuck on breaking the bad news. But something in Shortbull\u2019s tone jarred him. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna make him ID his parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jesus, McKay. What kind of monster do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I just...\u201d Cam dry-scrubbed his face. \u201cShit. Sorry. I ain\u2019t exactly thinkin\u2019 straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d</p><p>They trudged back to the other side. Emergency lights blinked. The ambulances waited silently as the Search and Rescue guys worked on getting Rex\u2019s and Nadia\u2019s bodies out of the car.</p> <p>Thirty minutes ticked by. Cam paced so much his shirt was damp from sweat and his prosthesis hurt like a bitch. The tow trucks loaded the smashed vehicles onto flatbed trucks. This time of night there wasn\u2019t much traffic, but cars were lined up both directions. Cam had to get to Jessie before someone in the community recognized Luke\u2019s wrecked truck and called her to ask about it.</p><p>Dread weighted him down as Sheriff Shortbull said, \u201cOther people can handle this part. You\u2019ll have enough trauma and drama to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Cam barely remembered driving to Luke and Jessie\u2019s place\u2014a doublewide trailer on the far edge of the McKay Ranch. A porch light burned. He glanced at the clock before he climbed out. Ten thirty. Christ. Had it only been two hours since he\u2019d gotten the call? It seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>He lumbered up the steps, inhaling a deep breath before he knocked on the door.</p><p>Lexie, Jessie\u2019s dog barked inside the house. A voice hushed her, then a squeaking, sucking noise sounded as the inner door swung open.</p><p>Is that what he\u2019d remember of this night? The sound the door made before he gave Jessie the news that\u2019d change her life forever?</p><p>A pajama clad Jessie blinked at him with total confusion. \u201cCam? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie. There\u2019s been an accident.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze widened at his deputy\u2019s uniform, realizing he was there on official business. The blood drained from her face. \u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cam forced his body and his voice to stay steady. \u201cLuke didn\u2019t survive. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Luke is...\u201d She swayed but righted herself before Cam could get to her. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA semi jackknifed in Shep\u2019s Canyon. Because of the fog...there was really nothing he could\u2019ve done. It happened fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone else with him?\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cThere were fatalities in other vehicles that also hit the semi, but Luke was alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Luke\u2019s folks? Or his brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I wanted to let you know first. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>When Jessie started to cry, Cam knew the sound of the squeaking door wouldn\u2019t stick in his mind, but the hiccupping sobs Jessie didn\u2019t try to hold in.</p><p>Without another word, Cam wrapped her in his arms. She clung to him and for the first time all night, he let himself grieve.</p><p>Time was a black void of sorrow, but eventually Jessie eased back and looked at him through red-rimmed, horror-filled eyes. \u201cWill you come with me to tell Brandt? He\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll\u2014need to tell Casper and Joan right after, but it\u2019d be...better coming from him than from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d She stumbled down the deck steps.</p><p>Cam said, \u201cJess, sweetheart, you\u2019re gonna need shoes.\u201d</p><p>She froze and stared at her bare feet. Then back at him with an expression Cam recognized as shock.</p><p>\u201cOh. Shoes. Right.\u201d She reversed course and slipped her feet into a pair of muddy ropers that were propped on the welcome mat. Wrapping her arms tightly around her middle, she trudged to the passenger side of the patrol car.</p><p>Neither spoke on the short, miserable drive to Brandt\u2019s place. She stared out the windshield as tears dripped down her face.</p><p>By the time Cam hit the end of Brandt\u2019s driveway, Brandt waited on the porch steps. Not a lot of social calls this time of night. Cam parked, but neither he nor Jessie attempted to get out of the car.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s voice was barely a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell him, Cam. This will ruin him. Brandt and Luke are so close.\u201d Her voice caught on a sob. \u201cWere so close. Oh God. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Stay here. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Cam forced himself to open the door. Forced himself to walk the twenty feet to where his cousin stood. Forced himself to look his cousin in the eye.</p><p>They stared at each other. Then Brandt said just one word. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d</p><p>A pain-filled sound cut the night air.</p><p>It sliced Cam to the bone. He whispered. \u201cJesus, Brandt. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s gaze zoomed to the passenger side of the car. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jessie?\u201d</p><p>She was out of the car and sobbing in Brandt\u2019s arms before Cam could answer.</p><p>He had to look away. He had to get away. Yet, he couldn\u2019t leave if they needed him. So he waited in hellish silence as Brandt and Jessie tried to hold one another up.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d Brandt said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a couple hours to talk to my folks and my brothers before you tell the rest of the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need, either of you, just ask, okay? We\u2019re all gonna be here for you. Every one of us in the McKay family. Count on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d Brandt draped his arm around Jessie and they disappeared into the house.</p><p>He\u2019d been given a momentary reprieve on the family side of being the bearer of bad news. But he still had to get through the conversation with Domini.</p><p>With a heavy heart, Cam climbed in his car. But a mile from Brandt\u2019s place he had to pull over on the shoulder. He rested his forehead on the steering wheel and wept.</p><p>Domini recognized the leaden tread coming up the stairs. Cam. Not Nadia.</p><p>She frowned at the clock. Eleven-thirty. Nadia was never this late picking Anton up. She\u2019d tried to call Nadia\u2019s cell to tell her just to leave Anton over night, but Nadia didn\u2019t pick up. Which was odd.</p><p>She released the deadbolt and opened the door for Cam. Without looking at him, she headed for the living room. The climb up the stairs took a lot out of him and he hated her looks of sympathy. \u201cAnton is still here, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini.\u201d</p><p>The way he said her name, so seriously, so full of regret and sadness had her spinning toward him.</p><p>Her awareness jumped to full alert at the grief etched on Cam\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was an accident tonight. A bad accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were called to the scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t first on scene, but everyone was called, including help from other counties.\u201d</p><p>She touched his arm, wanting to appease him, not knowing if he\u2019d welcome it. \u201cOh, Cam. I\u2019m so sorry. That had to be rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes it rough when the victims are someone you know.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched. \u201cSomeone you knew? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Luke, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>Cam shuffled his feet. \u201cCan we sit down? I\u2019ve been on my feet half the damn night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Domini led him to the sofa. She wanted to snuggle up, smooth the frown lines from his brow and erase the haggard look from his eyes. But something about his posture made her keep her distance.</p><p>\u201cI just left Luke\u2019s wife, Jessie, with his brother, Brandt.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt about tore me up to tell them. It was just so goddamn surreal. Like this is all happening to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to tell them?\u201d Jessie\u2019s sweet face flickered in Domini\u2019s mind. The poor woman. What an awful thing to deal with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my job.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to do this. So I\u2019m just gonna say it flat out. Luke wasn\u2019t the only victim tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first niggling of fear crept in.</p><p>\u201cIt was a multiple car crash with multiple fatalities. Not so uncommon in Wyoming, sad to say.\u201d Cam briefly ran down what\u2019d happened. As he relayed the information, he seemed to be watching her very closely. Too closely.</p><p>\u201cWho else was in the accident, Cam?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNadia and Rex.\u201d</p><p>Stunned didn\u2019t begin to describe her thoughts. \u201cWhat? No. You\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been confirmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It can\u2019t be.

That doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNadia was out with him tonight, wasn\u2019t she? And she hasn\u2019t come to pick up Anton. And she\u2019s not answering her cell phone. You know that\u2019s not like her.\u201d</p><p>Domini stared at him, the horror expanding in her chest. The room started to spin. White dots danced in front of her eyes. A din of pain pealed in her brain. Her heart seized as her throat closed. \u201cOh no. Please no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>Cam placed his hand on the back of her neck and gently shoved her head between her knees. \u201cBreathe. Nice and slow. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Her tears plopped on the carpet. She swallowed over and over to keep the bile down. Gagging on her disbelief.</p><p>And through the maelstrom of emotions, Cam\u2019s constant, soothing caresses drifted up and down her back.</p><p>Finally, she managed to sit up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>The awful truth filled Cam\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cNadia. I can\u2019t believe... How can she be dead? I just saw her a few hours ago.\u201d Domini went straight from a sick feeling to pure panic. She began to hyperventilate through her tears. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cam swore. Then his hands held her head and he was in her face. \u201cBreathe, baby. Come on. Look at me. Focus on me. Just breathe with me. Inhale slowly. Good. Now exhale. That\u2019s it. Three more times.\u201d</p> <p>After three long breaths, she started to speak, but he put his thumbs over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. We\u2019ll talk when I know you ain\u2019t gonna pass out. Just look in my eyes and breathe with me. That\u2019s all you need to do right now.\u201d</p><p>Domini let him calm her. It took a while.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Inhaled once more. \u201cWhat about Anton? How am I supposed to tell him his mother...is never coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to him? Nadia had sole custody. She has no family. Anton has no one...but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, in situations like this, Social Services will step in and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Domini jumped to her feet. She shot a look at the closed bedroom door where Anton was sleeping. Then she whispered fiercely, \u201cHe is not going into foster care. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly expect me to be reasonable when I know how bad state care is.\u201d</p><p>Calmly, Cam said, \u201cReally? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my parents died when I was eleven,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWith no family, I was shoved into an orphanage.\u201d</p><p>Shock crossed his face, followed by anger. \u201cYou were orphaned? Holy hell, Domini, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to be pitied even more than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what people say about me? What they\u2019ve said my whole life? Poor Domini, she\u2019s so quiet she must lack a backbone. Poor Domini, she\u2019s scared of dogs and her own shadow. Poor Domini, she lost her parents and grew up unwanted. Poor Domini, she can\u2019t have\u2014\u201d She stopped mid-rant, cringing for the near slip-up. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t want pity from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity is the last goddamn thing I\u2019d ever feel for you.\u201d Cam softened his tone. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re coming up with worst-case scenarios. Foster care here is nothing like what you dealt with living in an orphanage in a foreign country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your reasoning? I\u2019m supposed to turn him over to an agency that knows nothing about him? I lived with him for two years, Cam. I\u2019m a much better candidate to take care of him than some random person who\u2019s only fostering kids for the money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d take him on, just like that?\u201d Cam demanded. \u201cGive up your life as you know it to raise him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you do the same? For Brock? If he died and left a kid behind, wouldn\u2019t you want to make sure he was taken care of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do understand. You know that nothing you or anyone else says will change my mind. Anton belongs with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Domini paced as her feet tried to keep up with the jumbled thoughts in her head.</p><p>His voice was sharper. \u201cI said sit down. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She perched on the very edge of the cushion, legs bouncing up and down impatiently.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Shortbull knows the victims left behind an unattended minor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the world does he know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I told him.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhy would you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels like it.\u201d God. This was a nightmare. She knew it wasn\u2019t Cam\u2019s fault but she couldn\u2019t stop from lashing out at him.</p><p>\u201cWrong. Goddammit. No matter what I feel for you, Domini, I am an officer of the court and I have an obligation to uphold the law. Making Social Services aware of Anton and his situation might not be what you\u2019d do, but it\u2019s what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>Domini studied Cam like she\u2019d never seen him before. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him away before I\u2019ll turn him over.\u201d</p><p>He snatched her hands again. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me shit like that because I can\u2019t just ignore it! What you\u2019re talking about is illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re talking about is unjust.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other, which wasn\u2019t what they needed right now. In the last twenty minutes her whole life had been turned upside down. She began to cry.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He brought his knuckles to her cheek and wiped her tears. \u201cSorry about yelling at you. Just don\u2019t scare me like that. After what I\u2019ve seen tonight I can\u2019t stand the thought of you\u2014\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>Cam had lost a family member tonight and he was trying to keep it together for her. He deserved her sympathy, not her anger. \u201cCam. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared. For him. For me...\u201d For us went unsaid.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. I promise.\u201d He stroked her jawline. \u201cLet\u2019s take it a day at a time, okay? Tomorrow morning you\u2019ll tell Anton about his mom. Get through that first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t I tell him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason to wake the boy to bad news when tonight is probably one of the last nights of sleep he\u2019ll have for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s head spun. She just wanted to curl into Cam and let his solid presence surround her and reassure her.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He hauled her onto his lap and buried his face in her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you after the day I\u2019ve had and the shitty days in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched as they held each other.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cI wish you could stay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I promised Brandt I\u2019d wait awhile before I told our family about Luke. It\u2019s been a few hours so I\u2019ve got some calls to make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to wake Anton up to bad news, but you\u2019re going to call your brothers and other family members and do the same thing?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo. I guess you\u2019re right. It\u2019ll keep.\u201d Cam\u2019s hold locked them together, even as they were mired in their own separate, anguished thoughts.</p><p>He cocked his head back to look at her.</p><p>And Domini was lost in a million conflicting emotions when his mouth pressed to hers, helpless to keep the tears from falling when he kissed her so sweetly, like she was the most precious thing on the planet. The kiss lingered, almost as if they knew it\u2019d be a while before they\u2019d get the chance again.</p><p>Cam rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI want to make all the hurt you\u2019ve ever suffered go away. I want to make sure you never hurt again. I want to pull the covers over our heads and wake up to find this was all a bad fucking dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next few days are gonna be pure hell for both of us. Will you keep in touch with me? Promise you won\u2019t do anything rash or crazy like grab Anton and leave in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I will hunt your ass down and drag it back here if you try it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Telling Anton about Nadia\u2019s death was every bit as horrible as Domini imagined. He repeated words \u201cfault\u201d and \u201cblame\u201d and because his sobbing was incoherent, Domini wasn\u2019t sure if Anton was blaming Rex or Nadia or himself.</p><p>The poor boy wept until he passed out from exhaustion. He refused to let go of her hand. What would she do when Social Services came calling and tried to take him away?</p><p>Grateful as Domini was for the outpouring of support from the crew at Dewey\u2019s, she had no idea what to do next. Did she handle memorial service arrangements for Nadia? Was there a will? Did she pack up Nadia\u2019s house and bring Anton\u2019s stuff here? Did she need to hire a lawyer? Would they give her custody\u2014even temporary\u2014if she wasn\u2019t a blood relative? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And while all the scenarios raced in her head, she grieved. Nadia had been her friend, her roommate, the closest thing Domini had ever had to a sister. Now she was gone. Every single time she thought of that, she cried.</p><p>Soft knocking on the apartment door forced Domini to wipe her tears and get off the couch. She shot a look to her bedroom and listened, but the noise hadn\u2019t disturbed Anton.</p><p>Domini opened the door to Skylar McKay. Nadia\u2019s boss. Her eyes were swollen, her face was puffy. The second their gazes connected, more tears spilled from Skylar\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Domini said. \u201cAnton is sleeping in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Skylar squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cStupid question. That poor sweet boy. We\u2019re all just heartsick. I closed the plant for a couple days.\u201d</p><p>Nadia had loved working at Sky Blue. She\u2019d gotten close to the other employees after she\u2019d divorced Rex. And because Sky Blue maintained onsite daycare, everyone knew Anton.</p><p>Skylar clasped Domini\u2019s hands as she sat across from her. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea what to do first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should plan Nadia\u2019s memorial service. The girls volunteered to clear out Nadia\u2019s house and bring Anton\u2019s stuff to you, including any paperwork. I doubt Nadia had a will and that brings me to my next question.\u201d Skylar leaned forward. \u201cWhat happens to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nadia had no other family. I have no idea how the American system works, if Anton becomes a ward of the state or what.\u201d Domini looked away, sickness churning in her belly as awful memories from that turbulent time in her life resurfaced. \u201cRight after my parents died in the Ukraine, I was turned over to an orphanage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Domini. I\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable talking about. But you can understand why I don\u2019t want him to end up in foster care. Ever. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get custody of him, Skylar. I love him. I lived with him for two years. There is no one alive who knows that boy better than me. He needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you need him,\u201d Skylar murmured. \u201cThat should work in your favor. But I do think you need to hire a lawyer.\u201d She unearthed a stack of post-its from her purse and scrawled a number. \u201cCall Ginger Paulson. You met her at Keely\u2019s party. She\u2019s done corporate legal work for me. Since she\u2019s a single mom, my guess is she\u2019d be a bulldog on this case.\u201d</p><p>Domini tucked the note into her pocket. \u201cThank you. I think Ginger was Nadia\u2019s divorce attorney.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen she\u2019d already have legal paperwork about Rex. It might speed things up.\u201d Skylar glanced at her watch. \u201cI have to run. I\u2019m meeting Indy, AJ, Channing and Libby. We\u2019re going over to see Jessie. Which is just another horrible situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow awful for her to lose her husband. Cam was really shaken up last night after having to tell her and Luke\u2019s brother. Then he had to come here to tell me about Nadia... Sometimes I think he has the worst job in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt boggles my mind. He never wanted to be a rancher because it\u2019s a thankless job, and yet he\u2019s a cop, which is even more thankless.\u201d Skylar squeezed Domini\u2019s hand. \u201cDespite all the bad shit that\u2019s gone down in the last twenty-four hours, I\u2019m\u2014we\u2019re\u2014really glad that Cam came to you last night, Domini. He\u2019s kept his distance from most of his family since returning from Iraq.\u201d</p><p>Domini couldn\u2019t fathom why, but she had more things to worry about than Cam\u2019s sticky family situation. \u201cIs Jessie getting a lot of support from Luke\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Skylar\u2019s face turned hard. \u201cI never understood the riff between Casper McKay and his brothers, but now I see why\u2014that man is a plain mean bastard. Jessie is the sweetest girl in the world, who\u2019s just suffered a huge loss and she doesn\u2019t deserve any of this bullshit about Luke\u2019s stake in the McKay Ranch...\u201d Tears pooled in Skylar\u2019s eyes. \u201cSorry. I have to get control of myself. The last thing Jessie needs is more angry people around her.\u201d She stood. \u201cKeep in touch. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise. Thanks, Sky.\u201d</p><p>Domini had barely closed the door, when she heard, \u201cMom?\u201d drifting from the bedroom.</p><p>She took a deep breath and wandered in to the room and perched on the edge of the bed. \u201cHey. You hungry? I\u2019ve got cookies.\u201d</p> <p>Anton had a death grip on his fleece blanket. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mom? Is she coming to get me soon?\u201d</p><p>Domini swallowed a sob. \u201cNo, sweetling, your mom had an accident, remember?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. Confused. \u201cI thought it was a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not. And I know just how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Angrily, he said, \u201cOh yeah? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when I was eleven both my parents died.\u201d</p><p>His mouth made an O of surprise. \u201cWhere did you live after they died?\u201d</p><p>In hell. She swept the hair from his tear-stained cheek and changed the subject. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Anton shook his head. \u201cAm I gonna live here with you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so. I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep you with me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over to face the wall.</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t push. She just stayed with him as he cried himself to sleep once again.</p><p>Four days later...</p><p>With so many people filing in and out of her apartment, Domini considered leaving the door open. But she would\u2019ve triple locked it if she\u2019d known Social Services would darken her doorstep.</p><p>The agency woman resembled every supervisor Domini had dealt with in the Ukraine: older, gray-haired, her sharp eyes were only second to her sharp tongue.</p><p>\u201cSorry for the lack of notice about this visit, Miss Katzinski. The case file from Sheriff Shortbull came to us late.\u201d</p><p>Had Cam played a part in delaying the information? Probably not. Since that would\u2019ve been wrong, and Deputy Cam McKay always did the right thing. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting this visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s get straight to the point. Anton DeMarco is currently in your care, following the death of his mother, Nadia DeMarco and his father, Rex DeMarco. Do you consider this a temporary arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I intend to file for permanent legal custody of Anton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the boy\u2019s father? Rex DeMarco has no surviving relatives that might be interested in retaining custody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain. But I do know that Anton\u2019s mother retained sole custody in the divorce, which was not contested by Rex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And what was your relationship to Nadia DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my best friend. We were housemates for a couple years. During that time I helped take care of Anton.\u201d I helped her raise Anton.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m general manager of Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, a family restaurant. It\u2019s right downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived in Sundance, Miss Katzinski?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you own property in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>What did that have to do with anything? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to moving to Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenver, Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Denver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLubbock, Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Lubbock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiami, Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Miami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharleston, South Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in South Carolina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Charleston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHershey, Pennsylvania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Pennsylvania?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Hershey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCincinnati, Ohio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Ohio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Cincinnati?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago, Illinois.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in residence in Illinois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you live previous to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKharkiv, the Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you spell that for me, please?\u201d</p><p>Domini did.</p><p>Scribble, scribble.</p><p>\u201cYou immigrated to the United States from the Ukraine nearly twelve years ago. You became a naturalized citizen of the United States six years ago. In twelve years you\u2019ve lived...eight places. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Scribble, scribble.</p><p>\u201cDo you have family in the Ukraine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was orphaned at age eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have family in Sundance or any of the other seven locales you listed as former residences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Domini\u2019s hopes were sinking. When faced with the cold hard facts about her nomadic life, even though she had valid reasons for the continual relocation, she felt her chances of keeping Anton were getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>Maybe he belongs with a real family.</p><p>No! She was his family.</p><p>Mrs. Beesman glanced up. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak with Anton now.\u201d</p><p>Domini nodded. She poked her head in the small bedroom and gestured for Anton to come out.</p><p>Anton sat right next to Domini and gripped her hand. He was trying so hard to be brave but his bottom lip quivered and Domini almost lost it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnton, I\u2019m going to ask you some questions. Be as truthful as you can. If you feel you could be more truthful if we were having this conversation somewhere else, just between you and me, we can stop right now until I can arrange that.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth. The boy was seven years old. He still believed in Santa Claus for godsake. How was he supposed to understand the implication Domini might be somehow coercing him?</p><p>\u201cDomini, don\u2019t leave. Don\u2019t make me go somewhere else away from you. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t, sweetling. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Beesman\u2019s questions for Anton were neutral. But when she asked him why he thought Domini wanted custody of him, he simply said, \u201cBecause she loves me and she already knows how to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t bother to hide her tears.</p><p>Just like that the interview ended and Mrs. Beesman bustled out.</p><p>Neither she nor Anton spoke for a while. When he started swinging his feet\u2014a nervous habit he\u2019d always had\u2014she knew something bothered him. \u201cHey, buddy, what\u2019s going on in that smart head of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I told her a lie.\u201d</p><p>Fear skittered down her spine. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout when she asked why you wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said exactly the right thing, the true thing. I do love you. I do know how to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes filled with such confusion and pain her heart nearly stopped. \u201cBut do you think I shoulda told her that you want me because no one else does?\u201d</p><p>Those broken words sent her heart plummeting to her toes. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that. Don\u2019t ever think that. Anyone would be thrilled to have you, but I don\u2019t want to give anyone else a chance because I want you most of all, understand?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. He crawled into her lap, clinging as if he were afraid to let her go. She understood the feeling.</p><p>Not for the first time, Domini thought if the court ruled against her for custody of this sweet, needy little boy, she\u2019d take Anton and run.</p><p>And she had a sneaking suspicion Mrs. Beesman from Social Services had come to the exact same conclusion.</p><p>Cam hadn\u2019t seen Domini for days and he was going insane.</p><p>Before they\u2019d hooked up, Cam had seen Domini every day. Sometimes twice a day. He wasn\u2019t about to walk away when he\u2019d come to terms with how he felt about her.</p><p>In addition to setting up Nadia\u2019s memorial service, Domini was taking care of Anton fulltime. He\u2019d dealt with his cousin Luke\u2019s funeral and all the family shit that went along with it, which reminded him why he tended to avoid all that unpleasantness.</p><p>Might not be PC, but Cam could give a crap how Anton reacted to him being at Domini\u2019s place. Far as he was concerned, the kid better get used to seeing him.</p><p>Cam knocked twice. The fifteen-second wait for her to unlock the door was excruciating. Then Domini, his sweet, beautiful, wonderful Domini, stood in front of him, close enough to touch, close enough to kiss. He hugged her hard, kissed her hard and was totally hard.</p> <p>\u201cCome in the kitchen. You hungry? There\u2019s leftover casserole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have much of an appetite lately.\u201d</p><p>Domini brought them both a beer. He was a little surprised when she parked herself on his lap.</p><p>They stayed that way, not speaking, just being together. Cam had never known anyone as comfortable with silence as Domini. He\u2019d never known anyone like Domini period.</p><p>This awful week without her had just reinforced the truth: Cam was totally head over heels in love with her. Nothing had ever felt so real, so right.</p><p>Too bad his timing was all wrong. Domini had so many life changing events to get through, he didn\u2019t want to burden her with his declaration of love. When the time was right, he\u2019d blurt out everything in his heart. Every sappy thing.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back to look at her. \u201cSorry, I was kinda spacing out. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She fingered the necklace he\u2019d given her. \u201cCome to bed with me. Please. I know you can\u2019t stay, but I need to be with you, even for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Touched by her sweet hesitation, Cam clasped her hand and directed her to the bedroom, locking the door behind them.</p><p>She stripped. She helped him strip. She left his prosthesis on and pushed him on his back. After she straddled him, she ran her hands up the insides of his arms and pinned his arms above his head.</p><p>\u201cMy way,\u201d she said and kissed him.</p><p>Holy shit did Domini kiss him. Seductively. Wantonly. Relentlessly. She licked and bit his lips as her tongue tasted and teased. Her kisses destroyed him, turning him into a raging beast; her caresses tamed him into a junkie who craved her touch. His body burned from the light stroke of her fingertips over his skin. He bowed up from the silken rasp of the pads of her thumbs across his nipples. The bite of her nails into his scalp stung as she held him in place and kissed him stupid.</p><p>Domini locked her gaze to his. She grasped his cock and impaled herself in one deep stroke.</p><p>She kept the pace fast enough to excite but slow enough to tantalize. When she whispered, \u201cPut your hands on me and help me ride,\u201d Cam gritted his teeth against the urge to flip her on her back and fuck her through the mattress.</p><p>But he let her choose the pace. He let her love him with the desperation they both felt. Domini didn\u2019t drag it out; she took them both to the brink and kicked them into sweet ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cI needed that,\u201d she panted against his throat.</p><p>I needed you.</p><p>Domini kept touching his body, as if trying to memorize his shape. Then she sighed and nestled deeper into him. \u201cI could fall asleep like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to try it sometime.\u201d He stroked her back and waited for her get whatever was bugging her off her chest.</p><p>\u201cCam, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019d understand if you\u2019d say no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask me.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath. \u201cWill you come to the lawyer\u2019s office with me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>He was pretty shocked she\u2019d asked him because she never asked him for anything. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cam started to drift off. It was tough forcing himself to leave the warmth of her bed, the comfort of her body and the serenity she brought him. It was tougher yet when she kissed him goodnight and it felt as if she was kissing him goodbye.</p><p>Maybe it had been a goodbye fuck, because Domini had warned him she\u2019d run with Anton if things didn\u2019t go in her favor.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>No way would she leave here. No way would she leave him. He\u2019d do whatever it took to make sure she stayed.</p><p>Whatever. It. Took.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cDomini, Deputy McKay. Good to have you both here, have a seat.\u201d Ginger Paulson indicated two tweed wingback chairs in front of her desk. She scooted her leather chair in and donned a pair of glasses.</p><p>\u201cWithout violating confidentiality agreements, I will tell you I filed Nadia\u2019s divorce. When it appeared Rex might contest it, which is a rarity in this day and age, I had Nadia on record discussing the domestic violence issues that\u2019d plagued their marriage. I requested a copy of the police records. At the last minute, Rex agreed to the terms of irreconcilable differences. He also agreed to sign over sole custody of Anton DeMarco, to Nadia, with the stipulation he was no longer responsible for child support, which Nadia agreed to.\u201d</p><p>Ginger peered over the rim of her glasses. \u201cDomini, it is your intention to file for permanent legal guardianship of Anton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s going to be tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to admit it, the state does have sound reasons for the recommendation of Anton\u2019s immediate transfer from your temporary care into a foster home.\u201d</p><p>Domini compressed Cam\u2019s hand painfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the reasons?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Ginger looked right at Domini. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a blood relative nor are you licensed for foster care. You are a single woman. You don\u2019t own property. You don\u2019t have family in the area. You have a history of transient behavior. Any one of those is a strike against you. But all of them?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBut there were circumstances with the church group who sponsored me to the U.S. that I had no control over. They moved around a lot and since I was here with them on a work visa...I didn\u2019t have a choice but to follow them wherever they went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe biggest concern the state has right now, even if you were licensed for foster care, is you are considered a flight risk. A high flight risk.\u201d</p><p>Cam said, \u201cBullshit,\u201d but he noticed Domini didn\u2019t immediately deny it.</p><p>Hope drained out of Domini\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose him, aren\u2019t I? The state workers will show up and drag him to a stranger\u2019s house where they don\u2019t know he hates carrots and he loves to draw and he has to have his Cars blanket at night or he can\u2019t sleep and he\u2019s scared of the dark...\u201d Her tears fell.</p><p>Cam felt as if he\u2019d been gutted. Dammit, it was his fucking job to uphold the law and he hated these situations existed where the law was utter bullshit. Domini was the best person to have custody of Anton. She loved him, and she\u2019d be a great mother to him. So what if she didn\u2019t have the official foster care certification? So what if she didn\u2019t own a house? So what if she was single?</p><p>A light bulb pinged and the \u201cHallelujah Chorus\u201d rang out in his head.</p><p>Bingo. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of it before?</p><p>Because you were dealing with your own family issues.</p><p>\u201cBut if Domini was married to a local law enforcement officer, who has taken the required Social Services classes regarding foster care, who owns property, who has family ties to the area for several generations, what would her flight risk be considered then?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPractically zero,\u201d Ginger answered.</p><p>\u201cFine. Domini and I will get married. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Cam. No. What are you doing?\u201d Domini was flustered and pale and about to start hyperventilating.</p> <p>Cam aimed a cool look at her and faced Ginger. \u201cCould you give us a minute alone please?\u201d</p><p>Ginger didn\u2019t bat an eye at his request. \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Ginger was gone, Domini blurted, \u201cCam, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Cam said, \u201cDo you want Anton? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! But I don\u2019t want him temporarily. I want him permanently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. You can have him if you marry me.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cUs? Married? But...I thought we\u2019d break things off now that everything in my life has changed.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t bite her head off for thinking so lowly of you. \u201cDomini. I\u2019m not the kind of man who bails when things get tough. You should know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut married? Us? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better solution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p> <p>Was that hope or panic glazing her eyes?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me, Cam?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d do anything for you. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve sworn to never get married. Neither of us envisioned this kind of scenario. So this solution makes perfect sense for a situation that was thrust on you. If you marry me, you get to keep Anton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould this be temporary?\u201d</p><p>Fuck no. It\u2019s for good, it\u2019s for real, it\u2019s forever and ever amen. \u201cIs the thought of marrying me, even for a little while, so awful?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Domini shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen marry me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, a million questions in her eyes. \u201cWill anyone know the real reason we\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll keep it strictly between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>Because I love you. Because you\u2019ll think I\u2019m being selfless. Because by giving you the one thing you want so badly, Anton, I get the only thing I want: you.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>He cleared the emotion from his throat and told a bald-faced lie. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t smile. She didn\u2019t fling herself into his arms. She didn\u2019t happily shriek the word...yes.</p><p>Sweat broke out under his collar. Cam figured the lie was about to bite him in the ass. If he confessed the truth, shouting his love for her to the rafters, would that sway her to say yes? Or scare her into saying no?</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your answer, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>Cam could\u2019ve floated out of the room.</p><p>When Ginger returned, Cam announced, \u201cWe\u2019re getting married as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Ginger beamed at both of them. \u201cHowever, the courthouse is closed today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow then,\u201d Cam insisted.</p><p>Domini\u2019s face went pasty white.</p><p>\u201cAfter I receive confirmation of the marriage, I\u2019ll file a rebuttal with the Department of Social Services, requesting Anton DeMarco immediately be placed in the foster care of Cameron and Domini McKay.\u201d Ginger grinned again. \u201cI do so love a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>Cam wondered if Ginger\u2019s happiness stemmed from figuring out a way to buck the legal system. Lawyers got off on shit like that all the time.</p><p>\u201cStick around Wyoming the next couple of weeks until we\u2019re through the preliminary foster care assignment process. Then you can jet off for a romantic honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Cam helped Domini to her feet. She seemed to be having a hard time functioning.</p><p>Not Cam. Cam felt like doing a jig.</p><p>Domini wobbled to Cam\u2019s truck on jelly-like legs.</p><p>Domini and I will get married. Today.</p><p>She\u2019d almost passed out hearing Cam\u2019s matter-of-fact tone. Like it was no big deal. Like it was already a done deal.</p><p>By this time tomorrow Cam McKay would be her husband.</p><p>Unreal.</p><p>She sagged against the front bumper of his truck, twisting the necklace chain around her finger. As soon as they\u2019d walked out the door, Cam\u2019s cell phone rang with police business and he instructed her to wait for him. So, they\u2019d had no chance to discuss this bizarre development.</p><p>What was she supposed to say to him anyway? Ask him why he was suddenly willing to take on the responsibility of a wife and a child? A child he didn\u2019t know?</p><p>It made zero sense. Why was he volunteering to turn his life upside down? Cam loved his privacy. He loved living by himself to the point his own family was rarely welcomed into his sanctuary. Why would Cam offer to open his home and his life not only her, but to a rambunctious boy with emotional scars?</p><p>Sex. Pure and simple.</p><p>It might\u2019ve been different if Cam had confessed his undying love for her. But he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d merely resigned himself to doing the right thing.</p><p>When Domini asked him if the marriage was temporary, he\u2019d hedged. So maybe Cam wasn\u2019t treating this as a lifetime vow. Maybe the spectacular sex was enough incentive to keep up the appearance of a real marriage for a while. But once she started the adoption process, his \u201cdo the right thing\u201d mission would be successful and he\u2019d be free to move on.</p><p>If that was the case, then there was no reason to tell Cam anything about her medical issues because it wouldn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d be his wife for as long as it took her to adopt Anton.</p><p>Now that made perfect sense. She\u2019d consider this a business arrangement. She\u2019d keep her finances separate. Keep her job. Keep everything simple.</p><p>Domini just had to keep herself from falling in love with him.</p><p>A Cam-sized shadow fell over her. \u201cSorry about that. I traded with Sayzers to get the next two days off.\u201d He touched her face and offered a dazzling smile. \u201cThe ceremony is one o\u2019clock tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Ask him why he\u2019s doing this. Force him to give you a real reason.</p><p>But Domini couldn\u2019t get her tongue unstuck from the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, princess. The look on your face is scaring the holy hell outta me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t...\u201d White specks wavered in front of her eyes. She couldn\u2019t suck enough air into her lungs. Blood whooshed in her ears. Her heart threatened to beat out of her chest.</p><p>Oh God. Please, not now.</p><p>\u201cDomini? Baby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d She flapped her hand in front of her face as if that would help.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Cam hauled her to her feet. He put his palms over her ears and tipped her head to look directly into her eyes. \u201cBreathe with me. Nice and slow, okay?\u201d</p><p>Below her line of vision, she could see his chest expand as he inhaled. She followed his lead. In. Out. In. Out.</p><p>\u201cGood. Three more. Come on, you\u2019re doin\u2019 great.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she felt calmer, but she was still embarrassed. She focused on the placket of his uniform shirt and tried to blink the tears back. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d Cam kept stroking the side of her face. \u201cShould I be worried you had a panic attack at the thought of marrying me?\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s gaze flew to his. \u201cNo! It\u2019s not you! It\u2019s me. This happens when I\u2019m stressed and I can\u2019t remember ever being more stressed in my life. I want Anton, but what do I know about raising him? Babysitting isn\u2019t the same as living with him every day for the next eleven years. What if I\u2019m not the best choice? And then you offer to marry me, which you\u2019ve got to admit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now. Relax.\u201d His hands tightened on her scalp. \u201cNo reason to get worked up again. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on breathing slowly.</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen often, princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as it used to.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a prize, Cam. I have issues and baggage and...damage that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of my own issues, most of which you\u2019ve already seen and dealt with, so I think that makes us pretty evenly matched.\u201d He wiped a tear from the corner of her eye. \u201cSo are you feeling calmer now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I am getting married tomorrow! I don\u2019t have a wedding dress. My best friend is dead and I don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to. I don\u2019t have a clue if I\u2019m supposed to pack everything tonight. Are we moving in with you right away? Do you want me to tell Anton we\u2019re getting married, or should we do it together? And who all is coming to the wedding? What about the other legal stuff? We hardly discussed that with Ginger\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cam placed his finger over her mouth, stopping her tirade. \u201cYou can really work up a head of steam, can\u2019t you?\u201d He traced her lips with the pad of his thumb. \u201cOne thing at a time. You and Anton will be living with me as soon as we exchange I do\u2019s. You can tell him the happy news because I\u2019ll be wrapping up a few things at my place tonight to get ready for you to move in.</p><p>\u201cAs far as the ceremony? You and me are the only ones who matter. We\u2019ll need witnesses and I\u2019d like Colt to stand up for me. I can talk to Keely and see if she\u2019ll help you figure out some of the girly stuff since she\u2019s been through a dozen weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-ah. I ain\u2019t done. Now, what haven\u2019t we addressed as far as legal issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should have a prenuptial agreement.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want your money if this doesn\u2019t work out. I will want sole custody of Anton and I won\u2019t expect you to pay child support for him. And Skylar mentioned legal issues Jessie\u2019s dealing with, as far as Luke\u2019s stake in the McKay Ranch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. None of that shit matters. We\u2019ll figure it out as we go along.\u201d Cam leaned in so they were nose to nose. \u201cYou are changing your name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not a question.</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to keep Katzinski?\u201d</p><p>Cam granted her the slow, sexy smile that turned her knees weak. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got that settled...\u201d He kissed her. Lord did he ever kiss her.</p> <p>After he released her mouth, he nuzzled her cheek, her hair, her neck. \u201cDomini, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered, feeling the urgency in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d His breath drifted across her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later and I\u2019ll see you at the courthouse tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Cam smooched her forehead and climbed in his truck.</p><p>Evidently what he\u2019d meant to say hadn\u2019t been so urgent after all.</p> <p>Cam had chickened out telling Domini he loved her and none of the legal stuff mattered because their marriage would be real in every sense of the word.</p><p>It\u2019d been hard seeing her caught off balance, seeing her struggle. She wasn\u2019t sure of anything.</p><p>But Cam had never been more sure of anything in his life.</p><p>His first call was to his sister. \u201cHey Keely, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. This is important. Can you keep a secret?\u201d</p> <p>A beat passed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep your secret if you forget what you saw at Colt and Indy\u2019s wedding reception and we never ever ever bring it up again.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to him about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I hate him! Hate him, understand? And if I ever see that smug, self-serving, self-righteous prick again, I\u2019ll cut off his limp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it. So, if you help me, I will erase my memory of the incident in question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini and I are getting married tomorrow.\u201d Cam grinned like a loon. He couldn\u2019t help it. By this time tomorrow that Ukrainian princess would be his. His wife. In his bed every night. Forever.</p><p>Keely squealed. \u201cGet out! That is so awesome.\u201d She went quiet. \u201cDammit, Cam, you\u2019re not telling anyone else in the family, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Well, I\u2019m gonna ask Colt to stand up for me at the courthouse. Which means Indy will know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy the big secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKay family can be overwhelming. With Luke\u2019s death, and what Domini is going through after Nadia\u2019s death, and dealing with Anton...we decided to keep it simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s standing up for Domini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pick me, pick me! I couldn\u2019t stand it if I didn\u2019t get to be in your wedding, Cam. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Domini\u2019s choice. If you get over to her place right away and help her, she\u2019ll probably pick you. She was kinda freaked out, to be honest. She doesn\u2019t have a dress or flowers, and the rest of that girly crap I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. I will take care of it pronto.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cAnd can I just say I\u2019m really really really happy for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can.\u201d His wild child baby sis was such a softie. \u201cDo you still have Grandma Dinah\u2019s wedding ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeppers. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Grandma left it to you and all, and obviously I\u2019d pay you for it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron West McKay, you\u2019ll do no such thing as pay me! I don\u2019t know why the hell she ever left it to me anyway, unless she thought it was the only wedding ring I\u2019d ever get.\u201d</p><p>Cam laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped one of my brothers would want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I am the last male to get married, it ain\u2019t like you\u2019ve got a choice on which brother,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Even though Keely was mute on the other end of the phone, he heard the gears churning.</p><p>Why the sudden marriage? Why was he denying his family a chance to share in his happiness? Especially when he\u2019d had so little of it in the last few years?</p><p>Cam heard her intake of breath and he braced himself.</p><p>But Keely\u2019s train of thought had nothing to do with his impending nuptials. \u201cSo if Domini is moving in with you right away I totally call dibs on her apartment.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201c...by the State of Wyoming, I pronounce you husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss my bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>Cam flashed Domini a devastating, possessive grin. Then his hands were cupping her face and he kissed her with such melting sweetness, with such pride and intent, Domini knew she\u2019d start bawling if he kept it up.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cSave some of those kisses for tonight when we\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot plenty more where those came from. Now that you\u2019re mine, I can kiss you pretty much any time I please, wife.\u201d</p><p>Colt clapped Cam on the back. \u201cCongrats, bro.\u201d He hugged Domini. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cam took Colt aside to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cDomini, you look gorgeous, fabulous, radiant all those bridely type words,\u201d India said. Her curious gaze zoomed to the chain circling Domini\u2019s neck. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get the necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam gave it to me last week.\u201d Lord. It seemed like a lifetime ago. But Domini had gotten so used to wearing the necklace, she felt naked if she took it off.</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve guessed Cam was so...generous.\u201d Indy traced the satin sleeve banded across Domini\u2019s biceps. \u201cAnd wow. Who would\u2019ve thought this color would be perfect for a wedding dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely thought of it.\u201d She\u2019d shown up yesterday afternoon with three wedding dress choices. This one stood out\u2014a simple, short silk sheath in aquamarine.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it match her eyes exactly? I knew there was a reason I was compelled to buy this classy dress last year...it just wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>\u201cKeely, I can\u2019t thank you enough for all you did to get me ready. The dress. The hair. The makeup. The bridal bouquet.\u201d Driving her to Spearfish so she could pick out a wedding band for Cam.</p><p>Her husband.</p><p>Oh God. She\u2019d really done it. She\u2019d really married him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. We\u2019re sisters now.\u201d Keely hip-checked Indy and whispered, \u201cSo now that Domini is officially a McKay, let\u2019s figure out where you\u2019re gonna tattoo her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I have to get a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. India has tattooed all the women who\u2019ve married into the McKay family with the McKay cattle brand. It\u2019s something we started with AJ.\u201d Keely grinned. \u201cSince we didn\u2019t throw a bachelorette party before AJ\u2019s wedding, we had a private tattoo party afterward at Indy\u2019s new studio. Channing and Macie\u2019s brands are \u2018tramp stamps\u2019 on their lower backs. Mine is on my hip. Indy did hers on the inside of her left thigh last year. Skylar\u2019s is on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAt the McKay branding we convinced Libby and Jessie to get \u2019em too. Which was when I came up with the brilliant idea for the first annual Cowgirl\u2019s Night Out.\u201d A moment of silence passed as they all thought about Jessie, and how much everything had changed since that night. Keely squeezed Domini\u2019s hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll be happy for you and Cam, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going to be happy for you two,\u201d India added.</p><p>\u201cOnce they all get over being pissed off they weren\u2019t invited to the wedding,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>That had bothered Domini. It was like Cam was...embarrassed to be marrying her. Or maybe he wanted to save the big family celebration for when he got married for real.</p><p>Anton wormed his way between India and Keely. \u201cDomini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetling.\u201d She smoothed his cowlick. \u201cYou were very good during the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really married to him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Domini held out her left hand. The large, square pale blue stone glimmered in the light. She definitely planned on asking Cam where he\u2019d found such a stunning ring\u2014on such short notice. \u201cAnd tomorrow we\u2019re both moving into Cam\u2019s house. Tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a special sleepover planned for you, Anton, to officially welcome you into the McKay family.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Domini looked up at Keely. \u201cWhat? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>India crouched down and spoke to Anton. \u201cAll the ladies at Sky Blue miss seeing you, sport, and they know how much you miss your mom. They miss her too. So Skylar set up a pizza and movie night tonight with your friends from Sky Blue daycare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust babies,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>But Domini could tell he was interested.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ky, my nephew, is spending the night with you at Kade and Skylar\u2019s house.\u201d Keely whispered, \u201cKy is ready to hang out with you because all of his other cousins are younger. A couple of them are even\u2014gasp\u2014girls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKy\u2019s okay,\u201d Anton said. \u201cSo is Eliza.\u201d His eyes pleaded with Domini. \u201cAre you gonna be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d India said firmly. \u201cBut we will bring you back to her and Cam first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise you aren\u2019t going nowhere? You promise you\u2019ll come for me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word, Anton.\u201d How was she supposed to leave him?</p><p>\u201cJust one night,\u201d Keely assured him.</p><p>\u201cWell...okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll swing by Domini\u2019s apartment and load up your stuff, and then you, Indy and me will hit the grocery store for serious junk food. I hear you like cookies.\u201d Keely started to lead him away.</p><p>They\u2019d made it about ten feet when Anton stopped. He barreled back to Domini and threw his arms around her, nearly knocking her over. \u201cPromise? You promise I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d She squeezed him tightly and for once he didn\u2019t try to squirm away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my wife?\u201d Cam\u2019s voice boomed in the small space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anton jumped back and looked up at Cam.</p><p>\u201cHey, Anton.

You need to be alone with your husband without worrying about a seven-year-old boy. And considering all that Anton has been through, Indy and I knew he\u2019d be comfortable at Sky\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>These people, this family was so thoughtful it brought a lump to Domini\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cBut I did have to tell Sky and Kade you guys were getting married so she could do some planning. Cam said it was okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is wonderful. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Cam kissed Keely\u2019s head. \u201cYou are the best sister ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d She smirked. \u201cNow can I tell everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it. Be nice to have good news to hear about our family for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen.\u201d Keely gave them both a quick hug and practically skipped out, cell phone at her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we go home, Mrs. McKay?\u201d</p> <p>Domini let her gaze linger on him. Talk about outrageously handsome. Cam had worn his dress green Army uniform rather than a traditional suit for the ceremony. With medals and patches adorning his chest and arms, and a burgundy beret on his head, he looked every inch the warrior soldier. And he was all hers.</p><p>At least for a little while.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLead the way, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s house didn\u2019t look different. And yet, it looked completely different. Because this was her home now?</p><p>\u201cHang on, lemme come around and help you out so you don\u2019t get that pretty dress dirty.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her from the truck, and managed to steal a kiss. She had a sneaking suspicion she should get used to it. Mr. Tough Guy Cam was more publicly affectionate than she\u2019d ever dreamed.</p><p>Once they were on the deck, Cam swooped her up into his arms again.</p><p>\u201cCam! What are you doing? Your leg\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs fine. And I\u2019m carryin\u2019 my bride over the threshold, which is tradition in case you didn\u2019t know, bein\u2019s you\u2019re Ukrainian.\u201d</p><p>Touched beyond measure, she buried her face in his neck.</p><p>Cam pretended not to notice her tears. \u201cThere now, that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d He set her down and hugged her from behind. \u201cWelcome home. Anything you want to change around here, feel free.\u201d</p><p>This place was perfect and he knew it. \u201cI shall endeavor to suffer through the lack of amenities until I am able to make the much needed changes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Domini sniffed. \u201cWhat is that delicious scent coming from the kitchen? Did you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m about the worst cook on the planet.\u201d Cam grabbed her hand and towed her to the kitchen.</p><p>They both froze.</p><p>The table was covered with a crisp linen tablecloth. Two place settings, china dishes, silver, crystal wine and water glasses, were cozied side by side. An enormous bouquet of colorful wildflowers anchored one end; unlit candles in several sizes, shapes and colors anchored the other end. A bottle of champagne poked out of a silver bucket, alongside two beribboned champagne flutes, which read bride and groom. A piece of stationery was balanced between the salad plates.</p><p>\u201cDid you do all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could say, yes, but I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d He pointed at the note. \u201cBet that\u2019ll tell us who did.\u201d</p><p>Domini flipped it open and read:</p><p>\u201cCongrats to the newlyweds! We took the liberty of preparing your wedding supper\u2014Swiss steak and scalloped potatoes are in the crock-pots, salad and chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce are in the refrigerator. Enjoy them at your leisure. Welcome to the family, Domini! Channing and AJ</p><p>PS - Macie says congrats and you\u2019re on vacation for the next three days...\u201d</p><p>She met Cam\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m...stunned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shoulda figured those crazy females would do this after I told my brothers we were getting married today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told them? I didn\u2019t think we were telling anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I wanted to beat Keely to the punch. I\u2019m just so damn happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...the only reason we got married was because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s mouth cut off her protest. Then his hands were in her hair, tearing the hairpins out, shaking her hair free and loose, as he preferred it. Domini was adrift, drowning in his passion.</p><p>\u201cSince supper will keep, I\u2019m taking you to bed. Right now.\u201d</p><p>In their bedroom, after he\u2019d peeled her out of her wedding dress, Domini stood before him naked, feeling strangely shy.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly that I\u2019m nervous. I mean, we\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever as husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>He snatched her hand to kiss the skin above her wedding ring. \u201cJust anxious.\u201d</p><p>She tugged him toward the bed. \u201cMaybe we should do it fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always wanna do it fast,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cYou always wanna do it slow,\u201d she retorted. Domini stretched out on the bed with her arms above her head, one knee up, one leg down, back arched, breasts thrust up, knowing the wanton pose drove Cam crazy.</p><p>After Cam removed his prosthesis, he rolled on top of her. \u201cAre we havin\u2019 our first married-couple fight about sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think it\u2019s important we learn to compromise right away.\u201d She traced the line of his broad shoulders and down that muscular back, to those oh-so-wonderfully tight buns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d He nuzzled her throat in the spot that instantly made her wet.</p><p>\u201cHow about...you start out nice and slow, and then at the end we can go as fast as I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s a compromise I can agree to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I disagree wife, I\u2019m very hard.\u201d Cam angled her hips and eased into her one excruciating inch at a time. \u201cHowever, I think we\u2019ve got this compromise thing down pat.\u201d</p><p>Cam stroked Domini\u2019s head as it rested on his chest, content to hold her, content she was finally where she belonged.</p><p>She picked up their joined hands and studied them. For the third time. \u201cIt was such a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wedding ring. It\u2019s perfect, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. But now you\u2019re gonna ask me where I got it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you tell me a story like...you gave it to the first woman you ever loved. She broke your heart but you kept the ring...then you can skip it.\u201d</p><p>I did give it to the first woman I\u2019ve ever loved.</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 that sinister.\u201d Cam swept his thumb over the stone. \u201cThis ring belonged to my great-grandmother, Dinah. After my great-grandfather died, she took it off and never wore it again. As the only girl, Keely inherited it, but she passed it along to me.\u201d</p><p>Something akin to alarm flared in her eyes. \u201cYou gave me a family heirloom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an issue? You\u2019d prefer a newer ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d The platinum shone around the aquamarine stone. \u201cBut are you sure I should wear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. My brothers already bought their wives rings. Who else should have it?\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t answer. She rubbed her finger over the plain platinum band on his ring finger. He admitted it looked good next to the empty space where his left pinky used to be. It made his hand look...complete.</p><p>\u201cNow I know why Keely insisted on this color for your ring. She was trying to match it to this one.\u201d</p><p>He held their hands side by side. \u201cLooks like a perfect match to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She kissed his pectoral. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Cam insisted Domini wear one of his dress shirts and nothing else. He lit the candles and cracked the champagne while Domini dished up the food. They toasted. They kissed and nuzzled and were drunk on champagne and on each other. It was intimate and sexy and romantic and Cam couldn\u2019t imagine a better wedding supper. Or a better woman to be married to.</p><p>He was hard as concrete after licking raspberry sauce off her nipples. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the dishes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be right there in the morning. I think you get a free pass from doin\u2019 dishes on your wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Domini gave him a saucy look and ran to the bedroom.</p><p>He shoved his crutches by the nightstand and centered himself on the bed. \u201cCome here and kiss your husband, your lord and master.\u201d</p><p>Domini slunk across him, sexy as sin and straddled his groin. \u201cYou called, master?\u201d She giggled. \u201cI can\u2019t even say that with a straight face.\u201d</p><p>He fingered the necklace dangling from her neck. \u201cHave I lost all control over you, wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But she sobered quickly.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Cam twined her soft hair around his fingers. \u201cNo secrets between us now.\u201d</p><p>A bleak look flitted through her eyes. She broke eye contact and kissed the inside of his wrist. \u201cEverything is going to change between us when Anton is living here tomorrow. No more sex on the dining room table. No more bending me over the couch. No more plastering me against the refrigerator. We won\u2019t be able to be as spontaneous with sex. Will that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That grim expression crossed her face again.</p><p>\u201cBut having you in my bed every night more than makes up for it, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have a problem being sexually creative and commanding with a seven-year-old down the hall?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam frowned. \u201cYou think being confined to this room will make me boring in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d She lapped at his nipple. Slowly. Thoroughly. \u201cBut why don\u2019t you show me something new, Mr. McKay, to allay my new bride jitters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage has made you cheeky, Mrs. McKay.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. And kept licking as she trailed her fingers down his belly until they circled his erect cock. She jacked him a couple of times, then rolled his balls between her delicate fingertips.</p><p>\u201cMove down and use your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Domini inched toward his groin.</p><p>For the briefest second he had a flash of panic with Domini being so close to his stump. But she didn\u2019t pay any attention to it. Her eyes were devouring his dick.</p><p>\u201cSuck it.\u201d</p><p>Immediately heat and wetness surrounded the head, then the soft tissues of her mouth. She formed a firm seal around his shaft as she pulled him deep.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Show me how much you love to drive me crazy with that wicked mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>Domini hummed and began the unbroken rhythm he\u2019d taught her.</p><p>Cam withheld a groan. Damn. It felt amazing. But he wanted something more. To teach her a new trick. He clamped his hands around her head, stopping the bobbing motion.</p><p>Puzzled, she glanced up with half his shaft still in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGet the lube in the nightstand drawer and a towel.\u201d</p><p>She let her teeth drag along the sensitive underside of his cock as she released him from her mouth. Once the tube of K-Y and a washcloth were in her hand, that puzzled look returned.</p><p>After she was back in position, he said, \u201cSuck my balls.\u201d</p><p>Her breath teased the taut globes. Then she sucked them, one at a time, until both were resting on her tongue. She sucked experimentally. She sucked perfectly.</p><p>Cam\u2019s pelvis bumped up. \u201cOh hell, Domini.\u201d</p><p>The humming response buzzed up his cock.</p><p>Damn. If she kept that up he\u2019d shoot, guaranteed. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>His balls slipped from her mouth with an audible pop. She licked the length of his shaft, ready to suck him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you blow me to heaven in a second, but here\u2019s the new part you were wanting to try.\u201d</p> <p>That caught her attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna massage my prostate as you\u2019re sucking me off. You ever done that?\u201d</p><p>Domini shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how I like it, so lube up your finger first and then you\u2019ll spread some lube on the seam of my ass.\u201d</p><p>A smile curled the corners of her mouth and her eyes glittered. She cracked open the tube and coated her index finger, leaving a very big glob on the tip.</p><p>Cam felt the cool, slick gel on the strip of skin between his balls, and then the gentle circles she rubbed directly on his hole. \u201cJesus.\u201d He forced his ass to unclench. \u201cNow palm my balls as you\u2019re working the finger inside a little at a time.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue rimmed the head of his cock as she slowly swirled her finger in his ass.</p><p>The burning sensation vanished the second her finger connected with the gland. \u201cOh fuck. Christ, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s so fucking it.\u201d</p><p>As Domini swept her finger back and forth over that magic spot she sucked his cock until the crown bumped the back of her throat.</p><p>Cam figured he\u2019d last about a minute, maybe less. He came with a roar, pumping his hips and Domini made a soft purr as she swallowed every drop of come. Once the throbbing, pulsing orgasm ended, she removed her finger from his ass.</p><p>Holy fucking Christ. His mind blanked. His whole body shook.</p><p>Domini kept kissing and licking her way up his torso.</p><p>He cracked open his eyes. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his pelvis.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Knees on either side of my head and put that pretty pussy on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still going with the \u2018new\u2019 theme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He used his heel to drag himself further down the bed. \u201cHands on the headboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. I don\u2019t know about this\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>He sucked her clitoris and then rubbed his face on her inner thighs. \u201cMmm. Juicy. You are sopping wet, princess. And lucky for you, I\u2019m parched.\u201d He opened her up with his fingers and burrowed his tongue in as far as he could reach. He speared into her over and over. Until her scent coated his face. Until her taste glazed his lips and coated his tongue and flowed down the back of his throat. He basked in her, bathed in her, and lost himself in bringing her\u2014his wife\u2014pleasure.</p><p>When Domini was grinding her wet sex down and her whimpering moans escalated, he sucked her clit hard and she came all over his face.</p><p>Then he did it again.</p><p>After her last climax, she collapsed on the bed. After a bit she snuggled into him on his left side, her right knee below his stump, her toes drifting up and down his calf. Domini sighed dreamily and fell asleep in his arms.</p><p>Cam kissed the top of her head and mouthed, \u201cI love you,\u201d before he joined his wife in dreamland.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Gracie started barking. \u201cSorry, girl, you\u2019re gonna have to go out back for a bit.\u201d</p><p>She whined.</p><p>\u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t have a dog he\u2019s bringing to invade your space.\u201d</p><p>Invade your space. Was that how Cam felt? Domini didn\u2019t want to start the day out on a bad note, so she said nothing and went out to meet Anton.</p><p>After Cord McKay\u2019s pickup parked, Ky jumped out of the passenger side, followed by Anton. The relief on Anton\u2019s face when he saw Domini brought a smile. \u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>Anton hustled up the steps and hugged her. Hard.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun last night?\u201d she asked around the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay.\u201d The door opened behind them and Gracie was jumping and yipping around Anton.</p><p>Domini froze. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie! Settle down. Sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, she\u2019s not hurting me,\u201d Anton said, blocking Domini from the dog. He crouched down and stroked her head. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty. But Gracie is a kinda weird name.\u201d</p><p>Gracie allowed Anton to pet her.</p><p>Kyler leapt onto the deck beside them. \u201cAin\u2019t Gracie great? I wish she wasn\u2019t fixed so she and Rascal could have puppies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuppies would be cool.\u201d</p><p>Cord ambled up and smiled. \u201cCongrats to both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Please tell AJ the dinner was so thoughtful and very delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d He focused on Cam. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better. You?\u201d</p><p>Cord smiled. \u201cI recognize that look.\u201d</p><p>Domini blushed.</p><p>\u201cAre you loadin\u2019 up the stuff from Domini\u2019s apartment today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t thought about it, but I guess I should or else Keely\u2019ll throw it out the window in her desperation to move outta Ma and Dad\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. That\u2019s why me\u2019n Colby are offerin\u2019 to drag stuff up and down the stairs for you.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s smile flattened. \u201cNah, that\u2019s okay, I can get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It won\u2019t take\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I can handle it,\u201d Cam said tersely.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Cord pushed his hat back and stared daggers at Cam. \u201cKy, why don\u2019t you show Anton where Cam keeps the four-wheelers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ky and Anton rounded the deck toward the garage. Gracie whined on the deck.</p><p>Anton stopped and looked at Cam. \u201cCan she come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Say \u2018come\u2019 and pat your leg. But if she jumps up on you, bump her aside with your knee and make her sit. I don\u2019t need her knocking me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Gracie.\u201d Anton slapped his thighs. Gracie took off like a shot, tail wagging.</p><p>The air between Cam and Cord was heavy with tension.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn, Cam. Us wantin\u2019 to help you ain\u2019t a reflection of your disabilities. There\u2019s no sense in you fightin\u2019 them stairs when you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Cam crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re turnin\u2019 it down flat,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cYep.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit. This is asinine. We all just want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo humiliate the cripple?\u201d Cam snapped. \u201cHell, why don\u2019t you invite Colt, Kade, Buck, Quinn and Ben too? So everyone in the whole fuckin\u2019 family knows that I can\u2019t take care of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. Stop.\u201d Domini planted herself in front of him. \u201cTake your brother\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. And if you don\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll move all the stuff by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Cam and Cord said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cSee? You two can agree on something.\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s smile was as slow and as lethally sexy as Cam\u2019s. \u201cI am so gonna love sayin\u2019 \u2018listen to your wife\u2019 little bro, since you get such a huge fuckin\u2019 chuckle outta sayin\u2019 it to me all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>Cam relaxed. Smirked. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Let us help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. As long as it\u2019s only you and Colby. Not Ma and Dad, not anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much anyway, maybe one load, I don\u2019t have much,\u201d Domini said. \u201cAnd Anton\u2019s stuff is still boxed up in the entryway so that\u2019ll be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta just go get it done now.\u201d Cord\u2019s look challenged Cam. \u201cWill it piss you off if I suggest you stay here with the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll say it.\u201d Domini stood on her tiptoes to whisper, \u201cStay here and save your strength for tonight because you\u2019re gonna need it, husband.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be long. And if Anton and Ky get hungry, just feed them mac and cheese.\u201d</p><p>Domini and Cord returned three hours later. Cord stacked the boxes on the deck and Cam insisted on taking them into the house. Once Cord\u2019s truck was unloaded, he and Ky took off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anton sat on the steps with Gracie.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to like you,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u201cWe picked up your stuff from your mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cWant to see your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Domini wondered why Anton was surly. She showed Anton his room. \u201cThe bathroom is across the hall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is your room?\u201d</p><p>She pointed. \u201cRight there. I\u2019m not far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Cam feed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he burned it. Tasted so crappy the dog wouldn\u2019t even eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton! That\u2019s not nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll fix you something.\u201d She whipped up a couple grilled cheese sandwiches. While Anton devoured the entire plate, she jotted down grocery items. Good Lord the man was a bachelor to the core when it came to food. That\u2019d have to change.</p><p>Cam entered the kitchen through the sliding glass door. \u201cI thought I smelled food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a grilled cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He came up behind her and kissed her neck, sending a delicious shiver through her. \u201cBetter make it two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to hit the grocery store later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>Domini looked over at Anton. \u201cAnything special I need to put on the list?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOreos. Chips. Mountain Dew. Cap\u2019n Crunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, and maybe.\u201d She\u2019d seen a box of Peanut Butter Cap\u2019n Crunch in the cupboard, so she knew Cam liked it. \u201cName something healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?</p><p>\u201cBecause eating that stuff is bad for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I like. My mom never said I couldn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>Anton already played the \u201cmy mom\u201d card? \u201cYour mother and I had very different ideas about food, remember? So for now, we\u2019re doing it my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour way sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cam said sharply, \u201clet\u2019s get one thing straight up front. You don\u2019t get to talk to her like that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Anton hopped down from the breakfast bar.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Domini called out.</p><p>The slam of his bedroom door was the answer.</p><p>\u201cThat went well.\u201d</p><p>Cam tugged her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an adjustment. I\u2019ll cut him a little slack because he just lost his mother. And now he\u2019s living in a strange place. But I won\u2019t stand for him disrespecting you. Or me. Let\u2019s just let him be for now and see what happens, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his mouth over her ear. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Her belly fluttered.</p><p>\u201cI know it ain\u2019t gonna happen until he\u2019s tucked in for the night, but I can\u2019t help myself. I can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope you haven\u2019t gotten enough of me, since we\u2019ve only been married one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe goes to bed early, right?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Domini figured her own bedtime had just gotten a lot earlier too.</p><p>Week Two...</p><p>\u201cAnton. Why are there still markers all over the floor? I\u2019ve told you three times to pick them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it. Geez, you don\u2019t have to get all freaked out.\u201d</p><p>Domini counted to ten. \u201cYes, I do, because Cam could slip on any one of these and fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always take his side,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cSide? What side? Safety and consideration have a side?\u201d</p><p>After Anton shoved the markers in the box, he said, \u201cCan I go out and play with Gracie now?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Please. And stay out there for at least an hour so I don\u2019t snap at you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I worry.\u201d</p><p>Anton snorted. And slammed the door on his way out.</p><p>The first week of marriage had been the week from hell. Anton showed extremely bratty behavior at every opportunity. Cam worked overtime to make up for the days he missed, leaving Domini to deal with Anton and Gracie. Oddly enough, Gracie was the least of her problems.</p><p>Domini had the mixer whirring on full power, so she was surprised when she turned around to see Cam leaning against the counter watching her.</p><p>Would she ever get used to the way this hunky man devoured her with unabashed hunger? His very smug, very male grin indicated he too, was reliving last night\u2019s sexcapades.</p><p>Those sinfully sensual memories bombarded her. Facing each other in the Jacuzzi as the heat and the steam created a sultry haven. The rushing sound of the water jets and the darkness formed an erotic cocoon. The feel of his slippery chest gliding against hers as he fucked her slowly. His mouth sucking on her neck. On her breasts. The naughty words he growled in her ear. Cam\u2019s hands gripping her ass as he lifted and lowered her. How the tight binding around her wrists left her completely at his mercy.</p><p>She\u2019d loved every second of it. And she couldn\u2019t wait to see what Cam had in store for her tonight. Anton\u2019s presence down the hall seemed to challenge Cam to become even more inventive when it came to sex. She smiled and walked straight into his arms.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Now that\u2019s a welcome home a man could get accustomed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your day, Deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better now that I\u2019m here with my wife.\u201d Cam bussed the top of her head. \u201cHow was yours?\u201d</p><p>Trying.</p><p>Don\u2019t burden him with Anton\u2019s issues, her internal voice cautioned. While another countered with, why not? Anton is as much Cam\u2019s responsibility as he is yours.</p><p>But as many times as Domini reminded herself in the last two weeks, it\u2019d never fully sunk in. Mostly because Cam seemed to...tolerate Anton. He wasn\u2019t unpleasant, but he didn\u2019t go out of his way to engage the boy in conversation, either.</p><p>Be patient. These changes will take time. You\u2019ve had two years to get to know Anton, Cam has had two weeks.</p><p>\u201cDomini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve been distracted all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistracted thinking about our water games last night?\u201d he purred in her ear.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019ve planned for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cam chuckled. \u201cI ain\u2019t telling.\u201d</p><p>The timer on the oven buzzed and she pushed away from him. She punched the \u201coff\u201d button and grabbed the potholders. She set three loaves of bread on the wire cooling racks. When she looked up, Cam wore the strangest expression.</p><p>Domini stood in his kitchen wearing smiley face oven mitts.</p><p>Smiley face oven mitts for Christsake.</p><p>The unfamiliar rush of love for her contracted his heart.</p><p>Tell her.</p><p>\u201cCam? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Everything is utterly perfect in my life and I don\u2019t want to fuck it up by doing or saying something to make you leave.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like wheat bread?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNo, I like it.\u201d He pointed to the mixer. \u201cMore bread dough in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, silly. Bread dough is best when it\u2019s hand kneaded. I\u2019m also making cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Anton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for you. White chocolate chip macadamia nut are your favorite, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Domini lightly smacked him with the oven mitt. \u201cNeed I remind you of all the meals you\u2019ve eaten at Dewey\u2019s the past two years? I\u2019ve memorized your favorite foods and the ones you hate.\u201d</p><p>Cam lifted an eyebrow. \u201cNow you have me worried, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if we ever have a fight, I\u2019ll come home to a plate of liver and onions for supper, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, so don\u2019t tick me off.\u201d</p><p>He snagged her around the waist. Cam swallowed her surprised squeak, kissing her with coaxing, dreamy kisses until she melted into him.</p><p>The sliding glass door whooshed open. Gracie yipped and her toenails clattered as she tore around the corner of the breakfast bar. Domini froze. Cam had a split second to shove Domini behind him before Gracie jumped up on Cam\u2019s left side.</p><p>\u201cGracie! Sit. What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Gracie whined and cowered on the floor, recognizing her master\u2019s angry tone.</p><p>Domini\u2019s hand clutched his shoulder. \u201cCam. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. She never used to do this. Took me damn near a year to get her trained not to jump up.\u201d His gaze zoomed to Anton. \u201cHave you been letting her jump on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t tried to stop her like I showed you?\u201d</p><p>Anton shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Fury charged Cam\u2019s system. He managed a curt, \u201cI mind. And you\u2019ll either follow my rules concerning my dog, or I\u2019ll separate the two of you, understand?\u201d</p><p>A stricken look settled on Anton\u2019s face.</p><p>Cam knew Anton had bonded with Gracie, which was good for both boy and dog, but he wouldn\u2019t put up with Anton\u2019s blatant disregard of Gracie\u2019s training or of the rules he\u2019d laid down.</p><p>\u201cCam, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up, stopping Domini\u2019s interference, as he spoke to Anton. \u201cI asked, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d Anton walked off and his bedroom door slammed.</p><p>Jesus. That kid pushed his buttons. And it pissed him off that Domini just let Anton retreat to his room whenever he got mad, instead of forcing him to talk. But once again, Cam said nothing. Domini would take the kid\u2019s side, guaranteed.</p><p>Gracie whined. He said, \u201cStay,\u201d sharply, and faced his wife.</p><p>Domini rubbed his biceps. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Every time she touched him with concern or caring or passion, he could almost believe she loved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just not looking forward to trying to break Gracie\u2019s bad behavior again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have to do it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always have before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here now. How about if we help you? After supper, you can show Anton and me how we should correct Gracie if she veers from her training. That way we\u2019ll all know the right way to keep her in line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t like dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit Gracie\u2019s grown on me.\u201d She sent Gracie a fond look, but her face was serious when she looked back at him. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to make this work for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Cam knew Domini wasn\u2019t just talking about the dog.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Week Three...</p> <p>\u201cDomini, it\u2019s Ginger. I have good news! Anton DeMarco has officially been released into the foster care of Deputy Cameron McKay and Domini McKay, by Wyoming Department of Social Services.\u201d</p><p>Domini sagged against the counter. \u201cThat is good news, Ginger, thank you. Now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you adjust to parenting a child full-time. Social Services will check in periodically. That\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean when can I start the paperwork for adopting him?\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s hesitation was apparent even through the phone line.</p><p>A strange feeling of foreboding flowed through Domini. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are a couple of things to do before you take that permanent step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I recommend you hire a private detective to track down Rex\u2019s remaining family.\u201d</p><p>Domini frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovering all our bases from the start is very necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about hiring private detectives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re interested, I can handle it out of my office at my standard rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. Whatever I need to do, I\u2019ll do it. I don\u2019t care how much it costs.\u201d</p> <p>Ginger chuckled. \u201cDarlin\u2019, don\u2019t ever say that to an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Domini smiled. \u201cSo say the detective tracks these relatives down, what happens after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the private detective gives the family official notification of Rex\u2019s death, of financial windfalls of said death, of which I\u2019m going to assume none, and financial responsibilities of said death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would be...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuneral costs. Payment of any outstanding debts. The recipient cannot have the gains without the bearing the losses, understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce that\u2019s done, we see if there\u2019s any interest in adoption from his relatives.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched. \u201cWhat are the odds that will happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlim. However, it is a possibility. You and Cam have a minimum of six months of Anton living with you as a foster kid before you can even think of applying for adoption. And it\u2019ll take the detective at least that long to do the first stage of the legwork on a case like this. Especially if you don\u2019t want to pay through the nose for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we should get started right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Would you like me to get it set up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. And one other thing.\u201d Domini hesitated. \u201cCan you call me with updates? And send your bills to me at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to your home address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ginger was quiet a minute and then she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping Cam out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. He\u2019s already done so much and this isn\u2019t something he needs to think about until we are actually closer to the adoption process, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You are the client and I can set it up however you want, but I strongly recommend you include Cam in every step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s your husband. Because he will be Anton\u2019s adoptive father. Because keeping secrets is never a good thing, Domini.\u201d</p><p>How well Domini knew that. \u201cI appreciate the advice, Ginger. Keep me updated.\u201d</p><p>Week Four...</p><p>Cam dragged ass. Talk about a colossally shitty day. He wanted to tear off his uniform, ditch his prosthesis, stand under a scalding shower, drink an icy cold beer and fuck his wife for an hour.</p><p>In that exact order.</p><p>He opened the door and chaos whacked him in the face.</p><p>His house\u2014his haven\u2014was utterly trashed. Blankets and sheets were draped across every surface. Hell, he couldn\u2019t even see his furniture. The stereo blasted some classical crap with a billion weeping violins. Neither Domini nor Anton were in sight. His blood boiled when he noticed the small bronze statue his brother Carter had sculpted tipped on its side on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDomini?\u201d he shouted over the music, picking up the statue.</p><p>Her head popped up from beneath a yellow sheet. \u201cHey! Hang on.\u201d She disappeared beneath the blankets. The music stopped. She reappeared holding the stereo remote. \u201cHow come you\u2019re home so late?\u201d</p><p>Cam clenched his teeth at her accusation. \u201cI was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Anton and I were just playing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigs in a blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s food, not a game...\u201d Domini frowned. \u201cNot nice, Cam.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not feeling very nice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve had a shit day, and I just want to get out of these clothes and have some peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong place for that.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d meant it to be funny, but it struck a sour chord in him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I saved a plate for you in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cHow am I supposed to get to the kitchen? I can\u2019t even get across the damn living room.\u201d Of my own damn house, he silently tacked on. Be just his luck if he tried to ford his way through the maze only to land in a big heap on the floor. Perfect capper to his awesome day.</p><p>Domini kept her tone cool. \u201cAnton? Playtime is over. We need to get this stuff picked up. Now.\u201d</p><p>Due to static from the blankets, Anton\u2019s hair stuck up every which way. \u201cAw, do we have to? It took forever to set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetling. We should\u2019ve asked Cam first before we created such a mess in his house.\u201d</p><p>His house. That barb crossed the room, sharp as an arrow, and hit him dead center. \u201cFor Christsake, Domini, that\u2019s not fair and you know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>She scalded him with an \u201cOh really?\u201d look and vanished beneath the blankets.</p><p>Fucking fantastic.</p><p>He exited through the front door, grumbling as he trekked to the backside of the house and scaled the rear deck steps. He paused at the sliding glass door to rub the section of skin where the sock was chafing his stump. He couldn\u2019t wait to get the goddamn thing off. He snagged two beers from the fridge, ignoring the piles of dishes stacked everywhere and headed down the hallway, which was blessedly free of blankets. And dishes. And people.</p><p>Cam shucked his clothes, removed his leg and used his crutches to propel himself to the bathroom. He froze in the doorway.</p><p>Whoa. Looked like a Revlon factory exploded in here. Lotion, powders and creams were strewn across the countertop. Did Domini really need all that crap? And would it have killed her to put it away when she was done with it? Especially when it seemed she stashed his shaving stuff in a completely new drawer every damn time he turned around?</p><p>He ground his teeth. He was not a neat freak, not any more than any other guy who\u2019d spent a dozen years in the army. But he hated shit piled everywhere. He\u2019d learned the hard way not to leave wet towels, empty soda bottles and magazines scattered around after he\u2019d tripped and fallen on his ass a few times.</p><p>A shower didn\u2019t calm him.</p><p>He slipped on a pair of frayed sweat pant shorts and cast a look of loathing at his prosthesis. No way was he putting it back on tonight. No fucking way.</p><p>Now what? He was in a pissy mood. He wanted to be alone. The living room wasn\u2019t an option, neither was the kitchen. With no other recourse, he flopped on the bed.</p><p>Cam reached for his beer on the nightstand. His knuckle clipped the edge of the fan attached to the headboard, nearly knocking it off. That\u2019d be great, if he\u2019d have to crawl underneath the bed on one goddamn knee to plug in Domini\u2019s pacifier.</p><p>Okay, maybe it was mean to call it that, but Domini couldn\u2019t sleep without the damn thing on. The white noise from an oscillating fan calmed her. Which wouldn\u2019t have bothered him, except she had to have the air blowing directly on her. Which meant it blew on him. All night. He\u2019d woken up freezing on more than one occasion.</p><p>When he\u2019d tried to joke, \u201cLuke. I am your father,\u201d into the fan in his best Darth Vader imitation, Domini hadn\u2019t laughed. Maybe their senses of humor didn\u2019t mesh.</p><p>Maybe nothing about this situation meshed.</p><p>Cam expected adjustments. He expected changes. He thought he\u2019d done fairly well, considering the double whammy of a taking on a wife and a young kid all at once.</p><p>Honestly, his relationship with Domini wasn\u2019t causing friction. When they were locked in their bedroom, locked body to body, everything was perfect.</p><p>But that\u2019s not realistic. Your lives can\u2019t revolve around the few hours you spend in bed.</p><p>Yeah? Her life shouldn\u2019t revolve around Anton, either.</p><p>Talk about a stalemate.</p><p>He finished the first beer. Maybe he should\u2019ve crashed in Anton\u2019s room. At least he could\u2019ve watched TV. That was just another thing he and Domini disagreed on. Cam didn\u2019t think the kid needed a damn TV in his room. Domini claimed Anton needed his own space, his own things, and not a bunch more drastic changes in his life right away.</p><p>So Cam had given in. Sucked up his resentment. How did people do this parenting shit without going bonkers?</p><p>Most parents started out with a baby, not a surly seven-year-old. Maybe things would be different when he and Domini started having kids of their own. Right. If she stuck around that long. She\u2019d already been making contingency plans to adopt Anton on her own and that sucked ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just by happenstance, Cam discovered Domini had hired Ginger to start Anton\u2019s preliminary adoption process paperwork. He\u2019d been waiting in her office and noticed the bill on Domini\u2019s desk. He hadn\u2019t brought it up with her because he hadn\u2019t known what to say. And part of him wanted Domini to explain, of her own volition, not because he forced the issue. Might be a long damn wait.</p><p>Cam sighed and closed his eyes. Allowing himself to drift off. Just for a minute.</p><p>The sound of approaching helicopters echoed in the distance. Extraction was here. His two young charges, still green as far as live fire ops went, popped up out of their hiding places. He motioned for them to stay put. But the lead guy misread the hand signal and started across the open field. Keeping low, like he\u2019d been trained, yet Cam was horrified. The kid wasn\u2019t supposed to cross an open field. Ever. Too much shit could go wrong.</p> <p>Frantically, he made the \u201cstay\u201d signal again. Which the rear guy also misread and he followed his buddy through the exposed field.</p><p>Cam wanted to shout and drag those dumb little fuckers out of danger by their ears. But he could only watch helplessly, concealed in his own hiding place, sweating pure fear, praying they got lucky and cleared the field without incident.</p><p>The landmine shook the ground and took out the first guy. The second guy ran pell-mell through the smoke and dust, screeching for his partner and setting off another landmine.</p><p>The words, your fault, it was all your fault, screaming in his head.</p><p>Wait. The screaming sound was outside his head too.</p> <p>He looked to the sky as the whistling noise of a surface to air missile hit the helicopter. The explosion distorted reality, creating a ball of orange fire that knocked Cam flat on his ass. Parts rained down on him like metal raindrops. But when he saw the broken helicopter blade flipping end over end toward him like a deadly boomerang, he broke his silence and screamed.</p><p>And kept screaming.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>He jackknifed, not knowing where he was. He attempted to roll away and run from danger.</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Hands slapped his cheeks. Legs pinned him down. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in the near darkness until the face belonging to the voice swam into view.</p> <p>Domini.</p><p>\u201cDomini? What are you doing in...\u201d Shit. He wasn\u2019t in Afghanistan. The force of the old nightmare hit him anew and the shakes started. Sickness roiled in his belly. \u201cOh fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Lay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. I\u2019m here.\u201d Domini cupped his face in her hands. \u201cLook at me. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Cam. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I promise. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>She turned him on his side and covered him with the quilt after pressing her body tightly to his. Domini settled her right palm on his chest directly over his heart. She placed her left arm behind his head on the pillow and tenderly stroked his clammy forehead with her cool fingers. She murmured in his ear. He couldn\u2019t tell if her words were Ukrainian or English.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Cam closed his eyes and focused on her voice. It soothed him. Her gentle touches, her sporadic sweet kisses, her presence was a healing balm to his soul.</p><p>Domini nuzzled the back of his neck and stayed with him through every second of his meltdown.</p><p>He seemed to regain some semblance of control faster this time than the first night they\u2019d spent together. Might make him a needy bastard...but he just didn\u2019t want her to let go.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t. Domini didn\u2019t ask questions or babble to fill the empty air. Without doubt, if he did decide to spill his guts, she wouldn\u2019t judge him. She accepted him and he felt safe with her. At peace.</p><p>Goddamn. He loved her so fucking much.</p><p>She deserved better than the shitty way he\u2019d treated her when he\u2019d first walked in the door. He rolled to his back and she was still touching him. Still offering him solace. Still acting like she cared. Like she loved him.</p><p>Cam swept her hair behind her ear. His voice was thick with emotion. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m the luckiest goddamn guy in the world to get to come home to you every night. Thank you for staying with me through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d She smiled softly and sweetly stroked his scarred face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was such an ass earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an ass.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll work harder on bein\u2019 less of an ass, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the apology and I forgive you. So, I\u2019ll put the liver and onions I had planned for dinner tomorrow night on hold.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Before he drifted off, he murmured, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Rest, Deputy. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>When Domini reached up and switched on the fan, he didn\u2019t mind a bit.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Week Six...</p><p>Exhausted. Domini was just plain exhausted.</p><p>The fatigue wasn\u2019t from her randy husband keeping her up until the wee hours proving his sexual mastery. No, his big body hadn\u2019t been in bed next to her for the last three weeks.</p><p>Since Cam had started his month long assignment to third shift\u2014ten pm to six am\u2014she wasn\u2019t sleeping well. Add in the upheaval at Dewey\u2019s after firing Bobby and she\u2019d been working eleven-hour shifts. Naturally, none of her days off coincided with Cam\u2019s days off. It drove her crazy to think she\u2019d seen more of Cam before they\u2019d married.</p><p>Cam was equally frustrated at their lack of time together. He suggested she quit working at Dewey\u2019s, even going so far as to hint he earned enough money to support them and her job wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><p>Not necessary? Keeping her job was essential, not only for financial reasons, but her own sanity. She was good at her job. Not all women had the burning desire to stay home, bake muffins, iron clothes and pop out kids.</p><p>Like the last one was even an option.</p><p>She\u2019d pointed out they hadn\u2019t discussed the issues before their hurry-up wedding, so it shouldn\u2019t have shocked him they held different perspectives. Add Anton into the mix and it was turning out to be a very messy soup.</p><p>Anton\u2019s surly behavior had mellowed, but whenever his new reality hit him, he\u2019d become inconsolable. Domini feared she was doing a lousy job mothering Anton, but she couldn\u2019t share her concerns about her lack of parenting skills with Cam. Cam had even less skills than she and it didn\u2019t seem to bother him.</p><p>Granted, the six-month waiting period to start formal adoption was good in that Cam and Anton needed time to establish some kind of relationship\u2014because right now, they had no relationship. What if it didn\u2019t get better? Would she have to choose between Cam and Anton?</p><p>It\u2019d been a rocky start all around.</p><p>She mixed the taco seasoning with the ground beef and layered it over the noodles. After sprinkling the casserole with cheese, she slid it in the oven and set the timer.</p><p>Her arms were elbow deep in dishwater and she was lost in thought when a muscular body pressed against her, the thick forearms braced on either side of the sink.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I like you like this. Confined. You can\u2019t really move without splashing yourself. So I can do this\u2014\u201d Cam rubbed his lips on the back of her head, \u201c\u2014and this\u2014\u201d he nosed aside her hair to flick his tongue across her nape, \u201c\u2014and especially this\u2014\u201d he dragged openmouthed kisses up her neck.</p><p>Goose flesh broke out.</p><p>Cam continued his sensual assault with his heated breath, clever mouth and questing tongue. She closed her eyes, absorbing every sensation, craving this side of her dominant husband.</p><p>\u201cMy wife, my Domini,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI want to fuck you. Just like this. No time for you to think, no time for you to move. I\u2019d drop your pants and drive into you hard.\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cSince you like it fast, I\u2019d go slow. So.\u201d Kiss. \u201cVery.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cVery.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cSlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d let you choose which side of your neck I sink my teeth into. This area makes you squeak,\u201d Cam fastened his mouth to the left dip between her neck and collarbone and sucked.</p><p>Domini did squeak.</p><p>\u201cBut attention on this side elicits a throaty purr that makes my cock hard as steel.\u201d Cam scraped his teeth up the right side of her nape. \u201cMy fingers would stroke that sweet little clit. I\u2019d fist the other hand in your hair so I can angle your neck however I please.\u201d He threaded his fingers through her hair and lightly tugged. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I turning you on? Telling you how I plan on taking what\u2019s mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She needed him. Needed to feel that rush of pleasure only he could give her.</p><p>He growled. His grip increased on her hair. His right hand slid around her hip and stroked between her legs. Then he spread his big hand on her abdomen as he ground his erection into her ass. \u201cRight. Fucking. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I make the rules, you follow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t force me to get rough, Domini.\u201d</p><p>Oh how she\u2019d love that. In private. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to stop.\u201d</p><p>True. Domini spoke firmly through the lust tightening her throat. \u201cPlease. Cam, no. Don\u2019t. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d Fast footsteps smacked behind them.</p><p>She felt Cam\u2019s entire body stiffen as he was shoved hard into her. The sounds of slapping flesh followed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hurt her!\u201d Whack whack whack. \u201cDon\u2019t you touch her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Hang on\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Anton shrieked. His fists connected with the side of Domini\u2019s torso as he pummeled Cam.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Cam backed up.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>Domini spun around.</p><p>Cam tried to deflect Anton\u2019s blows, but Anton was undeterred as he kept hitting him. Face cherry red, fury darkening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini, stay out of this,\u201d Cam snapped.</p><p>Anton resembled the Tasmanian devil, his limbs flailing as he attempted to corner Cam. He was repeating, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen to me, Anton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed and rushed Cam, putting his head down low, aiming for Cam\u2019s groin.</p><p>The wounded animal wail coming from Anton ripped a hole in Domini\u2019s heart. She slapped her hand over her mouth, forgetting about the water and suds covering her hands until liquid dripped down her chin.</p><p>Cam dodged Anton, and held the boy\u2019s hands at his sides. When Anton tried to twist out of the hold, Cam pulled Anton\u2019s wrists behind his back and kept a wide stance in case Anton started kicking.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Cam said coolly.</p><p>Anton\u2019s chest rose and fell as quickly as a trapped bird\u2019s. He was crying in great big, gasping sobs. His hair covered his face.</p> <p>Cam waited a minute and repeated, \u201cAnswer me. You done?\u201d</p><p>Anton nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now I\u2019m going to walk over to the chair and sit down. If I let go of your arms and you run, or try to hit or kick me again, and we\u2019re gonna have a serious problem, understand?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>Domini watched as Cam sat and brought Anton around to face him, not sure if she should get in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that attacking me crap about?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cAnton. Look me in the eye and answer the question.\u201d</p> <p>Defiantly, Anton lifted his head. \u201cYou were hurting her. She said no, I heard her. And you didn\u2019t listen, you just kept doing it! Just like him.\u201d Tears tracked his face.</p><p>\u201cCam wasn\u2019t hurting me, Anton,\u201d Domini said softly.</p><p>Cam shot her a look that clearly said stay out of it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mom said too, but she lied! He always hurt her, always, even when she said he wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>What this poor boy had been through made her want to curl her body around his and protect him from the world. \u201cOh sweetling, it\u2019s not the same...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini. Will you please let me handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d But could Cam handle it? When he\u2019d shown no interest in Anton whatsoever? Good or bad?</p><p>\u201cFirst off, sport, I wasn\u2019t hurting Domini. I\u2019d never hurt her. Ever. We were just kinda goofing around like...you did with Ky a couple weeks back.\u201d</p><p>Anton\u2019s teary eyes were filled with skepticism.</p><p>\u201cSecond, not all men are like your dad. Most men aren\u2019t like your dad. I\u2019m not like your dad. Just because I\u2019m big doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m...well...mean. But I will not put up with any hitting in this house.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s firm, yet gentle tone stunned Domini.</p><p>\u201cSo there will be consequences for your actions of taking after me. We clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of us are gonna take a walk. Wait on the back deck for me.\u201d</p><p>Anton slunk out the sliding glass door without looking at Domini.</p><p>Her gaze connected with Cam\u2019s and she knew he read every question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say a word, understand this, I won\u2019t hurt him. I won\u2019t berate him. But it\u2019s time he learns how things are gonna go around here. It needs to come from me, not you, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d give us some time.\u201d</p><p>Cam left her staring after him. She thought she\u2019d wanted him involved with Anton on a deeper level. Now she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head over to the corral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in trouble, huh,\u201d Anton said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Even Gracie was subdued as they traipsed along. When they reached the fence, Anton blurted, \u201cDidja bring me out here so Domini won\u2019t see you whippin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Cam scowled at the kid. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna whip you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When I said I won\u2019t tolerate hitting in my house, I meant for everyone. Including me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I ain\u2019t gonna pretend to know what you were thinking when you saw me and Domini in the kitchen. It was a private moment between a husband and wife you misunderstood and I\u2019ll leave it that.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cNow you wanna tell me what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on with you?\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>Shit. Cam had no idea how to do this. How did he get the kid to talk? About what? Or did he start right in on the lecture? Just as he was about to give up and detail specific punishment, Anton spoke so softly Cam struggled to hear it.</p><p>\u201cHe used to come into the kitchen when she was cooking and pull her hair. Then he\u2019d take her by the hair into the bathroom or the bedroom. I heard her cry. Even when I put the pillow over my head I still heard her.\u201d</p><p>Cam withheld a wince. He\u2019d had his hand in Domini\u2019s hair, no wonder Anton freaked out, it probably flashed him right back to those bad memories.</p><p>\u201cHe hurt her, my mom.\u201d</p><p>Interesting that Anton never said Dad or Rex, only he or him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew then why didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re the police! You\u2019re supposed to help people.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn if that comment didn\u2019t knock the fight right out of him. \u201cWe tried. And I don\u2019t understand either, because I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t like him hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d Anton kicked a clump of dirt through the bottom of the fence and Gracie whined. \u201cSo why was she happy he was coming around again?\u201d</p><p>Because that\u2019s how the cycle of abuse works. \u201cI don\u2019t know. When he was with her, was he...pulling her hair and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Anton shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHow long had he been coming around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Valentine\u2019s Day when he brought her flowers,\u201d Anton sneered.</p><p>So Nadia had lasted a whole two months after Domini moved out before she hooked up with her ex.</p><p>\u201cMom made me go to my room when he came over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Cam frowned. Why wouldn\u2019t Rex want anything to do with his son?</p><p>Because Rex didn\u2019t need to win Anton over; Rex needed to win Nadia over. And if Rex was ignoring the kid, then in Nadia\u2019s frame of mind, that probably meant Anton was safe. Or if parenting issues with the kid had been a problem before, Rex ignoring Anton would\u2019ve been some sick kind of proof that he\u2019d changed.</p><p>Fucked up. But most domestic abuse cases were.</p><p>\u201cI hate him.\u201d</p><p>His focus snapped back. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate him more now because he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? If she hadn\u2019t been with him on a stupid date, she\u2019d be alive, I know it.\u201d</p><p>Cam understood the logic, he understood the rage. He just didn\u2019t know how to help the kid see the world didn\u2019t work that way. And he sure didn\u2019t tell him that Nadia had been driving.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his fault!\u201d</p><p>He thought Anton was gearing up to let rage fly again, but the boy started crying so hard his narrow shoulders shook. He babbled and snuffled like Cam\u2019d never seen from the surly kid.</p><p>A kid Domini claimed had rarely been surly.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t need a detective\u2019s shield to realize something was up. Something that didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with him and Domini. Something had gone down with his folks. Something big that little Anton had been keeping to himself. Cam put his hand on Anton\u2019s back, unsure what to do, and offered the kid a reassuring pat.</p><p>Which was the signal Anton needed to launch himself at Cam.</p><p>He buried his face in Cam\u2019s stomach, wrapped his thin arms around his waist and sobbed.</p><p>Jesus. Cam\u2019s emotions shifted from fear to resolve back to fear. What if he and Domini didn\u2019t have the skills to help Anton deal with his grief and guilt and abuse issues? Especially when they both had plenty of their own issues to work through?</p><p>The sobs abated. Cam pushed the thick blonde hair from Anton\u2019s damp forehead. \u201cSo, sport, you wanna tell me what really happened?\u201d</p><p>Anton vehemently shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s internal debate lasted barely fifteen seconds. \u201cWhen my mom left me at Domini\u2019s, I was mad at her about him. I wouldn\u2019t kiss her goodbye when I got out of the car. I wouldn\u2019t hug her either. And now I\u2019ll never get the chance to hug her or kiss her again! Or tell her I\u2019m sorry and I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s heart ripped in two. The burden Anton carried was heavy for anyone, but for a confused seven-year-old kid it probably felt like the end of the world. In some ways, it had been the end of his world as he\u2019d known it. No wonder he\u2019d been acting out\u2014he\u2019d been reaching out. \u201cHave you talked to anyone else about what happened? Maybe your teacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not Domini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter if I think you\u2019re bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already think I\u2019m bad. You were mad about Gracie. You don\u2019t talk to me unless I say something to hurt Domini\u2019s feelings and then you get mad at me. You think I\u2019m a pig and you get mad at me when your house is a mess.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Cam\u2019s cheeks burned with pure shame. Why did he think the kid wouldn\u2019t notice or care about his distant behavior? Had Domini noticed?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Cam would be wise to remember the only reason Domini had agreed to marry him...was standing right in front of him sobbing his heart out. If Cam couldn\u2019t come to terms with Anton, he\u2019d lose Domini. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You deserve to lose her. You took advantage of her. She never wanted the marriage or you. She just wanted Anton.</p><p>\u201cSorry I hit you and stuff,\u201d Anton said quietly, interrupting Cam\u2019s derisive thoughts. \u201cI thought it was just like before. With him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Apology accepted, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, sport, maybe I have been ignoring you. It ain\u2019t because I think you\u2019re bad, it\u2019s just...well, I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, my brothers and cousins have kids, but bein\u2019 around them for a couple of hours once a month isn\u2019t like living with them. When I was growing up, my dad was either yelling at me or ignoring me. So maybe I thought ignoring you was better than yelling, but now I can see that isn\u2019t any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your dad yell at you about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMostly about not getting my chores done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really got a fake leg?\u201d</p><p>For once Cam didn\u2019t mind the abrupt subject change. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Cam half-expected him to ask to see it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a kid at my school that gots a fake arm.\u201d Anton squinted at Cam\u2019s leg. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t hide it. Why do you hide yours?\u201d</p> <p>Because I\u2019m embarrassed. \u201cBecause it makes people uncomfortable. And because I\u2019m a cop, everyone is already on edge around me, so it\u2019s easier not to draw attention to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey doesn\u2019t care. He just whips it off in class. He scares the girls because it grosses them out.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it\u2019d probably gross them out long past second grade.</p><p>\u201cOne time, he hit Doug in the butt with it. He got sent to the principal\u2019s office for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said his dad doesn\u2019t whip him anymore \u2019cause he feels sorry for him. When you were bad as a kid, did your dad whip you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I didn\u2019t lose my leg until a couple years ago. Besides, there were a lot of other shitty things he could make us do to get his point across that didn\u2019t involve smacking us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike the same kind of consequences I\u2019m gonna give you for whaling on me today.\u201d</p><p>Anton looked afraid again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on dog doo-doo duty, which means you\u2019re gonna pick up all of Gracie\u2019s dog crap in the backyard and haul it to the hole behind that big tree over there.\u201d Cam pointed to a half-dead elm. \u201cI ain\u2019t talking about it bein\u2019 a one time thing, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Like chores I hafta do all the time?\u201d</p><p>Why did the kid sound so...happy about doing chores? \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids at school talk about having to do chores when they get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of chores around here.\u201d</p><p>Anton smiled sweetly, maybe for the first time since Cam had known him. \u201cI can do chores. Sometimes I help Domini sweep up at Dewey\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be on broom detail then. As for your other consequence, I\u2019m gonna hafta take the TV outta your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d Anton\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. When you come home from school you should be doin\u2019 your homework, or chores, or outside playin\u2019 with Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Gracie barked and they both looked up to see Domini walking toward them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her about what I said about my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. It\u2019ll be our secret. But I think you probably should tell her.\u201d</p><p>Anton nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey guys. You\u2019ve been out here awhile. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, except I\u2019m getting my TV taken away,\u201d Anton said glumly. \u201cAnd I hafta do chores every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fair,\u201d she said cautiously. Domini gazed at Anton with such softness and sweetness Cam was a little jealous. She loved the kid. She was good to him. Good for him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get a head start on chores by clearing a path in your room for when we haul the TV out,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Anton tapped his leg. \u201cGracie. Come.\u201d Boy and dog tore off.</p><p>Domini nestled her face in Cam\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you having to deal with that. Not only him hitting you, but his anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is entirely justified.\u201d He clasped his hands together on her lower back, bringing her closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been that upset, but I\u2019ve always been able to calm him down.\u201d</p><p>Guilt socked him in the gut. Domini shouldn\u2019t have to deal with Anton\u2019s issues alone. \u201cWho calms you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. When you\u2019re not heating me up.\u201d</p><p>Cam kissed the top of her head, working his way to her succulent mouth.</p><p>The unhurried kiss soothed rather than inflamed.</p><p>Domini shivered and he forced his lips from hers. \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly. We should go in. Supper\u2019s done anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Think we can pick up where we left off after he goes to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can stay awake. I\u2019m so tired lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of ideas on how to keep you up,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that supposed to be my line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmarty. Just for that, I think I\u2019ll drag out the nipple clamps tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Cam swatted her on the ass. \u201cFeed me, woman. I\u2019ll need to keep up my strength.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>\u201cPlease no. Come on.\u201d Domini turned the ignition key again.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The next try had the same result of an empty click. The damn car was dead.</p><p>Domini wanted to beat her hands on the steering wheel in pure frustration. She knew nothing about cars. Nothing. At least the stupid thing had broken down in the school parking lot and not in the middle of the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do?\u201d Anton asked.</p><p>\u201cWalk to the diner, I guess. And hope the repair shop can look at it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Cam look at it now? He probably knows a lot about cars.\u201d</p><p>Domini froze. She\u2019d handled every little thing in her life for so long it never crossed her mind to ask someone for help.</p><p>Cam\u2019s not someone. He\u2019s your husband.</p><p>She reached for her cell phone and dialed. She was patched straight through to him.</p><p>\u201cHello, wife. You never call me at work. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that will make you happy. My stupid car died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the school parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang tight. I\u2019ll be there in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d and she heard a dial tone. She looked over at Anton.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Cam arrived, he checked the engine and did mysterious manly stuff beneath the hood. Then he sauntered over to where Domini and Anton waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe starter is shot. The repair shop will have to order the part so it looks like we\u2019re carpooling for the next couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work. I need my own car. I have to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, princess, we don\u2019t have a choice about sharing a ride, unless you stashed another vehicle someplace I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>Domini shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen that settles it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working from five until close tonight. Do you really want to wake Anton up at eleven and drive back into town to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d do it.\u201d Cam\u2019s eyes held a challenge. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you driving my truck tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d trust me with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you with everything, Domini.\u201d Cam touched her cheek. \u201cEvery. Damn. Thing.\u201d</p><p>When Cam uttered such sweet words she wanted to burst out in song.</p><p>Anton sighed. \u201cCan I sit in the truck if you guys are gonna kiss and junk now so I don\u2019t hafta watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have all your stuff out of Domini\u2019s car?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen climb on in, sport, and close your eyes \u2019cause there\u2019s gonna be some serious smooching going on.\u201d</p><p>She smiled when Anton sighed again.</p><p>Cam situated them chest to chest. \u201cI wish we had time for kissing and junk, but I know you have to work. I\u2019m off duty now, so why don\u2019t you drive us home and bring the truck back into town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Nowhere I need to go tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you guys be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. We\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me.\u201d Domini kissed his chin and snatched his keys.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Cam asked Anton.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Anton pushed aside his empty bowl.</p><p>Cam rolled the wax pouch and shoved it inside the Cap\u2019n Crunch box. \u201cThis was a new box and now it\u2019s half empty. Domini is gonna know we had cereal for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could tell her it\u2019s gone because...it spilled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying is never a good choice. We\u2019ll have to come clean if she asks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But only if she asks, right?\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re learning. You rinse the bowls and I\u2019ll take the garbage out.\u201d Cam practically dragged the bag he was so dead on his feet. After dumping the trash, he trudged up the back deck. Maybe Anton wouldn\u2019t mind if they just called it a night right now.</p><p>He snorted. Yeah, nothing seven-year-olds liked better than hitting the hay at six thirty. As Cam tried to think of something entertaining he and Anton could do, he misjudged the next step and fell on his ass with a loud crash, painfully twisting his bum leg in the process. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He hissed against the sudden pain. \u201cFuck fuck fuck! Motherfucking piece of shit!\u201d</p><p>The sliding glass door opened. Footsteps vibrated the wooden deck as Anton raced toward him. \u201cHoly crap. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>No. Fuck no. Cam couldn\u2019t put pressure on his stump even if it hadn\u2019t detached from the prosthesis. \u201cCan you run into my bedroom and get my crutches?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm. Sure. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the nightstand.\u201d</p><p>He ran back inside.</p><p>Less than a minute later Cam heard the clatter of metal and opened his eyes. Anton held out the crutches. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Cam struggled upright. With the aid of the crutches he made it into the house without falling on his ass.</p> <p>Anton stayed behind him. Watchful. Sometimes the kid was so much like Domini he was surprised Anton hadn\u2019t sprung from her womb.</p><p>His stump hadn\u2019t detached, but it\u2019d been wrenched hard enough Cam knew in order to wear the prosthetic at work tomorrow, he couldn\u2019t wear it for the rest of the night.</p><p>So much for hiding in his room. He couldn\u2019t leave Anton unattended.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder and realized he was blocking the doorway. \u201cSorry.\u201d He hopped sideways. \u201cCan you get by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Do you need any more help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he replied briskly.</p><p>Anton\u2019s smile slipped. \u201cOh. So what\u2019re you gonna do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to my room, get changed and take this off. Why? Did you need something?\u201d</p><p>Anton shrugged. \u201cI need help with my homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving you homework in second grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpelling. You just have to read the words and I write \u2019em down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can probably handle that. Get your stuff out and set up at the breakfast bar. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Cam ditched his uniform and slipped on an old army PT shirt and a pair of sweatpants altered into shorts. They hung low enough that the fabric covered his stump completely. He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror. Why was he afraid of the stares and questions of a seven-year-old boy?</p> <p>Talk about ridiculous.</p><p>Still, he was uncomfortable shuffling into the kitchen.</p><p>Anton\u2019s head lifted. He automatically focused on the empty space below Cam\u2019s left thigh. Then when he realized he\u2019d been staring, his cheeks reddened and he quickly turned back to his notebook.</p><p>Cam took the barstool to the left of Anton. He propped his crutches on the support beam that framed the breakfast bar area and leaned across the countertop. \u201cSo? Whatcha got?\u201d</p><p>Paper rattled and Anton slid a sheet in front of him. \u201cRead me those words on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting with imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Anton waited, pencil poised above the wide-ruled lines, car-shaped eraser at the ready.</p><p>\u201cThe first word is: delight.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not the first word. The first word is imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like mixing things up. Keeping you on your toes. Making sure you can spell them out of order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini doesn\u2019t do it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Domini.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long and they were through the list.</p><p>\u201cThe last word is: antidisestablishmentarianism.\u201d</p><p>Anton\u2019s blue eyes bugged out. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s not on the list.\u201d</p><p>Cam grinned. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. When I was in school that was the longest word in the dictionary. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something worse than that these days. I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I could spell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you could too. The last word is resist.\u201d</p><p>Anton smiled when Cam checked his paper and he\u2019d gotten all the words right.</p><p>\u201cYou are a great speller.\u201d</p><p>He blushed and ducked his head.</p><p>Cam knew nothing about Anton\u2019s school activities besides when the bus let him off. That was pretty sad actually.</p><p>So change it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re good at math, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never was worth a crap in math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Anton\u2019s legs swung beneath the barstool.</p><p>Silence filled the air except for the hum of the dishwasher.</p><p>Man. He sucked at this.</p><p>You\u2019re never going to get better if you don\u2019t try. Start simple.</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cYou wanna watch TV with me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>When Anton plopped down on Cam\u2019s left side, close enough their hips touched, Cam didn\u2019t mind the invasion of his space as much as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Week Eight...</p><p>The queasy feeling wouldn\u2019t let up.</p><p>Domini ate crackers, drank soda water, but every time she stood up too fast, she got dizzy.</p><p>\u201cDomini, sweetie, you okay?\u201d Neva asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a little lightheaded. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll pass. I haven\u2019t been getting much sleep.\u201d</p><p>Neva smiled in her sweet, grandmotherly way. \u201cChild, with all that you\u2019ve been through in the last two months...not to mention being a newlywed...I don\u2019t imagine letting you rest is on the top of the deputy\u2019s agenda.\u201d</p><p>How true that was. Cam was insatiable. He was fabulous. And Domini was so crazy in love with her husband it wasn\u2019t funny.</p><p>She patted Domini\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you need anything, you let me know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Neva.\u201d</p><p>Domini noticed a spatula underneath the prep station and bent to pick it up. When she stood, spots danced in front of her eyes, her hearing muffled, and then everything went black.</p><p>A lifetime later she heard, \u201cDomini? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She was cold. Her head hurt. And why couldn\u2019t she open her eyes? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop pissing around with this, Dave, and call the ambulance.\u201d</p><p>That brought Domini out of her stupor. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Gentle hands pushed her shoulders down. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou passed out, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Beatrice snapped. \u201cDammit, you went down like a sack of potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we need to call the ambulance, because something ain\u2019t right with you.\u201d</p><p>Domini opened her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. Cam is on duty and all ambulance calls go through dispatch first. He\u2019d hear it and freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, he is your husband. He should freak out. He should be there when you talk to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s got\u2014\u201d no idea I\u2019ve been keeping something really big from him, \u201c\u2014too much going on today to hold my hand when I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>Bea wouldn\u2019t let up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your deal is, Domini, but you\u2019re not perfectly fine. I\u2019ll agree not to call an ambulance, if you let Neva drive you to the hospital. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Dave and Neva murmured their agreement with Bea\u2019s assessment.</p><p>\u201cNo hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor then. I\u2019ll call Doc Monroe. I know she\u2019ll get you in right away.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Doc Monroe was the last person Domini wanted to see, but it appeared she\u2019d have no choice. \u201cOkay. Call her.\u201d She looked at the concerned faces hovering above her. \u201cBut no one calls Cam, got it? I will talk to him after I\u2019ve seen Doctor Monroe. There\u2019s no reason to make him worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeva. Get your car and bring it around back.\u201d</p><p>Neva disappeared. Bea left to make the call, leaving Domini with Dave. She attempted a smile. \u201cHelp me up?\u201d</p><p>Dave extended a hand and Domini slowly rose to her feet.</p><p>\u201cSee? I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>At the doctor\u2019s office, Domini convinced Neva to return to Dewey\u2019s to help with the lunch rush. But Neva walked her into the clinic, making sure Domini didn\u2019t skip out on her appointment.</p><p>She filled out the medical forms, intentionally leaving some sections blank. Although medical records were supposed to be confidential, in a town the size of Sundance, Domini wasn\u2019t taking chances.</p><p>A young nurse called out, \u201cDomini McKay?\u201d</p><p>Domini followed the nurse back through the maze of exam rooms and ran straight into...Keely. She couldn\u2019t go anywhere in this town without running into a member of Cam\u2019s family.</p><p>Keely\u2019s blue eyes narrowed. \u201cYou look like a ghost. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Monroe and I are working on a project together and I\u2019m wrapping a few things up. Where\u2019s Cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt work. What project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, sis, with the bait and switch, but you didn\u2019t answer my question. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t answer because that\u2019s none of your business,\u201d the nurse retorted. \u201cThis way, Mrs. McKay.\u201d She led her into an exam room in the farthest corner and shut the door in Keely\u2019s face. The nurse gave her a tight smile. \u201cI\u2019ll get rid of her, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The nurse weighed her, took her blood pressure and her temperature. Then she drew a vial of blood. She gestured to the gown on the exam table. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get undressed completely. Put the gown on with the opening in the front. The doctor will be in shortly.\u201d</p><p>Domini perched on the exam table. Before too long her eyes began to droop and she laid back. The last thing she remembered was the crinkly sound of the paper beneath her bare butt as she tried to get comfortable.</p><p>Two sharp raps on the door startled her awake.</p><p>Doctor Monroe strode in and smiled. \u201cI\u2019d ask how you are, but the fact you\u2019re here is pretty much my answer.\u201d She sat on the rolling stool and flipped through the papers on the clipboard. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly I\u2019m here at all. I passed out in the kitchen at Dewey\u2019s, my coworkers panicked and offered me the choice of the emergency room or you, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d The doctor didn\u2019t look up. \u201cYour medical history seems to have quite a few gaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about some of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was orphaned at age eleven and they didn\u2019t have my full medical history. Then my medical records were lost in the immigration paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Understandable.\u201d Doctor Monroe shut the folder. \u201cBut complete and total b.s. So why don\u2019t you tell me the truth if you expect me to help you?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Domini stared at her.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing, strictly off the record, I assure you I\u2019ve never had designs on Cam McKay, which you might\u2019ve mistakenly believed. Cam is a patient. I don\u2019t date my patients. Period.</p> <p>\u201cSecondly, I take my patient\u2019s confidentiality very seriously. No one works for me I don\u2019t trust. Access to medical records is strictly monitored. No one on my staff will blab any part of your medical history to anyone. I guarantee it. So whatever you tell me, will be held in the utmost confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without your consent.\u201d Doctor Monroe stood and pulled out the table extension. \u201cLie back. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>Good thing she already had her blood pressure taken, because right now it was through the roof. Domini closed her eyes and flinched when the doc\u2019s cold hands started poking her abdomen. She knew the exact moment the doctor figured it out.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a uterus?\u201d She poked the area above Domini\u2019s hipbones.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou still have ovaries.\u201d She traced the scar above her pubic bone. \u201cSurgical rather than vaginal removal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease sit up.\u201d</p><p>Domini gathered the edges of her gown together. She heard the doctor return to her chair. Heard the squeak as the chair rolled toward the desk. Heard her flipping through the scant paperwork looking for answers.</p><p>Doctor Monroe\u2019s pale red eyebrows were drawn together. Her teeth were digging into her lower lip. She seemed...agitated. \u201cI don\u2019t have to ask if you\u2019re having problems with your menstrual cycle.\u201d She looked up. Her eyes were compassionate, yet held resolve. \u201cWill you please explain to me why a perfectly healthy thirty-year-old woman has had a hysterectomy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t by choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She might as well tell the whole sordid story. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about all the technical medical terms, but I started having issues with my menstrual cycle when I was fifteen. I had no one to talk to. My caregivers at the orphanage didn\u2019t care, so I suffered through it. Halfway through my sixteenth year, I could feel these...lumps in my abdomen. The pain was excruciating. Whenever I brought it up, I was told it was part of being a woman. Until one day I passed out from the pain. Someone called an ambulance and I ended up in the hospital. I was in and out of a drug-induced haze when the doctors did tests. I remembered thinking maybe my appendix had burst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUterine fibroids. The orphanage director was called in.\u201d Domini fought back the anger. \u201cI was a minor. When the doctors told him the best option was removal of my uterus, he didn\u2019t question it. He just signed the paperwork. I didn\u2019t know any of this until after it happened when I woke up two days later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many other options besides the most extreme one! Especially at your age! Why didn\u2019t they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could I do? The orphanage made the choice for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had something taken from you without your consent. My older patients who\u2019ve gone through a hysterectomy have emotional issues with the physical loss of part of their womanhood. But to deal with that loss at age sixteen when you were just a girl? Just becoming a woman\u2014\u201d Her voice broke, and she looked away.</p><p>Domini watched in shocked silence as Doctor Monroe\u2019s tears dripped on her white slacks. Not the reaction she\u2019d expected.</p><p>What did you expect? She\u2019d call Cam and tell him she could give him the babies you can\u2019t?</p><p>Finally Doctor Monroe composed herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It makes me so angry that there are monsters in the medical field all over the world who can just play God and take away choices...\u201d She inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cI get a little worked up sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they have any idea what might\u2019ve caused the fibroids? It\u2019s fairly uncommon at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of medical abnormalities after Chernobyl. Some immediate, some issues that didn\u2019t show up until years later. Of course, no one will admit that disaster had long term affects on any of the Ukraine people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Who monitors you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gynecological specialist in Denver. I see her once a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But now that I\u2019m aware of your condition, if you have any issues you\u2019re not sure of, I\u2019d be happy to treat you. I\u2019m not a specialist, but I am determined to make rural healthcare top notch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Domini fidgeted with the folds of the gown. \u201cCam doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Monroe frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when we\u2019d just started dating my friend Nadia died and left her son Anton an orphan and I couldn\u2019t let him go into foster care. I\u2019d have a hard time getting custody of Anton as a single woman so Cam suggested I marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was spur of the moment. As a cop Cam has had foster care training. His logic was if I married him, I wouldn\u2019t be a flight risk and Anton wouldn\u2019t have to go into foster care. So I said yes. I\u2019m so selfish.\u201d Domini started crying. \u201cCam is the best man in the world and he deserves so much better than me, especially with his brothers and cousins all having kids. If he stays married to me that\u2019ll never happen, he\u2019ll never have kids of his own and I don\u2019t know how to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Hey. Here.\u201d The doctor handed her a tissue. \u201cTake a deep breath. I can\u2019t tell you what to do, because you already know what you should do. I don\u2019t believe the only reason Cam McKay married you is so you could get custody of Anton. No one is that selfless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other reason?\u201d</p><p>Domini blew her nose. \u201cWell, the sex between us is pretty spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. Look, obviously you\u2019ve dealt with the issues concerning Cam\u2019s handicap. I can\u2019t imagine he wouldn\u2019t be as understanding when you tell him about yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think any less of him because his leg is gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Two raps sounded on the door and the nurse poked her head in. \u201cUmm. There\u2019s a very agitated, very large, uniformed man out here demanding to see his wife. He\u2019s armed and he\u2019s scaring me.\u201d</p><p>Domini\u2019s gaze zipped to the doctor\u2019s. \u201cHow did Cam find out I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I didn\u2019t call him. Send him back.\u201d Doctor Monroe patted Domini\u2019s knee. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s concentrate on\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Cam barreled in. \u201cDomini, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared me half to death.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands. His eyes searched hers frantically. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never too busy for you. Never ever ever too busy for my wife.\u201d Cam glanced at the doctor. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her? Is it serious? Is she gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s anemic for one thing. Which explains the lightheadedness and fainting spells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fainted?\u201d Cam said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cJust once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do you have to faint before you see it as a problem?\u201d Cam turned to the doctor. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNausea. It sounds like she hasn\u2019t been eating right or sleeping much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypertension. Stress can create all sorts of different reactions in the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do I do to make her better? I\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Her tears pooled again. She didn\u2019t deserve this man.</p><p>\u201cFor the anemia I\u2019ll prescribe iron tablets. For the hypertension, bed rest for a couple of days.\u201d The doctor clasped the chart to her chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doctor Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, doc, for seeing her right away. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRemember that when you see the bill. Take care. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>When the door clicked shut, Cam\u2019s mouth was on hers, bestowing the sweetest, gentlest kiss that brought tears to the surface again. \u201cThank God you\u2019re okay. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something happened to you, princess. I\u2019d absolutely lose my fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen. I\u2019m taking you home and you will not do a single goddamned thing but lay in bed for at least two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019. When Dave called me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Domini placed her hand on his chest. \u201cWait. Dave called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I found out?\u201d</p><p>So Keely hadn\u2019t tattled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it does matter. I should\u2019ve found out from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just...wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky thing you won\u2019t have to think for the next two days, because, princess, I\u2019m gonna be stuck to your side like a burr. So get dressed so I can take you home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam made no move to leave the exam room. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait out front? It\u2019ll just take me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. What if you fainted? And hit your head? I am not taking the chance that anything will happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She dressed quickly. Cam paid the doctor\u2019s bill and escorted her\u2014heck he practically carried her\u2014to his truck. The sun burned her eyes. She slipped on her sunglasses.</p> <p>About halfway home, Cam said, \u201cWhen I heard you\u2019d passed out and were nauseous, I thought...maybe you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Domini froze.</p><p>\u201cI know we haven\u2019t been married long, but if it\u2019d turned out you were pregnant, I...well, I wouldn\u2019t have minded. Not at all. I just wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>She faced out the window. She had to tell him the truth.</p><p>And if Cam decides to walk away?</p> <p>She loved him. Now she knew the true meaning of selfishness because she didn\u2019t know if she could let him go.</p><p>Cam tucked Domini in bed, called the station and requested a couple of sick days. He jotted down a grocery list. He paced until it was time to pick up Anton.</p><p>At the school, he rested his butt against the passenger side of his pickup and kept his eyes peeled for the boy. Cam whistled and Anton looked his direction. The kid smiled as he hustled toward him. \u201cHey, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeya, sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were picking me up today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lucky day, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. We doin\u2019 something fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, unless you love grocery shopping.\u201d</p><p>Anton groaned and hefted himself into the cab.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Where\u2019s Domini?\u201d</p><p>Cam turned the corner and waved at Mrs. Jackson walking her toy poodles. \u201cShe\u2019s at home. She ain\u2019t feeling too good.\u201d</p> <p>Anton was quiet. Too quiet. \u201cIs she gonna have a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sent Anton a sideways glance. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have babies after they get married. I thought maybe now she\u2019s got a baby in her tummy.\u201d</p><p>I wish. Maybe then Cam could believe she\u2019d stick around. She hadn\u2019t called him today when she\u2019d gotten ill, but she had called him when she had car trouble? That bugged the crap out of him. Add in the fact she wouldn\u2019t share a bank account with him, she insisted on buying all the groceries and Cam wondered if they had a marriage or a business arrangement.</p><p>It is a business arrangement. She only married you for Anton. Once she gets him she\u2019ll be gone.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t believe that. He half believed Domini loved him. But the last thing she needed right now was the added stress of him demanding to know how she felt about him.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tired and it\u2019s making her sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we hafta do to make her get better?\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled at Anton\u2019s use of \u201cwe\u201d and his offer to take care of the woman who took such good care of both of them. \u201cMake sure she rests and eats right. We\u2019ll be eating a lot of steak. And burgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. Why?\u201d</p><p>He blurted, \u201cBecause you\u2019re a really bad cook.\u201d</p><p>Cam said nothing.</p><p>A hint of fear shone in Anton\u2019s eyes. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you told the truth? Hell no. But you\u2019re right, sport, I\u2019m a shitty cook.\u201d He shot him a look. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not supposed to swear in front of you.\u201d</p><p>The kid actually rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m a bad cook, yet I need to feed my wife...what do you think we oughta do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat at Dewey\u2019s every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could ask Dave to help us. He knows everything about cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>Anton\u2019s face lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019ve gotta stop at Dewey\u2019s and get Domini\u2019s purse anyway, so we\u2019ll see if Dave can give us some pointers.\u201d</p><p>Armed with detailed instructions, Cam and Anton picked up several steaks before they headed home. Domini was sitting on the front deck when he pulled up.</p><p>Gracie barked and waited by the truck for Anton. Damn dog was completely smitten with the boy. And Anton had done a one-eighty when it came to Gracie\u2019s behavior. The dog minded Anton better than him sometimes.</p><p>Cam unloaded the grocery bags. Anton hauled them in the house, leaving Cam alone with Domini. He climbed the steps slowly. \u201cYou wanna explain what you\u2019re doin\u2019 out of bed, Mrs. McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lonely for my boys. Gracie was antsy so I thought I\u2019d sit out in the fresh air.\u201d</p><p>My boys. He leaned down and kissed her. \u201cGetcha ass back in bed, woman. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you go all caveman on me, Deputy. Makes me all tingly.\u201d</p><p>Does that mean you love me?</p><p>Not going there. Not now. \u201cI could toss you over my shoulder and drag you inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you wear a sexy jungle print loin cloth too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a filthy mind, woman. That\u2019s why I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Love you.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Domini\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I plan on doing nasty, raunchy, dirty things to you for hours when you\u2019re better. Now get in bed.\u201d</p><p>After Anton finished chores, which the crazy kid seemed to enjoy, they unwrapped the meat and fired up the barbecue. They read through Dave\u2019s instructions\u2014twice\u2014but it didn\u2019t help.</p><p>By the time they finished \u201ccooking\u201d the steaks were burned beyond recognition. Both he and Anton stared at the charred chunks of meat. Finally Anton said, \u201cWe suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We seriously suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Gracie will even eat it.\u201d</p><p>Gracie whined.</p><p>\u201cCan I make a suggestion?\u201d Domini said from the doorframe.</p><p>Cam wheeled around. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn bed. I know. I\u2019m anemic, not an invalid. You don\u2019t have to wait on me. And I\u2019m thinking it might be best if you don\u2019t try to cook for me either.\u201d</p><p>Cam and Anton exchanged a glum look.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, how about if I cook and you guys do everything else.\u201d She shook her head at the burned disks. \u201cWas that...steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoice cut steak.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cWe definitely cannot afford for you guys to massacre any more meat. Do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...sparsely...\u201d Anton looked up at Domini. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...very little?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at Cam and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She bumped Anton with her shoulder. \u201cEnglish isn\u2019t my native language, remember? It takes a minute for me to translate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you\u2019re thinking in your head, are you thinking in Ukrainian? Or in English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first moved to the U.S. I only thought in Ukrainian. But the longer I\u2019ve been here away from people who speak my language, it\u2019s English that pops into my head first. But there are always words that throw me off. Like sparsely.\u201d She tousled Anton\u2019s hair. \u201cDid your mom speak to you in Bosnian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time for bed, sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Anton jumped off the couch, securing his book under his arm, and lingered in front of Domini. \u201cAre you gonna tuck me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then I\u2019m tucking myself in.\u201d</p><p>Anton opened the front door and Gracie bounced in. Her tail wagged so hard her body swayed as she followed Anton down the hallway to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget that English isn\u2019t your native tongue,\u201d Cam murmured. \u201cWill you teach our kids to speak Ukrainian?\u201d</p><p>Domini let her head fall back on the cushion and closed her eyes. \u201cDo you think Anton will ever talk about Rex? Or will he just avoid the issue if we let him?\u201d</p><p>Kind of like she\u2019d sidestepped his question. Cam decided not to push it. \u201cGive him time. I know we all wanna be one big happy family from the get go, but it\u2019ll take us all time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you adjusting, Cam? Now that you\u2019ve got a kid and a wife? Do you want us to be a big happy family? When all this chaos you never wanted is destroying the serenity of your haven?\u201d</p><p>No, now I\u2019ve got everything I ever wanted.</p><p>Domini wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d mastered the art of deflection. \u201cI\u2019ll double check I shut the grill off while you tuck Anton in.\u201d</p><p>Domini was already in bed when he returned to their bedroom. Cam stripped, unfastened his prosthesis and slid beneath the covers.</p><p>Immediately Domini wrapped herself around him. She kissed his biceps. And his collarbones. Her lips skimmed his throat. \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini. Baby, you\u2019re supposed to take it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo love me nice and easy. And slow. You love to torture me. Take your time with me, Cam.\u201d She sank her teeth into his earlobe. \u201cPlease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Cam was helpless to resist. He didn\u2019t want to resist. He kissed her. Teased her. Showed her with his hands and his mouth and his body how much he loved her.</p><p>When he slid inside her, surrounded by her warmth and softness and strength, he realized she made him a whole man and it didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with his missing leg. It had everything to do with filling his heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go. In fact, I think we oughta stay home. You have been sick.\u201d</p><p>Domini tied the laces on her tennis shoes. \u201cNot sick, Cam. Anemic. I\u2019m feeling much better after being babied by you guys for the last two days. I want to enjoy the gorgeous day. I\u2019m tired of being cooped up inside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are gonna be a million people there,\u201d Cam warned. \u201cAnd my family will grill both of us on our marriage, if we\u2019re gonna start havin\u2019 kids\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her stomach knotted, but she tossed out a breezy, \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t, since we already have a kid.\u201d</p><p>Anton and Gracie burst into the kitchen. \u201cIs it time to go yet?\u201d</p> <p>Domini gave Cam a we-don\u2019t-want-to-disappoint-Anton look.</p><p>Cam sighed. \u201cFine.

You\u2019ve been too careful with me lately.

Definitely.\u201d Cam teased his mouth over hers and her heart jumped.</p><p>\u201cYuck. We\u2019re outta here.\u201d The sliding glass door slammed.</p><p>Domini stepped back. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky if any of the doors in this house survive until his teen years.\u201d</p><p>Cam went still.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Nothin\u2019. I just can\u2019t imagine Anton a teenager.\u201d</p><p>That was weird. Didn\u2019t he expect to be around then?</p><p>Maybe you won\u2019t be once you tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cDo we have everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Cam caught her staring at his pants. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you wear those.\u201d His baggy dark khaki pants appeared to be made out of shiny, lightweight parachute material, with cargo pockets everywhere and elastic bands at the knees and ankles. \u201cAre they new?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHell no, they\u2019re old. I couldn\u2019t face wearing jeans today, sweats are too casual and every other pair of pants is in the hamper, so this is what was left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a chance to do laundry this week. I\u2019m slacking on all sorts of wifely duties.\u201d</p><p>Cam tipped her chin up. \u201cI didn\u2019t marry you so you could wash my clothes, Domini.\u201d</p><p>No, you married me because you\u2019re selfless, perfect and a good man.</p><p>He pecked her on the mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go before I find another reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyin\u2019 you to the bed and keepin\u2019 you there all day is mighty tempting.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Anton was already in the truck bed with Gracie.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hop in the front,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>\u201cAw, do I have to? Everybody rides in the back of pickups with their dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody except for you.\u201d</p><p>Anton turned his puppy dog eyes to Cam.</p><p>Cam shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal. It\u2019s only ten miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the back of a bouncy pickup on a gravel road!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019ll be dusty. He won\u2019t be the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKy rides in the back of Cord\u2019s truck all the time,\u201d Anton added.</p><p>\u201cWe all did. We all turned out fine.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was outnumbered. And when she really thought about it, they\u2019d been siding together a lot in the last week. \u201cAll right. But you stay down. No hanging off the side, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Domini couldn\u2019t help but turn round every couple of minutes to check on Anton.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. He\u2019s happier than a pig in shit,\u201d Cam drawled. He plucked up her hand from the middle seat and kissed her knuckles. \u201cIs the honeymoon over? We\u2019ve only been married two months and you\u2019re not sitting close to me in the truck anymore.\u201d</p><p>She scooted closer. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. I\u2019m always better with you by my side.\u201d</p><p>A sigh of contentment drifted out. She rested her head on Cam\u2019s shoulder. He draped his arm across the back of the seat and lightly stroked the outside of her arm. Sometimes the silences between them were more revealing than words.</p><p>Vehicles crowded the yard at the Carson McKay ranch. Kids and dogs ran everywhere. With all the questions they\u2019d be facing about future kids, she wished she\u2019d talked to Cam before they\u2019d left home.</p><p>Anton beat on the window. \u201cCan I get out now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly shy, Domini kept a death grip on Cam\u2019s hand as they wended through the chairs and tables.</p><p>Carolyn McKay hopped up the instant she saw them.</p><p>Because Domini\u2019s schedule and Cam\u2019s schedules hadn\u2019t meshed, they\u2019d missed out on all the McKay family dinners in the last two months, so this was Domini\u2019s first official family function as Cam\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cCam! Sweetie, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ma.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him for a long time. Then she hugged Domini. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Domini. I heard you\u2019ve been under the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s anemic, which makes her tired. She\u2019s taking heavy duty iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing!\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset if we leave early. I have to take her home and get her back in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a true McKay man,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>Domini blushed.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll stick around for a little while,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cI hardly get to see you. I\u2019ve thought about doin\u2019 something wild to get myself arrested by you, just so we\u2019d have time to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat plan, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome to stop by our house anytime,\u201d Domini offered.</p><p>Carolyn gave her a puzzled look, almost as if she didn\u2019t believe Domini\u2019s invitation. Not that Domini blamed her. Cam wasn\u2019t known for his hospitality and Carolyn probably assumed Domini was the same way, especially since she and Cam had little to do with his parents since they\u2019d gotten married.</p><p>A herd of boys, ranging in age from eight to three, barreled up. Domini was happy to see Anton in the thick of things.</p><p>\u201cGrama, can we please have some cookies? We\u2019re starvin\u2019,\u201d Ky pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t have poor starving kids runnin\u2019 around. What would the neighbors think? I left the cookie jar on the back porch.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cThanks!\u201d broke out. Boots thumped, dust kicked up and dogs barked as the group tore off.</p><p>\u201cCookies? Before lunch?\u201d Cam mock-chided. \u201cYou\u2019re getting soft. You never would\u2019ve let us have cookies that early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandbabies are different. I can sugar them up and send them home with their parents.\u201d Carolyn strolled off when Kimi McKay shouted for her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s make the rounds so we can leave right after lunch,\u201d Cam murmured.</p><p>The first people they approached were India and Skylar. India swayed with a blanketed bundle tucked against her body. A toddler with auburn ringlets was cocked on Skylar\u2019s hip. Colt stood behind India talking to Kade, who also had a toddler clinging to him. Cam released her hand and moved between his brother and cousin.</p><p>India smiled. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if you guys would make it. Anton is off running with the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd girl,\u201d Skylar said dryly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Eliza is so determined to keep up with her boy cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she is a girl, that\u2019s why. I remember it well.\u201d Keely snuck in the group and held her hands out. \u201cShannie, come with Aunt Keely and we\u2019ll go see what the pack is up to.\u201d</p><p>Shannie practically jumped into Keely\u2019s arms.</p><p>Domini wasn\u2019t surprised when India and Skylar\u2019s discussion returned to business. \u201cIt pisses me off she had to go looking for work at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn didn\u2019t invite Casper and Joan, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know she invited Jessie. I don\u2019t know about Tell and Dalton. But if Jessie shows up Brandt will probably be with her. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re helping each other through this.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t have a clue what they were talking about. Should she ask? If she didn\u2019t would they think she didn\u2019t give a damn about Cam\u2019s family?</p><p>Skylar must\u2019ve sensed her curiosity. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know if Cam told you about what happened with Jessie after Luke\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cCasper kicked Jessie out of the trailer she\u2019d shared with Luke and he told her she had no financial claim on any part of the McKay Ranch and she was on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. Jessie had nowhere to live, no job, no place for her horses or her llamas. Poor girl. Her dad is still chasing the rodeo circuit. Her mom has remarried and is living on the Shoshone reservation with her new husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she needs a job I could always use extra help at Dewey\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Skylar squeezed her arm. \u201cYou are such a sweetie, Domini, to offer. I needed to hire someone to replace Nadia, so Jessie is working for me at Sky Blue. Brandt tracked down a rental place outside of Moorcroft with a small pasture so she\u2019s kept her animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so awful. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Domini wondered why Cam hadn\u2019t told her. Wouldn\u2019t that be something you\u2019d tell your spouse?</p><p>Like you have any right to judge him on keeping secrets.</p><p>\u201cCam keeps to himself and generally stays out of family\u2014I mean ranch\u2014business. Anyway, Casper\u2019s behavior caused another big rift with the McKay families. Even Casper\u2019s sons are pissed off at him. So in addition to losing their brother...\u201d</p><p>Hudson fussed and Colt was right there. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>India handed the baby over, but followed Colt to the house anyway.</p><p>Skylar sighed. \u201cMy sister is absolutely smitten with her son. She\u2019s as bad as Chassie was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say my name?\u201d Chassie inquired sweetly behind Skylar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Domini and Skylar turned.</p><p>Chassie shifted her roly-poly baby boy from one hip to the next. One chubby hand gripped Chassie\u2019s long braid. \u201cWestin, honey, let go of mama\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>He cooed, blinked enormous hazel eyes and blew a big spit bubble.</p> <p>\u201cBlowing me kisses won\u2019t charm me, buddy boy.\u201d She kissed the top of his blond head and attempted to pry his fingers off her braid.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Domini asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be great if you\u2019d distract him.\u201d</p><p>Domini made goofy faces. Poked his round belly until he giggled while Chassie freed her hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She smooched Westin\u2019s plump cheek. \u201cYou should show Domini how good you are at giving kisses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a kiss,\u201d she said, leaning in. She caught a whiff of powdery baby smell as Westin\u2019s cool mouth connected with her cheek, leaving a drooly wet mark. She laughed and looked up to see Cam staring at her.</p><p>The soft, wistful look in his eyes caused her to break eye contact. Caused her stomach to lurch with dread. Caused an immense amount of guilt.</p><p>Skylar said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been into Dewey\u2019s in ages. It\u2019s a nightmare to take three kids to a restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much has changed.\u201d</p><p>Westin wiggled in Chassie\u2019s arms. When she shifted her hold, he arched his back and protested loudly.</p><p>\u201cI am not putting you down, so stop fussing.\u201d Chassie flicked her hair aside as Westin tried to snatch it again. \u201cHe\u2019s already trying to walk. It\u2019s driving me nuts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want them to walk and you don\u2019t realize how easy you had it when they weren\u2019t walking.\u201d Skylar smiled. \u201cWe weren\u2019t anxious for Peyton and Shannie to start walking at all, after dealing with Eliza, the pink tornado.\u201d</p><p>Westin pushed on Chassie\u2019s chest and attempted to either throw himself to the ground, or shinny down her body. When neither option worked, he wailed with full lung power.</p><p>\u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done now with that caterwauling. Daddies are gonna come running.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Trevor and Edgard were both there instantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Trevor said as Westin dove into his arms.</p><p>Edgard rubbed Westin\u2019s back. \u201cHe sounds tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mad because I won\u2019t let him roll in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, Chass, boys get dirty. He just wants to be runnin\u2019 with his cousins.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie rolled her eyes at Edgard.</p><p>The dinner bell clanked.</p><p>\u201cI should track down Anton and make sure he eats something besides cookies,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hands landed on her shoulders. \u201cLet him be. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s havin\u2019 a great time. Plus, I need to make sure you eat.\u201d</p><p>When Domini and Cam were in the food line, she felt guilty seeing Macie, Keely and AJ running around behind the serving tables helping Carolyn.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that guilty look, princess,\u201d Cam murmured. \u201cNext time, when you\u2019re feeling better, I\u2019m sure Ma would appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it amazed her how well Cam read her.</p><p>The kids got in line. Red faced, sweaty, dirty. Carolyn kicked them out of line and sent them to the pump to wash up. Grama ruled the clan with a velvet fist.</p><p>She turned to follow Anton\u2019s blond head in the crowd of dark-headed boys and found herself looking into Carson McKay\u2019s face. Into blue eyes identical to Cam\u2019s. Uncanny, how all Carson\u2019s offspring had his eyes. He gave her a dimpled, charming smile. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have you here, Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Carson cocked his head at Cam, who towered over his dad by a good five inches. \u201cSon, I understand you and Domini just got married, and you\u2019re figurin\u2019 out how to be parents and balance your jobs. But your mother and I sure would like to get to know your new family.\u201d</p><p>Every McKay family member had gone out of their way to make her feel welcome. So Cam\u2019s...standoffish attitude toward his family bothered her and she wanted to let Carson know she appreciated his genuine interest in welcoming her and Anton into the McKay family. \u201cI\u2019d like that, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, darlin\u2019, call me Carson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will definitely find a time to get together soon, Carson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>Cam whispered, \u201cNicely done, wife.\u201d</p><p>Anton didn\u2019t sit with them. Colby and Cord stood back from the kid\u2019s table, keeping an eye on the kids, while they talked and held yet more dark-haired babies.</p><p>This was one fertile family.</p><p>Libby plopped down beside her. \u201cHow is Anton faring with the multitude of McKay males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot. Not all males.\u201d She pointed. \u201cLook at Eliza.\u201d</p><p>Her face was sweaty and smudged with dirt. Weeds poked out of her pigtails. Grass stained her flowered shirt. And she was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd they thought Keely was hell on wheels. I say look out for her.\u201d</p><p>Domini scanned the picnic tables, but she didn\u2019t see Channing. \u201cWhere\u2019s Channing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying down upstairs.\u201d Libby chuckled. \u201cCan you believe she\u2019s pregnant again? Some of us can\u2019t even have one baby and she\u2019s knocked up every time I turn around.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t press Libby on her some of us can\u2019t even have one baby comment, but she was curious as to why Libby just blithely tossed it out there.</p><p>She can tell a stranger about her fertility issues but you can\u2019t even tell your husband about yours?</p><p>\u201cThis is their fourth in six years. Miles is only six months old.\u201d Libby gave her a droll stare. \u201cFYI: Channing is blaming the cherry bombs for her current state. Said she got home, got naked with Colby and neither remembered a condom.\u201d</p><p>Domini couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, I hope they consider naming her Cherry.\u201d</p><p>A beat-up Suburban pulled up. Carter McKay exited the driver\u2019s side. A tall, muscular guy Domini vaguely remembered from Colt and India\u2019s wedding reception sauntered around the front end of the vehicle.</p><p>Talk about gorgeous. Talk about impeccably dressed. He wore tasseled loafers, black dress pants, and a gray cashmere sweater layered over a black mock turtleneck. His dark hair was a little long, but created a sophisticated, bad boy, devil-may-care aura that added to his dazzling looks.</p><p>Carter\u2019s oldest two boys ran up and hugged their dad and then Mr. Overdressed, who grinned and didn\u2019t seem to care if the dirt on their clothes transferred to his.</p><p>Domini glanced at Cam, but Cam\u2019s eyes were narrowed at someone behind her.</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, what the hell is he doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely!\u201d AJ said.</p><p>Domini turned around. Keely had worn that same furious look the night of the bar fight. Not a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Who invited him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d Macie took her youngest son, Spencer, from Keely\u2019s arms as a precaution. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with us for a couple days. What were we supposed to do? Leave him at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to spend the day staring at his perfect face in the mirror. Or combing his perfect hair. Or figuring out how he can be even more of a perfect dickhead. Oh right, that\u2019s not possible for Jack-off, because he\u2019s already the biggest dickhead on the planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely West McKay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Carolyn came up behind Keely, set her hands on her shoulders and whispered furiously in her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not possible. You are dead wrong, Ma, and I\u2019m ticked off you even suggested it.\u201d She wheeled around and hustled into the house.</p><p>Carolyn and AJ exchanged a look. AJ sighed and chased after Keely.</p><p>Oddly enough, Cam said, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d and left the table too.</p><p>Confused, Domini faced Libby. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely used to date Jack\u2019s younger brother. No love lost between them, which is awkward since Jack is Carter\u2019s best friend. Keely and Jack are constantly sniping and one of these days they\u2019re gonna kill each another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Quinn and Libby jumped into a heated discussion with Buck and Kade. When ten minutes passed and Cam hadn\u2019t returned, she dumped her plate. Anton was nowhere to be found. Babies cried. Kids shrieked. Dogs barked. People were everywhere. It was chaotic and loud.</p><p>What would it be like to really be part of this boisterous family? To understand the rivalries and alliances? To build relationships that would last beyond the length of a job? To have roots in not only a place, but with people?</p><p>She\u2019d put down roots in Sundance, more so than in any other place she\u2019d resided, but the temptation to leave existed. She had nothing to keep her here.</p><p>What about Cam? He wants to give you all this.</p><p>He should give it to a woman who can give the same thing back to him\u2014babies, family, that long-term community connection.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it up to Cam to decide that? Aren\u2019t you doing what you hate; taking away someone\u2019s choice?</p><p>It hit her. Her reproductive problem wasn\u2019t the total issue. She\u2019d used it as an excuse. She\u2019d been more than willing to share her body with Cam, but her heart? No.</p><p>Why had she demanded so much brutal honesty from him but she\u2019d not done the same, except for when it came to sex?</p><p>She wandered to the section of the yard between the house and the barn. On edge. Wanting so much to come clean, to have the kind of marriage with Cam she didn\u2019t think existed. To have a real chance with him. Not for Anton\u2019s sake, but for hers.</p><p>\u201cDomini?\u201d</p><p>Speak of the devil. Warmth suffused her body. Not surprising he\u2019d tracked her down when she needed him\u2014the man was inordinately attuned to her. \u201cI was just thinking of you and here you are.\u201d</p><p>He turned her toward him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s grip increased on her shoulders. \u201cAre you sick? Do we need to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We need to talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want to do this here, with your family around but I have to do it before I lose my nerve.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, Cam dragged her around the corner of the house, out of sight. He braced her spine against the trunk of an old oak tree and framed her face in his hands, not saying a word, just watching her with those dark blue eyes.</p> <p>Domini attempted to push him back because he was crowding her, but he didn\u2019t allow it. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been...honest about something. Something big. Something that will probably change everything between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Breathe. Own up to it. Just say it straight out like he would. \u201cYou know that scar on my abdomen?\u201d</p><p>He nodded guardedly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from getting my appendix taken out. It\u2019s from getting my uterus taken out.\u201d Domini detailed the short version of her medical history. She finished by saying; \u201cI know I should\u2019ve told you I can\u2019t have children before you married me. I\u2019m sorry. It was selfish. You deserve better, Cam. You deserve more. You deserve a woman who\u2019s as selfless as you are and I understand if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Talking. Now.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hands dropped. He spun on his heel away from her and retreated to pace like a caged animal.</p><p>Her heart pounded with pure fear. Was he resetting the distance between them with each step?</p><p>Finally, Cam got right in her face. \u201cListen to me very carefully, Domini McKay. I don\u2019t mean to be flip or make light of your medical condition, but guess what? It doesn\u2019t matter to me. Should you have told me sooner? Yes. Would it have made a damn bit of difference when I asked you to marry me? Hell no. I\u2019m taking the fact you\u2019re telling me this now as a good sign that you haven\u2019t dragged me behind the goddamn house to tell me you\u2019re leaving me.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked at him, unable to formulate the words leaving me out loud. Cam thought she wanted to leave him?</p><p>\u201cHavin\u2019 a mini-Cam running around isn\u2019t important to me. You are important to me.\u201d He flattened his palm on her lower belly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t why I love you.\u201d His hand slid up to cover her heart. \u201cThis is.\u201d</p><p>Domini choked out, \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you. Why do you think I married you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the foster care issue with Anton. Because it was the right thing to do, you told me that yourself in Ginger\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a total lie.\u201d</p><p>Her head reeled back as if she\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you what you wanted to hear. You were so...mired in grief about Nadia and worried about Anton\u2019s future you weren\u2019t thinking straight. I seized my chance to get what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>A shiver worked loose at his forceful tone. \u201cMe? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think me offering to marry you was selfless?\u201d His grip increased on her shoulders and he shook her a little. \u201cWrong. I\u2019m a total selfish bastard, Domini. I used the legal system I\u2019m supposed to be upholding to benefit me. Despite the shitty circumstances of Nadia\u2019s death, it made me happy you had no choice but to marry me without delay if you wanted Anton. Even now I wouldn\u2019t change a goddamn thing. How fucked up is that?\u201d</p><p>She forced a hoarse, \u201cWhy?\u201d through her dry throat.</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes searched hers. \u201cBecause I hoped if you were around me every day as my wife you\u2019d fall in love with me, given the chance. Don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m not the one who always does the right thing, princess. You are. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s selfless, taking on a grieving boy and a handicapped man all in one fell swoop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. I fell in love with you so goddamned hard and fast my ass is still sore. The thing is, I fought it from the first time I set eyes on you, which is partially why I tried to just stay friends with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other part was I didn\u2019t think you could handle my sexual needs. Boy was I ever wrong.\u201d He smiled cagily. \u201cThen you told me what you needed in bed and gave me everything I\u2019d dreamed of\u2014and more\u2014in return. The night you called my bluff, refusing to let me hide my body from you, I knew you were meant to be mine.</p><p>\u201cYou fill a part of me that\u2019s been empty since before I lost my damn leg. For the first time in my life I feel like a whole man. Not because you accept my handicap, but because you accept me. All of me.\u201d Cam\u2019s hand shook as his knuckle drifted down the side of her face. \u201cYou own my soul, Domini. You are my heart.\u201d</p><p>Domini studied his handsome, serious face for a long time, mustering her courage, because her next confession would be the hardest one.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. All this time we\u2019ve been together, I demanded something from you that I wasn\u2019t prepared to give in return. I\u2019ve given you my body without hesitation, but not my...\u201d Emotion engulfed her.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, Domini, baby, why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m an idiot. I tried to protect my heart from you, but it\u2019s safe with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, it\u2019s safe with me. I\u2019ll always keep it safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. I think I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>Then his mouth was on hers. Kissing her with sweetness and tenderness so rare for him. Her tears fell with each gentle glide of his lips, with each heartbeat, with each shared breath. When she broke the kiss to whisper, \u201cYou make me feel whole too,\u201d he clutched her like he\u2019d never let her go.</p><p>After he\u2019d squeezed the breath out of her, he laughed. Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d trade you in for a model that wasn\u2019t missing parts?\u201d He swept her hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m missing parts. That hasn\u2019t mattered to you, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you think it\u2019d matter to me? I married you for real, for keeps, forever. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you, not making babies with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just crazy about my wife.\u201d Cam kissed her again. \u201cBesides, if we ever get a handle on how to parent the kid we\u2019ve already got, and if we decide we want more, we can adopt. After what we\u2019ve seen the world over...we both know\u2014you probably better than anyone\u2014that there are kids all over the world who need a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to adopt Anton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know you\u2019re surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken me time to adjust. Maybe you should\u2019ve kept me in the loop as far as what legal steps you were taking alone, with the help of Ginger Paulson, on lining up Anton\u2019s adoption.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I saw her bill on your desk at Dewey\u2019s. Were you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably. I guess I wanted to see if you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m damn stubborn. Once I set my mind to something, I don\u2019t change it. Since you\u2019ve been sick and I\u2019ve been hanging out with Anton I had an epiphany of sorts. I realized I really like the kid. I also understood that for the last two months I tried to get along with Anton for your sake. That\u2019s unfair, not only to you, but to me, and most of all to Anton.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary shit being entrusted with the care of a child, but you\u2019ve bucked up to the challenge so can I. Anton deserves better than my half-assed attempt at being a father figure. He needs a real father and I intend to be one to him if he\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>Domini closed her eyes. She was half afraid if she reopened them she\u2019d find this was all some kind of cruel dream. One of those where everything she\u2019d ever wanted was within her grasp and as soon as she reached for it, it\u2019d vanish into mist and she\u2019d wake up.</p><p>\u201cDomini? Say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo baby, this is as real as it gets.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Everything Domini said, everything that\u2019d come out, gave Cam an unbelievable sense of relief their marriage was real\u2014and finally on the right track. When Domini insisted on helping his mother clean up, he\u2019d been grateful for a few moments alone. Not that it\u2019d last long. Sure enough he heard, \u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at Jack Donohue\u2019s approach. Cam tried not to scowl at the man his sister hated, who was also his brother\u2019s best friend. \u201cHey, Jack. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. I\u2019m looking for...\u201d Jack jammed his hands in his pockets and scowled at his shoes.</p><p>Cam knew who Jack was seeking out, but no way would he point the man in Keely\u2019s direction. But he would let the poor sucker off the hook. \u201cYou looking for Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know where Carter and Thane are. They\u2019re partnering up for the games. Are you joining in?\u201d</p><p>His mother loved games. Which meant she subjected her children to games, even as adults. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Anton sitting by himself on the porch swing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Did Jack\u2019s tone sound a little judgmental?</p><p>\u201cJesus. Do all you McKays practice that fiery death stare from the cradle?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. I\u2019d hate to think that foul-mouthed cowgirl cornered the market on dirty looks in this family.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnyway, I just thought you should know about Anton.\u201d Jack sauntered off.</p><p>Cam headed for the front of the house, discreetly rubbing at the top of his socket. He was sweating like crazy and the damn thing itched today.</p><p>When he saw Anton with Gracie\u2019s head in his lap, the dejected look on the kid\u2019s face released a flood of emotions, none of which he knew how to handle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Figure it out.</p><p>\u201cWhy so glum chum?\u201d Cam asked from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you playing games with the rest of your\u2014\u201d cousins, but Cam amended it to, \u201c\u2014buddies?\u201d</p><p>Anton didn\u2019t look up. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to throw a rope. How to hook something with a rope. How to tie something up with a rope. I don\u2019t know how to do any of that ranch and cowboy stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There was a foot race. I got third. Colt got first and Ky got second.\u201d</p><p>Cam bit back a groan. Colt\u2019s competitive streak would never go away. \u201cThird is damn good.\u201d</p><p>Anton finally looked at him. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What other games does Grama have planned?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome pin chaps on the cowboy for the little kids and a three-legged race.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s stomach did a loop-de-loop. Anything but that. He managed, \u201cDo you want to enter that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Domini\u2019s sick and she can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t even think it. You will fall on your ass and embarrass yourself in front of your entire family.</p><p>But Cam\u2019s mouth opened anyway despite the warning of self-preservation. \u201cWe could partner up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you don\u2019t wanna do it and you\u2019re trying to be nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>The kid\u2019s dead-on assessment of his attitude stung. \u201cWhy would I offer if I didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d</p><p>Anton shrugged. \u201cAll grownups say things they don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>The truth left shame coiling in his gut. Cam had sworn to Anton he was nothing like his father. But he acted just like Rex\u2014he ignored the boy the same as Rex had done.</p><p>Hellfire and damnation. Cam wished he could erase the last two months. But since he couldn\u2019t, the best he could do was to start fresh.</p><p>\u201cLook, I could feed you full of crap, offering excuses on why I\u2019ve kept my distance since you moved in with us. I could make promises about how everything will be ponies and puppies and sparkling rainbows from here on out, but you\u2019re a smart kid. You\u2019ve been burned by those lies before.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll just tell you I\u2019m sorry. I will do better, not try to do better, but I\u2019ll actually be part of your life. Every day, not just at family picnics or when I\u2019ve got no other choice because Domini is working. It\u2019ll take time to prove to you I\u2019m in this for the long haul, but luckily for us, neither of us is going anywhere any time soon.\u201d</p><p>Anton ruffled his fingers through Gracie\u2019s fur.</p><p>\u201cI understand if you don\u2019t wanna partner up with me, bein\u2019s I have a peg leg and all, but I used to whup butt all the time in races when we were kids.\u201d</p> <p>That caught Anton\u2019s attention. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about being in the three-legged race with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019re the ringers, no one expects us to compete so I think we\u2019ve got a shot at winning.\u201d</p><p>Anton smiled. Shyly. \u201cMaybe we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The area in front of the pickups had been cleared. A section of orange rope was used as the starting line. The course curved and ended by the old outhouse. His family members had already paired off and were tying orange ropes around their \u201cthird\u201d leg. Cord with Ky, Colby with Gib, Carter with Thane, Kade with Eliza, Buck with Hayden. Colt and Jack were helping Colby\u2019s second son Braxton, and Carter\u2019s second son Parker, get set up.</p><p>\u201cGot room for us?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>Everyone stopped. All eyes zoomed to him and Anton. Anton half-ducked behind him. Damn. He knew just how the kid felt.</p><p>\u201cOf course we do!\u201d Carolyn said. She walked over with Miles cocked on her hip. \u201cThere\u2019s the rope. Help yourselves.\u201d</p><p>While they readied for the race, the crowd grew. His sisters-in-law, assorted cousins, aunts and uncles stood on the sidelines. But there was only one face he searched for: Domini\u2019s.</p><p>When she smiled, her eyes shone, her face lit up as her gaze flicked back and forth between him and Anton. She gave them both a thumbs-up.</p><p>Once his and Anton\u2019s legs were tied together, they took a couple practice steps. Shit. That hurt. He clamped his teeth together and rode out the pain. He\u2019d done it before. For months. And months. He could do it for five more minutes. He forced a smile. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Hell no. \u201cYep.\u201d He wrapped his arm around Anton\u2019s shoulders; Anton brought his arm around Cam\u2019s waist.</p><p>Keely made a big production of starting the race with a long green scarf. \u201cOn your marks. Get set. Go!\u201d</p><p>Cheers erupted and the race was on.</p><p>Cord and Ky took the early lead. Cam kept his head down and focused exclusively on his footing and the terrain beneath his feet. Heel first, step kept repeating in his head. Heel first, step. Heel first, step.</p><p>Cam and Anton built up a good rhythm. They weren\u2019t winning, and Cam was in pain, but Anton seemed to be getting a huge kick out of it and that\u2019s what mattered.</p><p>Then two things happened simultaneously. Parker and Braxton veered off course, directly into their path. While Cam attempted to avoid mowing over the little boys, he wasn\u2019t watching his footing and the toe of his prosthetic foot caught in a gopher hole.</p><p>Panic and inevitability seized his lungs. If he landed on his nephews, he\u2019d crush their bodies. Ditto if he hit Anton with his full weight. So he took the logical course of action and jerked to his left so he crashed on his hip and prosthetic leg.</p><p>The familiar agonizing pain assaulted him. Too much sweat caused the rubber sleeve covering his stump to loosen and slide down. The vacuum suction popped and gave way. Then his prosthetic was flopping around inside his pant leg. He was completely helpless.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>It seemed dozens of hands touched him at once. Dozens of voices spoke to him. Cam gritted his teeth and kept his eyes closed. He didn\u2019t want to see the looks of pity and concern from his family. He wanted everyone to leave him the fuck alone.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d</p><p>Her soft voice cut through the chatter, but he still flinched at the idea of his wife seeing him lying in a big goddamn pile in the middle of the fucking yard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Look at me. Just me.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her even though her face was only inches away.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hurts like a motherfucking son of a bitch. \u201cBad enough. It detached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She moved back and quickly unzipped the section of his pants that turned them from pants into shorts.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Keely bulled her way in beside Domini and dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring your crutches?\u201d Keely demanded.</p><p>No. He\u2019d forgotten them.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. First we need to get it completely off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>\u201cHas it been coming loose a lot lately? You need to trot your stubborn self to the VA and have it refitted. Bodies change. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got this, Keely, thanks,\u201d Domini said tightly.</p><p>\u201cBut do you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what my husband needs, so I suggest you back off so I can give it to him. Now.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Keely\u2019s hands went up defensively.</p><p>Cam was stunned when Domini took it a step further. She addressed his family. \u201cThanks for your concern. We\u2019d appreciate it if you all gave Cam space right now.\u201d</p><p>Everyone backed off. Including Keely.</p><p>Despite the stitch in his thigh, he shifted toward Anton, sitting cross-legged beside him. Tear tracks streaked his dirty face. Alarmed, Cam said, \u201cAnton? Did you get hurt?\u201d</p><p>Anton shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you crying, sport?\u201d</p><p>He whispered, \u201cBecause I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor making you do the race. You knew this would happen, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cam wanted to toss off something clever, but he hurt too fucking bad to try. He hated the throbbing pain in the aftermath of a fall. Guaranteed his stump would be bruised and it\u2019d be damn painful to walk for the next week.</p><p>\u201cDid you get hurt?\u201d Anton asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He reached over and brushed dirt off Anton\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could send you for my crutches like last time. That was a big help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time I could remember to put them in the truck for you when we go somewhere,\u201d Anton offered.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. I can\u2019t seem to remember shit like that.\u201d He looked up at Domini expecting her to spear him with a dark look because he\u2019d cursed again.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. What did you mean by last time?\u201d Domini repeated. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam fell down on the back deck. I got his crutches and helped him up. Then he showed me his fake leg.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou fell? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Cam exchanged a look with Anton. \u201cBecause it was no big deal and us guys gotta have some secrets. Plus, I was in a lot of pain and cussin\u2019 up a storm. And I know you don\u2019t want me swearing around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So maybe you\u2019d better give us a minute alone, young secret keeper and crutches fetcher,\u201d Domini said to Anton.</p><p>\u201cAw, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna swear that much,\u201d Anton said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m going to swear at him,\u201d Domini replied coolly.</p><p>Cam muttered, \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Anton raced off.</p><p>Smart kid.</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t bat an eye as she removed his stump from the socket. \u201cKeely has a point, Cam. You\u2019ve been having issues with the fit since before we got married.\u201d She peeled the socks off. \u201cYou\u2019re using five socks? Instead of two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damn sleeve is really slippery lately. I need the extras to mop up the sweat but it doesn\u2019t help and it still hurts like a bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou in pain now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been worse.\u201d</p><p>Domini rattled off a Russian phrase.</p><p>Hell, she only swore in Russian when she was really pissed. He attempted to remove his stump from her hands. \u201cLet me do this. I...you know my family ain\u2019t ever seen me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVulnerable?\u201d she supplied. \u201cThe injured war hero Cameron McKay has a chip on his shoulder the size of his missing leg, when it comes to letting his family see his stump.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock.</p> <p>But his wife wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI can see how you\u2019d hate all the love, support and help they\u2019ve offered you. That has to suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini\u2014\u201d</p><p>She got right in his face. \u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to show your stump to the world at large. But these people\u2014\u201d she gestured to the group watching them very closely from afar, \u201c\u2014aren\u2019t the world at large. They care about you. They always have, they always will. What don\u2019t you get about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent Keely away,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Keely. Besides, if I wouldn\u2019t have told her to back off, you would have.\u201d</p><p>True.</p> <p>\u201cYour inability to let your family see, just once, what the damn war did to you physically, makes you emotionally handicapped, and that is way worse than losing your damn leg.\u201d</p><p>A hot wave of shame washed over him.</p><p>What could he say? Domini was exactly right. Yet, no one had dared say it to him before now. Ballsy, this soft-spoken woman he married.</p><p>He turned his head, but instead of facing away, he looked toward the family members who hadn\u2019t gone far after the directive from his suddenly bossy wife.</p><p>In truth, his family never had gone far. They\u2019d rallied around him from the second he\u2019d been back on American soil. Never complained when he\u2019d banned them from the hospital. Understood when he claimed the need for privacy. Had they resigned themselves to the fact he\u2019d never be the man he was?</p><p>You aren\u2019t the man you were and maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.</p><p>Talk about a day for epiphanies.</p><p>Domini touched his face. \u201cYou mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>He kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cYeah, I hate that you\u2019re right. So what do I do? Lay here and let them file over and gawk at me like...\u201d I\u2019ve always feared they would?</p><p>The pack of dogs chasing a squirrel brought Ky running past. He skidded to a stop. Behind Ky were the rest of his nephews. His whole body stiffened as he braced himself for their stares. And questions. And disgust.</p><p>Ky peered at his stump without apology. \u201cSo did it hurt when they chopped it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember, but it hurt afterward.\u201d</p><p>Gib asked, \u201cDidja cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prolly woulda cried too,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>Out of the mouth of babes.</p><p>Thane edged closer to the prosthetic. \u201cIs that a robot leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>His hazel eyes went wide. \u201cLike in Transformers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was like in Transformers, Uncle Cam could turn his leg into an arm,\u201d Ky chided.</p><p>Before Cam answered, Gib said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if he could turn it into a machine gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d totally be cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Or how about some of them knives?\u201d Thane said, adding a slashing motion.</p><p>The boys wandered off, debating the merits on the coolest robotic body parts.</p><p>Cam frowned. That was the extent of it? That was what he\u2019d worried about? Sort of anticlimactic.</p><p>Soft fingertips gently traced the red marks on his stump. Domini said nothing; she just touched him and he felt it clear down to his soul. He mouthed, \u201cI love you,\u201d and she gave him that special serene smile.</p><p>Four shadows fell across him. He looked up as Carter, Colby, Cord, and Colt crouched down.</p><p>A tense minute passed when no one spoke.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the boys. They were...curious,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cNo harm. I can\u2019t say as I blame them. We\u2019da all done the same thing at their ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again, it sucks ass that this happened to you, bro,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Murmured agreements.</p><p>Colby poked the fake leg. \u201cHow in the hell you walk on this every day is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously I didn\u2019t do such a bang up job of walkin\u2019 on it today.\u201d</p><p>Another bout of silence.</p><p>Cord cleared his throat. \u201cI admire the hell outta you for even tryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d Carter added. \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re a captive audience, we ain\u2019t letting you up until we\u2019ve had our say.\u201d</p><p>Fucking awesome.</p><p>\u201cSince you came back you\u2019ve forced us to see things in a new light in this family. So it\u2019s ironic you can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of you,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cDid you think we\u2019d look at you differently just because you\u2019re missing a goddamn leg?\u201d Colby\u2019s eyes bored into him. \u201cDid you honestly fucking believe that we\u2019d somehow see you as...weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. Look at me. I\u2019m sitting in the fucking skunkweed. I can\u2019t get up by myself. That makes me weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that makes you stupid,\u201d Cord fired back.</p><p>\u201cPicking on the cripple, that\u2019s nice, bro.\u201d</p><p>Domini didn\u2019t pipe in to defend him. She stayed silent and watchful.</p><p>Colby\u2019s arms were crossed over his chest. \u201cI think what Cord\u2014and all of us are sayin\u2019\u2014is we\u2019re goddamned glad you ain\u2019t dead. If anyone is weak in this family, it\u2019s us, because we haven\u2019t kicked your sorry ass before this. We just let you be. Well, that bullshit is over, little bro, I guarantee it. You\u2019re part of this family whether you\u2019re ranchin\u2019 with us or not. Whether you like it or not. So get used to it. We\u2019re gonna be in your face and in your life like we should\u2019ve been all along.\u201d</p><p>Cam stared at Colt. Then Cord. Then Colby. Then Carter. His embarrassment at how he\u2019d treated his brothers vanished when he understood how goddamn lucky he was to have them. How he had a chance to make this\u2014another thing that\u2019d gone wrong in his life\u2014right.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have something to say?\u201d Colt prodded.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know what sucks worse than ranching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Carter offered.</p><p>Chuckles broke out.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was worse having to face Brandt and tell him about Luke. Losing his brother...I never want to go through that. Ever. Jesus.\u201d Cam stopped, afraid he\u2019d start bawling. Domini\u2019s steady grip on his hand encouraged him to go on. \u201cI never realized how hard it must\u2019ve been on you guys, especially in the beginning, when you didn\u2019t know if I was alive or dead. Then I get back here and I\u2019m not the same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, none of us are the same guy since you left when you were eighteen,\u201d Cord said. \u201cYou\u2019d know that if you weren\u2019t bein\u2019 such a reclusive asshole.\u201d</p><p>Cam winced. \u201cI deserve that and more. Christ. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had our bad moments, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d Colt flashed him a challenging grin. \u201cSo now that all the touchy-feely crap is over...question is: do you need help up?\u201d</p><p>Say no. Scream no.</p><p>Cam swallowed his pride and his fear. \u201cYeah. Since I forgot my crutches, that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>His brothers carried him to the porch like it was no big deal. He didn\u2019t point out they should\u2019ve carried him to his damn truck so he could go home.</p><p>All of a sudden his brothers took off like their boots were on fire. When a sharp gasp sounded, he knew why: his mother stood behind him.</p><p>\u201cSo, is it worse than you thought?\u201d he asked brusquely, fighting the temptation to cover his limb.</p><p>\u201cNo. The worst part was not knowing what it looked like.\u201d</p><p>Cam tipped his head back. Tears rolled from the corners of his mother\u2019s eyes. Shit. \u201cMa. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me how to react when I see my boy\u2019s blown-off leg for the first time, don\u2019t even try, Cameron West McKay.\u201d</p><p>He bit his tongue, letting her to harangue him because he deserved it.</p><p>\u201cAfter they told us you were gonna live through your injuries, I\u2019ll admit after the immediate feeling of relief, I was pissed off at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaro...\u201d his dad warned.</p><p>She waved him off. \u201cI thought if you would\u2019ve stayed here on the ranch, being a cowboy like your brothers, that this wouldn\u2019t have happened to you.</p><p>\u201cBut then I think of poor Dag. And now Luke...and what their families\u2014what our family is going through and how it\u2019s ripping them apart on so many levels. Stupid accidents happen everywhere. All the time. No one is immune. No one is ever really safe.\u201d A small sob escaped. \u201cI realized I can\u2019t protect you any more now than when you were my sweet baby boy who was determined to run before you could even walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the fact I hate that you\u2019re embarrassed about your stump. I hate you don\u2019t understand how I see that stump\u2014not as not a flaw, but a miracle.\u201d She reached for Cam\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear this, but I\u2019ll say it anyway. When you went missing...\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cThat was the worst week of my life. Or so I thought.\u201d</p><p>Cam frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut in some ways, it\u2019s been harder having you living in Sundance. When you were in the army, you had an excuse for not being here. I could tell myself you would be with us if you could. Now that you live ten miles away and we still don\u2019t see you, I know it\u2019s your choice to stay away. The lie no longer works and that\u2019s what hurts the most.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never meant to hurt any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you are. And I forgive you even when I still want to paddle your butt.\u201d She kissed his forehead. \u201cBut it needed to be said.\u201d</p><p>He owed her more than a perfunctory I\u2019m sorry. He owed his entire family more than that.</p><p>\u201cBeing kicked around by my family when I\u2019ve been down today has been a good thing, believe it or not.\u201d He smiled at Domini. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to being the man I was because some changes are for the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear and I\u2019m happy for you, son. Let us share in your happiness, okay? Let us get to know the different man you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI meant it when I said you\u2019re welcome at our house any time, Carolyn,\u201d Domini said. \u201cYou too, Carson.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn squeezed their joined hands. \u201cThat means a lot. Cameron\u2019s been back in Wyoming for a while but it took you to really bring him home to us. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>His dad just patted his shoulder and then Domini\u2019s. Twice. Then he slipped his arm around his mother\u2019s waist and murmured to her as they walked off by themselves.</p><p>As soon as his folks were gone, the screen door slammed.</p><p>Keely wrapped her arms around Domini from behind, setting her chin on Domini\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRelax, I\u2019m not gonna choke you for ordering me away from my own brother. I deserved it. I just wanted to ask if you\u2019re glad you took my naked advice?\u201d</p><p>Domini blushed when Cam lifted an eyebrow at her. \u201cVery glad. The best advice I ever had.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019ll be honest, Domini, I wasn\u2019t sure if you were...assertive enough to handle my tough-as-nails brother.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes his sister had the tact of an ape. \u201cKeely, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Cam, let her finish,\u201d Domini said, running her hand down his forearm.</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s why you two fit so perfectly.\u201d Keely leaned into Domini. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet and sweet, but that\u2019s deceiving because you have an inner core of pure steel. I always thought Cam would need a woman who is as hardheaded and tenacious as he is. But Cam needs someone like you, a woman who gives him a soft place to land as well as quiet strength. You understand him in ways none of us ever have.\u201d Keely\u2019s eyes filled with tears and Cam felt himself tearing up. \u201cI will always be grateful to you for that. And I am so happy you found each other.\u201d</p><p>Domini murmured in Ukrainian.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you swearing at me after I spilled my guts?\u201d Keely demanded.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I just remembered a Ukrainian proverb: she who weeps with joy for others will find joy in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get married. Being around these McKay males, I have very high standards for a man and no man has ever come close.\u201d</p> <p>Anton and Gracie bounded over.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind having kids though. Just girls.\u201d She smirked. \u201cYou guys gonna join the McKay baby parade soon?\u201d</p><p>Cam said, \u201cNah. We\u2019ve already got a jump on our family.\u201d He ruffled Anton\u2019s hair. \u201cOne kid is plenty, right?\u201d</p><p>Gracie barked in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSince the boys had such a great time today I thought I\u2019d offer to take Anton for an overnight. Ky\u2019s coming. So are Gib and Thane. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>Cam looked at Anton. \u201cYou interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Do you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe we could chill out at home. Pop some popcorn, check out that Transformers movie so I can see why Ky and Thane and Gib were all fired up about me having robot parts.\u201d</p><p>Anton grinned. \u201cThat\u2019d be cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your answer, sis. We\u2019re goin\u2019 home. But if Domini and Anton are okay with it, maybe sometime soon we could have the family over for a barbecue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as long as you\u2019re not cookin\u2019,\u201d Anton said.</p><p>\u201cAmen to that,\u201d Keely said and low fived him.</p><p>Domini helped him to his feet. They inched their way to his truck, Anton on one side, Domini on the other. The pain made him dizzy. Domini held him up, she held him up in so many ways. His wife. His sweet, strong, perfect miracle.</p><p>No man\u2014cowboy or otherwise\u2014had ever had it so good.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One year later...</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Cam yelled over his shoulder. He flipped the burgers and shut the lid on the grill, praying they wouldn\u2019t catch fire the second he turned his back. Although he\u2019d drastically improved his cooking skills, they all preferred Domini\u2019s food to his. But the woman deserved a night off now and then, so he\u2019d bucked up and learned the basics.</p><p>\u201cDad! Seriously, look at this!\u201d Anton shouted.</p><p>Cam felt that catch in his heart and in his gut. His eyes got a little damp whenever Anton called him Dad. He\u2019d get used to it eventually\u2014the word was still new even if Cam\u2019s paternal feelings for the boy weren\u2019t.</p><p>The change from Cam to Dad happened gradually, not in some sappy Hallmark moment. At the school\u2019s fall open house, Anton had introduced them to his new teacher as his mom and dad. Poor overwhelmed Domini had hidden her face against Cam\u2019s chest and cried. Cam managed to man up\u2014barely\u2014he\u2019d been pretty bowled over himself.</p><p>There were times in the last year they\u2019d all struggled to become a real family, not just on paper, but in their hearts and everyday lives. When Anton had taken that last step on his own, Cam knew the struggle had been worth it. They truly were a family now\u2014by choice, not by circumstance.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>He leaned over the deck rail. \u201cOkay, son, I\u2019m watchin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Anton\u2019s black cowboy hat was almost as big as he was. He adjusted the rope, started twirling it above his head, and let fly. It landed in a perfect loop on the practice horns on the sawhorse. Then he quickly cinched the rope tight and let out a whoop. Gracie barked happily at his bootheels.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 good. You\u2019re gonna give Ky a run for his money at the junior rodeo tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Anton beamed...and returned to practicing. The kid was obsessed.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s going to be a total cowboy,\u201d Domini said, behind him.</p><p>\u201cHard not to be one, growin\u2019 up in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Wyoming that\u2019s his influence, silly man, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Cam cocked his head at her. \u201cPrincess, I\u2019ll remind you I\u2019m not a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You might not be wearing chaps, riding a horse, roping steers and showing off all those external cues.\u201d Domini moved into his arms and placed her hand over his chest, over his heart. \u201cBut inside? Where it really counts? You\u2019re all cowboy, Cameron McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDom\u2014\u201d</p><p>She briefly laid a finger over his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve always done the right thing, whether you were a ranch kid, or a soldier, or a cop, or a member of the notorious McKay clan, or now as a husband and a father. That\u2019s who you are, that\u2019s who I fell in love with.\u201d She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him lightly on the lips. \u201cA true cowboy.\u201d</p><p>This woman had quite a bit of cowboy in her too. He curled his hands around her face and rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI love you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>The moment was sweet... And short-lived when Anton sicced Gracie on them.</p><p>Domini laughed and shooed the dog away. \u201cBefore I forget, you\u2019re supposed to call Remy back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe say why? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is on schedule, worrywart, he just wanted to go over a few things about taking care of Gracie before we leave on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Cam glanced at the markers surrounding the new concrete slab, as well as the skeletal walls and ceiling trusses. His cousins were adding on a new section to the house that\u2019d double the size of their current living space.</p><p>Which made sense, since he and Domini were about to double the size of their family. His stomach fluttered when he considered the next step in their lives together. Adoption. Anton would officially become a McKay the same time as his new siblings. It\u2019d all happened so fast. Normally adoption took forever, so they were surprised when everything fell into place in record time. They\u2019d taken it as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we all set for the trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re meeting them Thursday. If all the paperwork is at the orphanage and the embassy, which Ginger assures me it is, then we should have them out of Romania and be back in Wyoming within two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Cam smoothed her hair behind her ear. \u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini, I don\u2019t want to back out. I already think of them as ours. I have since the first time we saw their pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, Anton is looking forward to bein\u2019 a big brother. And it kills Ky that his cousin is getting a brother and a sister all in one shot.\u201d Fourteen-month-old twins. Yeah, he and Domini would be hitting up everyone in his family for parenting advice.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think Anton will do on diaper duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrible. Just like me. But just like everything else we\u2019ve done in this family, we\u2019ll learn together.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
