She didn\u2019t move, not an inch, too afraid to even breathe as she knelt in the middle of the old, rickety wooden dock.</p><p>It was her grandfather\u2019s dock. Her grandfather\u2019s fishing cabin. Her haven.</p><p>She should have been safe there. Instead, it seemed she was about to die there.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you leave me, Claire?\u201d Ethan Harrison asked her as he held that gun to her head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to the right. His bright, red sports car gleamed in the nearby parking lot, sticking out like a sore thumb.</p><p>Please, please, someone notice that car. You have to see it. But there just weren\u2019t any people out then. No one was there to help her. If someone would just pull into the lot. If someone would just come\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you, Claire,\u201d Ethan whispered, his voice actually sounding sad as he stared down at her with his soulful green gaze. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Claire was sixteen, but she still knew that love didn\u2019t involve a gun. It also didn\u2019t involve hitting, punching, hurting. Her parents had wanted her away from Ethan. She\u2019d wanted away from him.</p> <p>But in Alabama, escaping from a Harrison wasn\u2019t exactly easy. The cops hadn\u2019t believed her story about Ethan\u2019s attacks. His daddy was a state senator. Ethan was old money. Power.</p><p>And she...she was the girl kneeling on the dock, with a gun to her head.</p><p>My family believed me. She\u2019d been trying to get her parents on the phone just moments before Ethan had surprised her. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to find her. Only her parents, her sister, and her grandfather knew she was at the little cabin on the water.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d Not a whisper this time, but a bellow.</p><p>Claire flinched. Her hands were twisted behind her, her fingers fisted, and her nails sank deep into her own palms. \u201cI-it was over, Ethan. You said you-you didn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d</p><p>The sunlight glinted off his blond hair. \u201cI will always want you, Claire.\u201d Ethan never eased his grip on the gun. \u201cYou\u2019re my one and only.\u201d</p> <p>My one and only.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have run. Never run again, understand? Because I can find you anywhere, Claire.\u201d</p><p>A tear leaked down her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She was begging. She knew it. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Please.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Once, that wide grin had made her heart melt in her chest. Now it just made her body ice with fear.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you beg me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She knew he did.</p><p>She also knew that he liked to hurt her.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the way love is supposed to be.</p> <p>She\u2019d seen her parents together. Her dad loved her mother so much. He would never hurt her mom. But Ethan wasn\u2019t like Claire\u2019s father.</p><p>Claire still had the bruises from Ethan\u2019s last attack on her skin.</p><p>Ethan exhaled slowly. \u201cBegging won\u2019t work this time. You shouldn\u2019t have left. You knew that you belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>No, I don\u2019t. Claire shook her head.</p><p>His handsome face twisted with fury. \u201cYou\u2019re mine!\u201d</p><p>And he pulled the trigger.</p><p>Claire screamed. The frantic cry burst from her throat as her eyes instinctively squeezed shut. She knew that she was dead. She\u2019d never see her parents again. Never see her sister, Sara. She\u2019d never do anything but\u2014</p><p>He was laughing at her.</p><p>I\u2019m still alive.</p><p>Her eyes opened. More tears coursed down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, Claire, I forgot to mention...I already used the bullets that were in this gun.\u201d</p><p>The chill on her skin got worse. So much worse.</p><p>He glanced toward the phone that had fallen from her fingers when he\u2019d surprised her before. The phone sat on the edge of the dock. \u201cYou were trying to call your parents, right? Sorry, sweetheart, but they\u2019ll never be answering you again.\u201d</p><p>I already used the bullets that were in this gun.</p><p>He pulled the gun away from her head. Numb, she could only kneel there and gaze helplessly up at him.</p><p>Ethan tucked the gun into the back of his jeans. Then his head tilted to the right as he studied her. His hair fell loosely over his forehead. The good-looking college boy. The heart breaker. \u201cYou have a choice,\u201d he told her flatly as that good-looking veneer twisted with rage. \u201cYou can be mine, or you can be dead. Because I swear...you will never leave me for another.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been leaving him for another boy. She\u2019d been afraid of him, and she\u2019d fled. For her own survival. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t say any more. His hands were at her throat. Squeezing so tightly. \u201cMine or dead, Claire. Mine. Or. Dead.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers flew up. Her nails clawed at his skin.</p><p>He jerked her, twisting her body, and hauling her down the dock with his fierce grip on her throat.</p><p>He was going to take her away. This was the end for her. No matter how hard she fought, Claire couldn\u2019t break free. Her throat hurt so much\u2014</p><p>A gunshot rang out. The bullet sank into Ethan\u2019s thigh, just a few inches away from Claire\u2019s face. Blood sprayed onto her.</p><p>Ethan screamed and he let her go.</p><p>Claire jumped to her feet. She ran for the end of the dock even as Ethan bellowed her name. She didn\u2019t stop. Faster, faster.</p><p>Then she saw them. Men in uniform who were coming from the woods near the small parking lot. Their badges gleamed. They had their weapons out.</p><p>\u201cKeep my boy alive!\u201d That shout, it was familiar. Her gaze whipped to the left, and she saw Senator Colby Harrison standing behind a uniformed officer\u2014that officer had a rifle in his hands.</p><p>\u201cClaire, it\u2019s okay now.\u201d The sheriff came toward her. Jim Brady\u2019s face was lined with concern. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Jim hadn\u2019t believed her when she\u2019d tried to press charges against Ethan. But...but the deputies were all there. They all had to believe her now.</p><p>I already used the bullets...</p><p>Claire grabbed Sheriff Brady\u2019s shirt-front, clenching it beneath her fists. \u201cMy...my parents...\u201d</p><p>Other deputies rushed past her. They raced toward the dock. Toward a still-screaming Ethan.</p><p>Sorrow flashed on Sheriff Brady\u2019s face. \u201cClaire, I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>No, no. Her body started shaking. \u201cI-I need to call my mom.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Brady shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI have to call my mom!\u201d Now she was screaming.</p><p>Sheriff Brady wrapped his arms around her. \u201cThey\u2019re gone, Claire. He...he got to them first.\u201d</p><p>And at that moment, Claire broke.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>Claire Kramer stared up at the tall, imposing lines of York Towers. The building seemed to touch the sky, and windows\u2014far too many to count\u2014gleamed as they reflected the bright sunlight back on her. The Towers were located in the heart of New York, and the streets were packed with people.</p><p>So many people. Their bodies brushed against her as they passed her on the sidewalk.</p><p>Claire took a deep breath. That breath was supposed to fortify her. She\u2019d come this far. She had to go inside the building. It wasn\u2019t like she had much of a choice at this point.</p><p>Her savings were gone. Her apartment\u2014um, she didn\u2019t have one. She had nothing but a hotel stay that would last for two more nights.</p><p>She was desperate, and desperate times sure called for desperate measures.</p><p>After one more glance up at York Towers, Claire straightened her shoulders. She smoothed down her jacket for what had to be the tenth time. Fall had hit the city, and the brisk air chilled her skin. Or maybe that chill just came from the fear she felt. What if he doesn\u2019t help me?</p><p>Going to York Towers...it was her last option.</p><p>So do this. With her chin up, Claire approached the entrance to the hotel.</p><p>The rich and famous usually stayed in places like this one. Claire wasn\u2019t rich, and she sure wasn\u2019t famous.</p><p>Just infamous back home.</p><p>But New York was a long, long way from Fairview, Alabama. No one knew her in this city. No one but Noah York. The man who was York Towers. Young, dynamic, mysterious...Noah York was a powerhouse in this city and around the world. He had dozens of luxury hotels and getaways.</p><p>He was also the sexiest man Claire had ever met. That sexiness made him dangerous. The last time Claire had fallen for a good-looking, rich boy, she\u2019d lost everything.</p><p>This time, I have nothing to lose.</p><p>A doorman hurried to open the door for her. He tipped his hat, a friendly smile on his face. Claire found herself nervously smiling back. She\u2019d worked in plenty of other hotels during the last few years. It wasn\u2019t as if she was totally out of her element.</p><p>She\u2019d seen gleaming marble floors before. She\u2019d seen other lobbies filled with complimentary welcome champagne and roses.</p><p>It was just that...this was Noah\u2019s hotel. And Noah made Claire very nervous.</p><p>She headed toward the concierge desk. The woman there immediately stood to greet her. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked. Her ID listed her name as Janelle.</p><p>Claire cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Noah York. My name\u2019s Claire\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s brown eyes lit with curiosity. \u201cOf course! Mr. York told me that you\u2019d be here for a meeting this morning.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d broken down and called him last night. She and Noah had met a few months ago. They\u2019d both been caught in a terrible nightmare in Chicago. She\u2019d been stabbed. He\u2019d been shot.</p><p>They\u2019d both survived.</p><p>Sometimes, Claire felt like that survival had linked them. Or maybe it was just the odd, instinctive awareness that she\u2019d felt for Noah since the first moment that they\u2019d met. When he was close, Claire was hyper-aware of the man.</p><p>An elevator dinged behind her. She heard the doors slide open.</p><p>And goosebumps rose on Claire\u2019s arms.</p><p>Instinctive awareness. Almost like prey, sensing danger.</p><p>Claire glanced over her shoulder. Sure enough, Noah strode from the elevator. His golden eyes were locked on her. Such unusual eyes\u2014they reminded her of a lion\u2019s. Noah was certainly a top notch predator, both in the boardroom and, judging by the gossip columns, in his personal life.</p><p>As she turned to fully face him, Noah smiled, a flash of his perfect, white teeth, and his steps quickened as he approached her. \u201cClaire, you\u2019re late,\u201d he chided as he closed in.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI...it\u2019s only nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes after nine.\u201d He raised one dark brow. \u201cAnd here I thought you\u2019d be more punctual.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. What a way to begin a job interview. Claire felt her cheeks sting with embarrassment. How did she go about explaining that she\u2019d actually been outside of the hotel for thirty minutes? She\u2019d just been trying to work up the courage to step inside the place.</p><p>Noah scares me.</p><p>Her gaze drifted over his face. He was too handsome. Handsome men were dangerous. That was rule one in her book.</p><p>Rule two went something like...Never trust handsome men.</p><p>And Claire didn\u2019t trust Noah. The man was too much of a mystery for trust to enter the equation. But then, Claire didn\u2019t actually trust anyone. Not completely.</p><p>Noah\u2019s cheekbones were high, sharp slashes. His nose was straight and strong. His jaw was perfectly square. His lips appeared hard but sensual. His hair was midnight black and his eyes\u2014</p><p>They were like a lion\u2019s. A deep, beautiful gold.</p><p>Those eyes seemed to be looking right into Claire\u2019s soul then.</p><p>Nervously, she pulled at the sleeves of her jacket, making sure they covered her wrists. Then she stopped, catching herself.</p><p>Noah reached for her hand. \u201cCome along, Claire.\u201d He nodded to the concierge. \u201cMorning, Janelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir...\u201d Janelle said, giving a quick nod.</p><p>Then Noah pulled Claire toward the elevator. A private elevator, she noted, because he had to use a keycard to get the control panel to function. Once they were inside, he pressed the button for the top floor.</p><p>She knew that floor would house the main luxury suites.</p><p>The elevator doors closed, and they were sealed inside. The space seemed far too small to her, or maybe Noah was just too big. His broad shoulders stretched the tailored suit that he wore, and the guy had to be at least six foot two, maybe six foot three. A raw power clung to him.</p><p>Claire inched back a bit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to meet his.</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cYou have nothing to fear from me, Claire.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cBesides, from what I remember, you\u2019re pretty strong in your own right.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Again. She couldn\u2019t help it that she had the annoying skin type that flushed way too much. No, she couldn\u2019t help it, but she could hate it. \u201cI was...\u201d Claire cleared her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were then.\u201d When a strange man appeared out of seemingly nowhere and came at her, Claire\u2019s immediate instinct had been to attack. She hadn\u2019t wasted moment on questions. Instead, she\u2019d gone in fighting.</p><p>These days, Claire knew it was better to be safe\u2014</p><p>Than dead.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think,\u201d he murmured as he advanced in that little space, \u201cyou look so...deceptively delicate.\u201d</p><p>Claire was tall, about five foot ten, but she still had to tilt her head back a bit to keep meeting his stare. \u201cAppearances are always deceiving.\u201d She\u2019d learned that lesson at sixteen.</p><p>His mouth hitched into a half-smile. A smile that made her heart race too quickly. He was definitely a handsome bastard, she\u2019d give him that. And the fact that he could make her heart jump so easily\u2014</p><p>That tells me to be careful with him. So careful. The last time she\u2019d fallen for a man with a heart-jumping smile, she\u2019d nearly paid for that mistake with her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou remembered my offer,\u201d Noah murmured.</p><p>How could she forget?</p><p>The last time that she\u2019d seen Noah York, Claire had been at her sister\u2019s funeral. Grief had nearly choked her as she stared down at Sara\u2019s coffin. Noah had been there. Right at Claire\u2019s side. I want to help you. His words whispered through her mind. He\u2019d slipped his card into her hand. I owe you. I owe your sister. If you ever need me, I\u2019m a phone call away.</p> <p>When the funeral had ended, Claire hadn\u2019t stayed around to talk with Noah or any of the others at that gut-wrenching graveside. She\u2019d run away from them all. Claire had gotten good at running.</p><p>But there was nowhere to run now. She needed him. A week ago, she\u2019d lost the job that she\u2019d counted on, and Claire had forced herself to come to Noah. Even though he scared her.</p><p>\u201cMy, what big eyes you have,\u201d he murmured. His smile slowly faded as he searched her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone with eyes quite like yours. That deep blue is really quite incredible.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered, hiding the blue in question. She found herself staring at his throat. At his tie. At anything but\u2014</p><p>His fingers slipped under her chin. Claire jerked at the contact and tried to back away from him.</p> <p>Her elbow rammed into the wall of the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t like to be touched.\u201d The words were sharp. They were also true.</p><p>Normally.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t jerked away from Noah because the press of his fingers brought the usual cold fear.</p><p>She\u2019d backed away because his touch had scorched her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d he told her as his hand dropped back to his side. \u201cBecause I think that I could enjoy touching you.\u201d</p> <p>The elevator had stopped. She just realized that. How long had it been still? \u201cAh, why aren\u2019t the doors opening?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the control panel. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t opened them.\u201d</p><p>So he wanted the two of them to be trapped together in that elevator?</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of small spaces?\u201d Noah asked her suddenly.</p><p>Claire shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cI\u2019m making a list, you see.\u201d</p><p>She was totally lost. \u201cA list?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a code into the control panel. The doors opened seconds later. \u201cI\u2019m finding out what scares you. What you like. What you don\u2019t like.\u201d</p> <p>She hurried from the elevator, but then hesitated on the lush carpet in the hallway. \u201cWhy does any of that matter to you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBecause it does.\u201d</p><p>Talk about an incredibly vague answer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost to my suite.\u201d He headed down the hallway.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t follow. \u201cI\u2019d expected that we\u2019d meet in your office.\u201d Not in his suite. If she hadn\u2019t been so nervous on that elevator, she would have brought up this point sooner.</p><p>Noah glanced over his shoulder at her. \u201cI can get the best privacy in my personal suite.\u201d</p><p>They were having the meeting in his personal suite? The breath that she sucked in felt icy, but Claire soldiered on. Noah opened the suite door for her. She slipped past him, casting a quick glance up at the chandelier that hung in the entrance way. The huge chandelier gleamed, casting light all over the massive foyer of the suite. A suite that is way bigger than the home my family used to have down in Alabama.</p><p>Noah shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cDo you always have business meetings in your suite?\u201d She asked him, not buying the privacy line for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were going to talk just business.\u201d He slid by her. Not touching, but close. He headed into the next room. She did, too, then momentarily lost her breath at the stunning view she discovered. The New York skyline was spread out before her, on perfect display thanks to the floor to ceiling windows that lined the wall. Just to the right of that wall, Claire saw a glass door that led out onto a balcony area. When she\u2019d been staring up at the hotel, she hadn\u2019t even noticed the balcony. She glanced back at Noah. He was watching her.</p><p>Noah motioned toward the windows and said, \u201cI saw you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou stayed across the street for so long. I was wondering when you\u2019d get the courage to come to me.\u201d</p><p>She crossed to the windows. Stared down. They were up so high. \u201cHow could you see me clearly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to you, Claire, I can see plenty.\u201d</p><p>Now she looked back over her shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want a job.\u201d Okay, those words had just blurted out. She\u2019d meant to broach the subject of her employment in a much more elegant way. She was sure that had been her plan. But when she got nervous, elegance tended to vanish from her repertoire.</p><p>Noah crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn. She\u2019d had such high hopes. Keep your pride, Claire. It\u2019s all you have. Her chin notched up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy. Just something temporary. You\u2019ve got dozens of hotels, I\u2019m sure that you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck with my employees.\u201d</p><p>Wait, what? Her jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cAnd I very much want to have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Claire wasn\u2019t sure if she was denying his words or just\u2014\u201cYou didn\u2019t just say that to me.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. Amusement flashed in the depths of his golden eyes. \u201cI assure you, I did. I believe in honesty.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI\u2019m not...\u201d Okay, this was getting way past her control. \u201cI\u2019m not here for sex. I\u2019m here for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel it?\u201d Noah asked as his gaze seemed to heat with emotion. \u201cOr is it just me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs what just you?\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>\u201cI look at you, and my whole body burns. I want you naked. I want you screaming. I want to see pleasure make your eyes flash even brighter.\u201d</p><p>Her breath came faster. Rougher.</p><p>\u201cSo I wondered if that was just me. Is the arousal all on my side? The attraction?\u201d His gaze dipped to her mouth. \u201cOr do you feel it, too?\u201d</p><p>I feel it. But Claire had rules. So many rules. She licked her lips. Saw the gold in his eyes go molten. \u201cI\u2019m not...I\u2019m not interested in having sex with you.\u201d</p><p>His dark brows rose. \u201cAre you very sure about that?\u201d</p><p>No. Yes. Claire hadn\u2019t taken a lover in years.</p><p>Nine years, to be exact.</p><p>Not since she\u2019d learned how dangerous a lover could be. She pulled at the left sleeve of her jacket. \u201cSex won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d Claire cleared her throat. \u201cI need the job. You said that you owed me.\u201d She didn\u2019t actually think that he did owe her. He certainly hadn\u2019t caused her injury in Chicago, but in that desperate moment, she\u2019d try to play on any sense of debt that he might feel. \u201cI-I need the job.\u201d</p><p>He took a slow step toward her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, truly desperate and\u2014</p><p>A flash of anger crossed his face. In the next instant, Noah was right in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that.\u201d</p><p>Do what? Lost, she could only shake her head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to beg me for anything. Remember that.\u201d His hands lifted, then his fingers fisted as if he were trying to resist the urge to touch her. \u201cIf you want a job with me, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Her breath expelled in a relieved burst. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your gratitude.\u201d His eyes still burned. \u201cI want you, and that wanting isn\u2019t just going to stop.\u201d</p><p>She could actually feel the heat from his body. It warmed her when she\u2019d been cold for so long.</p><p>\u201cBut I meant what I said,\u201d Noah continued, his voice deep and rumbling. \u201cI don\u2019t fuck with my employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you won\u2019t be f-fucking with me.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t want you to beg, I think I was pretty clear about that...you should never have to beg for anything. But I will wait and let you ask me to be your lover.\u201d</p><p>That shocked her. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He turned away from her. Paced toward a desk that waited in the corner. \u201cYou graduated at the top of your class at Washington State University. Received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Management, then got your MBA.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d checked her out?</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve barely stayed at any job longer than six months since you got your MBA.\u201d His fingers tapped lightly on the edge of the desk. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my past keeps catching up with me.\u201d And she did not, could not, talk about her past then. She\u2019d lost her last job because her boss found out about her.</p><p>Noah\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cAre you in danger, Claire?\u201d A new note had entered his voice. Rougher. Harder.</p><p>A shiver slid over her. \u201cNo.\u201d Not any longer. At least, she shouldn\u2019t be. She cleared her throat. \u201cI have...a powerful enemy. He likes to punish me, so he tends to make sure I don\u2019t exactly have the best employment prospects.\u201d Please, please, Noah, just accept what I say and don\u2019t ask any other questions.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the manila file on his desk. Understanding hit her hard and had Claire backing up a step. If he\u2019d learned about her college, then... \u201cYou already know.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders tensed as he straightened to fully face her.</p><p>\u201cYou know everything that happened to me, don\u2019t you?\u201d And she hated that. Claire rarely talked about her past. It hurt too much. For Noah to know. For this sexy, strong man to know all her dark secrets\u2014</p><p>The knowledge of her exposure to him just made her feel weak. Too exposed.</p><p>He held her gaze. \u201cI know you\u2019re a survivor, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked quickly because, for some reason, his words had her eyes tearing. Claire would not cry in front of him. She didn\u2019t cry in front of anyone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit how powerful the enemy from your past is,\u201d he continued, voice deep, \u201cbecause I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got just as much...if not more...power.\u201d</p><p>Claire thought he did, too. That was why she\u2019d come to him. If anyone could stand up to the man after her, it would be Noah. \u201cI just want a chance.\u201d</p><p>Noah inclined his head. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll give you a job.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. The relief that hit her then was so dizzying she felt a little light-headed for a minute. The last nine years had been so hard. And with her sister\u2019s death just a few months before...the demons that chased Claire seemed to have just grown stronger.</p><p>\u201cI know I have to start at the bottom,\u201d Claire said, her words coming fast now, \u201cand that\u2019s fine. You just tell me who to report to, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll report to me, Claire. Only me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need an assistant, and you just got the job.\u201d</p><p>That was...wow. \u201cI can do it,\u201d she promised him. \u201cI\u2019ll prove that I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know you can do it.\u201d He tilted his head as he studied her. \u201cBut you should be aware that we\u2019ll have to work very closely together. My hours are crazy, and I\u2019ll expect you to be at my beck and call pretty much twenty-four, seven.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She had no social life, so that was a done deal.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Hamlet, over on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dump, Claire.\u201d The anger was back on his face and in his voice. \u201cA man was shot there last week.\u201d</p><p>And two men had been arrested there last night. But when you were trying to save every bit of money you had, well, you didn\u2019t have the luxury of being choosy about your hotel.</p><p>His jaw locked. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you have a room available here at the Towers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cYou aren\u2019t staying there any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will the other staff members think?\u201d Claire asked as she shifted her feet nervously. \u201cIf I just move in here, even if it\u2019s just for a few days, they\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. Other staff members stay here.\u201d He waved that concern away. \u201cLike I told you, I don\u2019t sleep with my employees. No one will think anything of your sleeping accommodations at the Towers.\u201d</p><p>Right. Claire nodded and sighed in relief. \u201cTh-thank you, Noah. I won\u2019t forget this.\u201d Claire squared her shoulders. She walked toward him. Offered her hand.</p><p>He stared down at her hand for a moment, then his fingers curled around hers. His hand was so big that it seemed to swallow her own. His flesh was golden, warm, and at that touch\u2014a touch she\u2019d instigated\u2014a surge of sensual awareness flooded through her.</p><p>Just from his hand? Such a simple touch...</p><p>\u201cAnd we will get to this part,\u201d he murmured as his fingers tightened around hers. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to choose...if you want to keep working for me or if you want to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>He had Claire Kramer, and he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>Noah York was used to getting what he wanted in life, and for the last few months, he\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>Noah led Claire to the room he\u2019d arranged for her. She probably didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d had that room\u2014a suite also on the same floor with his\u2014cleared out when he\u2019d gotten her call. He and Claire now occupied the only two suites on that floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He needed her close. He\u2019d have her close.</p><p>And, eventually, he would get exactly what he wanted from her.</p><p>He\u2019d watched her that morning as she stood outside, the wind sending her blonde hair flying around her shoulders. He\u2019d been afraid that Claire wasn\u2019t going to walk into his hotel.</p> <p>Come to me, Claire. Come to me.</p><p>Then she had.</p><p>He opened the door to her suite. Heard her soft gasp. Good. That sound better mean she liked the place.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way I can afford this!\u201d Claire turned in a circle as her eyes swept around the suite. \u201cGive me another room. This hotel is huge, just put me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my assistant nearby,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI do business at all hours, just like I told you. This floor is reserved for me and my associates.\u201d A partial lie. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to work for me,\u201d Noah added, \u201cyou really do need to start learning how to follow my orders.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lower lip. That lip was sexy and full, and he\u2019d like to be the one biting it.</p><p>\u201cStaying close is an order,\u201d he told her as his stare swept over her once more.</p><p>In the past, he\u2019d gone more for the dark-haired beauties. But Claire\u2014Claire with her blonde hair and blue eyes\u2014she was different for him. Her heart-shaped face kept catching his gaze. Those high cheeks, that small nose. When the light hit her hair just right, she almost looked like an angel.</p><p>One who\u2019d fallen so very far.</p><p>Claire had lush curves that he couldn\u2019t wait to explore. Rounded hips and tempting breasts that he knew would be perfect for his hands.</p><p>But not yet.</p> <p>Because Claire still feared him. He had to work past that fear.</p><p>He would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your things brought over from the Hamlet,\u201d he told her, aware that his voice had hardened. He couldn\u2019t help it. When he thought of Claire and sex, his response was immediate.</p><p>\u201cI only have one bag there.\u201d Her shoulders lifted in a faint shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to travel light over the years.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d been forced to do so.</p><p>Things were going to change for Claire. Noah believed in protecting what was his.</p><p>Claire, you don\u2019t know it yet, but you will be mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to get the bag, though,\u201d Claire said as she notched up her chin. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of doing that on my own.\u201d She cast one more nervous glance around the suite. \u201cI\u2019ll...um...I\u2019ll go do that now, and I\u2019ll come back and get settled. That way, I can get started working this afternoon.\u201d Her eyelashes\u2014so long\u2014flickered. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you to the Hamlet.\u201d He wasn\u2019t ready to let her out of his sight yet. The last time he\u2019d done that, when he\u2019d thought she might want a little time to grieve privately in Chicago, Claire had vanished.</p><p>It had taken him weeks to track her down. Claire had a talent for disappearing. He wasn\u2019t about to let her use that talent again.</p><p>Instead of arguing with him, Claire surprised him then. She smiled.</p><p>Noah stiffened.</p><p>Claire\u2019s smile was slow, beginning with a faint curve of her lips. The smile spread, showing a dimple in each cheek. He\u2019d never noticed those dimples before.</p><p>Because Claire had never smiled for me before.</p><p>And her eyes lit with her smile. Shined even brighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak. Noah just nodded. Hell, yes, he\u2019d make sure that everything was okay for Claire.</p><p>She\u2019d already suffered enough.</p><p>Claire wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the sight of the Hamlet Hotel. She\u2019d stayed in far worse places in the course of her life.</p><p>Even once, for five terrible months, in a place where her other roommates would scream for hours and hours.</p><p>Claire shoved that memory into the back of her mind. All of the memories from Shady Pines deserved to stay back in the darkness.</p><p>She rose from the car\u2014Noah\u2019s car, a sleek limo that had been waiting outside of York Towers. She cleared her throat and told him, \u201cYou know, this car really doesn\u2019t seem to belong here.\u201d</p><p>Noah had exited a few moments before her. He glanced her way. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here. You should\u2019ve come to me as soon as you arrived in New York.\u201d</p><p>That statement had her frowning. How did he know when she\u2019d arrived in New York?</p><p>He took her elbow. Claire stiffened. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike to be touched,\u201d he finished grimly. \u201cYes, I know, but, Claire, you have to get used to me.\u201d He nodded to his driver. Claire wondered if the hulking guy was also a body guard.</p><p>She knew a few secrets about Noah\u2019s past. Enough to tell her that the man hadn\u2019t always worn fancy suits. He knew how to fight.</p><p>How to kill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting in and out as fast as we can.\u201d He led her into the building. Growled when he found out that she was on the first floor. \u201cOpen access to anyone,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>The room had been cheap, so she\u2019d taken it.</p><p>They hurried past the desk clerk. Turned the corner and\u2014</p><p>Her door was ajar. Room one-oh-four. Claire stopped.</p><p>Noah immediately stilled beside her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head, fighting the surge of fear she\u2019d felt. If she wasn\u2019t careful, Claire found that fear could creep up on her far too often. \u201cI think the maid is in there.\u201d</p><p>He advanced. Claire tried to hurry with him, but Noah pushed her behind him.</p><p>He entered the room first. His body tensed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a damn maid.\u201d</p><p>She peered over his shoulder. Her clothes were tossed around the room. They\u2019d been...slashed? Torn apart? \u201cNo,\u201d Claire whispered. Dammit, those clothes were all she had! Fury had her shoving past Noah.</p><p>He grabbed her and wrapped his arms around her stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t! The bastard could still be in here.\u201d He pushed her back once more. Then he stalked forward. He yanked open the closet. Checked the bathroom.</p><p>Claire stood in the doorway. The room was wrecked. The mirror was shattered. Chunks of glass littered the floor. The overturned mattress slumped against the small nightstand.</p><p>My things...they\u2019re all\u2014</p><p>Her gaze fell on the floor. On the picture frame that had been smashed. Claire rushed forward and grabbed it. Broken glass bit into her fingers.</p><p>Her family stared back up at her. Her mom. Claire had her mom\u2019s blonde hair. Her dad. Claire had his blue eyes. Her parents were both smiling. And Claire\u2014Claire was standing next to her sister, Sara.</p><p>Claire had been fifteen years old then.</p><p>She\u2019d been happy.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up at Noah\u2019s call. Her hold tightened on the frame.</p><p>He stalked toward her. \u201cYou were supposed to stay in the hall.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a cut.\u201d Her voice sounded so hollow. \u201cNothing to-to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Claire, there\u2019s plenty to worry about. Some asshole broke into your room. Destroyed your things. And now you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>A small wound, nothing more. She\u2019d suffered plenty worse. But he took the frame from her and led her into the matchbox-sized bathroom. He put her hand under the rush of water in the sink. \u201cHere,\u201d Noah said, \u201clet\u2019s push up your sleeves...\u201d</p><p>Because she was still so shocked by the savagery in her room, it took Claire a moment too long to react to his words.</p><p>He pushed up her sleeves.</p><p>Claire glanced down. Saw the white scars on each wrist. \u201cNo!\u201d She jerked away from him but Claire knew it was too late. He\u2019d seen those marks. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her voice was stronger now. She whirled to face Noah. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers.</p><p>\u201cI need the frame. The picture.\u201d Her voice was softer now. \u201cNothing else matters.\u201d It couldn\u2019t matter. It was all gone.</p><p>She brushed past him.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell happened here?\u201d At that bellow, Claire looked toward the doorway. The Hamlet\u2019s Hotel manager\u2014a man with thinning hair and small, dark eyes\u2014glared at her. \u201cDid you have a party? We don\u2019t allow\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah was across that room in an instant. He grabbed the manager and shoved him up against the thin wall of the room. \u201cDoes it look like a damn party?\u201d</p><p>The manager\u2019s small eyes got very big.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into her room because the security at your hotel is shit.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice vibrated with fury. \u201cHe got in here, and he wrecked Ms. Kramer\u2019s things. If she\u2019d been here, he could have hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I know you,\u201d the manager gasped out as his eyes widened with recognition. \u201cYou\u2019re Noah York!\u201d</p><p>In this town, most people knew him. Or, knew of Noah.</p><p>\u201cCall the police,\u201d Noah snarled at him. \u201cCall them now. I\u2019m sure they have this place\u2019s address memorized.\u201d He let the guy go. The man stumbled away.</p><p>Noah focused on Claire once more. She held the frame in her hands. He rolled back his shoulders and demanded, \u201cHas this ever happened to you before?\u201d</p><p>Having her place trashed? Unfortunately, it had. Claire nodded.</p><p>His jaw hardened. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened since I lived at home, back in Alabama.\u201d She never let her southern drawl slip out. She\u2019d worked hard to lose her past.</p><p>But the past wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cAt first, people blamed me,\u201d Claire confessed quietly. At first? That was a lie. Claire knew that too many still blamed her for what happened down in Alabama. \u201cThe house was trashed a few times back then.\u201d Goosebumps were on her arms. \u201cThis\u2014this was just a break-in.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be related to her past. \u201cThe thieves must have realized I\u2019d taken my purse, that nothing valuable was left behind, so they trashed the place.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a break-in,\u201d Claire repeated, willing herself to believe those words. \u201cLike you said, the police have this address memorized. Crimes happen here all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you ever coming back here,\u201d he gritted out the words.</p><p>She looked around the room. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to come back. Not anymore.\u201d But it looked as if she\u2019d be starting her new job with just the clothes on her back.</p><p>And with the memory of her past rushing through her mind.</p><p>He watched as the police came. They would find no clues in that dank, little hotel room. Nothing that could be tied back to him.</p><p>He never left clues behind.</p><p>Claire was there. Broken Claire Kramer. She stood in front of the Hamlet, clutching tight to her photo.</p><p>Nothing was left of Claire\u2019s family. They were all bones in the ground. She was alone.</p><p>Except...who is that guy with her?</p><p>Because there was a man near Claire. A man who let his body brush against hers. A man who wrapped his arms around Claire\u2019s shoulders even as the man seemed to bark orders to the cops.</p><p>No, no, no! Claire didn\u2019t get to turn to another. That wasn\u2019t how this worked.</p><p>And Claire...Claire didn\u2019t like to be touched.</p><p>Only that man was touching her.</p><p>That man was also loading Claire into the back of a big, dark limo.</p><p>What in the hell?</p><p>Rage pulsed within him. He\u2019d made sure that Claire was at the end of her rope. He\u2019d pushed and pushed her. She should have been falling apart then.</p><p>Just like she did before.</p><p>No white knight was supposed to ride to Claire\u2019s rescue. That damn well wouldn\u2019t happen. Claire Kramer deserved to be punished for her crimes.</p><p>And no matter what, he would see to it that she was punished. She\u2019d suffer, just as Claire had made others suffer.</p><p>Punishing Claire was his job, and he was very, very good at that job.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The knock at her door woke Claire the next morning. She rolled over, pushing away the memory of blood and death and gunshots, and a quick glance at the bedside clock showed her that it was six a.m.</p><p>Claire had slept in a hotel robe last night. There hadn\u2019t exactly been tons of options for her. So as she rose from the bed, Claire secured the robe once more and hurried toward that demanding knock.</p><p>She glanced through the peep-hole and saw Noah standing on the other side of the door.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Her hand automatically flew up to try and smooth down her hair. She had to look like hell. She had to\u2014</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, Claire.\u201d</p><p>How had he known that she was standing there?</p><p>Claire opened the door. Noah immediately pushed his way inside. \u201cBring in all the clothes. Put them in her closet.\u201d</p><p>Two men hurried in after him. They were both wearing York Towers jackets, with the distinctive YT emblem, and both men were also carrying armfuls of bags.</p><p>The names displayed on those bags told her that the items inside had come with a very hefty price tag.</p><p>\u201cNoah, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>He stood close to her. Not touching, but still making her too aware of the warmth that always clung to him. His gaze was on the frame near her bed. She...liked to keep it close.</p><p>After a moment, while the other men got busy unpacking those bags, Noah turned back to glance at her. \u201cYou look good in the morning.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cNo makeup. Just soft lips. Wide eyes.\u201d His voice was low, carrying only to her ears. \u201cAnd you even have a little sprinkle of freckles across your nose. Your makeup hid that from me before.\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cWho are those men?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFranco and Paul both work in the concierge department here at the hotel. They\u2019ve got plenty of connections in this town, and they used those connections to help me out.\u201d</p><p>Only they weren\u2019t helping Noah. They were helping her. \u201cHow did they know my size?\u201d</p><p>The clothes they were unpacking\u2014unreal.</p> <p>\u201cI knew your size. Don\u2019t forget...\u201d And his voice dropped even more. \u201cI did have the chance to get up close and personal with you in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Up close and personal? She\u2019d been punching him! But he\u2019d been holding her tight. \u201cI thought you were\u2014you were some mugger. I was scared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you attacked.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut when you did, I was able to get a pretty good feel for your body.\u201d</p><p>She suspected the guy was an expert when it came to getting a \u201cfeel\u201d for a woman\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cThe shoes will be here soon,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.

Her panties. Anything sexual.</p><p>She paced away from him and stared at the now full closet. \u201cI can\u2019t pay for this.\u201d She also couldn\u2019t pay for the underwear that she needed. Shame burned through her. She\u2019d tried to stay at those other jobs. Tried to save money, but each time she\u2019d been forced to move and start again, her bank account had depleted more and more.</p> <p>Until nothing was left.</p><p>\u201cConsider it an advance on your salary.\u201d He didn\u2019t even sound a little concerned.</p><p>Probably because he had money to burn. She didn\u2019t. She also had pride. Her hands tightened around the robe\u2019s belt as she glanced at him. \u201cYou have to deduct every penny from my paycheck.\u201d</p><p>He rolled one shoulder in a careless shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s really a business expenditure, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bull.</p><p>Another knock sounded at the door.</p><p>Noah advance toward the door as he told her, \u201cWhere I go, you will go. You needed clothing that would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me fit in your circle?\u201d Claire finished and her pride sure felt like it took a hit then.</p> <p>He paused at the door. \u201cYou already fit me, Claire.\u201d He opened the door. Franco and Paul were already back\u2014and loaded down with shoe boxes this time.</p><p>While they unloaded the shoes, Noah returned to Claire\u2019s side. \u201cThe police have nothing,\u201d he said, voice softer once again. \u201cThey think it was just a random break-in at the Hamlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sure it was.\u201d She needed to believe that.</p><p>\u201cClaire...How can I help you, when you\u2019re so determined to keep your past locked away?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to meet his gaze. \u201cYou already know what happened to me. I saw that manila file on your desk. That file told you what college I went to, so I\u2019m sure whatever investigator you hired also told you all about what happened when I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak again until Franco and Paul were headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Claire told them as she stepped forward. \u201cThank you so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>Paul, a red-haired man with dark green eyes, waved away her thanks. \u201cMa\u2019am, when the boss tells us to jump, we do. And considering some of the crazy things we\u2019ve had to do for him...\u201d Paul laughed. \u201cTaking care of his new assistant was a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Franco agreed, smiling. Franco appeared to be in his early twenties, and his skin was a deep coffee cream. \u201cNothing like the time he had us get rid of that dead body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Franco laughed. \u201cSorry. Couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He gave her a little wave. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be seeing you very soon.\u201d</p><p>Then he and Paul were gone.</p><p>Claire faced Noah. \u201cI should go use those new clothes and get dressed.\u201d She gave a firm nod of her head and turned away to\u2014</p><p>\u201cRunning, Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking,\u201d she said without looking back at him. \u201cWalking very slowly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken about four steps when he said, \u201cTrace Weston.\u201d</p><p>The name had her pausing.</p><p>Trace Weston was a billionaire, a man with a dangerous reputation\u2014and the man who\u2019d saved her sanity once upon a time.</p><p>Claire\u2019s sister had worked for Trace. Sara had been his assistant for several years before she\u2019d been brutally murdered in Chicago.</p><p>Claire cleared her throat. \u201cIf you had Trace Weston investigate me, then I\u2019m sure you discovered all of my dirty little secrets. Weston Securities is the best firm in the U.S.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have dirty secrets.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she did. Everyone did. Hers were bloody and dirty and dark.</p><p>\u201cYou know, so I don\u2019t have to tell you.\u201d She needed to get dressed. The clothing almost seemed to be armor that she had to don in order to deal with him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty for you to tell me. One day, you will.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so certain. So confident.</p><p>Claire found herself whirling toward him. For years, she\u2019d been the good one. The quiet one. The one who never tried to step a foot out of line.</p><p>But I still lose everyone who gets close to me. \u201cOnly if you tell me your secrets, Noah. Because I know you have them. You and Trace...your military past. You both pretend to be such good, upstanding members of society, but there\u2019s more to you both, right? Secrets that some people would kill to know.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Her breath heaved out. \u201cI\u2019m going to get dressed. Wait outside the suite.\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>What? Had no one ever given the guy an order before? Money can\u2019t buy everything, Noah York.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said with a nod, \u201cbecause we need to get ready for our flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlight?\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cYork Towers is a world-wide operation, you know that. I rarely stay in one city too long.\u201d</p><p>She pulled at the sleeves of her robe, making sure her wrists were covered. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s just a short trip to D.C.\u201d</p><p>Claire could feel all of the blood leaving her face. D.C.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in twenty minutes,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>He\u2019s not in D.C. any more. He\u2019s long gone. I\u2019ll be safe there.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d she said again. Then she headed for her closet and the clothes that he\u2019d bought for her. She heard him walk away.</p><p>Heard the soft click of the door shut behind him.</p><p>And then she heard a whisper from her past. The voice of Ethan Harrison\u2019s father, Senator Colby Harrison.</p><p>You little bitch. I know you made my boy kill. You did this. I\u2019ll make you pay. No matter how long it takes, you\u2019ll pay.</p><p>And all of his rage had come at her before he\u2019d lost his senate seat due to the scandal. After that, he\u2019d blamed her, hated her, even more.</p><p>But Colby Harrison isn\u2019t in Washington, D.C. I\u2019ll be safe with Noah.</p><p>Her hands were shaking when she reached for the clothes.</p><p>Noah yanked out his phone as he paced in front of Claire\u2019s suite. He didn\u2019t give a damn what time it was. His buddy owed him.</p><p>The phone rang once. Twice. Then\u2014</p><p>\u201cDammit, Noah,\u201d Trace Weston growled, \u201cyou know I\u2019m on my honeymoon, right?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. Lucky bastard. Two weeks ago, Trace\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Skye, had confessed that she didn\u2019t want to have a big wedding that would just be fodder for the gossip pages. Instead, she\u2019d asked Trace to run away with her. To elope.</p><p>And since Trace would do anything for Skye...</p><p>They\u2019d gotten married in Paris.</p><p>\u201cI need your agents in New York to look into a break-in for me.\u201d He kept his eyes on Claire\u2019s suite door.</p><p>\u201cUh, then call the office there, man. Don\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Claire Kramer, and I only want your best men on the case.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then... \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>Noah yanked a hand through his hair. \u201cThe SOB who killed her parents is still locked up in an Alabama prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sure of that.\u201d Grim satisfaction coated Trace\u2019s words.</p><p>Noah knew that Claire\u2019s sister Sara had used her connection to Trace in order to get his help. He\u2019d used his power to convince the parole board that Ethan Harrison shouldn\u2019t be walking outside of those prison gates anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into Claire\u2019s hotel room at the Hamlet yesterday. Slashed her clothes. Destroyed every damn thing there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Hamlet? What the hell was she doing there? Noah, I thought you said you were watching\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her now,\u201d Noah growled into the phone. \u201cI want your men to see if they can find out who broke into her room. The cops aren\u2019t looking hard. The Hamlet gets robbed every other day. It\u2019s just business as usual at that place.\u201d But the knot in his gut told him that the destruction in Claire\u2019s room hadn\u2019t just been the result of a robbery gone wrong.</p><p>Noah never ignored his instincts. They\u2019d kept him alive too many times in the past, and they\u2019d put his enemies in the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my men on it,\u201d Trace said, voice flat. \u201cAnd if I find out anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me right away.\u201d He knew he could count on Trace.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, hey, one more thing, buddy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Worry deepened Trace\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cGive that pretty bride of yours a big kiss for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew off,\u201d Trace muttered and hung up the phone.</p><p>Noah\u2019s lips tilted as he kept staring at Claire\u2019s door.</p><p>Trace had loved his Skye for over ten years. Loved her, but nearly lost her to a crazed stalker.</p><p>Once upon a time, Noah had thought that Trace\u2019s single-minded love for Skye made the other man weak.</p><p>Now he knew...</p><p>It makes him lucky.</p><p>She\u2019d never been to D.C. Claire had actually made a point of staying out of the area.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to attract any unwanted attention.</p><p>But as Noah\u2019s private jet touched down in D.C., tension settled heavily over Claire\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>First trip to D.C. and my first time to fly in a private jet.</p><p>Noah had talked to her all during the flight. Business only. He\u2019d gone over a listing of his most profitable hotels, hinted at his plans for expansion, told her the PR work that needed to be done...</p><p>And he\u2019d kept her mind off the fear that wanted to snake through her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d Noah asked as he unbuckled his seatbelt. Time for them to go.</p><p>She fumbled and managed to unhook her belt, too. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019m just curious about the city.\u201d Such a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here before?\u201d He seemed surprised. Since globe-hopping was no doubt a habit for him, it probably was surprising.</p><p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t get to jet off whenever they want,\u201d she said as she fought to keep her voice light. \u201cBesides, I...I was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t want to come here.\u201d He stood, blocking the exit. Trapping her, but not touching her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to come here.\u201d Her hair slipped forward and fell over her left eye.</p><p>Before she could brush the blonde locks back, Noah\u2019s hand moved. His fingers pushed the hair back and lingered on her cheek. \u201cBut you came for me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating faster. \u201cI came for me.\u201d Because she wouldn\u2019t let fear lead her life. \u201cColby Harrison isn\u2019t here.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to dance around this issue. Noah had his neat file, after all, so why hide the truth? \u201cHe lost his position two terms back.\u201d</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t seen the man in eight years.</p><p>\u201cWhen you worry...\u201d His fingers slipped from her cheek and his index finger moved to lightly tap her lower lip. \u201cYou have a tendency to bite this lip.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her lungs.</p><p>His finger caressed her lip. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t...\u201d She barely breathed the words against his touch.</p><p>But...when she spoke, she...she licked his finger.</p><p>It was an accident. She hadn\u2019t meant to do that. Not at all.</p><p>Had she?</p><p>His pupils expanded, swallowing the gold. \u201cClaire...\u201d Need, lust, deepened her name.</p><p>She backed away. Tried to. But there was nowhere for her to go. The seat was behind her. He was in front of her.</p><p>His hand fell to his side. Fisted. \u201cDon\u2019t tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you every fucking time I see you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m trying to give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>Claire wasn\u2019t even sure what she wanted.</p><p>To be safe?</p><p>No, no, there had to be more to life than safety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have to ask, remember?\u201d His voice was so deep. So dark. So tempting. \u201cJust ask.\u201d He turned away. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell off this plane before I forget that part.\u201d</p><p>When his back was to her, Claire finally managed to suck in a deep breath. \u201cI should tell you something.\u201d</p><p>But then the pilot strode from the cockpit. Claire immediately clamped her lips shut. She sure wasn\u2019t about to make this particular reveal in front of anyone but Noah.</p> <p>Claire didn\u2019t speak again until they\u2019d cleared the airport and were in the back of yet another limo. Noah and his limos. At this point, she figured that wherever he went, a car would be waiting.</p><p>As the car drove, she found herself leaning closer to the window as she tried to get a glimpse of the city.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a while before you see anything out here.\u201d</p><p>She kept looking. Everything here was new to her.</p><p>\u201cThe privacy shield is up.\u201d And the deep longing, the lust, was gone from his voice. Noah seemed back to business now. \u201cFinish what you were saying to me on the plane.\u201d</p> <p>Making sure that she did not bite her lip, Claire turned toward him. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of that...\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head, hard. \u201cHot sex. Pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t understanding her. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>A faint line appeared between his brows. \u201cClaire, if there\u2019s one thing you\u2019re made for, it\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>But pleasure just brought more pain. \u201cI don\u2019t have lovers.\u201d</p><p>Silence. His stare seemed to measure her. After what had to be at least two minutes of extremely awkward silence, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t as in...you don\u2019t have one now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one now. I haven\u2019t had one in nine years.\u201d She didn\u2019t let emotion leak into her voice. There was no emotion. She was simply stating a fact. \u201cI don\u2019t let men get close to me. So you and I...it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d She glanced away from him. There. She\u2019d done it. Now Noah wouldn\u2019t touch her again. And she wouldn\u2019t feel the longing that his touch stirred. A longing for something Claire knew she wasn\u2019t meant to have.</p><p>\u201cHe should be dead.\u201d</p><p>Those cold, biting words had her gaze flying back to his.</p><p>\u201cThe only lover you had? That bastard who tried to destroy you?\u201d Noah growled the words. \u201cHe should be rotting in the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-he\u2019s in a cell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison is too easy for Ethan Harrison.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes...his voice...Claire shifted nervously. \u201cYou aren\u2019t who you pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, and the sight chilled her. \u201cNo, Claire, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a man who knows too much about death and dealing out bloody justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The question slipped from her. She hadn\u2019t meant to ask, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy do I think Ethan should be dead? Because he\u2019s a monster. No amount of rehabilitation is going to fix what\u2019s wrong with him. If he ever gets out\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a dead woman.</p><p>Claire already knew exactly what would happen to her if Ethan Harrison ever got out of prison. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was asking.\u201d She took a breath and pushed on. \u201cWhy do you even care what happens in my life? You once said that you owed me a debt, but...we both know you don\u2019t, not really. So why do I even matter at all to you? You\u2019re Noah York.\u201d He\u2019d been on the cover of a dozen magazines that she\u2019d passed in the airport. \u201cAnd I\u2019m...I\u2019m no one.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer, but he didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>She was...disappointed? No, surely not.</p><p>I am.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re someone to me.\u201d</p><p>She had to look away from him again. His gaze seemed to see too deeply into her.</p><p>His fingers caught her chin. He turned her head back so that she had to stare into his eyes. \u201cYour sister died in Chicago because she was pulled into Trace\u2019s battle. You lost her, and I wish every day that hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>So did Claire. \u201cSara was all I had left.\u201d The one person who\u2019d believed in Claire, no matter what accusations were tossed around in their small town.</p><p>\u201cI damn well do owe you, Claire, but that\u2019s not why I have my interest in you.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d Flat. Almost angry. \u201cMore than I can remember wanting any other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019ve had dozens of lovers\u2014\u201d Claire began.</p><p>\u201cYes, dozens.\u201d He released her chin. \u201cBut for the last three months, when I close my eyes, I only see you.\u201d</p><p>Claire swiped her damp palms on her new, black pants. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with them.\u201d The guy dated super models, heiresses, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no damn competition.\u201d He gave a hard, negative shake of his head. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ve never wanted anyone as much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I find you sexy as hell. I look at you, and I ache.\u201d</p><p>Her breath came faster.</p><p>His gaze was on her mouth. \u201cAnd I have the feeling that when I do finally taste you, you just might addict me.\u201d</p><p>Helplessly, Claire shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t give you...what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that, Claire.\u201d He inclined his head. \u201cYou might want to look out the window now. You don\u2019t want to miss what\u2019s coming...\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the window, dazed. D.C. rose before her, but in her mind, she saw a pair of glittering, golden eyes. Eyes that shone with desire.</p><p>A desire that she\u2019d felt, too. She hadn\u2019t wanted any man, not in so long. She\u2019d been in cold storage but...</p><p>He was warming her again. And making her want things that were too dangerous for her to ever have.</p><p>At eight p.m., Noah walked into Claire\u2019s temporary D.C. office. They\u2019d been in meetings all day. Talking with contractors, working with marketing staff. They\u2019d barely stopped for lunch.</p><p>Claire had surprised him. He\u2019d known that she was smart. After all, the woman had graduated at the top of her class, but she was also damn savvy when it came to the inner workings of the hotel business. And the woman sure had a gift for tact.</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t always so tactful. When he\u2019d been ready to tear into the contractors, Claire had carefully interceded. Charmed.</p><p>She was sure charming him.</p><p>She was also not even aware that he was in the room with her. Claire was crouched over the laptop that he\u2019d given her earlier, her fingers tapping furiously across the keys.</p><p>It was rare that a woman could ignore him.</p><p>But then, Claire was a very rare woman.</p><p>So he just crossed his arms over his chest and watched her. A small furrow was between her brows\u2014a sign of her focus, he was certain. Her cheeks were pale, her lips bare of color. But Claire didn\u2019t need makeup to shine. She was already so close to perfect that he ached just looking at her.</p><p>I don\u2019t have lovers... I don\u2019t have one now. I haven\u2019t had one in nine years.</p><p>He\u2019d taken that revelation like a punch to the gut. Claire truly was made for pleasure, and by locking herself off from the world, she was just giving that SOB Ethan Harrison more power over her.</p><p>Claire deserved pleasure. Noah was going to see that she got it.</p><p>Claire glanced up then. She saw him\u2014and jumped.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Noah murmured as he straightened. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>Claire surged to her feet. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t skulk in doorways.\u201d</p><p>Skulk? He smiled at her. \u201cYou looked focused. I was waiting for the right time to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and he knew she was trying to decide if she believed his story or not.</p><p>Since it was a lie, he let his smile stretch a bit more. He hadn\u2019t announced his presence because he\u2019d just enjoyed watching her. \u201cYou need to wrap things up for the night.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back her hair. \u201cAh, right...just give me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out for dinner,\u201d Noah added. Then, so she wouldn\u2019t be so nervous, he said, \u201cI want to check out the competition in town.\u201d He\u2019d just bought one of the historic hotels in D.C.\u2014the hotel they were inside of right then. His crew was updating the hotel\u2019s interior, while still working to keep the ambiance and the character that the clientele would love. He wanted to add a roof-top restaurant to the hotel, though. A new place that would be the talk of the town. He already had a celebrity chef lined up for the new venue.</p><p>So while he didn\u2019t technically need to check out the competition, he did want to take Claire to dinner.</p><p>Their first date. Even if she didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll change and meet you in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like one fine plan to him. He wondered what the odds were that she\u2019d put on the sleek, black dress that had been purchased for her. One that dipped low in the back and would reveal Claire\u2019s long legs.</p><p>She approached him slowly. Cautiously.</p><p>Noah realized that he was blocking the door.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t move, Claire would have to brush against him as she passed.</p><p>I want her to get used to my touch.</p><p>He also wanted her to make the next move.</p><p>He slid to the side.</p><p>But Claire...she still brushed against him as she passed.</p><p>That\u2019s it, Claire. Touch me. Do it all you want.</p><p>He turned, watching her as she left the little office. Hell, yes. Claire had been made for pleasure.</p><p>And soon, he\u2019d give her so much pleasure that she screamed.</p><p>Noah was in the lobby, talking with the hotel manager, when the elevator doors slid open and Claire walked out.</p><p>She was wearing the black dress. It clung to every curve that she had.</p><p>And her legs...sweet hell, her legs seemed to go on forever. Her feet were clad in high, black heels. Fuck-me heels.</p><p>She\u2019d put on lipstick. Slid color on her cheeks. Pulled her hair back into a little twist.</p><p>She also had black ribbon tied around her wrists. Sexy, silky ribbon that made Noah think of Claire...</p><p>Tied to his bed.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. York?\u201d The manager, Chuck Collins, cleared his throat. \u201cYou were, um, you were telling me about the construction upstairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember a damn thing that he\u2019d been saying to Chuck. \u201cCarry on with your work.\u201d He nodded curtly to the guy.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr. York\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah stalked toward Claire. The woman looked good enough to eat. How was he supposed to keep his hands off her?</p><p>She put her hands in front of her dress. At that angle, it almost looked as if her wrists were bound together with the ribbon.</p><p>Noah swallowed. The woman had no clue what she was doing to him.</p><p>\u201cSorry it took so long,\u201d Claire told him with a slightly nervous edge in her voice. \u201cI had to, um...improvise a few things.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. Noah had to do it. That ribbon was driving him insane. How could something so simple be so sexy?</p><p>He lifted her hand. Turned her wrist and realized\u2014</p><p>She\u2019s not wearing this to be sexy. She\u2019s using the ribbon to hide her scars.</p><p>\u201cI improvise if I wear something without sleeves,\u201d Claire said, her voice so low it was almost a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s just...people might ask questions, and I didn\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in his throat. \u201cYou would never embarrass me.\u201d He didn\u2019t let her hand go. He knew exactly how Claire had gotten those scars on her wrists. His Claire had broken once.</p><p>Because of Ethan Harrison.</p><p>Noah would make sure that she never broke again.</p><p>Her lips started to curl. He waited for her smile to come. For her dimples to flash. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cClaire Kramer!\u201d The snarl cut across the hotel\u2019s lobby. The tall, arching ceiling in the historic hotel seemed to make the cry echo all around the space.</p><p>Noah turned at the cry, frowning at the fury he heard in those words.</p><p>An older man had just entered the lobby. His gray hair had thinned, his shoulders hunched, but a feverish intensity lit his eyes. Eyes that were locked on Claire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know you anywhere,\u201d the man snapped.</p><p>He advanced on Claire.</p><p>The hell, no.</p><p>Noah stepped in front of Claire even as he heard her gasp behind him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison, no!\u201d This cry came from the man who was hurrying to grab the older guy\u2019s arm. A brown-haired fellow wearing a three piece suit. Probably in his late twenties, with one of those All-American faces.</p><p>But Harrison shook off the man\u2019s hold. \u201cYou damn bitch!\u201d He yelled at Claire. \u201cYou should be in prison! Not my boy! You should be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to close your mouth,\u201d Noah said, his own voice lethally soft. \u201cBefore I close it for you.\u201d His hands were clenched, and he wanted to drive his fist into the old man\u2019s jaw.</p><p>He knew he was looking at ex-Senator Colby Harrison. He\u2019d seen photos of the guy, but those photos had been during the man\u2019s time in office. Harrison hadn\u2019t aged so well. Age spots and thick lines marked his face, and the stench of booze clung to the man.</p><p>Colby Harrison wasn\u2019t a D.C. power player any longer. This jerk was about to find his ass kicked into the street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man with Harrison muttered. \u201cHe got a call that she was here, and I couldn\u2019t stop him\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harrison made a mistake then. He tried to lunge around Noah and actually touch Claire.</p><p>Huge mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah shoved the bastard back. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch her. You don\u2019t even talk to her again, understand?\u201d</p><p>Colby Harrison blinked as he stumbled back a bit more. His gaze was full of rage and hate. \u201cYou know what she did?\u201d He shook his head then yelled, \u201cShe ruined my boy\u2019s life! Twisted him! Made him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear,\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was still low, but grating with fury. \u201cYour Ethan was a twisted bastard all along. You knew that. Instead of getting him help, you just covered up for the asshole.\u201d He closed in on Colby Harrison. Stood toe-to-toe with the guy. \u201cI know who you are. The question is...do you know I am?\u201d</p> <p>The ex-senator frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cNoah York,\u201d the other guy whispered from behind Colby. \u201cHe owns this place. Now, boss, come on, we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s shouts had attracted too much attention. That just wouldn\u2019t do. Not only because Noah just didn\u2019t allow shit like this in his hotels but because\u2014</p><p>Claire can\u2019t be upset.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the hell out of here in the next five seconds,\u201d Noah told him, holding Colby\u2019s stare, \u201cthen I\u2019ll have my men throw you out.\u201d He smiled and knew the sight would be grim. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll just do that part myself. Because I don\u2019t give a shit how old you are or who you used to be. When I look at you, I just see garbage that needs to be tossed away.\u201d</p> <p>Colby sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cShe should\u2019ve lost her freedom. Just like him!\u201d He tried to crane his neck and see Claire. \u201cShe seduced him. Made him kill. That woman is evil!\u201d</p><p>Noah was done. He grabbed the guy\u2019s shoulders and pushed him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d Colby yelled. \u201cI\u2019m a senator! I\u2019ve got powerful friends in this town!\u201d</p><p>Two members of the hotel security team rushed toward Noah. He didn\u2019t let go of Colby. He wanted the pleasure of tossing the bastard into the street himself.</p><p>\u201cKnew this would happen,\u201d the younger man said as he hurried behind them. \u201cKnew it...\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t stop until he was on the sidewalk in front of his hotel. He still had a tight grip on Colby\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t care who your friends are. You come near Claire again, and no one will be able to save you.\u201d He leaned in close because he wanted to make sure Colby understood exactly what he was saying. \u201cYou so much as look her way, and I\u2019ll destroy you.\u201d</p> <p>Then he dropped his hold. Colby stared up at him, fear flickering in his gaze. Good. The guy had gotten the message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, sorry,\u201d the dark-haired fellow began.</p><p>Noah whirled on him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent Finch. I\u2019m the senator\u2019s...I\u2019m his manager.\u201d</p><p>What the hell ever. \u201cKeep him away, Finch, or go down with him.\u201d</p><p>Noah turned on his heel and marched back into the hotel. Claire stood just a few feet in front of the elevator, exactly where she\u2019d been moments before. Her head was down. When he looked closely, he could see that she was trembling.</p><p>Screw this.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want Claire cowering from anyone or anything. People in the lobby were whispering as they gazed at her. He was pretty sure he\u2019d even caught sight of a reporter with a camera. Gossip and D.C.\u2014the two were always locked together.</p> <p>Noah didn\u2019t hesitate. He stalked right up to her. \u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Shock froze Claire. Noah\u2019s arms were around her, he had her pressed tightly to his body, and his mouth\u2014</p><p>His mouth claimed hers.</p><p>Her lips had been parted when he kissed her. His tongue slipped inside her mouth. There was nothing hesitant about the way Noah kissed her. He just...took.</p><p>And ignited her.</p><p>Her hands rose. Curled around his shoulders. She should push him back. She should do something, anything but\u2014</p><p>Pull him closer.</p><p>Kiss him back.</p><p>Fear and shame knotted within her, fighting with a tide of hot desire that caught her by surprise.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands were on her hips. Holding her so tightly and he was\u2014</p><p>Pushing her into the elevator. Still kissing her, but guiding her movements.</p><p>She heard the elevator ding, and Claire pulled away from Noah. For a moment, she stared up at him, lost.</p><p>\u201cWill that be all, sir?\u201d The question came from the man standing near the elevator doors. He had his hand up and was holding the elevator open. Chuck Collins. Claire had met the hotel manager earlier. As she stared at him, Chuck cleared his throat and asked again, \u201cWill that be all?\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced over at him. \u201cNot quite.\u201d His words were low and lethal. \u201cThat asshole never comes into the hotel again.\u201d</p><p>Chuck nodded. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d Then he dropped his hand and the elevator doors slid closed.</p><p>Claire was still in Noah\u2019s arms. Still shocked and lost and aching in a way she shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cYou can...you can let me go,\u201d Claire managed to say.</p><p>Noah shook his head. His eyes were on her mouth. \u201cI knew one taste wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough for her, either. Noah tasted good. Very good. Good like the kind of wine Claire had when she saved her money and splurged. Not that she\u2019d done any splurging, not in the last year. Like the wine, he also made her a little drunk.</p><p>\u201cAsk me to kiss you again, Claire.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to keep kissing her? After what had just happened in that lobby?</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She pushed against his chest. The elevator was rising, and she didn\u2019t even remember Noah hitting the button on the control panel. But she knew where they were headed.</p><p>The top floor, of course. What she was thinking of as his floor.</p><p>The faint lines around his eyes deepened, but Noah let her go.</p><p>Claire rubbed her arms, chilled without him. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been here. I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize again, and I swear, Claire, you\u2019ll push me too far.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood. Here\u2019s the deal. Colby Harrison is your past, got it? He doesn\u2019t matter. What he says...doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all of those people...they saw. They heard.\u201d They\u2019d all been staring at her. When she\u2019d lived in Alabama, she hadn\u2019t even been able to walk down the aisle at the grocery store without people stopping to stare and whisper.</p><p>Did you hear...that\u2019s the girl...she seduced that poor boy...made him crazy...</p><p>Got him to kill her folks...</p><p>Claire shook her head as she tried to make those voices vanish. They\u2019d haunted her for too long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your business. Your hotel. You should care.\u201d She\u2019d been so worried about doing something to tarnish his image. And now...</p><p>\u201cScandal sells, baby, or haven\u2019t you realized that?\u201d</p><p>Claire flinched. She hated scandal. She wanted...secrecy.</p><p>The elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cSo much for dinner,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He caught her hand. Brushed his fingers over the ribbon on her right wrist. She\u2019d learned to be creative over the years. When people saw the scars there, well, there was no mistaking them. You got scars on your wrist-those long, thin scars\u2014from one act.</p><p>Claire had wanted to die when she was sixteen. When she stood at her parents\u2019 graves, when it seemed that the whole world hated her, she\u2019d wanted to escape.</p><p>To be with my mom and dad again.</p><p>People had spray painted her home. Written words like \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201ckiller\u201d on her windows. Senator Harrison had done a massive job on the local media. He\u2019d worked so hard to convince everyone that his son was just the poor, misled boy.</p><p>And Claire was the evil seductress.</p><p>He\u2019d told her, time and again, that she should be the one to suffer. The one to be punished.</p><p>I just wanted to escape.</p><p>The scars would always be there. She covered them so she didn\u2019t have to see the curiosity, the pity, in the eyes of strangers.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>Claire blinked and focused on Noah.</p><p>He had lifted a dark eyebrow. \u201cI told you, the past is over.\u201d Anger pumped in his words. He pulled her toward his room. Not just a room. A suite. One as big as the place he had in New York.</p><p>He opened the door. Kept his hold on her and pulled her over the threshold. When the door closed behind them, Claire exhaled slowly as relief hit her.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the reason, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Noah asked her. \u201cThe reason you lose your other jobs. The reason you move around the country so much.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded. Her gaze was on the D.C. skyline. She\u2019d wanted to walk through the city at night.</p><p>But Harrison is out there.</p><p>\u201cHe...I think he hires someone, a detective maybe, to watch me. Each time when I feel like I might have a life, Colby Harrison comes in. Reveals my past. Gets me fired.\u201d An endless cycle.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a problem any longer.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was grim.</p><p>Claire glanced over her shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done, Claire. Done. He won\u2019t ever get near you again.\u201d He yanked a hand through his hair. \u201cNine years? Jesus, you put up with this for nine years? Why didn\u2019t you get a restraining order against him? Why didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never physically hurt me.\u201d There were so many other ways to hurt. Like when she\u2019d been nineteen and her grandfather had been struck down by a heart attack. She\u2019d flown back home to bury him. And at the funeral, Colby Harrison had been there...telling everyone that the whore was back in town.</p><p>\u201cNever again,\u201d Noah vowed.</p><p>She wished it could be that simple. \u201cNoah, he\u2019s not going to stop. Not until I\u2019m dead or-or he is.\u201d</p><p>Noah held her gaze. Nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s done,\u201d he said again, simply.</p><p>A chill skated over Claire\u2019s spine.</p><p>His stare drifted over her face. Down her body. Lingered on her legs. \u201cI was supposed to wine and dine you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never been wined and dined.</p><p>His golden eyes lifted. Locked on her mouth. \u201cI knew one taste would do it for me. Claire, sweet Claire, you taste like candy.\u201d</p><p>She could still taste him.</p><p>\u201cNo lover? Not in nine years?\u201d He stood about five feet away from her.</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cThe people in the lobby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, what they saw doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey saw you kiss me. The other\u2014the other York Towers employees. They\u2019ll all think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cThat I\u2019m fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He took another stop. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t fuck my employees.\u201d</p><p>He had said that but... \u201cYou kissed me.\u201d</p><p>Another step. \u201cNothing would have stopped me from kissing you then.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t turned from her in shock or disgust. Hadn\u2019t been embarrassed. After everything, he\u2019d...wanted her. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I did it? You don\u2019t think I seduced Ethan Harrison into killing for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. They\u2019d crossed a line downstairs. She knew that. She also knew exactly what she had to do.</p><p>They saw us kiss. I can\u2019t keep working for him now. Coming to Noah...taking the job...it was a mistake. One desperation had led her to make.</p><p>And perhaps she was about to make another mistake. But Claire found she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you again,\u201d Noah told her.</p><p>He took another step toward her.</p><p>So little space separated them. Claire shook her head.</p><p>Noah\u2019s face hardened.</p><p>\u201cI want more,\u201d she told him, then Claire pulled in a deep breath, grabbed tight to her courage and asked, \u201cWill you fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone to the hotel,\u201d Vincent murmured. \u201cTh-that was a mistake, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mistake was made years ago,\u201d Colby snapped back at him. \u201cWhen that girl wasn\u2019t charged along with my son.\u201d Sure, Ethan had been troubled. He\u2019d been a little wild, but he\u2019d never killed.</p><p>Not until he\u2019d gotten involved with Claire Kramer. A little cheap piece of ass who\u2019d destroyed Colby\u2019s world.</p><p>Vincent shifted uncomfortably beside Colby. They were in the back of a cab, heading to their hotel. Once, Colby had only ridden in limos. He\u2019d had the D.C. folks jumping to do his bidding.</p><p>But he\u2019d lost his congressional seat after the trial.</p><p>Nearly lost his fortune in the legal battles over the years.</p><p>He would have lost it all, if it hadn\u2019t been for his other son. Austin has saved him.</p><p>Austin was the only good thing he had left.</p><p>Because Claire took my life away.</p><p>\u201cUh, sir, I read the newspaper articles. Ethan tried to kill Claire\u2014\u201d</p><p>The bastard dared to say that to him? \u201cBecause he couldn\u2019t live with what she\u2019d made him do! Ethan told me the truth. He couldn\u2019t stand what she\u2019d done, how she\u2019d used him, and he was just trying to stop her from hurting anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Claire Kramer. Not some sweet innocent girl. She was a lying, manipulative whore who\u2019d destroyed his boy.</p><p>It was a good thing Colby\u2019s wife hadn\u2019t lived to see the tragedy that hit his son. But Lily had died when Ethan was just three years old. She\u2019d slipped from Colby\u2019s life too soon. His perfect Lily\u2014gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lily was in the ground, but Claire Kramer was still walking around, living the high life. That was so unfair.</p><p>His hands were shaking. His gut twisting. He yanked out his phone. Vincent was a damn idiot. He didn\u2019t understand anything.</p><p>Colby\u2019s call was answered on the second ring. \u201cYou were right,\u201d Colby said, the words heaving out of him. \u201cShe was here. York brought her here. The bastard is probably screwing her.\u201d</p> <p>Because Claire always used her body to get just what she wanted.</p><p>The tremor in his hands got worse as his rage swelled. \u201cIt can\u2019t go on any longer,\u201d Colby said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure she suffers.\u201d</p><p>As his boy suffered, every damn day in that prison cell.</p><p>Ethan had nothing.</p><p>Claire deserved the same fate.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s hand lifted and curved around Claire\u2019s chin. \u201cYou need to be very sure. There will be no going back.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any place for her to go back to.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you.\u201d Her words were the truth. She wanted him for tonight because tomorrow, well, then she\u2019d begin running again.</p><p>A new city.</p><p>A new job.</p><p>Maybe this time, it would take Colby Harrison longer to find her.</p> <p>Maybe.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you scream for me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t the screaming type. Ethan had fumbled with her in the dark, and it had hurt, but she knew there had to be more to sex than rough touches. Others found pleasure in the act. She would, too.</p><p>I want the pleasure.</p><p>But Claire didn\u2019t think she\u2019d scream. Not even for a lover like Noah.</p><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d His lips pressed to hers.</p><p>Her eyes closed. She leaned into him.</p><p>His tongue glided over her lips. Into her mouth. Noah knew how to use his tongue so well. He wasn\u2019t wet or rough. He was...savoring her.</p> <p>She wanted to devour him.</p><p>His hands slid over her shoulders. Touched the straps of her dress.</p><p>Then the dress was sliding down to pool at her feet.</p><p>And he was kissing his way along the line of her jaw. Down her throat. Over the pulse that raced so frantically. His tongue licked over her skin. She felt the light score of his teeth on her.</p><p>Claire gasped.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>She liked everything that he was doing.</p><p>\u201cWhat I like...\u201d Noah muttered, desire heavy in his voice. \u201cI like the fact that you didn\u2019t wear a bra. Claire, I like that a lot.\u201d</p><p>A bra wouldn\u2019t have fit under the bodice of that dress and\u2014</p><p>He eased away from her. Stared down at her. The lights in the suite were on, shining all around them. There was no darkness.</p><p>There was only Noah.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect.\u201d He lifted his hand. Caressed her right breast. Her nipples were hard. Aching. And his touch sent a surge of arousal straight to her sex.</p><p>I\u2019m wet for him. Already.</p><p>She reached out to Noah. \u201cI need you now.\u201d Her fingers fumbled with his belt. \u201cNoah, we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He caught her hands. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He pushed her hands back to her sides. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started with you.\u201d</p><p>Sex with Ethan had been fast. So quick. In the back of a car or\u2014</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted.</p><p>\u201cClaire, I\u2019m going to give you so much pleasure you won\u2019t ever think of anyone else.\u201d Then he lifted her into his arms. The move surprised her and she grabbed tightly to him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t carry her far. Just a few steps. Closer to the window. To the big, leather couch that waited right beside that glass.</p><p>He spread her out on the couch. She started to cover her breasts, but he caught her wrists. Lifted them above her head. \u201cDon\u2019t move them.\u201d He swallowed. His gaze burned her. \u201cYou look sexy that way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been hurt badly in Chicago, and she bore the scar from that attack, but Noah didn\u2019t seem to see it at all as he gazed at her. Noah didn\u2019t seem to pay much attention to any of her scars.</p><p>I\u2019m the one who can\u2019t see past them.</p><p>But Claire shoved her doubts away right then. She was going to have this moment with him. No matter what...I\u2019ll have this.</p><p>She still had on her black panties. Panties that she\u2019d picked up back in New York before their flight had left. And she wore her heels. Heels that were higher than anything she\u2019d worn before.</p><p>Noah bent his head. His lips closed around her breast. He licked. Sucked.</p><p>Claire arched against him. She wanted to grab onto him and hold tightly, but she didn\u2019t move her hands. She kept them above her head, fisted.</p><p>His fingers worked her other breast. Lightly tugging at the nipple. Stroking her. Her hips arched again, helplessly. She felt so empty, and she wanted Noah to fill her. She wanted him to thrust deep inside of her.</p><p>Then she could pretend that she was just like every other woman. Having sex with her lover. Enjoying pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWith me, Claire.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid over the plane of her stomach. Down, down his fingers went until he was at the edge of her panties.</p><p>Her eyes were on his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf I pull these off, they\u2019ll just get stuck on your shoes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>He ripped her panties. Tore them in two and tossed the scraps away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d His fingers slid between her folds. \u201cAh, baby, you\u2019re so ready for me.\u201d</p><p>He positioned his body between her legs. He\u2019d thrust into her soon, she was sure of it. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>He slid a finger into her.</p><p>Claire jerked toward him.</p><p>\u201cSo tight. You\u2019re going to drive me out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>He was already driving her out of hers.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to be burning up. You have to need me more than breath.\u201d He withdrew his finger. Moved her legs farther apart. The couch was massive, so there was easily room for them both on it and he was\u2014he was\u2014</p><p>Noah put his mouth on her.</p><p>Claire flinched. She hadn\u2019t expected that move. Her hands flew down to his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, Claire,\u201d the words growled against the most sensitive part of her body. \u201cHands up.\u201d</p><p>Then his tongue, that wonderful, wicked tongue of his, stroked her. Slid over her. Slid into her.</p><p>Her hands flew back up and locked around one of the pillows on the couch. Her hips were arching, so he grabbed them and held them tightly. And he kept tasting her. Licking her. Kissing her. Taking her breath away as she gasped.</p><p>Every muscle in her body seemed to tense. Claire heard herself crying out Noah\u2019s name.</p><p>Her release was close. She could feel it. No roughness. No fast groping.</p><p>This was sex. This was what it should be like. Hot. Consuming.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her.</p><p>Claire screamed when the climax hit her. Her eyes squeezed shut, and her body bucked beneath him. The pleasure rolled through her, seeming to crest again and again, and Claire shuddered with the powerful release.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes lifted. Her breath heaved out.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you scream for me, Claire.\u201d He put on protection. Settled right back between her legs. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can do it again.\u201d</p><p>He drove into her. His hands lifted and pinned hers in place. His eyes locked with hers.</p><p>He filled her so completely. Stretching every inch of her, and Claire froze, caught between pleasure and pain.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to fuck you from the first moment we met.\u201d</p><p>She tried to suck in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>He still had his clothes on. She was naked. In only her heels, and he was fully dressed.</p><p>That knowledge made her feel vulnerable, exposed and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWill you scream for me again?\u201d He withdrew.</p><p>She wanted him back inside, as deep as he could go. Her legs flew up and locked around his hips.</p><p>\u201cSo...damn...good.\u201d</p><p>He thrust into her again.</p><p>Withdrew.</p><p>She met him, thrust for thrust. The rhythm became wild, so hard. He was in her so deep.</p><p>No pain.</p><p>Only more pleasure.</p><p>So much pleasure that the whole world seemed to explode. She wasn\u2019t sure if she screamed or not. She only knew that after years of being cold, it felt as if she were in an inferno.</p><p>One that swept her up, hollowed her out, and left her aching for more...more pleasure.</p><p>More...of Noah.</p><p>His hold tightened on her. He drove into her again. Her sex was contracting around him, aftershocks from her release.</p><p>\u201cNothing like this...never like this...\u201d He heaved into her. Tensed.</p><p>She was staring into his eyes when he came, and Claire actually saw his gaze go blind with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d He kissed her. \u201cMine...\u201d Noah whispered against her lips.</p><p>His hands still held hers pinned. She was spread beneath him. Filled with him.</p><p>Surrounded by him.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Claire woke when she heard the squeak of the bedroom door. Noah had carried her to the bedroom after he\u2019d given her that mind-numbing, world-altering orgasm.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t undressed. He\u2019d put her in the bed. Held her.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep with his arms around her.</p><p>Only now he was...leaving?</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d She sat up, pulling the sheet with her as she glanced over at the bedside clock. The numbers glowed, showing her that it was close to midnight.</p><p>He was a shadow in the doorway. \u201cGo back to sleep, Claire. I just have a little business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what kind of business?\u201d Business at midnight?</p><p>\u201cI have to meet with the manager. We need to upgrade the security here.\u201d</p><p>Because of her.</p><p>The sheets felt cool against her body. I\u2019m still naked.</p><p>\u201cHarrison won\u2019t ever be let in this place again, and I want to make sure every staff member knows that. Chuck is waiting for me now.\u201d</p><p>Chuck would know\u2014as would everyone else who\u2019d seen them enter the elevator\u2014that they\u2019d slept together.</p><p>I don\u2019t fuck my employees.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Claire softly said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, baby. If I\u2019d realized that SOB was in the city, hell, I never would\u2019ve let him get within thirty feet of you.\u201d</p><p>What had brought the man back to D.C.? She\u2019d thought Colby stayed close to his place in Alabama these days.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep,\u201d Noah told her from his position near the bedroom door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>She climbed from the bed. The lush carpeting swallowed the sound of her steps as she went to him in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted. Pressed to his chest. She would\u2019ve liked to see him naked. His shoulders were so wide. So built. He probably had a six pack.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said again, and she rose onto her toes. Her lips skimmed the hard line of his jaw.</p><p>But then his fingers sank into her hair. He tilted her head back. Took her mouth. Kissed her long and deep.</p><p>Her nipples tightened as they pressed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want to thank me,\u201d Noah rasped when his head lifted, \u201cyou\u2019ll stay in that bed and be ready for me when I come back.\u201d He let her go. \u201cI will be back soon, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She believed him.</p><p>She stood there, in the darkness, and a few moments later, she heard the sound of the suite\u2019s main door closing.</p><p>Her body was so sensitive. He\u2019d touched her\u2014everywhere. Claimed her. Marked her.</p><p>Taught her about pleasure.</p><p>Claire knew she wouldn\u2019t have much time, so she dressed quickly. She yanked her hands through her hair. Rushed to the smaller room she\u2019d been given when they checked in.</p><p>She grabbed her bag. Wrote him a note. Because she suspected that he would look for her, and she didn\u2019t want Noah to worry.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t want to throw her troubles onto his doorstep. He\u2019d been too good to her. He didn\u2019t deserve to be yanked down into her hell.</p><p>Her note was simple. Short.</p><p>Then Claire rode the elevator down to the lobby. Even at midnight, there were still plenty of people milling around the hotel. She didn\u2019t see Noah or Chuck, so she dashed across the lobby and hurried outside.</p><p>She paused to talk with the bellman, just for a moment. When he offered to get her a taxi, Claire refused. Why waste the money? Claire turned away and marched down the sidewalk.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>A hard knock pounded against the hotel room door.</p><p>Colby Harrison jerked at the sound. Who the hell would be coming to see him at this hour?</p><p>Muttering, he climbed from the bed. He\u2019d just gotten to sleep a few moments ago.</p><p>He shuffled toward the door.</p><p>The knocking came again. Harder. Almost...desperate.</p><p>Colby weaved a bit as he reached out for the knob. He\u2019d been drinking. The drinks helped him. They always did. Without them, he couldn\u2019t sleep at all.</p><p>When he tried to sleep, he thought about Ethan. Poor Ethan. Wasting away in that prison.</p><p>He squinted as he tried to see through the peephole on the door. He couldn\u2019t see a damn thing.</p><p>A rough knock had the door shaking.</p><p>Furious now, Colby jerked open the door. \u201cWhat the hell do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His visitor\u2019s hand flew away from the door. Had that hand been over the peephole?</p><p>Colby frowned. \u201cI sure as hell didn\u2019t expect to see you here\u2014\u201d</p><p>A gun was shoved into his face.</p><p>Terror flooded through Colby as he stumbled back. \u201cY-you can\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>Laughter. Then... \u201cI can do anything.\u201d The door was kicked shut. They were sealed together in that room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gun\u2019s barrel was too long. A silencer. Colby licked his bone-dry lips. Tried to think. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>The bullet blasted through his head before he could finish.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you meant.\u201d</p> <p>Colby\u2019s knees hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t make you beg.\u201d</p><p>Colby slammed face first into the carpet.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Noah opened the suite\u2019s door, frowning as he called her name. He\u2019d been gone longer than he\u2019d planned, but there hadn\u2019t been any help for that delay.</p> <p>He\u2019d had to be careful and not rush his return to her.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Noah figured Claire was probably asleep. He strode into the bedroom, but the bed was empty. The covers had been carefully arranged, re-made, and Claire was gone.</p><p>No.</p><p>He spun on his heel and nearly ran from that suite. When they\u2019d checked in, Claire had been given a separate room, and he was in front of that room moments later. He had a key, and he opened the door, not bothering with a knock. He was too pissed for a knock. The woman didn\u2019t get to just run out of his bed in the middle of the night.</p><p>Her room was smaller than his, and in an instant, he knew she wasn\u2019t there. The bed hadn\u2019t been touched. Her bag was gone.</p> <p>Hell, no.</p><p>The woman wasn\u2019t about to pull one of her disappearing acts on him. Not when he could still taste her on his tongue.</p><p>Not when I want more.</p><p>Then he saw the note. Folded, right in the middle of her pillow.</p><p>He scooped it up and instantly recognized the hotel stationary. He should, he\u2019d picked that shit out.</p><p>A flowing, feminine handwriting told him...</p><p>Thank you, Noah. You taught me more about pleasure than I ever expected.</p><p>And she\u2019d made him hungry for more.</p> <p>Noah balled up the note and shoved it into his pocket. We\u2019re not finished yet, Claire.</p><p>Three minutes later, he was storming outside of the hotel. He turned to the bellman. He knew the guy\u2014Blayne\u2014had started at the hotel just a few months back. \u201cClaire Kramer.\u201d</p><p>Blayne swallowed nervously and straightened his suit.</p><p>\u201cBlonde hair, five foot ten. Slender. She would have left here alone, probably within the last two hours.\u201d</p><p>The bellman nodded. \u201cI saw her. She was in a big hurry. Only stopped to talk with me for a few moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich taxi company did she use?\u201d Because he could call them. Track her down.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t use a taxi, sir. I offered to get her one but...\u201d Blayne pointed down the street. \u201cShe just started walking that way.\u201d</p><p>Noah glared down that street.</p><p>It\u2019s not that easy, Claire.</p><p>He started walking.</p><p>Vincent Finch stared down at the senator\u2019s body. He\u2019d called the cops less than fifteen minutes ago, and they were already on the scene and trying to push him out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou found him just like this?\u201d The detective asked. The detective was a woman, barely five feet tall, with coffee cream skin. Her partner was a blond male, and the guy towered behind her.</p><p>Vincent nodded. \u201cI...I came in to my room late.\u201d Because he\u2019d been trying to pick up the waitress who worked at the bar across the street. \u201cH-his door was open. I thought something was wrong and\u2014\u201d He broke off, gagging a bit, because he\u2019d seen the spray left behind when the bullet sank into Colby\u2019s head.</p><p>His brain.</p><p>\u201cAnd you said the victim was Colby Harrison?\u201d The female detective pushed. \u201cWhy do I know that name?\u201d she murmured, as if to herself.</p><p>\u201cHe used to be a senator.\u201d Vincent swallowed. He could smell the blood. \u201cFrom Alabama.\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2014she\u2019d introduced herself as Gwen Lazlo\u2014scribbled down that bit of information.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing a senator could have a lot of enemies in D.C.\u201d This came from the detective\u2019s blond partner. Vincent couldn\u2019t remember the man\u2019s name.</p><p>After he swiped a hand over his mouth, Vincent eased out a slow breath. \u201cThere was an...incident earlier tonight.\u201d And Vincent knew that he had to tell them the rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of incident?\u201d the male demanded.</p><p>The screaming match would be in the news. Vincent had caught sight of the reporter at York Towers. \u201cA woman from his past,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHer name\u2019s Claire Kramer. She\u2019s in town. She and the senator...they had words tonight.\u201d Though now that he thought about it, he wasn\u2019t sure that Claire had actually spoken to the senator at all during that tense exchange.</p><p>\u201cShe an ex-lover?\u201d Detective Lazlo asked as her eyebrows rose.</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cShe was involved with his son, Ethan.\u201d He turned away from the hotel room. He didn\u2019t want to look in there anymore. So Vincent stared down at his hands. \u201cEthan went to jail for killing Claire\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>The blond whistled.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch,\u201d Gwen Lazlo muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s why I remember the guy\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>There was more. Say it. \u201cOn my...on my way into the hotel...before I found the body...\u201d His hands clenched. I\u2019d always felt a bit sorry for her. \u201cI thought I saw Claire outside.\u201d He looked up and found the blond watching him.</p><p>The blond detective asked, \u201cYou think she might have killed the guy?\u201d</p><p>Vincent held his gaze. \u201cClaire\u2019s parents were both shot in the head. Just like the senator was tonight. And Claire...Claire hated Colby Harrison.\u201d With good reason. I hated the old bastard, too. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she killed him, I just know...Claire is a very distinctive woman. You don\u2019t forget her once you see her.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d been wrong to feel any sympathy for her. \u201cShe was outside of the hotel. She was here.\u201d Don\u2019t look back at that room. \u201cAnd now Harrison is dead.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat on the stone steps, her arms curled around her up-drawn knees. The Lincoln Memorial was behind her, glowing in all its glory. In the distance, she could see the Washington Monument, reaching straight up into the dark sky.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was close to 4 a.m., Claire wasn\u2019t the only one hanging out near the Lincoln Memorial. So many people were there. Walking. Talking. Taking their pictures.</p><p>Plenty of people.</p><p>So why did she feel so alone?</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p><p>At that deep, familiar voice, Claire\u2019s head turned and she saw Noah, walking up the steps toward her. She scrambled to her feet.</p><p>He kept coming. Slowly. Stalking up those stairs.</p><p>Her heart was racing in her chest now. He wasn\u2019t supposed to come after her.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t stop his advance, not until he was right in front of her. \u201cWhy did you run from me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou liked being with me. I know a woman\u2019s body. I could feel your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>A lump rose in her throat, and it took Claire two attempts to actually speak. \u201cI screamed for you,\u201d she whispered, not wanting anyone but him to hear her words. \u201cI-I...never expected that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why leave me?\u201d His words were harder. Sharper.</p><p>Claire squared her shoulders. Her bag was at her feet. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t fuck your employees.\u201d</p><p>He kept staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYou fucked me, so I\u2019m not your employee any longer. I thought it would be...easier...if you came back and I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d He bent and grabbed her bag. \u201cWhere the hell were you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome place new,\u201d she told him, her voice still soft. \u201cSome place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you hoped Harrison wouldn\u2019t find you? Forget him. He\u2019s done. He\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d</p><p>If only she could believe that.</p><p>One of his hands easily held her bag while his other hand brushed over her cheek. \u201cDo you seriously not realize just how much power I have? I can bury the man. I will bury him. You don\u2019t have to fear him again.\u201d</p><p>Hope was fragile as it tried to rise in her heart. She wanted to believe him but...</p><p>We still fucked. Noah had told her that they couldn\u2019t work together if things got personal. She had to move on.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave me?\u201d Noah asked her as his body seemed to surround hers. \u201cIf you do, Claire, if you really want to go, I\u2019ll let you get on my jet, and I\u2019ll have it take you any place you want.\u201d His hand fell from her skin.</p><p>I want his touch back.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d His voice was a deep rumble. \u201cI want you with me. In my bed. Screaming my name again. One night wasn\u2019t enough for me.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been enough for her, either.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cYour choice, baby. Always yours. Stay or go, but you won\u2019t get to cut out on me in the middle of the night again. If you stay, then you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work it out. I\u2019m the boss, and that means I can do anything.\u201d His eyes glinted. \u201cEven break my own rules. For you...I\u2019d break any rule.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand. Offered it to her, palm up.</p><p>She wanted to take his hand. So badly. So very badly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be? Do you want to be with me? Or...\u201d</p><p>Are you gone?</p><p>The question hung between them.</p><p>Claire had no one. Nothing. The clothes in the bag were really Noah\u2019s. If she left, where would she go?</p><p>Do I even want to leave him?</p><p>Her hand reached for his. His fingers were a little rough, callused on the tips.</p><p>She liked the roughness of his hands. She liked to touch him.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled around hers. \u201cRemember that.\u201d Then he bent and kissed her. She leaned into him, because right then, Claire thought that maybe, just maybe, she could have a chance.</p><p>Everyone else could live and love.</p><p>Why not her?</p><p>Noah shut the door of the suite.</p><p>I\u2019ve got her. She won\u2019t leave again.</p><p>Claire glanced back at him. She tucked a lock of blonde hair behind her ear. Her gaze was nervous. Hesitant.</p><p>Did she know just what he wanted to do with her? To her?</p><p>Fucking Claire Kramer had been incredible. And he planned to do it again and again.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be easy this time.\u201d He felt it was only fair to warn her.</p><p>Her eyelids flickered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize just how furious he\u2019d been when he returned to find her gone. Women didn\u2019t slip away from his bed in the middle of the night, acting as if screwing him was somehow shameful. They stayed. They begged for more. But...</p><p>I never want Claire to beg.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to beg for anything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever asking you to be easy,\u201d Claire said, surprising him. She turned to face him fully. She was wearing a snug pair of jeans and a loose top.</p><p>She looked even sexier than she\u2019d been in that black dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to be fast.\u201d Fair warning, Claire. They were lucky they\u2019d made it up the elevator. He\u2019d thought about taking her there, but then he\u2019d remembered the security cameras installed there. He didn\u2019t want anyone else seeing Claire\u2019s passion. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be right here.\u201d</p><p>He yanked his shirt off and tossed it to the floor. His hands went to his belt. To the snap of his jeans.</p><p>Claire\u2019s gaze was on his chest. Her blue stare...heated.</p><p>His cock jerked, swelling even more as it pushed against the zipper of his jeans.</p><p>Claire walked toward him. Her eyes were on his chest. \u201cI wondered...\u201d She licked her lips.</p><p>Sweet hell. Lick me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to touch you before,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>Wait, hold the hell up. Claire had wanted to touch him? His heart was jack-hammering in his chest.</p><p>Her hand rose, hovering above his shoulder. Then, while he barely breathed, her fingers lowered and skimmed over his flesh. Lightly, carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always so warm.\u201d Her voice was husky. Pure sin. \u201cI like that.\u201d Her fingers slipped down.</p><p>His body wasn\u2019t perfect. Far from it. Scars snaked across his chest. Some from wounds he\u2019d gotten while he was enlisted, and the newest came from the attack he\u2019d survived in Chicago.</p><p>The world might think he led the easy life.</p><p>They thought wrong.</p><p>\u201cI knew there was more to you,\u201d Claire said as her head bent. \u201cYou\u2019re not just the businessman.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Her lips brushed over the scar on his shoulder. Then the one that was too near his heart. The bullet that had nearly ended him.</p><p>His muscles stiffened.</p><p>Claire slid down his body. Her mouth skimmed over the scar that wrapped around his side. Then she went even lower.</p><p>Her knees dropped to the carpet.</p><p>Fuck me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, as much as I like where you\u2019re going, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Her mouth on him...there\u2019d be no control then.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hurt Claire. He was far too close to the edge.</p><p>He pulled her back to her feet. Stripped her in seconds.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Claire. Now.\u201d</p><p>Then he put her against the door. \u201cAre you on the pill?\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he growled out the order.</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>In seconds, he was back. He wanted to go bare with her. To drive deep and feel her hot grip all around him. And he would...</p><p>Soon.</p><p>But this time, he\u2019d use care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted her up against that door frame. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>\u201cHold tight.\u201d</p> <p>She did.</p><p>And he thrust into her as hard and deep as he could go.</p><p>Just as Noah had known...the feel of her sensual grip pushed him right over the edge. There was no holding back this time. No slow build. No sensual foreplay.</p><p>He thrust, and he took.</p><p>And he wanted everything that Claire had to give.</p> <p>She was arching against him. Squeezing him with her tight little sheath. She was so tight it was almost as if she were a virgin.</p><p>She\u2019s mine.</p><p>He lifted her up, easily controlling the motions of her body. Then he pulled her back down as he thrust again. He made sure his cock slid over her clit, and Claire gasped.</p><p>Then she moaned.</p><p>He did that same move again and again. He was so wild for her, so desperate. He pinned her to the door. Thrust deep. Loved it when her nails scraped over his skin.</p><p>He put his mouth on her throat. He could feel the frantic beat of her pulse beneath his lips. Her scent surrounded him.</p> <p>When she came, it was his name that she cried out.</p><p>He erupted right after her.</p><p>Noah\u2019s breath sawed out of his lungs as the release pounded through him. It seemed to never end, and her sex was squeezing his cock and damn near making his eyes roll back into his head.</p><p>Finally, finally, his heart rate started to slow down. He was still holding her against the door, and he hoped he hadn\u2019t scared her. He\u2019d be better next time. He\u2019d be\u2014</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cCan we do it again?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>Noah glanced at the clock. \u201cCome on, Claire, we need to go. The jet\u2019s waiting on us.\u201d The sooner he got her back to New York, the better he would feel.</p> <p>The bathroom door opened. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She was wearing all black\u2014the woman just looked good in black. Black pants. Black top. Those sexy shoes he loved.</p><p>Get her on the plane, then fuck her. Those were his immediate priorities.</p><p>He grabbed her bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and hurried to keep up with him. He didn\u2019t want to tell her why they needed to rush. Claire would just worry. She\u2019d been in the bathroom when he got the phone call that tipped him off about the visitors coming their way, so she didn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><p>I\u2019ll tell her...later.</p><p>When he got her in the elevator, he pulled Claire into his arms. He kissed her long and deep. The woman still tasted like candy to him.</p><p>But he forced himself to pull back a few seconds later. The doors slid open. He locked his fingers with hers. Claire. He finally had her just where he needed her to be.</p><p>They stepped into the lobby. Hurried toward the hotel\u2019s main doors.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw a couple talking with Chuck. The woman was small, attractive, with light brown skin and a haircut that skimmed her jaw. A blond male was at her side. Tall. Wide shoulders.</p><p>Something about them put Noah on alert.</p><p>His fingers tightened around Claire\u2019s. They were almost to the doors.</p><p>\u201cMr. York?\u201d The voice calling to him belonged to the blond male.</p><p>Noah kept walking.</p><p>Claire stopped.</p><p>Dammit. When she stopped, he had to stop, too.</p><p>\u201cMr. York? I\u2019m Detective Lane Scott. I\u2019ve got some questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Claire still wasn\u2019t moving. Because of that, Noah had to turn and fully face the cops\u2014he was sure the woman was a cop, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Claire asked as she edged closer to Noah.</p><p>Then the man and woman were right before them. The guy\u2019s gaze slid to Claire. \u201cYou\u2019re Claire Kramer.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded.</p><p>The woman with Lane Scott asked, \u201cWant to tell us where you were last night?\u201d</p><p>Noah stepped in front of Claire. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s dark eyes cut his way. \u201cI\u2019m Detective Gwen Lazlo. Lane and I work the D.C. homicide division.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenator Colby Harrison was murdered last night,\u201d Gwen said. When she made this reveal, she\u2019d made a point of maneuvering to the side so that she had a line-of-sight with Claire.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claire gasped.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d That non-committal sound came from Lane. \u201cSomeone shot the guy\u2014right in the head\u2014last night between one and three a.m.\u201d Lane paused as his gaze swept over Claire. \u201cWhere were you then, Ms. Kramer?\u201d</p><p>Noah turned back to Claire. She\u2019d gone ashen. Her eyes were too wide.</p><p>\u201cIn the...in the head?\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>Just like her parents.</p><p>Because he\u2019d read the autopsy reports on them. He\u2019d needed to read them, had to learn as much as he could, after he\u2019d met Claire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Noah told her and he made sure that his voice was calm. \u201cLook at me, Claire. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze met his.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he repeated. They had to be very careful here. If Claire hadn\u2019t left last night, his staff would have been able to vouch for her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t count on her leaving.</p><p>That had sure wrecked his plans.</p><p>Claire nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it is all right,\u201d Lane drawled.</p><p>Noah glanced back at him. The blond was scratching his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI mean, a man is dead. Half of his head was blown away and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah heard Claire\u2019s sharp inhalation of breath. His jaw clenched. \u201cBe very careful how you proceed, Detective,\u201d Noah warned him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make any enemies today.\u201d</p><p>Lane\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou threatening me?\u201d</p><p>Noah had to laugh. \u201cThreats are useless. Why bother with them? I make promises.\u201d</p><p>Lane glanced at his partner.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kramer hasn\u2019t answered our question,\u201d Gwen said, voice tight. \u201cWe need to know her whereabouts. It\u2019s come to our attention that she and the victim had an...altercation last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Noah snapped before Claire could speak. \u201cI\u2019m the one who had an altercation with the drunken idiot. He came into my hotel and insulted my guest, so I threw his ass out.\u201d He flashed his teeth in a hard grin. \u201cEnd of altercation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ms. Kramer\u2014\u201d Gwen pressed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Claire said. She eased to Noah\u2019s side. Stared at the detective. \u201cThat\u2019s what you really want to know, isn\u2019t it? If I killed him?\u201d Claire shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gwen pursed her lips as she assessed Claire. \u201cA woman fitting your description was seen at the senator\u2019s hotel, right around the time of his death. Actually, the senator\u2019s manager, Vincent Finch, didn\u2019t just say she fit your description. He\u2019s sure that she was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Noah said flatly. \u201cAnd there are plenty of blonde\u2019s in this city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there aren\u2019t that many who would probably take a savage satisfaction in blowing out Senator Harrison\u2019s brains,\u201d Gwen said. Her voice was low, and her eyes were still on Claire. \u201cAfter what happened to you, I could see where you\u2019d want payback. Your boyfriend killed your parents. Maybe you just got around to evening up that score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Claire said, voice soft.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down to the station and answer a few questions for us?\u201d Lane asked her, and the jerk was trying for a solicitous tone. The man must think Noah was an idiot.</p><p>You aren\u2019t getting Claire any place near your station.</p><p>\u201cWe have a plane to catch,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Lane shook his head. \u201cWe have an active murder investigation, you can\u2019t just leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. We will.\u201d Noah cocked his head to the right. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in New York for the next few days. If you want to reach me or Claire, you can contact my attorney.\u201d He rattled off the name and number of his lawyer. The lawyer in question was a lady who would chew up and spit out anyone who ever came after Noah.</p><p>Then he rolled back his shoulders in what he hoped appeared to be a careless shrug. \u201cNow, I\u2019m sure you have plenty of work to do. After all, there\u2019s a killer out there for you to find.\u201d</p><p>He took Claire\u2019s elbow and walked with her toward the doors.</p><p>\u201cMs. Kramer?\u201d Gwen called out.</p><p>And, of course, Claire glanced back.</p><p>Noah sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious...are you glad he\u2019s dead? Because, in your place, I would be.\u201d</p><p>Noah had to give Gwen credit. The woman was very skilled at the good cop role.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Then she walked through the door. Noah made sure that she didn\u2019t have the chance to stop again.</p><p>\u201cWell, well...\u201d Lane exhaled as Noah York and Claire Kramer left the hotel. \u201cThat went pretty much as I\u2019d thought.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it had gone nowhere.</p><p>Gwen rubbed the back of her neck. Tension was thick there, knotting the muscles. She\u2019d been awake for almost twenty hours, and she needed to crash.</p><p>Unfortunately, every time she closed her eyes, she saw Colby Harrison\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cYou think she did it?\u201d Lane asked as his arm brushed against hers.</p><p>Gwen looked over at him. He\u2019d been her partner for a year.</p><p>Her lover for six months.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been her, I would\u2019ve probably killed him,\u201d Lane added. \u201cI mean, shit, you read the file on her. The fellow\u2019s son went full-on stalker over the woman. He had a gun to her head when the cops arrived. Everyone there knew just what he\u2019d done, but then the Senator started spinning that bull about Claire being the mastermind\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s sigh cut through his words. \u201cMen. You see a pretty face, and you forget the danger.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. Then he leaned in close. His lips brushed her ear as he whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re the only pretty face I see.\u201d</p><p>Gwen wouldn\u2019t let her reaction to his words show. She\u2019d learned to be very careful with Lane. With everyone. \u201cI\u2019m saying I think there is more to Claire Kramer than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>Lane ran a hand through his hair, tousling the short locks. \u201cDespite what he said, I\u2019m betting that Noah York is going to put an army of lawyers in our path, not just one lady, if we go after Claire Kramer again.\u201d</p><p>Lawyers didn\u2019t scare Gwen. \u201cThen we just have to be sure that when we go after her, we have enough evidence to knock our way right through that army.\u201d And she knew just where they had to start with that evidence. \u201cLet\u2019s go get Vincent Finch. I want him brought into the station.\u201d She had plenty of other questions to ask the guy.</p><p>If Claire Kramer had killed the senator, Gwen wasn\u2019t about to give the woman a free pass. She might feel bad for what Claire had been through\u2014</p><p>But you don\u2019t get to kill in my town.</p><p>The plane was in the air. Noah exhaled slowly. He\u2019d wanted to get away before the cops stopped them, but...well, we\u2019re still clear.</p><p>Claire was beside him. She wasn\u2019t looking at him, though. Her gaze was locked on the window.</p><p>The pilot was up front. They were alone in the back. Secure. So he waited, knowing that sooner or later, Claire would turn to him.</p><p>Five minutes later, she did.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I killed him?\u201d Claire asked as her delicate eyebrows arched.</p><p>Noah shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She seemed confused. \u201cI don\u2019t have an alibi. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand me, Claire.\u201d He caught her chin. For this part, he needed her to look directly into his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you killed him.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cBut I will make sure that no matter what else happens, those cops stay away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>He kept staring into her eyes. \u201cWere you at his hotel?\u201d Say no. It would be so much easier to cover up if she just\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Her gaze lowered. Her long lashes shielded her eyes. \u201cI asked the bellman at our hotel where the senator had gone. He-he\u2019d been there when the taxi driver got the destination.\u201d She eased out a soft sigh. \u201cI thought about talking to the senator alone. Asking him to pl-please stop. To just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Anger surged within him. She shouldn\u2019t beg.</p><p>Then Claire\u2019s lashes lifted. Something new was in her eyes. A spark. Anger of her own. \u201cThen I realized he\u2019d just like it if I went to him, pleading. He wasn\u2019t going to stop harassing me. There was no point in me talking to him. The bastard was going to hound me for the rest of his life.\u201d Her breath eased out slowly. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead. That should make me feel bad, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t make Noah feel bad. During his life, he\u2019d seen plenty of death. Before he\u2019d started York Towers, he\u2019d been a soldier, one too good at killing. He\u2019d gotten a spot on an elite military team.</p><p>He and Trace Weston had run that team. Their job had been to rescue high-level prisoners who\u2019d been captured by U.S. enemies. Collateral damage had been a way of life.</p><p>His fingers stroked down her neck.</p><p>Collateral damage.</p><p>After he\u2019d ended his last tour, Noah had kept working with Trace. They\u2019d gone independent. There were still individuals who\u2019d needed their help. Powerful men and women who\u2019d gotten caught in the wrong place, at the wrong time.</p><p>Some of their clients had been extremely grateful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One had been so grateful that he\u2019d given Noah his first hotel.</p><p>And Noah had walked away from the bloodshed. From the battles. From the death.</p><p>For her, I\u2019d walk back.</p> <p>For Claire, he was coming to realize that he might do just about anything.</p><p>Even kill.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Gwen said as she pointed across the street.</p><p>Vincent Finch had just left his hotel.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him.\u201d Lane let out a loud whistle.</p> <p>Finch glanced up at the sound. They\u2019d called him and told the guy they\u2019d be coming back to pick him up.</p><p>Finch hurried toward the cross walk.</p><p>The light changed. Finch didn\u2019t stop walking. He ran into the street.</p><p>An engine revved.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFinch, stop!\u201d</p><p>A black SUV shot forward. It slammed right into Finch. The guy\u2019s body flew into the air, twisted, then hit the concrete.</p> <p>The vehicle kept driving. It raced away with a squeal of its tires. She heard Lane calling for back-up. Gwen ran across the street.</p><p>Blood, oh, jeez, blood was everywhere.</p><p>Finch was face-up on the concrete. His neck was twisted. His eyes\u2014closed.</p><p>\u201cFinch?\u201d Gwen put her hand to his throat.</p><p>No pulse.</p><p>Their only witness was dead in the street.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cI have to leave town,\u201d Noah said as he paced toward Claire.</p> <p>Shocked, she could only shake her head. \u201cWe just got back in town an hour ago.\u201d They\u2019d made it to York Towers less than ten minutes before.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Claire was shaken. Senator Harrison is dead. She wanted Noah to stay with her. She didn\u2019t want to be alone and\u2014 \u201cI can come with you,\u201d she offered and hoped that she didn\u2019t sound desperate. She sure felt that way.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d What was happening?</p><p>\u201cVegas,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back by tomorrow.\u201d He started packing. Claire just watched him, totally lost.</p><p>After everything that had just happened, he was going to fly away and leave her?</p><p>\u201cDrake Archer is going to keep an eye on you while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>Claire stiffened. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to \u2018keep an eye\u2019 on me.\u201d And she sure didn\u2019t need Drake to be that guy.</p><p>She\u2019d met Drake in Chicago, right around the time she\u2019d met Noah. Drake had been involved in that nightmare situation, too. Like Noah, Drake was caught in the tangled web of Trace Weston\u2019s past. Claire didn\u2019t exactly know what those three men had done when they were in the military, but they\u2019d made plenty of deadly enemies.</p><p>They\u2019re all dangerous. She understood that. Danger clung to Noah as surely as it clung to Drake and Trace.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t afraid when she was with Noah. Drake, on the other hand, made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cSomeone trashed your hotel room here, did you forget about that?\u201d Noah had his bag filled. Talk about a record-breaking packing job. If he kept running off so much, she wondered why he didn\u2019t always have a bag at the ready.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget about that,\u201d Claire snapped back. \u201cBut I hardly think that will be an issue here at York Towers. I hope you have better security than what they\u2019ve got at the Hamlet.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted and a gleam appeared in his eyes. \u201cWe do, baby. But when word of Harrison\u2019s death hits the media, you could get dragged into the mud. I want to make sure no reporters get close to you while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s all going to get stirred up again, don\u2019t you?\u201d That was what she feared.</p><p>\u201cI think reporters like juicy stories. The gorier, the better.\u201d His voice was grim. The gleam had vanished from his eyes.</p><p>Claire looked away from him. \u201cSo I just sit here and twiddle my thumbs while you rush off and tend to your business?\u201d Since she didn\u2019t have a job anymore, what else was she\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Claire, you stay here and you get to work learning more about my company and the staff at York Towers.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew back to him. \u201cBut, you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules are different with you.\u201d He strode toward her. Dropped the bag. Wrapped his hands around her shoulders. \u201cEverything is different with you.\u201d</p><p>And everything felt different with him.</p><p>Noah kissed her. It was a rough, hard kiss, and she liked it. Claire was discovering that she liked quite a bit...with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d No, had she just said that? It\u2019s Harrison\u2019s death. Everything is stirred up. The memories are so strong right now.</p><p>\u201cI have to do this.\u201d He let her go. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Then he just...walked away.</p><p>Left her.</p><p>Claire stayed in their bedroom. No, his bedroom. His suite. She looked down at her hands. At the scars on her wrists.</p><p>She thought about life.</p><p>About death.</p><p>And about what it would feel like to kill.</p><p>When the limo door shut behind him, Noah pulled out his phone. He\u2019d already called Drake Archer earlier, before he\u2019d even left D.C., so this phone call was for Trace Weston. Noah knew that he could count on both Trace and Drake to have his back.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Trace said when he answered the phone. \u201cThe senator\u2019s dead.\u201d A pause. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be celebrating?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t answer that particular question. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got pull down in Alabama.\u201d The same pull that Trace had used a while back when he\u2019d made sure Ethan Harrison didn\u2019t get paroled. \u201cUse that pull for me now. I want in to see the SOB.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice hardened as he demanded, \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s mine now, so yes, I\u2019m fucking serious.\u201d He had to see Ethan Harrison with his own eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight now? Jesus, his old man isn\u2019t even cold yet and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething is happening. I know it. Claire\u2019s room gets trashed, the senator dies\u2014just the way her parents died\u2014that\u2019s no damn coincidence.\u201d His breath heaved out. \u201cI don\u2019t want Claire in danger, and this whole tangled mess leads back to Ethan Harrison. He needs to know that Claire is off-limits. Now and forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in jail, man. He can\u2019t get to her. You just need to settle down\u2014\u201d</p><p>The hell he did. \u201cLike you settled down when Skye was in trouble? Did you settle down then, Trace? Or did you do what damn well had to be done?\u201d</p><p>Trace had killed to protect Skye. If anyone could understand what Noah was doing, it should be Trace. Maybe he won\u2019t have my back after all.</p><p>Silence hummed over the line. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him while he\u2019s in prison. That\u2019s too much, even for you.\u201d</p><p>Noah felt his lips curl. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to kill him in prison. I\u2019m just going to deliver a message to him.\u201d One that had to be personally delivered.</p><p>Trace sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll get you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going on record as saying that this is a mistake, Noah. A huge mistake.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. Drake\u2019s the crazy-ass one. You\u2019re more controlled, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>He thought about the faint scars on Claire\u2019s wrists. \u201cI\u2019m not controlled when it comes to her.\u201d</p><p>Then he ended the call. His hands fisted, and he planned.</p><p>It was nearing sunset when Noah passed through the gates of the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.</p><p>The guards were waiting for him, and they took him straight to the warden\u2019s office.</p><p>Warden Jeremiah Quill was sweating when he shook Noah\u2019s hand. \u201cThis is...highly unusual.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t care how unusual it seemed. \u201cI\u2019m sure inmates get visitors every day.\u201d He made sure to meet the Warden\u2019s stare directly as he said, \u201cI\u2019m just another visitor.\u201d</p><p>The warden\u2019s eyes darted away from him. How much pressure had Trace put on the guy? \u201cEthan Harrison is waiting for you in one of our holding rooms.\u201d He led Noah down the hallway.</p><p>Prison bars were to the right.</p><p>To the left.</p><p>\u201cIs Ethan Harrison kept in general population?\u201d Noah asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The warden glanced back at him. \u201cHis father wouldn\u2019t allow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p><p>The warden lowered his voice, \u201cBut Harrison\u2019s great-uncle is the governor. You don\u2019t quite seem to understand how things work down here.\u201d</p><p>He was getting a crystal clear view.</p><p>The warden stopped in front of a heavy, metal door. \u201cHe\u2019s inside. A guard\u2019s there, too.\u201d</p><p>Noah lifted a brow. \u201cIs the guard supposed to be for his protection or my own?\u201d</p><p>The warden swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s protocol.\u201d</p><p>It sounded to Noah as if protocol got screwed a lot down here.</p><p>The warden opened the door.</p><p>Noah stalked inside. Ethan Harrison was cuffed to an old table. He wore a bright, orange jump suit.</p><p>Nine years ago, the guy had been a fit, blond teen. Noah had seen Ethan\u2019s pictures when he\u2019d explored Claire\u2019s past. He\u2019d wondered how Ethan had fared in prison.</p><p>It looked like the guy had been on a vacation.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s face was tan. His hair even blonder. His shoulders were wide. He appeared fit\u2014and, worst of all, the bastard was smiling.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Ethan said as he inclined his head toward Noah.</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan leaned forward. He never even glanced at the warden. \u201cDid Claire send you to see me?\u201d</p><p>Noah hated to hear her name come from that jerk\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI miss Claire.\u201d Ethan\u2019s smile stretched. \u201cBut I have her pictures to keep me company.\u201d</p><p>Noah tensed.</p><p>\u201cThey help me to get through the days. And the nights.\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled out the chair across from Ethan. \u201cYou\u2019ve had someone watching Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father liked to keep track of her.\u201d Ethan\u2019s eyes gleamed with what looked like amusement. \u201cDid you hear? He died last night. Someone shot him.\u201d Ethan raised his cuffed hands and tapped his forehead. \u201cRight in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father had a private investigator tracking her?\u201d Noah kept his focus. This was important. He wouldn\u2019t let the other man bait him. Noah\u2019s rage built, but he held it back. \u201cAnd he sent you the information that the PI gathered.\u201d</p><p>Ethan tilted his head. He smiled at Noah. That smile was getting on Noah\u2019s nerves. \u201cClaire will tease and she will flirt,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cbut she won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe can\u2019t. Claire knows she belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father had someone watching her in New York.\u201d Noah was trying to put all the pieces together. \u201cHe told you that Claire was with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get to make one phone call a day.\u201d Now Ethan glanced at the warden. \u201cEven get to use his office. Thanks, Warden. I\u2019ll be sure to let my great-uncle know just how well you treat me. Bet there will be some kind of bonus coming your way soon.\u201d</p><p>Noah wanted to drive his fist into the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI used that phone call last night. Talked to my father. He seemed to think you and Claire were together.\u201d Ethan shook his head. \u201cBut he was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was wrong about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s smile dimmed.</p><p>\u201cHe thought you were the poor, misled boy, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought I was obsessed. Claire\u2019s the type of woman that can obsess a man.\u201d Ethan\u2019s gaze turned calculating. \u201cBut that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? Claire\u2019s obsessed you.\u201d</p><p>It was Noah\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cI can see you for what you are. I\u2019m not some drunken old man.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cA man obsessed will do anything for the woman he loves, and I do love my Claire.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t. He was a twisted jerk who needed to forget Claire. But that wasn\u2019t happening. Noah knew that with absolute certainty now. \u201cYou\u2019re never getting out of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my parole was revoked?\u201d Ethan\u2019s brows climbed. \u201cI only got fifteen years for the murders. I\u2019ve served nine already. Six more years...Hello, Claire.\u201d</p><p>The hell that would happen.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know...with my father dying...I wonder if I\u2019ll even get a special circumstances waiver...\u201d Ethan\u2019s stare darted to the warden once more. \u201cWith guards, of course, I might get to attend my beloved father\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>\u201cSo I will get out. One way or another.\u201d</p><p>Noah had wanted to see Ethan Harrison for himself. To talk to him. Sometimes, monsters weren\u2019t as bad as you thought.</p><p>Sometimes, they were.</p><p>He can\u2019t ever get near Claire again.</p><p>\u201cClaire has stayed true to me all these years,\u201d Ethan murmured. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always be true to her. I did exactly what she wanted, and she\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill trying to spin that line of bull?\u201d Noah asked Ethan, and he shook his head in disgust. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not your drunken old man. Claire didn\u2019t get you to kill her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so sure about that?\u201d Ethan laughed. \u201cEven Claire\u2019s closest friends weren\u2019t sure. Claire...she has secrets. A darkness inside. With her, what you see isn\u2019t what you get.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah flattened his hands on the table. \u201cThere will be no more investigators who follow Claire. No one will watch her. No one will report to you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan laughed again.</p><p>\u201cIf I see anyone even trying to watch her, they\u2019ll have to deal with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe big, bad, hotel owner.\u201d Ethan shuddered. \u201cHow terrifying...oh, wait, I\u2019ve been locked up with murderers and rapists for nine years. You don\u2019t scare me. Nothing scares me anymore.\u201d And his fa\u00e7ade dropped right then.</p><p>The humor, the mockery\u2014vanished.</p><p>Evil remained.</p><p>\u201cClaire owes me,\u201d Ethan snarled. Spittle flew from his mouth. \u201cAnd the bitch will pay me back everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you fair warning,\u201d Noah gritted out as his back teeth clenched. \u201cA warning that needed to be delivered in person.\u201d And he didn\u2019t care if the guard was listening or if the warden overheard his words. Noah leaned forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the man I used to be.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan\u2019s brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cThat man would have killed you the instant he walked into this room,\u201d Noah said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThe guard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been across the table. I would have snapped your neck before you even had the breath to scream.\u201d</p><p>Ethan swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou forget Claire Kramer. You forget her now. Or the next time we meet...\u201d Noah smiled at him. A smile that held a grim promise. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a dead man.\u201d</p> <p>Then he rose and walked toward the door.</p><p>The warden followed him out, and the guy was sweating even more. Jeremiah ran a shaking hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cI want to see his cell,\u201d Noah told the warden.</p><p>Jeremiah hesitated.</p><p>Noah just kept staring back at him.</p><p>A quick nod, then Jeremiah was leading the way for him. Noah wondered what sort of pressure Trace had applied in order to get the warden so compliant. Had it been cash? Or another, darker motivation?</p><p>Trace has a way of finding out everyone\u2019s secrets...and using those secrets against his enemies.</p><p>Noah walked past dozens of cells. After about five minutes, Jeremiah stopped near a cell that was separate from the others. A nearby guard opened the door.</p> <p>Noah slipped inside. The place was about five feet by nine feet. The cell contained a toilet. A bed.</p><p>A dozen pictures of Claire were on a back, stone wall. Fucking recent pictures judging by Claire\u2019s hair. One...he leaned forward. Sonofabitch...One was of Claire at her sister\u2019s funeral. He recognized the dress that she wore in that shot.</p><p>Noah spun to confront the warden. \u201cShe was his victim,\u201d he snarled. \u201cHe put a gun to her head. He was going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Jeremiah backed up a step. \u201cHis father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs going to be rotting in the ground soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe governor\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah whirled back around. He ripped those pictures from the wall. \u201cNo more.\u201d Rage had a haze covering his gaze. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see her. If any more pictures find their way to him, you\u2019ll have more than the governor to worry about.\u201d He tore the pictures into pieces. Marched toward the warden. \u201cYou\u2019ll have me. And when it comes to the biggest threat you need to fear, Warden, it\u2019s not the governor because I can buy and sell him ten times over.\u201d</p><p>The warden glanced nervously around the room. \u201cHe...he\u2019s probably going to get out.\u201d His voice was low, carrying just to Noah\u2019s ears. \u201cFor the funeral. He was right. There won\u2019t be anything I can do to stop it if the order comes down...\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s fury burned even hotter. \u201cIf that happens, you call me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>The warden\u2019s gaze dropped to the torn pictures scattered on the floor. \u201cI know what he is,\u201d Jeremiah said. \u201cAnd if I had my way, he\u2019d stay locked up forever.\u201d His eyes lifted. Held Noah\u2019s. \u201cIf he ever gets free, he will kill that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah swore, \u201che won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Claire...\u201d The rumbling masculine voice was followed by a light rap on the office door. \u201cIt\u2019s quitting time for the night.\u201d</p><p>Claire glanced up and found herself staring into Drake Archer\u2019s green gaze. She\u2019d been aware of him covertly checking on her during the day. He hadn\u2019t actually spoken to her until now.</p><p>Since the guy had a tendency to unnerve her, she\u2019d appreciated his silence.</p><p>Claire shut down her computer. Well, Noah\u2019s computer. She was in his office, in his suite, and she\u2019d spent the day pouring over marketing plans for the hotel in D.C. She wanted to prove to Noah that she could be useful to him.</p><p>And not just as a bed partner.</p><p>Drake stepped into the room. The light glinted off his dark, blond hair.</p><p>Claire tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d Drake asked her, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bite.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she believed that.</p><p>She\u2019d met Drake and Noah back in Chicago. Actually, her first image of Drake was rather twisted. Stained in blood. One thing remained clear to her, though.</p><p>Drake Archer is dangerous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time an old friend has asked me to keep an eye on his girl,\u201d Drake added with a roll of his broad shoulders. \u201cAnd Skye doesn\u2019t jump when I get within ten feet of her.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m not Skye.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid over her. \u201cTrue, but this is the same city she used to love. This is the place where I watched her.\u201d His head tilted a little to the left as he seemed to savor a memory. \u201cSkye was one hell of a dancer.\u201d</p><p>Claire had actually seen Skye once on stage. He was right\u2014Skye was phenomenal.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of her,\u201d Drake added as he kept studying her. \u201cSomething about the eyes. No, the fear in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Warily, she eased around the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Claire Kramer?\u201d Drake murmured. His voice was low, rumbling. His face was all hard lines and angles. Danger. When she looked at Drake, she thought of darkness and of the threats that waited in the night.</p><p>Some women might like that wild edge that clung to him. It just made her nervous.</p><p>What are you afraid of? His question had made her tense. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Claire asked him. Noah did. Trace did. Surely Drake had been told about her past, too.</p><p>But Drake shook his head. \u201cSome. Not all. Your past is your own.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cI sure as hell don\u2019t want anyone looking at my past. It\u2019s bloody and full of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is mine.\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched between them.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t we just screw the talk about the past and just focus on the present?\u201d Drake suggested. \u201cAnd in the present, you sure have my boy Noah twisted up.\u201d</p><p>She did?</p><p>Was that good or bad?</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s not like me and Trace. He holds himself back. He\u2019s damn smart. He knows that a woman can destroy a man faster than anything else on earth.\u201d</p><p>Drake sounded as if he were speaking from personal experience. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to destroy Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His smile flashed. \u201cBecause then I\u2019d have to destroy you, and I think I rather like you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just threatened her. Claire\u2019s fingers curled tightly around the edge of the desk.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends in this world,\u201d Drake continued. \u201cNoah is one of the few people who has always stood by me, no matter what screwed up shit I did.\u201d</p><p>Just as Noah was standing by her?</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t let his appearance fool you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. Helplessly, Claire shivered. Only one other man had called her by that endearment.</p><p>\u201cNoah is a hell of a lot more dangerous than most people believe. I\u2019ve always thought that, if someone were to wreck that perfect control of his, Noah York might just be the deadliest man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy...\u201d She pulled in a deep breath. \u201cWhy are you trying to warn me away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think you might be the one to wreck that perfect control.\u201d He crossed the room until he stood just two feet away from her. Not touching her, thank goodness, but still too close. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t keep them, you know.\u201d</p><p>Now she was lost. \u201cKeep what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis women. He sleeps with them, gets the lust out of his system, then he lets them go. He doesn\u2019t like to have the same lover twice in a row.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to freeze in her chest. Noah had been with her, and as soon as they\u2019d returned to New York, he\u2019d rushed out of town. Away from me?</p><p>\u201cHe usually pushes his lovers aside, but here you are, all snug in his suite, and he has me playing guard duty for you.\u201d He gave a low whistle. \u201cThat\u2019s new, and it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not a threat to Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because, as I said, I like you.\u201d</p><p>Then what did he tell to the women he didn\u2019t like?</p><p>\u201cEven if you do have that injured, delicate bird thing happening.\u201d He waved his hand at her. \u201cDo something about that, would you?\u201d</p><p>She could only blink. \u201cI\u2019m not an injured bird.\u201d Now that was just insulting.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s better. You had some bite in those words.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m in the suite. Completely safe for the night.\u201d She\u2019d been safe all day. \u201cI think you can probably leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I leave the suite? I just ordered room service for us. The room service menu in this place is damn good. Noah made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yes, Claire had realized that quickly.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It will be here any moment...\u201d Then he turned his back and took about four steps before he hesitated and said, \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t bite. Noah\u2019s already marked you as his. I know how to keep my hands to myself.\u201d After that little announcement, he kept walking.</p><p>She didn\u2019t follow him.</p><p>Noah\u2019s already marked you as his.</p><p>She rubbed her chilled arms.</p><p>Noah opened the door to his suite and slipped inside the dark interior to\u2014</p><p>\u201cThree a.m., hoss...sure didn\u2019t expect to see you come dragging in at this hour.\u201d</p><p>A light flipped on near the couch. The illumination spilled on Drake\u2019s features. The guy was lounging against the cushions, looking quite at home. Too at home.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my suite?\u201d Noah demanded. Since he\u2019d known that Drake was in New York, he\u2019d gotten the guy to keep an eye on Claire.</p><p>Not spend the night in the same suite with her.</p><p>Drake grinned. When Drake grinned, it made Noah nervous.</p><p>\u201cI was getting to know your Claire,\u201d Drake said. \u201cThat woman likes her secrets, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Claire...she has secrets. A darkness inside. With her, what you see isn\u2019t what you get.</p><p>Noah shut the door behind him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean getting the woman to talk with me was like pulling teeth.\u201d He shook his head and stayed sprawled on the couch. \u201cI don\u2019t think she cares much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually you don\u2019t have a problem charming the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Drake glanced toward the shut bedroom door. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she\u2019s one for charmers.\u201d</p><p>Noah dropped his bag. He was so tired his bones ached, but he\u2019d been determined to get back to Claire as fast as possible.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me about your mystery trip?\u201d</p><p>Now Noah was the once glancing toward the bedroom door. \u201cIs she asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been that way for a few hours now. Tried to get her drunk with some wine,\u201d Drake confessed. \u201cDidn\u2019t work. The woman didn\u2019t even touch her glass.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe need to be clear on something.\u201d He\u2019d thought it was obvious when he asked Drake to watch Claire. \u201cYou don\u2019t fuck with her, understand?\u201d</p><p>Drake laughed softly. \u201cBut you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly me.\u201d He tossed aside his jacket. \u201cClaire is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA broken bird, a woman who needs your protection.\u201d Now Drake was mocking.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah snarled. That sure wasn\u2019t what he saw when he looked at Claire. \u201cShe\u2019s a survivor. She\u2019s been through hell, and I want to make sure she never has to suffer again.\u201d</p><p>Drake seemed to absorb that. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do anything to keep her safe, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cOh, how the mighty have fallen.\u201d Now Drake rose and paced toward Noah. \u201cI don\u2019t give out advice often, but for you, I\u2019ll make an exception. Seeing as how we go back so far...and you\u2019re one of the few people who can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually stand your psychotic ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand me,\u201d Drake muttered. He heaved out a sigh. \u201cYou were smarter than Trace and I were. You didn\u2019t get wrapped up in a woman. You kept your distance. You played it safe.\u201d</p><p>Noah waited.</p><p>\u201cYou need to keep playing it safe. Opening yourself up to a woman like Claire, that is a big mistake. She\u2019ll rip your world apart, man.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cWhen Trace almost lost Skye, you saw what it did to him.\u201d Drake\u2019s face hardened as worry glinted in his eyes. \u201cDo you really want that shit to happen to you?\u201d</p><p>His back teeth had clenched so hard they ached. \u201cI have no intention of losing Claire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw, hell, it\u2019s already too late for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It had been too late for Noah the moment he\u2019d met Claire\u2014and she\u2019d taken a swing at him in that Chicago alley.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Now real concern was in Drake\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t let her push you too far.\u201d</p> <p>But how far was too far?</p><p>\u201cReporters were at the Towers most of the day, trying to get to her. They even asked me if she was involved in the death of a certain Senator Colby Harrison.\u201d Drake\u2019s brows rose. \u201cSeems he died in D.C., right during your recent little visit there with the tempting Claire.\u201d</p><p>Noah fired another fast glance at the bedroom door. \u201cWhen she was sixteen, Claire\u2019s boyfriend killed her parents. He put a gun to Claire\u2019s head, and he was going to kill her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boyfriend was Ethan Harrison, Senator Harrison\u2019s younger son. Instead of just admitting that he had one screwed-up kid, the senator tried to paint Claire as a seductress who\u2019d led the boy down the wrong path.\u201d</p> <p>Drake rocked back on his heels. \u201cShe said her past was blood and death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Her future wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cThe senator harassed her for years, and now she\u2019s free of him.\u201d</p><p>Drake absorbed that, then muttered, \u201cFree, right at the same time you two hook up.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t let his expression change. \u201cSometimes, that\u2019s how fate works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cute, Noah...did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had, then I wouldn\u2019t be so worried about keeping a watch on Claire.\u201d He did not want Claire overhearing this conversation. \u201cBefore she moved in here at the Towers, someone trashed her hotel room at the Hamlet. That asshole Ethan Harrison, he\u2019s been watching her\u2014from prison. He\u2019s got a PI on her. Ethan had photos of her, recent damn photos, all over his cell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s where you went on your little trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to see him with my own eyes. Needed to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Drake assessed him. \u201cYou were measuring your enemy.\u201d</p><p>It was the way they\u2019d worked when they were in the military. Know your enemy. Learn his weaknesses. Exploit them.</p><p>Take out that enemy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s as obsessed with her now as he was nine years ago.\u201d Actually, the guy might even be more obsessed. Time should have made the bastard let her go.</p><p>The bedroom door squeaked open. \u201cNoah?\u201d Claire slipped out of the darkness and into the light of the main room. A smile swept over her face. The smile that he loved. The one that started with her lips, that flashed her dimples, and made her eyes shine.</p><p>Every muscle in his body locked down.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the only one obsessed,\u201d Drake said, voice low. \u201cI\u2019m telling you...watch yourself. Because you\u2019re headed for an implosion.\u201d Then Drake raised his voice as he drawled, \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you again soon, Claire Kramer.\u201d</p><p>Then he left them.</p><p>Noah drank in the sight of Claire.</p><p>\u201cHow was your trip?\u201d Claire asked him as she crept toward him. A few seconds later, she stood in front of him. Her hands lifted, then hesitated.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want Claire to hesitate when it came to touching him. He started to reach for her, but Noah locked his muscles down. He wanted the next move to be hers.</p><p>After a moment, she pressed herself against him. Hugged him. It only lasted a moment, but he felt the impact of that embrace rock through his whole body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d Her words were faint as she drew back. She put her hands behind her. Stared up at him with those big blues that always seemed to make him a little weak.</p><p>I missed you, Claire.</p><p>When he\u2019d never missed anyone, not until her.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t about just repaying some debt anymore. Wasn\u2019t about trying to fix the hole in Claire\u2019s life that her sister\u2019s death had left behind.</p><p>It was about more.</p><p>\u201cDid you finish your business?\u201d Claire asked him.</p><p>He put his hand on her cheek. Like touching silk. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I will, soon.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught as she stared up at him. \u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d So badly that his whole body seemed to be burning. He hadn\u2019t been able to get back to her fast enough. She\u2019d been the only thing he could think about on the flight home.</p><p>She wore a dark robe. Her hands lifted. Unbelted that robe. It fell at her feet.</p><p>Claire took his hand. She led him back to the bedroom. The woman had no idea just how close to pouncing on her he truly was.</p><p>He should be careful with her. After their last time together, she was probably sore.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d Her voice was pure sin, like a stroke right over his aroused cock.</p><p>His control was shredding. Every second with her ripped it a bit more.</p><p>\u201cI want to give you pleasure,\u201d Claire told him as she stared up into his eyes. \u201cTeach me how?\u201d</p><p>Right then, he couldn\u2019t. He could only push her back onto the bed. Part her thighs. See the perfect pink flesh that waited. \u201cThis gives me pleasure.\u201d He put his mouth on her and feasted.</p><p>She bucked beneath him. Arched. Her taste drove him insane.</p><p>Get her ready. Take her.</p><p>When her nails raked down his back, Noah rose. He positioned his cock right at the entrance to her body. He\u2019d put on a condom, pausing just those few seconds\u2014one day I\u2019ll have all of her\u2014and he drove deep into her.</p><p>Only then, only then, the frantic tension left his body. The fear. The fury. The lethal combination that seeing Ethan Harrison had roused within him.</p><p>Claire will tease and she will flirt, but she won\u2019t sleep with you...She can\u2019t. Claire knows she belongs to me.</p><p>Ethan was so wrong.</p><p>Noah thrust harder into Claire. She whispered his name. Her sex squeezed around him. So hot and tight and wet. Perfect for him.</p><p>She climaxed, crying out and her sex clenched him even tighter.</p><p>Noah\u2019s thrusts became faster then. Deeper. The bed shook beneath them. The headboard thudded into the wall. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Nothing could have stopped him at that moment.</p><p>He plunged into her. Lost sight of everything but Claire.</p><p>And when he came, he roared her name.</p><p>Mine. Always.</p><p>Noah would do anything necessary in order to protect what was his.</p><p>They\u2019d taken Claire away.</p><p>Ethan Harrison paced the length of his cell, rage pouring through his veins. All of his pictures were gone. The pictures that let him see Claire. That let him feel her.</p><p>Those pictures were important.</p><p>He needed them.</p><p>I need Claire.</p><p>That bastard Noah York didn\u2019t scare him. After what he\u2019d survived in prison, nothing scared him.</p><p>His father had thought that he kept Ethan safe from the other inmates. But when the lights went out, when the guards turned their backs...you had to protect yourself. He\u2019d gotten very good at protecting himself.</p><p>And now...his father was dead.</p><p>The funeral would be in a few days. That gave him so little time.</p><p>It was a good thing he\u2019d been plotting his escape for nine years. All of the plans were already in place. Soon...very soon...</p><p>I\u2019ll see you again, Claire.</p><p>And it wouldn\u2019t just be a thin photograph that he touched. He\u2019d have the real deal in his arms once again.</p><p>No one will take you from me.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re burying the senator today.\u201d</p><p>When Noah made that announcement, Claire\u2019s fingers stilled over the computer keyboard. She\u2019d been staying with him at York Towers for the last few days. Sleeping in his bed at night, working by his side during the day.</p><p>Drake had vanished.</p><p>The reporters had stayed close.</p><p>But not as close as Noah.</p><p>Noah cleared his throat and said, \u201cAnd they\u2019re letting Ethan go to the funeral.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. They weren\u2019t in the suite now. Instead, they were working in one of the offices downstairs. They\u2019d spent the morning going over blueprints for the Washington restaurant addition. Talking marketing. PR. Noah wanted to open the roof-top restaurant with a bang on New Year\u2019s Eve. Throw a huge party and\u2014</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and focused on him. She\u2019d already known that Ethan was being allowed to attend the funeral.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing a mask, Claire. Talk to me.\u201d He caught her hands. Pulled Claire to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d There wasn\u2019t anything to say. She wasn\u2019t going to pretend some sort of grief for the senator\u2019s death. It was wrong, but she felt relief now that he was being buried.</p><p>He can\u2019t hurt me anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to me.\u201d The words were hard, but his hands were light on her. \u201cClaire, it\u2019s me. I won\u2019t judge anything you say. Just...talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d There. She\u2019d said it.</p><p>His hold tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cI saw on the news that the Alabama governor was granting some sort of special release for Ethan.\u201d A temporary hardship release or some other kind of bull. \u201cI don\u2019t like knowing that he\u2019s out there, free, not even for a second.\u201d She wanted him locked away behind as many bars as possible.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t touch you.\u201d</p><p>His gruff words sounded like a vow, but Noah didn\u2019t understand. \u201cThat\u2019s what my parents told me, too.\u201d She pulled away from him. Headed to the nearby window. Stared out at the city. \u201cThey told me I\u2019d be safe. That Ethan wouldn\u2019t hurt me again. That I could just walk away from him.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Noah swore.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t safe. Even with a restraining order on him, he came after me. He killed them, and he found me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told her that when he first found her on the dock. Been so proud.</p><p>\u201cHe watched me in that courtroom. Watched me like he owned me.\u201d She\u2019d been sixteen. So terrified. \u201cAnd when I left the courthouse each day, there\u2019d be people outside, yelling at me. Calling me so many names. There\u2019d be spray paint on my house. People were believing his story. I thought...\u201d This was the part that twisted her insides, but saying it out loud...I have to do it. \u201cI thought Ethan was going to get away with what he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands wrapped around her shoulders. He turned her around and forced Claire to face him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was, though, and I knew if he got free, he\u2019d come after me.\u201d She looked down at her wrists. Covered by her long sleeves. Always covered so carefully. \u201cSo I took the razor.\u201d A hard smile lifted her lips. \u201cI made sure I cut myself just the right way, and I waited to die in the same house that my parents had died in.\u201d</p><p>His hold on her was bruising.</p><p>\u201cI know it was weak,\u201d she said, voice husky, \u201cbut I was sixteen, and so scared, and death was better than having to see him again.\u201d</p><p>He yanked her against his chest. She could feel the mad drumming of his heart.</p><p>His scent wrapped around her. His arms held her close. She felt safe there, in his embrace. Once, she\u2019d thought that she\u2019d never be safe.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t see him again,\u201d Noah promised her. \u201cHe\u2019s going back to jail.\u201d</p><p>But one day, Ethan would get out, for good. In five years, eight months, and seven days. Yes, she knew exactly how much time he had left to serve.</p><p>\u201cSara found you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Noah asked her.</p><p>Claire pulled away from him, just a little bit. \u201cShe came home early.\u201d Her big sister. Older by four years. \u201cShe saved me. She got there in time.\u201d Her lips trembled as she thought of Sara\u2019s recent death...and how she\u2019d just been minutes too late to save the one person in this world that she loved. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do the same for her.\u201d</p><p>Claire had lost everyone that she loved.</p><p>So much pain. Sometimes, she felt as if it were choking her.</p><p>His lips brushed against her forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the fuck out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Claire blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a place in the Hamptons. We\u2019re going to the beach. You\u2019re going to drink wine with me, and you\u2019re going to relax on that beach\u2014even if it is getting a bit cold now\u2014and you\u2019re not going to think about death, Senator Harrison, or that asshole Ethan.\u201d He tipped up her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re only going to think about me. Got it? Me...and you...and the way we can make each other feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...the Washington hotel, the restaurant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill still be there when we come back. We\u2019re leaving, Claire. Because you\u2019re alive, I\u2019m alive, and the rest of the world can just screw off.\u201d</p><p>He hated funerals. Particularly this funeral.</p><p>The overdone mourning. All the fake tears. The talk about the \u201cgood\u201d man that had been taken too soon.</p><p>Such bullshit.</p><p>Drake Archer shifted beneath the hanging branches of the old oak tree. Spanish moss clung to the sprawling branches, and the moss blew lightly in the faint breeze.</p><p>It was a packed funeral, but Drake had expected nothing less. Old senators, law enforcement personnel, reporters...and, of course, just the curious had turned out for this event.</p><p>It\u2019s like a freaking circus show.</p><p>Noah hadn\u2019t asked Drake to attend the funeral. After he\u2019d left New York, Drake had actually planned to just head back to Biloxi, but the funeral in Fairview had been too close for him to pass up. Maybe he was just curious, too.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019m a suspicious bastard, and I wanted to see Ethan Harrison with my own eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because the guy was there. Not wearing prison orange, but instead dressed in a black suit. Drake sure never would\u2019ve guessed that man had spent the last nine years in a cell.</p><p>It turned out there were actually two Harrison boys. Ethan Harrison, and his older brother, Austin. Ethan was the black sheep, but the brother who currently sat beside him on the front row, right next to the casket, well, it seemed Austin Harrison was supposed to be the savior of the family.</p><p>He was an attorney, some big corporate deal. Drake had done a little digging, and he\u2019d discovered that Austin was the one who\u2019d kept the family afloat for so many years. After the senator had crashed and burned, it had been Austin who made sure the family never lost their position in Alabama society.</p> <p>They\u2019d kept their mansion. Kept their power.</p><p>Drake shifted again, moving to get a better view of the brothers. His eyes narrowed. Ethan was staring at the grave. He was...smiling?</p><p>\u201cAre you a friend of Senator Harrison\u2019s?\u201d A soft voice asked him. \u201cOr are you family?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and saw a petite beauty with light brown skin standing close by. \u201cI\u2019m neither,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She tilted her head. The woman\u2019s shoulders were straight. Her hair fell just to her chin. She was dressed simply but stylishly in black pants and a matching blouse. Her gaze held his, then slid to the mourners, as if assessing them.</p> <p>His instincts kicked into gear. The way she was watching the crowd...</p><p>Cop. Or a private investigator. He could usually spot them easily.</p><p>Even when said cop came in the form of such a pretty package.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d she said, not glancing back at him. \u201cI\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>Drake felt a grin curl his lips. \u201cI was just admiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d Her gaze was on Ethan Harrison. \u201cWell, Mr. Neither, if you aren\u2019t a friend or family member, then want to tell me why you\u2019re at the funeral?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just passing through. It\u2019s not every day that a senator gets buried.\u201d He kept his eyes on her. \u201cAnd what\u2019s a cop with a northern accent doing down here in Alabama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the cop who found the senator\u2019s body in D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t you in D.C. right now?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze came back to his. \u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to find a killer, Mr. Archer.\u201d</p><p>Ah, he wasn\u2019t Mr. Neither any longer. The lady had known exactly who he was all along. Interesting. \u201cIt would seem then you\u2019re a pretty good cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Noah York\u2019s,\u201d she said. Once more, her gaze turned to sweep the crowd. \u201cDid he send you down here to watch the funeral...or to watch Ethan Harrison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>He thought her lips curled a bit at that answer. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m just passing through,\u201d Drake told her.</p> <p>This time, she turned to face him. \u201cYour friend could be a killer.\u201d</p><p>There was no could be about it.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t protect a killer, would you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d protect Noah York any day. \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d he said as he remembered days better left in the past, \u201cNoah pulled me out of hell. A man doesn\u2019t forget things like that.\u201d</p><p>Because he could\u2019ve died in a frigid prison, if Trace and Noah hadn\u2019t fought so hard for him. They\u2019d been willing to die in order to save him. No, he\u2019d never forget what they\u2019d done.</p><p>His gaze slid back to the funeral.</p><p>Drake knew that, if he had to, he\u2019d kill in order to protect Noah. Because he would not just stand back and watch his friend crash and burn.</p><p>The funeral was over.</p><p>Ethan Harrison tried not to smile as he stared at the grave. His father was gone.</p><p>Good fucking riddance.</p><p>The mourners kept looking at him. They were driving him insane. There were so many whispers and curious stares. He hunched his shoulders. Looked at the ground. And tried to act like this wasn\u2019t one of the best moments of his life.</p><p>I\u2019ll be getting away soon.</p><p>His brother tried to brush by him. Ethan grabbed Austin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He steered his brother to the relative privacy of a nearby mausoleum. The guards stayed close, about ten feet away, so Ethan dropped his voice when he said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t come to see me, brother.\u201d</p><p>He and Austin had the same eyes. Same green color. Same shape. And right then, Austin\u2019s eyes were bright with fury. \u201cWhy the hell would I come and see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re family!\u201d That should be plenty of reason. \u201cYou don\u2019t lock family away and forget about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do if the family is anything like you.\u201d Austin glared at him, the disgust plain to see on his face. That was Austin all right. Always looking down his nose at him. Always acting like he was so much better than Ethan.</p><p>You\u2019re not.</p><p>\u201cEverything that happened is on you,\u201d Austin snarled at him. \u201cIf you\u2019d just left that girl alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s eyelids jerked. \u201cYou should have left her alone.\u201d</p><p>Austin had always been the perfect one. The quarterback. The valedictorian. The every-fucking-thing. \u201cYou saw her first,\u201d Ethan recalled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the diner, you saw her first.\u201d He could remember this so well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have noticed Claire at all, if you hadn\u2019t been staring at her so hard. Hell, you even said...\u2018I\u2019m gonna ask her out.\u2019 I just beat you to the punch.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s jaw dropped in surprise, and he surged toward Ethan. \u201cThat\u2019s why you hooked up with Claire Kramer? Because you thought I wanted her?\u201d</p><p>Ethan just smiled at him. You did want her, brother. I saw it in your eyes.</p><p>Austin sucked in a deep breath. Then he smiled, too. And laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot, Ethan. I hope you enjoyed your afternoon of freedom, because it\u2019s over. They\u2019re waiting to take you back to jail.\u201d His voice dropped to a low whisper. \u201cAnd guess what happens when you get back? Your preferential treatment ends. No more being separated from the others. Welcome to general pop.\u201d</p><p>Was that supposed to scare him?</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s gone. And I\u2019m not as blind as he was. Everything will change for you now. You did the crime, and you\u2019ll suffer for it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced away from Austin\u2019s glittering eyes. \u201cOne thing I always wondered...\u201d His stare lingered a moment on the casket. Rot, old man. Rot. \u201cDid he hit you, too? Or did he just save that shit for me?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Maybe that was his answer.</p><p>\u201cYour big brother is supposed to protect you. How come you never helped me?\u201d Ethan asked him. Then, because maybe he didn\u2019t want to hear the miserable lie that Austin would spout, Ethan walked away from him.</p><p>The whispers were louder as he headed back to the patrol car. The black and white car was parked near the edge of the lot, close to a thick patch of trees. Those trees backed up to a little bayou. He\u2019d taken Claire to that bayou once.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her virginity there. They\u2019d been in the back of his car then.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d one of the guards said as he stepped to Ethan\u2019s side. Bo. Bo Dunnelly.</p><p>The other guy was Marcel Reed.</p><p>They\u2019d been good enough, for cops.</p><p>Marcel opened one of the car\u2019s back doors. Ethan knew the reporters close by had been waiting for this shot. The picture of him being loaded back up for jail.</p><p>The cops didn\u2019t cuff him.</p><p>He\u2019d counted on that.</p><p>So he waved to the crowd. He sucked in a deep breath of that free air. And he remembered Claire.</p><p>He slid into the car.</p><p>Marcel and Bo headed toward the front of the vehicle. They climbed inside.</p><p>\u201cDamn, son,\u201d Marcel said as he settled into the front seat of the car. \u201cThat was sure a lot of folks to see your dad off.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it had been. \u201cHe always liked a good show.\u201d The old bastard had cared so much about what everyone thought.</p><p>Too bad no one had realized what an abusive prick he was.</p><p>The show was over. Drake strode past the grave. He glanced toward the patrol car. Ethan Harrison had just been loaded up in there and\u2014</p><p>The force of the explosion threw Drake back about five feet. He nearly landed right in that damn grave.</p><p>Drake jumped up as fast as he could, then stared with narrowed eyes at the sight before him.</p><p>The patrol car was a ball of flames. People were screaming, running, and Ethan Harrison...</p><p>He was burning.</p><p>The little cop ran toward the car. Damn foolish mistake. Amateur hour. He grabbed her, jerked her back and\u2014</p><p>Another explosion sent the flames surging even higher.</p><p>\u201cThere are men in there!\u201d The cop screamed. \u201cTwo officers, I saw them load Ethan in\u2014\u201d</p><p>And all he could see was fire now. \u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d Someone had wanted to take out Ethan Harrison and the cops had just become collateral damage.</p><p>The heat from the flames lanced over his skin.</p><p>When his phone rang, Noah thought about ignoring the call. He would have, if the ring hadn\u2019t been the distinct tone that told him Drake Archer was on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be gambling some place?\u201d Noah asked when he took the call. Drake owned a series of casinos along the Mississippi Coast, and Noah had thought that his friend would be getting right back to business.</p><p>Noah and Claire had just arrived at his house in the Hamptons. Claire was walking along the beach. He intended to join her there in the next sixty seconds.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t talk long,\u201d Drake said, the words low. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more later, but...Ethan Harrison is dead.\u201d</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d just heard correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at the senator\u2019s funeral...\u201d</p><p>Why the hell had Drake been there?</p><p>\u201cEverything was fine until Ethan Harrison got loaded back into a patrol car. Someone put a bomb in the car. Everything and everyone in that car are gone.\u201d</p><p>Noah stared down at the beach. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the man can walk through fire, hell yes, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Drake warned him, \u201cthere\u2019s a cop here. A woman from D.C. She\u2019s asking a lot of questions about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d Claire was free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find out from the authorities down here. But, shit, Weston\u2019s the one who is good at investigating things, not me.\u201d There was the murmur of voices in the background. \u201cGot to go.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>Noah kept staring down at the beach. Claire had turned and was walking toward him. She wasn\u2019t smiling, but she didn\u2019t look as frightened as she\u2019d appeared back in the city.</p><p>He moved to the edge of his deck. The wind tousled Claire\u2019s hair as she climbed up the steps. Her gaze darted to his phone. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Just tell her. \u201cEthan Harrison is dead.\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>\u201cDrake was at the senator\u2019s funeral.\u201d Why? \u201cA bomb was put in the car, and he\u2019s...Ethan is gone, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Her breath heaved out, and Claire hunched over, clutching her stomach.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d He ran to her. Put his hands on her arms.</p><p>She looked up at him. Tears streamed down her cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d If Drake had said the man was gone...he was gone.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t mention that when it came to demolitions, Drake was an expert. He\u2019d always been the one to set the detonations for their team.</p><p>And Drake just happened to be at the funeral? Shit, but this could get bad, fast.</p><p>\u201cEthan won\u2019t ever come after me,\u201d Claire whispered. She was crying and smiling, and breaking the heart that Noah didn\u2019t think he still had. \u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>Then she threw her arms around Noah and held him tight. He held her just as tightly.</p><p>Ethan Harrison might be gone, but things weren\u2019t over. Not yet.</p><p>The senator\u2019s dead. Harrison\u2019s dead. Would that be the end of the killings? Or were things just getting started?</p><p>He pulled her closer. Noah didn\u2019t know what was happening. Someone had just saved him one hell of a lot of trouble though. Because Noah had already put a plan in motion to eliminate Ethan.</p><p>Claire looked up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be afraid any longer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He didn\u2019t tell Claire what he was thinking. What would be the point?</p><p>Maybe he was wrong.</p><p>The senator...Ethan...their deaths might not touch Claire at all.</p><p>His fingers slid down her back.</p><p>He was the only one touching her, and anyone who wanted to hurt Claire would have to go through him.</p><p>\u201cWill you take me out on your boat?\u201d Claire asked. Her stomach was in knots. It had been that way, pretty much all day long. The knots had gotten even worse when she found out the news about Ethan\u2019s death.</p><p>He\u2019s dead. Dead. He can\u2019t hurt me. He can\u2019t find me. I\u2019m finally safe.</p><p>Noah was cooking dinner for her. Such a normal, domestic task, and one that she never would\u2019ve pictured Noah York performing. The guy always seemed to have an army of chefs at his beck and call.</p><p>But out there, it was just him. Just her.</p><p>Exactly as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cMy boat?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. He\u2019d just sounded so wooden. \u201cYes, I, um, I saw the boat down by the dock. I thought\u2014I thought you might want to go out.\u201d When she\u2019d been younger, she\u2019d loved heading out on the water with her grandfather. She\u2019d always felt so free then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His stare turned toward the window. Darkness had fallen, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to see the boat. \u201cI don\u2019t usually take anyone out with me.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d She stopped because Claire didn\u2019t know what to say. They were lovers, but according to Drake, it was just some sort of temporary situation. She was bumbling around, and trying to make plans and do things because\u2014</p><p>I feel free.</p> <p>Noah put down the knife he\u2019d been holding. He headed for her. His face was so hard. So tight.</p><p>Nervousness pushed through Claire. She\u2019d done something wrong. \u201cForget I said anything.\u201d The moment was thick with tension, and she just wanted to go back to the way they\u2019d been before.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know about my past, do you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>His gaze held hers. \u201cSome women...they make plans for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey learn everything they can about my life. Then they use what they know to try and win me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to win you.\u201d It hurt that he thought she was just trying to manipulate him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cYou tried to run from me.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d thought it was best.</p><p>\u201cDinner can wait,\u201d he said. He reached for her fingers. Threaded his with hers. \u201cI know about your hell. Maybe it\u2019s time you knew about mine.\u201d And he led her out onto the balcony. Then down the wooden steps.</p> <p>Her bare feet curled in the sand. The wind blew off the water, sending her t-shirt fluttering around her body. There was a chill on the wind that sent goosebumps rising along her arms.</p><p>The moon was out. Heavy and full in the sky. The big boat was docked nearby.</p><p>\u201cI was thirteen when they died,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were the only parents I ever knew.\u201d He released her hand. \u201cMy real folks gave me up when I was a kid. But Mac and Kylie...they loved me so much.\u201d A pause. \u201cProbably the same way your parents loved you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never thought about Noah\u2019s family before. Why not? The guy had to be connected to others. He wasn\u2019t just\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy dad loved to get out on the water. He started teaching me how to steer when I was barely tall enough to reach his waist. We\u2019d go out on that water. Stay for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I loved the water, too,\u201d Claire whispered, needing to say something. There was an echo of pain in Noah\u2019s voice, and she wanted to soothe him. \u201cI always felt free out on the water.\u201d But she sure hadn\u2019t been out on a boat like this one. She\u2019d gone out on a little fishing boat\u2014one with a small motor or she\u2019d just used paddles.</p><p>\u201cThe water\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Noah said and his gaze turned toward the waves. \u201cAnd it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>The waves crashed into the beach.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it reminds me of you.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was dangerous? Claire shook her head, then realized he couldn\u2019t see the movement. \u201cI\u2019m not dangerous to you.\u201d She\u2019d never hurt him. He\u2019d been one of the few people to actually help her. To care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more dangerous than you know.\u201d The wind took that soft reply, twisted it, and Claire wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d even said those words.</p><p>Then he turned his back on the water and faced her. \u201cA storm came up. One of those freak storms that shouldn\u2019t have happened. It sent our boat rolling. We lost the sail\u2014hell, we lost everything.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her arms. \u201cNoah...\u201d Claire didn\u2019t want to hear the end of this story. She wanted to picture him happy. She wanted him to introduce her to Mac and Kylie.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough. I couldn\u2019t keep my dad afloat. He\u2019d gotten hit in the head with the mast, and he was bleeding. I couldn\u2019t keep him afloat.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out on the water,\u201d Claire whispered. You don\u2019t have to tell me anymore. Stop, Noah, just stop. Because it hurt him to share this story. She could feel the pain vibrating through him.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t save my mother, either. I tried. So damn hard. I treaded water with her for hours, but when the Coast Guard finally found us...\u201d He wasn\u2019t holding her back. Just standing stiffly in her embrace. \u201cShe was dead.\u201d</p><p>In his arms.</p><p>Claire squeezed her eyes shut, but the image was there, burning brightly in her mind.</p><p>Sometimes, she forgot\u2014I\u2019m not the only one who has lost. Her own pain was so thick. It had blinded her. I should\u2019ve seen his pain sooner. Noah had been so busy helping her, but she\u2019d done nothing for him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take anyone else out on the water with me because I never want to be in that situation again.\u201d</p><p>Holding someone he loved and watching that person slip away?</p><p>\u201cI get sea sick,\u201d she lied, talking quickly and still holding him tightly. \u201cI hate being out on the water.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her back. Stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back inside,\u201d she said. Her voice was husky with tears that she wanted to shed, for him.</p><p>\u201cThe water reminds me of them,\u201d he told her. \u201cI hate it, and I love it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll never let it take anyone else from me again.\u201d</p><p>Was that why he had this place here? A place that was both haven and hell? A place he\u2019d brought her to? \u201cHow many...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cHow many other women have been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you, Claire. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Drake\u2019s words whispered through her mind. He doesn\u2019t keep them, you know...He sleeps with them, gets the lust out of his system, then he lets them go. He doesn\u2019t like to have the same lover twice in a row.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Claire asked him.</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly some romantic confession. She started to ease back from him.</p><p>But then he was holding tight to her. \u201cI just know that I need you close. Sometimes, I think if I can\u2019t see you, if I can\u2019t touch you\u2014\u201d He broke off, and his head jerked to the left.</p><p>His body tensed as he stared into the darkness.</p><p>Jeez, but she didn\u2019t want the guy to stop talking. \u201cNoah? What were you saying?\u201d Keep saying it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone.\u201d Then he pushed her back and ran toward the sand dunes.</p><p>Shocked, Claire stared after him for a few seconds before understanding kicked in\u2014it sure kicked in hard when she saw the dark shadow rise from the sand dunes and start running away.</p><p>Only Noah wasn\u2019t letting that shadow get far.</p><p>Claire raced after Noah. The sand flew beneath her feet.</p><p>Noah tackled the shadow. A man. They hit the sand with a thudding impact that she heard even over the waves. Then Noah spun the guy over. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Breath heaving, Claire rushed to his side.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d The guy shouted. He tried to swing at Noah.</p><p>A terrible mistake. The swing missed.</p><p>Noah\u2019s fist drove down. He didn\u2019t miss. He hit the man in the face. Once. Twice. Powerful blows that were brutal with their intensity.</p><p>\u201cTry again...\u201d Noah snarled. His fist was poised over the man\u2019s face. \u201cWho. Are. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cP-private investigator!\u201d Then, he snarled, \u201cShit, you broke my nose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to break a whole lot more than that,\u201d Noah told him. She\u2019d never heard Noah\u2019s voice sound that way. Lethal.</p><p>Deadly.</p><p>Chilling.</p><p>Claire tried to peer at the private investigator\u2019s face. She could see the round curve of his cheek. The high forehead. The thinning hair. The moonlight was strong as it shone down on them.</p><p>\u201cWho are you working for?\u201d Noah asked him. His hand was still poised to punch.</p><p>\u201cScrew off!\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s fist plunged down again.</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d Claire lunged forward. She grabbed his arm. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d The PI cried. There was a dark shadow streaking down his face. Blood. Definitely blood. \u201cI\u2019m going to sue your ass! This is assault!\u201d</p><p>Claire tried to drag Noah off the guy. He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cThis is private property, dumbass,\u201d Noah bit out. \u201cAnd you took the first swing.\u201d Then Noah shoved his hand into the guy\u2019s pockets.</p><p>\u201cWait, stop, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah rose, and he had what looked like a wallet in his hand. \u201cGuessing your ID is in here.\u201d</p><p>The man stumbled to his feet. He put his hand to his nose, obviously trying to stop that blood flow.</p><p>Claire stood there, her frantic breaths still shaking her chest, shocked by the violence that had erupted so suddenly.</p><p>\u201cHarrison sent you,\u201d Noah said flatly.</p><p>The guy\u2019s shoulders jerked.</p><p>\u201cThe senator\u2019s dead,\u201d Claire said. It didn\u2019t make sense that this guy would be here if he\u2019d been hired by Colby Harrison to\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot the senator.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was sharp. \u201cEthan. You were the one sending him the pictures of Claire, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Pictures? Her goosebumps got worse.</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t heard, Ethan Harrison is dead, too,\u201d Noah announced and it sounded like there was...satisfaction in those words.</p><p>The man backed up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and call your employer? You\u2019re going find out that your services aren\u2019t needed. No one\u2019s left to pay you.\u201d The waves crashed behind them. \u201cAnd after you do that, you need to get out of this area as fast as you can.\u201d He advanced on the guy.</p><p>The PI darted back.</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll give you one warning. Only one. If you ever come near Claire again, it will be the last mistake you make.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s sudden eruption of violence...the deadly intensity that clung to him...</p><p>It made Claire think too much of her past.</p><p>Ethan had erupted into violence so quickly. So often.</p><p>Noah isn\u2019t Ethan.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d Noah ordered.</p><p>\u201cGive me back my ID and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get anything back. I\u2019ll be turning this over to Weston Securities. They\u2019ll learn every detail I need to know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-there\u2019s no need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is, because if you don\u2019t stay away from me and Claire, I\u2019ll be the one lurking in the shadows near your door. And you\u2019ll see what it\u2019s like to be hunted.\u201d</p><p>The man turned then and he ran, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>Noah stared after him. One hand was clenched around the wallet he\u2019d taken. The other hand was fisted at his side.</p><p>The waves kept pounding against the shore.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know...about the pictures?\u201d Claire asked.</p><p>Noah glanced over his shoulder at her.</p><p>It felt as if someone had punched her. \u201cYou said Ethan had pictures of me. That he\u2019d been the one to hire that guy...how do you know all that, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He stalked toward her. Shoved the wallet into his back pocket.</p><p>She stood her ground when she wanted to flee.</p><p>Noah isn\u2019t Ethan.</p><p>She\u2019d never been afraid of Noah before.</p><p>She\u2019d also...never seen him attack a man before. One instant, he\u2019d been sharing his past with her.</p><p>The next...he\u2019d been punching a man with lethal fury.</p><p>Now he seemed so contained. So controlled.</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me,\u201d Claire said as she lifted her chin and forced her shoulders to stay straight. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Maybe he\u2019d just been guessing. Just been\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecause Ethan looked me in the eyes, and the bastard told me that he had someone watching you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing in her chest, pounding louder than those waves.</p><p>\u201cAnd I went to his cell. I saw the pictures that he had of you.\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. This wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him yesterday.\u201d Flat.</p><p>The day before Ethan died?</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d Fear was there now. Fear and enough dread to choke her. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Claire was afraid of him.</p><p>Sonofabitch. She wasn\u2019t supposed to fear him. He was the one who wanted to protect her. To help her.</p><p>But when Noah took a step toward Claire, she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>He could hear her fear.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d Claire asked again.Her voice was shaking.</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her. \u201cWhy does it even matter? You know you\u2019re glad that he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Claire spun from him then. She ran from him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to send her fleeing. \u201cClaire!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t slow down at his call. She just ran faster. Why? Because she thought that she was running from a killer?</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what I am.</p><p>No matter how many fancy suits he put on. No matter how many hotels he opened. No matter how many charity balls he hosted...Noah couldn\u2019t hide the truth.</p><p>At his core, he was a killer.</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019ll always be.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t letting Claire run away. Noah rushed after Claire. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>She was fast. He was faster. He grabbed her arm and spun her around to face him.</p><p>Claire hit him.</p><p>Noah hadn\u2019t expected Claire to drive her fist at him\u2014she had one hell of a hook\u2014and he let her go.</p><p>She didn\u2019t run then. She stood, staring up at him, her chest heaving, and the moonlight showed the horror on her face. \u201cNoah, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d She shook her head. Her hand fell to her side. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What are we doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe should go inside.\u201d He fought to keep his voice level, his control in place. If the PI came back, Noah didn\u2019t want the guy overhearing anything else that he and Claire said.</p><p>Claire glanced toward his beach house. The lights were on and glowing brightly. He stepped toward her.</p><p>Claire flinched.</p> <p>He held up his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside and talk.\u201d Claire was at the edge of her control. He could see it.</p><p>I did this to her.</p><p>He wanted to wrap her in his arms, but he couldn\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>Her head nodded jerkily, and she hurried to his house. He noticed she made sure to keep a careful distance between them. When they were inside, he secured the door.</p><p>\u201cIt all seemed so perfect before,\u201d she murmured, her eyes on the table in the kitchen. On the plates that were still there. Their half-made dinner waited steps away. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t get perfect, though. I should\u2019ve known that.\u201d</p> <p>Hell, no, he wasn\u2019t perfect. He never would be.</p><p>Claire squared her shoulders. \u201cThere was no trip to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d Pain whispered through her words. \u201cI thought I could trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lifted to meet his. \u201cYou went down to Alabama.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cTrace got me in to see Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan.\u201d Her whisper was stark.</p><p>He forced himself to take a long, deep breath. That breath didn\u2019t calm him worth a damn. \u201cThe senator was dead, but I needed to make sure that Ethan understood exactly where he stood with you. With us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. \u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t set the bomb in that car.\u201d He could say that with absolute honesty.</p><p>After a tense moment, her eyes opened. Her confused gaze was on him. \u201cI\u2019m just a woman you had sex with. Drake says there are plenty of us.\u201d</p><p>There was only one Claire.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you go all the way down there? Why would you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He had to touch her. Noah wrapped his arms around her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not like anyone else. You never could be.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI went down there because I needed to see him. He\u2019s the bastard who ruined your life. The one who put the fear and the shadows in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>When her eyes widened, he nodded grimly. \u201cYeah, baby, it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s always there. You look out at the world as if you\u2019re just waiting for people to strike out at you. You\u2019re beautiful...and you\u2019re scared, so scared. He did that to you.\u201d His hands slid down her arms. Down, down to her wrists. His fingers curled over the scars. \u201cHe did that,\u201d Noah repeated.</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d Claire fired back, her words surprisingly strong. \u201cI let him into my life. I\u2019m the one who picked up the razor, I\u2019m the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d His fury erupted.</p><p>Claire tried to pull away. He wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sick, twisted freak. He locked onto you, and he was going to do anything and everything in order to keep you with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in jail,\u201d Claire said with a shake of her head. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had photos of you all over his cell.\u201d He hadn\u2019t intended to tell her, and if that asshole PI hadn\u2019t shown up...She never would have known. \u201cHe was as obsessed with you as ever. He had plans, Claire.\u201d Plans that won\u2019t ever happen. \u201cHe was counting down the days until he would be free, and then he would\u2019ve come for you again.\u201d Noah knew that Ethan would have killed her.</p><p>His fingers were caressing the skin along her wrists. Claire wasn\u2019t speaking. She was so stiff and still.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let Ethan hurt you. I went down there to tell him, to let him know that you weren\u2019t alone. If he came after you...he\u2019d find me in his path, and I would kill him then.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. \u201cHow can you talk about taking someone\u2019s life so easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Ethan Harrison wasn\u2019t a man. He was a monster that needed to be put down.\u201d</p><p>She tugged against his hold.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, Claire.\u201d But he would\u2019ve. And maybe that was what she feared the most. What he was capable of doing. Noah let her go. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him, but that\u2019s just because someone else beat me to the punch. If he\u2019d come after you, if he\u2019d tried to hurt you...\u201d It was better for her to see him exactly as he was. No lies. No masks. \u201cI would have killed him in an instant.\u201d</p><p>She stood before him. Her eyes too wide. Her face too pale. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be like him.\u201d</p><p>Fury poured through his blood. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he had a darkness inside, I knew it from the very beginning, but I wanted him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a darkness, too. I can feel it. I want you, Noah, more than I\u2019ve wanted anyone, but you scare me, too.\u201d Her hand raked through her hair.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But she\u2019d wanted him despite her fear.</p><p>And he just\u2014wanted her.</p><p>\u201cMore than that...\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019m scared of the way I feel with you. Like the control I have, the life I\u2019ve got...I could lose it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you lose anything.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t she see that he wanted to protect her? To help her? \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Noah said again. \u201cBut I would kill to keep you safe.\u201d He backed away from her. \u201cI want you. And you need to decide...you have to decide, if you want me, too.\u201d The rest had to be said so he forced himself to add, \u201cYou have to decide if you want me more than you fear me.\u201d Noah took another step back.</p><p>Claire wrapped her arms around her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you do decide, you come find me.\u201d</p><p>Then, before he gave into the primal urge to touch her, to take her, to make her see what they had...Noah turned away from Claire. He went upstairs to his bedroom. The rage he felt had his hands shaking.</p><p>Claire shouldn\u2019t have learned about his trip to Alabama. He\u2019d screwed up. He\u2019d be more careful next time.</p><p>He yanked out the wallet he\u2019d taken from the PI. Scanned the information inside. And, two minutes later, Noah had Trace on the phone. \u201cAre your agents still working the break-in at the Hamlet?\u201d Noah demanded when Trace came on the line. Claire\u2019s stay at the Hamlet...it seemed so far away, but it had just been days ago when he\u2019d discovered her trashed room.</p><p>\u201cAnother middle of the night call...\u201d Trace growled. \u201cShit, man, keep normal hours and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan Harrison is dead.\u201d</p><p>That shut Trace up.</p><p>\u201cThe car he was in exploded today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure he was in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake was there. He\u2019s the one who confirmed the kill.\u201d</p><p>The faint sound of rustling and then the click of a door eased over the line. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Trace demanded. \u201cFirst the senator, and now the bastard Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. I want you to find out.\u201d Trace had a slew of agents at his beck and call. \u201cStart your hunt with a private investigator, a man named Sloan Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why should I start with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Harrisons were paying him to watch Claire, and the SOB was just here at my place in the Hamptons. If I see him again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Trace said. Silence stretched over the line, then Trace cleared his throat. \u201cNoah, you don\u2019t sound quite like yourself.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced down. There was a faint tremor in his fingers. \u201cDid Skye ever look at you as if you were the monster she should fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, look, Claire\u2019s been through a lot and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a no, right? Because the woman you want isn\u2019t supposed to look at you that way. She isn\u2019t supposed to be afraid of you.\u201d His left hand fisted.</p><p>\u201cSkye isn\u2019t Claire. After what she\u2019s been through, Claire has to be afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her afraid of me.\u201d But he knew that people didn\u2019t always get what they wanted. Especially...</p><p>When she has a reason to be afraid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking over this case,\u201d Trace told him. \u201cI\u2019m coming in personally to handle it. Not just my agents. Me. I\u2019ll be on the next flight to New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You stay with Skye, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in,\u201d Trace said again. \u201cI don\u2019t like this scene. First Senator Harrison, then his son? It reeks of a set-up. Kill the senator...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to get a shot at the son.\u201d Noah had thought the same thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d Trace sighed. \u201cAnd an attack against Ethan Harrison isn\u2019t personal without it being connected to Claire Kramer.\u201d</p><p>That was what Noah feared.</p><p>\u201cYou need to keep her close.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice had hardened. \u201cDammit, man, I owe her, too, and I don\u2019t want anything happening to Claire\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind Noah. He turned.</p><p>Claire was there, standing on the threshold of the room.</p><p>\u201cNothing will,\u201d he swore.</p><p>Nothing...but what she wanted to happen.</p><p>Sloan Hall swiped at the blood that kept gushing from his nose. He\u2019d never expected Noah York to come after him like that. Suits weren\u2019t supposed to attack.</p><p>They were supposed to run.</p><p>He yanked out his phone. His bloody fingers smeared across the screen as he dialed his client.</p><p>Ethan Harrison is dead?</p><p>Shit, this couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>But...Ethan wasn\u2019t the one who paid his bills.</p><p>The phone was answered on the second ring. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d</p><p>Sloan recognized the boss\u2019s voice immediately.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I hear that\u2019s because your brother\u2019s dead,\u201d Sloan said, words coming fast because he was afraid the guy was about to hang up.</p><p>Austin Harrison had never seemed to care much for him. Austin had paid him, but only because he\u2019d been ordered to do so. The senator had run that family with a drunken fist.</p><p>\u201cWord travels fast...\u201d Austin murmured. \u201cI figured the news shows would run with the story. They always enjoyed my family\u2019s pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t the news.\u201d The blood wouldn\u2019t stop coming. \u201cIt was Noah York.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then... \u201cYou\u2019re still on the job?\u201d</p><p>If the job was Claire Kramer... \u201cNot anymore. As of twenty minutes ago, I\u2019m done, got it? The bastard attacked me!\u201d He put his left hand to his nose. That shit hurt. He might have to go see a doc.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe freaking Hamptons, and guess what? I hate the place. Claire\u2019s screwing her rich psycho, he\u2019s muttering about his parents dying on a boat, and I\u2019m just wondering how much you\u2019re gonna be paying me for my pain and suffering.\u201d Make this work. Salvage something, Sloan. \u201cBecause if I have to do it, I\u2019ll go to the media. I\u2019ll let them know just how messed up the Harrison family became. Stalking that woman, getting all those pictures...day and night.\u201d</p><p>There was a murmur of voices in the background. What was happening? It sounded as if Austin had a dozen people around him.</p><p>Sloan\u2019s hold on the phone tightened. Had Austin just said, \u201cdetective\u201d just then? Hell, had he already been replaced?</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Austin told him. The guy sounded way too curt.</p><p>\u201cWhat you have to do is deal with me!\u201d Sloan was getting desperate. And his nose kept throbbing and bleeding.</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll see you, very soon.\u201d</p><p>The bastard hung up on him.</p><p>Sloan glared down at the phone. \u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d he snarled. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t been paid enough for this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison?\u201d Gwen Lazlo said as she cocked her head and waited for the guy to end his phone call. \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate a few minutes of your time.\u201d</p><p>Austin Harrison slowly turned toward her. There was no grief on his face. If anything, she\u2019d say the guy showed signs of...relief.</p><p>His gaze\u2014a glittering green\u2014drifted over her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Detective Lazlo. For a man like me, business doesn\u2019t seem to stop, not even for death.\u201d</p><p>She barely controlled an eye roll. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have jurisdiction down here but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d His stare drifted behind her. They were in his house. Some fancy southern mansion with too many white columns, and people were milling all over the place. \u201cI believe Sheriff Brady will be in charge of the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn charge of the investigation into your brother\u2019s death, yes,\u201d Gwen said, her voice sharp. And that investigation is going to take forever. Nothing was left of that car, those two poor cops, or of Ethan Harrison. \u201cBut I\u2019m still lead on your father\u2019s case, and I have a few questions that I must ask you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cMy father...\u201d His laugh was rough. \u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it? I almost forgot about him. I just\u2014I keep seeing the flames. Ethan was trying to talk to me, I wanted to get away from him, and then...he was just gone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always sucked at dealing with grieving families. This guy wasn\u2019t exactly grieving, though. She wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure what he was. \u201cDid your father have any enemies?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlenty of them.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cHe was an asshole.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d heard, but Gwen pressed on with her questions. \u201cAny enemies that might want him dead? That might want him and Ethan dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan was in jail. He couldn\u2019t hurt anyone in jail.\u201d His hand dropped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a good brother.\u201d</p> <p>This was not helping her investigation. \u201cI need names. I need to know who would want your father to die like that\u2014a shot to the head and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire Kramer.\u201d Her name was a sigh from Austin. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who\u2019d want him dead. Who\u2019d want them both dead, but Claire doesn\u2019t have the power to pull off something like this.\u201d</p><p>Gwen wasn\u2019t so certain of that. Claire\u2019s new lover has plenty of power. \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke with Claire?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken with her, not in years, but I know what they did.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cI know what they both did to Claire, and if anyone would\u2019ve wanted to see my father and my brother rotting, it would be her.\u201d</p><p>Her knees were shaking. Her stomach seemed to be tied in knots, and Claire was absolutely determined not to let Noah see her fear.</p> <p>He tossed aside the phone that he\u2019d held. His golden gaze locked on her.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid of you,\u201d Claire told him because she thought the words needed to be said.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cTell me something I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>A spark of anger ignited within her. \u201cHow can I not be afraid? You attacked that PI. You\u2014you told me that you\u2019d kill Ethan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you hadn\u2019t thought about killing him yourself? Come on, Claire. It\u2019s just us. I won\u2019t judge you for the darkness inside you.\u201d</p><p>The darkness inside you. So he did see it. She\u2019d wondered about that. Keeping her eyes on his, Claire admitted, \u201cOnly every day.\u201d</p> <p>His head cocked as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cBut if I killed Ethan, then wouldn\u2019t I become just like him?\u201d And that was the root of Claire\u2019s terror. Ethan had been so drawn to her because he\u2019d said they were the same. Mirror images, deep inside. She didn\u2019t want to be the same as Ethan.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to kill. To destroy.</p><p>Claire never wanted to become so obsessed with one person that she let everything else slip away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite read Noah\u2019s expression. Claire took a tentative step forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between love and obsession?\u201d That one question had haunted her for so long.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in love, Noah?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, but Claire laughed, realizing what she\u2019d just foolishly asked. \u201cOf course, you haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the man with a new lover every night. You don\u2019t want to love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove leads to pain,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Claire nodded. \u201cI was told once that you were in love when you needed someone so much that you couldn\u2019t bear to think of the world without that person, that you couldn\u2019t live without that person being near.\u201d She wet her too-dry lips. \u201cI think that\u2019s obsession. A need that dominates you. Consumes you. A need for one other person. A need that makes you do...anything...to possess that person.\u201d</p><p>He was as still as a statue before her.</p><p>\u201cEthan thought he loved me, but I don\u2019t believe Ethan could love.\u201d Time to confess all. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can love, either.\u201d She\u2019d just been getting by, in a void, for so long. Watching the world. Hiding from herself.</p><p>From everyone.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can love?\u201d Claire asked him.</p><p>His eyes glittered. \u201cDo you want me to say that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Because she wouldn\u2019t believe him if he did. \u201cYou don\u2019t. You want to fuck me. I think you want to protect me, because you and Trace\u2014\u201d The slightly bitter laughter slipped from her again. \u201cYou both hold yourselves responsible for Sara\u2019s death. You\u2019re trying to make amends somehow to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to protect you.\u201d</p><p>But you don\u2019t love me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking if you can love, Noah.\u201d And it was so important to her. \u201cLove or obsession...what is life about to you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid from hers. \u201cI think there\u2019s a thin line between love and obsession.\u201d</p><p>Her breath whispered out.</p><p>\u201cI already feel obsessed with you,\u201d he said, his voice gravel-rough, \u201cbut you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever hurt you,\u201d Noah told her. The words were stark. \u201cI need you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>Not her. She didn\u2019t think he would physically hurt her, but what about someone else? She\u2019d been so wrong about a lover before. Trusting Noah completely seemed an impossible task.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like Ethan Harrison. Anything that happens between you and me...it happens because it is what you want to happen. It\u2019s about what you need.\u201d</p><p>She needed him. She needed to feel like any other woman. \u201cI didn\u2019t date again after Ethan. Didn\u2019t go to prom or any parties in college. I stayed as far away from men as I could get.\u201d She was trying to explain, and Claire was afraid he just wouldn\u2019t understand her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m feeling for you is normal and\u2014\u201d Right. She swallowed and finished, \u201cOr if it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Claire had whispered like the shameful secret it was.</p><p>Her eyes lowered. She was staring at the lush carpet, and she saw his legs moving toward her.</p><p>\u201cEthan told me that I was just like him. That I consumed him. And at first, I felt like he consumed me, too.\u201d There was so much pain in those memories. \u201cI feel the same way with you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid under her chin. He forced her head to lift, but her gaze darted over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Slowly, afraid to see his gaze, afraid of what would be in his gaze, she did.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel when you\u2019re with me? Tell me...exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to let go.\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between his brows.</p><p>\u201cI want to stop playing it safe. I want to not care what happens beyond the pleasure that you can give me and the pleasure I can give you.\u201d</p><p>That furrow smoothed away. His eyes heated.</p><p>\u201cI want to let go,\u201d she said again as their eyes held. \u201cI want to burn instead of always being cold. I want to claw your back. I want to buck against your hips. I want to scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that simple. \u201cI have no control. I lose myself when we\u2019re together, and I-I just want more and more.\u201d More of his heat. More of the pleasure. More of the pretense that she wasn\u2019t broken beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cAsk, Claire,\u201d he growled out that command.</p><p>\u201cCan any obsession be healthy?\u201d Because she felt obsessed with him. \u201cDo they all have to end in fear and darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not him.\u201d</p><p>He and Ethan looked different. Night and day. But that same, dark intensity was there, just beneath the skin.</p><p>Only Noah isn\u2019t twisted.</p><p>His eyes blazed right through her. Saw right through her.</p><p>In that moment, Claire thought she could see through him, too. Past the veneer of the polished businessman. Right to his core. Darkness and light, all tangled together. Not perfect. Not evil. Not good.</p><p>\u201cAsk,\u201d he whispered. His expression was stark.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you again,\u201d she said. Maybe it was just for tonight. Maybe what they had together would last longer. But she wasn\u2019t going to think of a future then.</p><p>She refused to think of the past.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me?\u201d No, no, that was wrong. It wasn\u2019t about love. Obsession wasn\u2019t love. She was sure of that. She got obsession. She didn\u2019t get love.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. Kissed her deep and hard, and the chill slid from her skin. The hands that had been so brutal on the PI were gentle against her. There was so much power in his body, but he kept it ruthlessly restrained when he was with her.</p><p>He kept his control.</p><p>For me?</p><p>His hands slid over her back. Caressing. Seeming to scorch her through the t-shirt. Then he yanked that t-shirt up. He tossed it across the room. Her bra followed it.</p><p>Her breasts were so sensitive they ached. The nipples were tight and flushed. Noah lifted her up, and he took one nipple into his mouth.</p><p>She felt arousal flood her sex. His strength was such a turn-on. That much power, leashed.</p><p>Controlled. In that moment, Claire realized that she didn\u2019t need control. Noah had it.</p><p>And she had him.</p><p>He carried her toward the bed. That big, sprawling bed that was perfect for sex. A sturdy, wrought-iron bed. He hadn\u2019t taken another lover there. He\u2019d told her she was the only one to come to this place.</p><p>He put her on the bed. Pulled away her jeans and underwear. \u201cI could devour you,\u201d he said as his gaze slid down her body. The gold of his eyes turned molten when he stared at the juncture between her legs.</p><p>His hands went to the snap of his jeans.</p><p>Claire rose then, pushing up quickly. \u201cI need to taste you.\u201d Her fingers tangled with his. \u201cI want to.\u201d He was all about her asking so she did. \u201cCan I taste you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire...\u201d There was a sensual warning in her name.</p><p>That warning just aroused her more. \u201cI\u2019ve never...\u201d Her fingers pulled from his. Her knees sank into the mattress. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this, and I want to taste you. I want you to be the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only.\u201d His voice had deepened and hardened with possession.</p><p>Claire eased down his zipper. The hiss seemed so loud in the silence of the room.</p><p>He put his hands behind his back. \u201cTake me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her heart pounded in a double-time rhythm. Excitement and nervousness both surged through her as she slid off the bed. Her knees brushed over the carpet as she knelt before him.</p><p>His aroused flesh sprang toward her. Long and full. Hard and hot. She stroked him at first, her touch tentative. She wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d like, and this was important\u2014giving him as much pleasure as he\u2019d given her was vitally important.</p><p>His hands were still behind his back.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t touching her. She was the one touching. The one with power?</p><p>Claire leaned forward. Her lips skimmed over his erection, and his cock jerked beneath her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTake me in...\u201d Noah growled out the sensual command.</p><p>Claire\u2019s lips parted. She took the head of his cock into her mouth. She licked. Sucked. Savored. Slowly, still so hesitant, she began to move. To take more. To find a rhythm that had him groaning.</p><p>And had her arousal deepening.</p><p>She liked the way he tasted. Liked the way he hardened impossibly more beneath her mouth and she\u2014</p><p>Claire was on her back in the bed.</p><p>Noah was over her. He had her wrists pinned to the bed. Damn but that man had moved fast.</p><p>He stared at her, locked his gaze with her\u2014and took her. He filled her, every inch, and she gasped as the pleasure surged through her.</p><p>Her legs curled around his. She arched up against him.</p><p>He plunged. Fast. Hard. Deep.</p><p>Claire wanted to match his rhythm, but...he felt so good. Every thrust sent his cock gliding right over her clit, and the sensation was incredible. Powerful and hot.</p><p>His grip tightened around her wrists. \u201cI can feel you...feel everything...\u201d Noah groaned the words. \u201cShould stop...tell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>No, she never wanted him to stop. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He thrust even harder. Deeper.</p><p>She could feel all of him.</p><p>All.</p><p>Noah was trying to pull away.</p><p>No condom.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to lose him. Didn\u2019t want to lose that moment. \u201cI\u2019m clean,\u201d she whispered. No diseases. No lovers, not until him.</p><p>\u201cSo...am I.\u201d Noah thrust again.</p><p>Claire was lost. She shattered beneath him as the pleasure slammed through her. Not some gentle wave. An avalanche that stole her breath and had her quaking.</p><p>And Noah was there. He thrust into her once more, the hot surge of his climax filling her, and her legs locked tightly around his hips. She held him as fiercely as she could.</p><p>In that moment, Claire realized that she\u2019d crossed a line. For her, there\u2019d be no going back.</p><p>She\u2019d lived in the darkness for years, and now, finally, she could see the light.</p><p>Gwen Lazlo was bone-tired when she shoved open the door to her apartment and dropped her bag on the floor. Her flight had landed in D.C. less than an hour ago, and the sun still hadn\u2019t risen above the sky.</p><p>She stumbled forward in the darkness. She wanted to crash in bed. Bed was the goal. Bed was\u2014</p><p>Warm hands slid around her stomach and she was pulled back against a rock-hard chest.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned,\u201d Lane\u2019s voice rumbled in her ear, \u201chow much I hate it when you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>Her body melted against his. \u201cMaybe a time or two.\u201d She turned in his arms. The lights were still off, and she liked that. In the dark, he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell how happy she was to see him.</p><p>When did I get so attached? Gwen made it a habit not to get too close to anyone or anything, but Lane had snuck right past her defenses. \u201cLet yourself in again, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have seriously got to change those locks.\u201d His lips brushed over her neck. \u201cAnyone could get in here.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. That was Lane. He could always make her smile, even after her last hellish twenty-four hours. Her fingers curled around his shoulders. \u201cTell me that you made some headway on our case.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm, not a damn bit.\u201d He kissed her neck. \u201cNo one saw anything else at the senator\u2019s hotel, and the car from the hit and run turned out to be stolen. It was wiped clean, no prints.\u201d His mouth lifted from her skin.</p><p>Her breath rushed out. She wanted that mouth back on her.</p><p>\u201cBut at least I wasn\u2019t ten feet away from a car explosion.\u201d Now his words roughened. \u201cDo you know how much that shit scared me when I found out what happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a targeted attack.\u201d Her fingers tightened on his shoulders. \u201cJust aimed at taking out Ethan Harrison.\u201d And the two poor cops who\u2019d been with him.</p><p>Lane grunted. \u201cWe know how easy it is for innocents to get caught in the crossfire.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d seen that too many times.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s cleaning house,\u201d Lane mused.</p><p>She nodded, then realized he couldn\u2019t see the move. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s York? Because if it is...it\u2019s gonna be real hard pinning anything on him.\u201d</p><p>Because he was such a power player. But power players didn\u2019t intimidate her. Never had. Never would. \u201cIf it\u2019s him, we\u2019ll nail him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d He lifted her into his arms, surprising her with his strength the way he always did\u2014the way she loved. \u201cBut let\u2019s leave the killers alone for a while. Right now, I need you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth pressed to hers.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached at his words. She\u2019d seen so many people killed in crimes of passion. Seen others nearly driven to the breaking point of sanity because they\u2019d lost someone close.</p> <p>But Gwen had never understood those powerful emotions, not until Lane.</p><p>Now she knew all too well how emotions could twist a person. They could blind you to a lover\u2019s faults. Make you desperate to do anything to protect your lover.</p><p>Even make you kill.</p><p>Is that what you did, Noah York? Did you kill for a lover?</p><p>Lane kissed Gwen again.</p><p>And she knew the stark truth...I\u2019d kill for him.</p><p>Noah dreamed of death. Of a field covered in snow, and of the blood that stained that snow.</p><p>He dreamed of Claire. Claire with her deep, blue eyes and her blonde hair.</p> <p>He tried to get to Claire. But she lifted her hands toward him, and blood dripped from her wrists.</p><p>\u201cYou did this,\u201d she whispered as tears slid down her cheeks. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. He wouldn\u2019t hurt Claire. Not ever. Things were going to be different with her. So different from the way they\u2019d been before.</p><p>\u201cYou killed me,\u201d she told him as the blood dripped from her wrists. She was standing in the middle of the snow, and her blood dripped down from her wounds, falling slowly.</p><p>Then Claire fell, and Noah was too far away to catch her.</p><p>Noah jerked awake, his heart racing. Claire was by his side. She was breathing softly as she kept sleeping.</p><p>He ran a shaking hand over his face. He often dreamed of that damn, snow-covered field. He\u2019d lost a friend on that field. Barely managed to get another away from the carnage.</p><p>But Claire...</p><p>You killed me.</p><p>He turned to look down at her. Her hand was near her face, positioned loosely on her pillow. Her hand rested, palm up, and with the early morning sunlight filtering through the window, he could see the scar on her wrist.</p><p>Noah swallowed and tried to shove the images from his mind. He wasn\u2019t going to hurt Claire. He wanted to protect her.</p><p>Protecting Claire helped him to atone for the sins of his past.</p><p>And...</p><p>I just want her safe.</p><p>He bent his head and pressed a kiss to the scar along her wrist.</p><p>I will keep you safe. No matter what.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about it,\u201d Noah said carefully. He\u2019d been hesitant to broach this subject before, but they were nearly back in the city, and he had to man up and face facts.</p><p>I lost control with her.</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d Claire echoed. He could feel her stare on him, but Noah kept looking at the road. \u201cWhat is \u2018it\u2019 exactly?\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched. \u201cNo protection,\u201d Noah gritted out. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t use a condom last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped to her. The woman sure didn\u2019t sound concerned.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was safe,\u201d Claire told him with a shrug. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anyone for me in years.\u201d</p><p>And he never went without protection. Well, he hadn\u2019t. Until her. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the risk of pregnancy, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I do. I was the guy fucking you last night.\u201d He forced his gaze back to the road. \u201cSo if you get pregnant, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d Claire said again, cutting through his words before he\u2019d been able to finish his sentence. And that finish would\u2019ve included...</p><p>We\u2019ll get married.</p><p>The idea had come to him as he\u2019d stood on the balcony, watching the sun rise. After his nightmare, sleep had been an impossibility. He\u2019d had plenty of time with his thoughts.</p><p>His thoughts had focused on her.</p><p>\u201cAre you on the pill? Some sort of contraception\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d Her voice was totally devoid of emotion. \u201cI can\u2019t have kids, okay? So, again, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened around the wheel as his knuckles whitened. \u201cYou can\u2019t have kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I...I was pregnant before.\u201d</p><p>He slammed on the brakes. Car horns behind him blared. \u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d been pregnant with Ethan Harrison\u2019s baby? That hadn\u2019t been in the reports he\u2019d read.</p><p>Claire glanced at him. Her cheeks had paled. \u201cThat part didn\u2019t make the papers.\u201d</p><p>Or my reports.</p><p>The cars kept honking.</p><p>Noah started driving again. \u201cNo, it sure as shit didn\u2019t make them.\u201d His guts were twisted into knots. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnancy was one of the reasons my parents sent me away to my grandfather\u2019s fishing cabin. I\u2019d found out I was pregnant, and I was trying to figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>His heartbeat thundered in his ears.</p><p>\u201cThen Ethan killed my parents. He nearly killed me, and I-I lost the baby after that. It was...the doctors said it was a tubal pregnancy. The baby died, and they saved me.\u201d Her breath rushed out. \u201cAnd that was when I started to think that I shouldn\u2019t have been saved.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said it would be unlikely that I could conceive again. They told me that I\u2019d been lucky to have the first pregnancy...Lucky,\u201d she whispered and her voice rasped with pain. \u201cHow was I lucky if I\u2019d lost the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire...\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI left the hospital as soon as I could. Sara knew, she always knew. The doctors had said that there was some surgery that could be done to increase my chances of conceiving again, but we didn\u2019t have money for that. We were barely surviving back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you any damn doctor you want.\u201d If there was a way for Claire to have a baby, if she\u2014</p><p>\u201cI lost one fallopian tube with that pregnancy. They said the other...it wasn\u2019t functioning the way it should. That\u2019s why my pregnancy chances were unlikely. Surgery might be able to help me, or it might not.\u201d Her fingers tapped against the window. \u201cBack then, I figured it didn\u2019t matter. I wasn\u2019t planning to get close enough to another man to have his child.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re close to me.</p><p>Her voice husky, Claire continued, \u201cThey told me the surgery might not work, anyway. That there was only a twenty percent chance of success.\u201d</p><p>But I can get you any doctor. The best in the world.</p><p>\u201cI figured if I ever wanted kids, I could adopt them. There are plenty of kids out there that need homes. I could love a child just the same if he came from my body or if he didn\u2019t. Blood doesn\u2019t make family.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stopped at a red light. Noah had to look at her again. His mother had told him something similar to that, when he\u2019d first learned that he was adopted.</p><p>You\u2019re mine, Noah. Blood doesn\u2019t make you more or less my son.</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>His breath rushed out. \u201cBlood doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She looked relieved that he\u2019d agreed with her.</p><p>\u201cHell, I know that more than anyone else.\u201d The light changed. He had to glance toward the road once again.</p><p>There was silence in the car. Then Claire asked, \u201cDo you want kids, Noah?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never thought about them, not until he\u2019d stood on that balcony this morning. Then he\u2019d imagined a little girl. He hadn\u2019t seen that little girl clearly in his mind. He\u2019d just had an image of Claire, smiling that full smile of hers\u2014the one that flashed her dimples\u2014as she bent to hug the child. \u201cMaybe I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I hope you have them,\u201d she told him, and she cleared her throat. When she spoke again, her voice was stronger as she said, \u201cI hope you get everything that you want.\u201d</p><p>They eased into the valet line in front of his hotel. As the valet rushed toward them, Noah offered Claire a smile. \u201cI fully intend to do just that.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re what I want.</p><p>Someone was pounding at his door.</p><p>Sloan Hall groaned as he cracked open one eye. He\u2019d been at the hospital last night\u2014damn broken nose\u2014then he\u2019d gone out to drink his sorrows away.</p><p>Maybe mixing pain pills and booze hadn\u2019t been his best idea.</p><p>But it had sure felt good at the time.</p><p>Sunlight poured through the cheap blinds by his window. The light hurt his eyes and he swore as he headed toward the pounding.</p><p>Someone was being a dick.</p><p>He yanked open the door. \u201cWhat the hell do you\u2014\u201d Sloan broke off when he got a look at the person on the other side of the door. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>His guest stepped forward.</p><p>Sloan hurried back.</p><p>And he started wishing that he hadn\u2019t had quite so many glasses of whiskey.</p><p>His guest shut the door. Then the guy\u2019s hand reached under the long, dark coat that he wore.</p><p>Fuck me, a gun!</p><p>Sloan tensed. His gaze locked on the weapon and the silencer attached to the end of it.</p><p>\u201cNo, man, no!\u201d Sloan\u2019s voice was frantic. His own weapon was shoved under the sagging mattress a few feet away. If he moved fast enough, maybe he\u2019d be able to grab it. \u201cI-I was doing my job!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour services aren\u2019t needed any longer.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s going to kill me.</p><p>Sloan spun away, rushing for the bed. He\u2019d go out fighting or he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>The bullet tore into the back of his head. It felt like someone had just swung a hammer into his head and then\u2014</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Sloan hit the floor.</p><p>Noah\u2019s phone rang just as he entered the elevator. He glanced down, but didn\u2019t recognize the number. \u201cYork,\u201d he said. His gaze was on Claire. They needed to talk more. He hated that he\u2019d brought up the possibility of a pregnancy to her because now Claire looked shaken.</p><p>She\u2019s lost too much.</p><p>He wanted to give her everything.</p><p>\u201cI know Claire Kramer\u2019s secrets.\u201d The voice was low, growling.</p><p>Noah frowned. \u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met last night. I had such a nice view of you and Claire.\u201d</p><p>Sloan. The guy\u2019s voice was so low that Noah had to strain in order to hear him.</p><p>The elevator rose.</p><p>\u201cLook, dumbass,\u201d Noah snarled. \u201cI thought I made myself clear when we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire killed the senator, and I have proof. I was watching her. Always watching. Come to meet me, or I\u2019ll go to the cops.\u201d Laughter. Rough. Taunting. \u201cI\u2019ll go to that pretty D.C. cop. She already thinks that Claire is guilty. It\u2019ll be so easy, and Claire will finally get just what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes had flared with alarm. \u201cNoah? Noah, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cWhere. When.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just bought a new building here in town, right? The old Claymire Hotel.\u201d</p><p>The building was completely empty right then. His crews would begin renovation work the next week.</p><p>\u201cMeet me there at three, or, by four, I\u2019ll be on my way to D.C.\u201d</p><p>The caller hung up.</p><p>The elevator\u2019s doors slid open.</p><p>Claire touched his arm. \u201cNoah, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, not there. He caught her hand and led her to his suite. When they were alone, when he was sure that no one could overhear, Noah said, \u201cI have to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d Claire shook her head as confusion flashed across her face. \u201cI\u2019ve always told you the truth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill the senator?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a lot of time. Protect her. He pulled her closer. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did that jerk PI just tell me that you did? He says that he has proof, Claire. Proof that can lock you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I was at the senator\u2019s hotel, but I didn\u2019t go in. I didn\u2019t see him.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cI told you this already. You believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know the truth.\u201d His eyes never left hers. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m facing, I can\u2019t cover our tracks well enough.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Understanding filled her eyes. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d She yanked away from him. \u201cAll this time...have you actually thought I killed him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHe was shot in the head! Just like my parents.\u201d She covered her mouth with her hand. Her gaze was stunned as it held his.</p><p>\u201cHe made your life hell. You wanting some revenge only seems natural.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand fell away from her mouth. \u201cKilling isn\u2019t natural for me. My parents were murdered. My sister was murdered. Violence has taken everyone from me.\u201d She gave a hard, negative shake of her head. \u201cTrust me. Believe in me. I didn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Then what the hell kind of game was Sloan trying to play? \u201cI want you to stay here. Don\u2019t leave the hotel until I get back.\u201d He turned for the door.</p><p>But Claire grabbed his arm. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe PI wants to meet me. Says if I don\u2019t come, he\u2019ll turn over the proof of your guilt to that D.C. cop, Gwen Lazlo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no proof,\u201d she whispered as her fingers tightened around him. \u201cHe\u2019s lying to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s about to realize I\u2019m not the kind of man you can jerk around.\u201d Bad mistake, Sloan. He tried to brush by her.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t ease her hold. \u201cIf you\u2019re going, then so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was definite. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my life we\u2019re talking about here! He\u2019s saying I\u2019m a killer. I get to face the guy!\u201d Her breath heaved out. Red stained her cheeks. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving me behind for this.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what he planned to do.</p><p>\u201cThe last time you saw Sloan, you attacked the guy,\u201d Claire reminded him. Not that Noah needed the reminder. \u201cMaybe this is some kind of payback plan he has. Get you alone, and then attack.\u201d</p> <p>Bring it, asshole.</p><p>Claire\u2019s stubborn chin notched up. \u201cI won\u2019t let you be hurt because you\u2019re trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Wait\u2014what?</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d Claire straightened her shoulders. \u201cSo either we both go, or you\u2019re going to have to tie me to a chair...because I will follow you.\u201d</p><p>This was the woman Drake had compared to a broken bird? Hell, no. There was so much more to Claire than just what met the eye.</p><p>\u201cMy life,\u201d Claire said again. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out. Noah, pl\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Deep and hard. I told her not to ever beg me.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth. He tasted her. He took.</p> <p>Claire\u2019s fierce response stunned him. Her tongue met his. Her kiss was as frantic and feverish as his own.</p><p>A perfect match.</p><p>Noah lifted his head. Their breath panted out.</p><p>\u201cTake me with you,\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>If I have to hurt the guy, I didn\u2019t want you seeing that. I don\u2019t want you seeing...me.</p><p>But maybe it was time that he stopped hiding the man that he really was from Claire. Maybe it was time for her to see him for what he truly was.</p><p>Would she run then?</p><p>Or would Claire prove to be stronger than the others?</p><p>Noah stared up at the old hotel. The building was boarded up, and his crew had put a large, chain-link fence around the property\u2019s perimeter.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see anyone, but that didn\u2019t mean Sloan Hall wasn\u2019t already inside, waiting for him.</p><p>Claire\u2019s shoulder brushed against his. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about getting back-up for the trip, but until he found out exactly what Sloan had to say, Noah hadn\u2019t wanted to involve anyone else.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t kill the senator.</p><p>He believed that, but he also knew just how easy it was to frame someone for a crime. He wouldn\u2019t let Claire be pulled into a legal nightmare.</p><p>\u201cThe plan is that I go in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Claire corrected crisply.</p><p>Right. \u201cWe go in,\u201d he allowed, \u201cand we find out what game this jerk is playing.\u201d</p><p>Cautiously, they approached the building. He saw that the wood near the entrance had been pried open. Are you inside, Sloan?</p><p>He climbed up the steps. Claire hurried with him.</p><p>Then his phone rang.</p><p>Noah hesitated. Sloan?</p><p>He yanked out the phone, but this time, he recognized the number of the screen. It was Trace Weston\u2019s personal line. \u201cNot a good time,\u201d he growled to his friend when he answered the call.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staring at a dead body,\u201d Trace told him. \u201cI just thought you might want to know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Claire was trying to peer into the darkness of the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI made it to New York about three hours ago.\u201d Trace\u2019s voice held a hard edge. \u201cMy agents and I came out to have a little talk with Sloan Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to have my own talk with him,\u201d Noah snapped. Dead body? What the hell?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be hard,\u201d Trace murmured. \u201cSeeing as how the guy is missing half his head.\u201d</p><p>All of the distant noise seemed to quiet right then. The car horns muted. The rush of traffic eased. Noah focused completely on Trace\u2019s voice. \u201cThe dead body? It\u2019s Sloan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in some flea-hole of a hotel. My agents tracked him. Seems the guy had to visit the hospital last night for a broken nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by the smell, at least a few damn hours.\u201d</p><p>Noah hadn\u2019t heard Sloan\u2019s voice clearly on the phone. The guy had been whispering. Trying to disguise his identity?</p><p>Claire was about to slip inside the small opening near the old door. \u201cNo!\u201d He grabbed for her arm.</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d Trace asked. \u201cWhat are you yelling about?\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t answer him. Every instinct he had was screaming at him.</p><p>This meeting wasn\u2019t about blackmail. It wasn\u2019t about Claire\u2019s innocence or guilt.</p><p>It was about them being lured to this hotel. To this empty, abandoned spot.</p><p>\u201cClaire, come on!\u201d But he didn\u2019t wait for her to come. Noah wrapped his arm around her stomach, and he lifted her up against him. He ran, nearly falling down those stairs.</p><p>Get away. Get away. Get\u2014</p><p>The explosion sent chunks of the old building spiraling into the air. The boards covering the windows shot out. Shards of glass rained down on Noah, and he tried to hunch his body over Claire\u2019s. But the blast had him flying through the air, too, and all he could do was hold her, as tightly as he could.</p><p>They hit the ground. Hard enough to rattle his bones. He felt blood sliding down his right arm, and a board slammed into his back.</p><p>Claire was beneath him. The flames from the explosion scorched his skin as he tried to keep covering her.</p><p>One explosion so far, but there could be more.</p><p>I have to get her out of here.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Claire,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cWe have to make a run for it.\u201d</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t respond. When he lifted her up, her head sagged back weakly. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed. Blood trickled down the side of her head.</p><p>No!</p><p>He lifted her up and ran then, as fast as he could toward the fence that circled the property. Another explosion had the ground trembling beneath his feet, but Noah didn\u2019t stop. He kept going. Kept holding her as tightly as he could.</p><p>Then he was free as he slid through the opening in the chain-link fence. He rushed across the street. Traffic had stopped. People were screaming, running, but he barely saw any of them. They were just smoke covered blurs to him.</p><p>He put Claire down on the sidewalk. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were still closed. He brushed back her hair. Blood was on his fingers, and it smeared across her cheek. But when he moved her hair, Noah saw the gash on her head. About an inch long, and already, the skin around that wound was turning a dark, bruised purple.</p><p>Sirens screamed in the distance. Help, coming in fast.</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d He put his hand to her throat. Her pulse was steady. He checked for other injuries but only saw the gash on her head.</p><p>Be okay, baby. Be okay.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t gone in the building.</p><p>They\u2019d been so close, but Noah had stopped just steps away from the entrance. He\u2019d gotten that phone call, and the guy had started to pull Claire back.</p><p>He\u2019d had to detonate then. There had been no choice.</p><p>A few steps. Noah had been so close to death.</p><p>But not as close as Claire.</p><p>As he watched, she was loaded into the back of an ambulance. Noah was with her. Standing so close. Jumping into the back of that emergency vehicle when she was pushed inside.</p><p>He\u2019d wondered just how close Claire and Noah truly were. Now he realized...</p><p>Claire has got to Noah, too.</p><p>She had a real talent for drawing in her lovers. Winding men around her finger. Batting those blue eyes and getting them to do anything for her.</p><p>Lie.</p><p>Steal.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>But Claire wasn\u2019t going to twist him. Her days of playing games\u2014those days were long over.</p><p>He\u2019d missed her and Noah this time.</p><p>Next time, they wouldn\u2019t escape. He\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>Claire felt like she\u2019d been hit by a truck. She opened her eyes slowly and winced at the pain. Her head throbbed and nausea rolled in her belly as the room before her came into focus\u2014</p><p>And then that nausea just got a whole lot worse.</p><p>\u201cA hospital,\u201d Claire whispered, surprised by the slightly hoarse sound of her own voice. \u201cNo, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She turned her head at that deep voice. Noah was beside her bed. His fingers had curled around her wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d ditched his coat. He wore a white shirt, one that had flecks of blood over the sleeves. Actually, one sleeve was cut nearly to the shoulder, and she could see the outline of a white bandage on his arm.</p><p>The shirt was also stained gray\u2014with soot? Ash?</p><p>\u201cThe hotel,\u201d Claire said as the memories pushed through her mind. \u201cIt caught on fire.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cTwo bombs were planted there.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat kicked up, and the machines near her bed began to beat even faster. \u201cThe PI tried to kill us?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. His face looked harder, the faint lines near his eyes deeper than before. \u201cSloan wasn\u2019t the one who set up that meeting.\u201d</p><p>The throbbing in her head got even worse. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was talking to Sloan, but it turns out that guy was already dead when I got that phone call to set up our meeting.\u201d</p><p>She jerked beneath his hold.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Noah murmured as his fingers kept stroking her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a concussion. You have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>The concussion would explain the jackhammer in her head. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d Her voice was stronger. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced away from her.</p><p>No, no, no\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe was shot in the head.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d She tried to climb from the bed.</p><p>Noah pushed her back. \u201cNo, stop it!\u201d He held her easily in the bed. \u201cI can\u2019t let you hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d The machines were still beeping too loudly and fear had her whole body tensing. \u201cThe shot to the head...just like the senator, just like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents,\u201d he finished grimly. His hands were around her shoulders now. He eased her back into the hospital bed. \u201cAnd the bomb...well, we both know a bomb just took out Ethan Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone wanted us to go out that way, too.\u201d Bombs didn\u2019t just kill. They obliterated. \u201cWhy? Why is someone after me?\u201d But then horror filled her. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Noah frowned down at her.</p><p>\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t the one called to that hotel. You were. You were the one who was\u2014\u201d Claire broke off, unable to say more.</p><p>You were the one who was going to die.</p><p>She tried to get out of the bed again.</p><p>He pushed her back against the pillow. \u201cClaire, stop it!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cI need to get away.\u201d She twisted beneath his hands. \u201cNo, you have to get away from me. It\u2019s happening again.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t letting her go. \u201cLeave, Noah, just leave!\u201d</p><p>Instead of leaving, he sat on the edge of the bed and pulled her into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>This time, she was. He was. What about next time? \u201cIt\u2019s because of me,\u201d Claire managed to say.</p><p>Noah eased back just enough to peer down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou almost died...because of me.\u201d Because he\u2019d gotten involved with her. He\u2019d helped her.</p><p>I won\u2019t let him suffer because of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of you.\u201d Intensity hardened each word. \u201cSome bastard out there is playing some sort of sick game.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAnd he\u2019s playing with the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a game. \u201cYou need to stay away from me.\u201d He had to see that.</p><p>Everyone close to me dies.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then I have to stay away from you.</p><p>The door opened behind Noah then, swinging in with a soft swoosh of sound. Noah glanced toward the door, but he didn\u2019t release Claire. Claire followed his gaze.</p><p>She instantly recognized the man who stood in the doorway. Tall, with broad shoulders, the guy had a handsome, but hard face and glittering blue eyes.</p><p>Trace Weston.He\u2019d been her sister\u2019s boss, and Sara had looked up to him so much.</p><p>Sara had also feared him.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d The soft, feminine voice came from the woman beside Trace\u2014his new wife, Skye. Skye hurried toward the bed. Her dark hair fell over her shoulders, and her pretty face reflected her concern. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, Claire was pretty sure she might shatter into a million pieces at any moment. \u201cSomeone tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>Noah slid from the bed.</p><p>Skye came closer. She started to touch Claire, then hesitated.</p> <p>She knows I don\u2019t like to be touched. Skye understood Claire far better than any other woman had. Maybe it was because Skye had been through her own nightmare. Stalked, kidnapped, starved...Skye had managed to survive, but the horrific nightmare had marked her.</p><p>We\u2019re both marked. On the skin, and deep within.</p><p>Skye\u2019s hand hesitantly curved over Claire\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. Trace has two men guarding your hospital room door, and he\u2019s going to keep a guard on you until we can figure out what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Claire glanced toward the doorway. Noah was leading Trace back out of the room. \u201cNoah?\u201d Claire called.</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be right outside.\u201d</p> <p>There was something...different...in his eyes. A wildness. A fury.</p><p>It scared her.</p><p>The door shut softly behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe nearly died,\u201d Noah snarled as soon as he was out of that hospital room.</p><p>The two guards near her door glanced at him with wide eyes.</p><p>He glared at them.</p> <p>Trace caught his shoulder and steered him toward the corner. \u201cShe didn\u2019t die. You got her out of there.\u201d</p><p>Noah yanked a hand through his hair. He couldn\u2019t cool the rage that burned him from the inside out. \u201cOnly because you called. If that phone had rung two minutes later, hell, even one minute later, we\u2019d both be dead.\u201d</p><p>Trace crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThen I guess it\u2019s a good thing you answered your old friend\u2019s call.\u201d</p><p>Noah surged toward him. \u201cI won\u2019t lose her.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s eyebrows flew up. \u201cShit, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Noah\u2019s hands fisted. He wasn\u2019t in the mood for any bull. Not even from Trace. \u201cMan, don\u2019t push me, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing your control right in front of me. This doesn\u2019t happen to the Noah York I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Well, it\u2019s happening. Claire was in my arms, and she wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d He swung away from the guy. He wanted to drive his fist into the nearest wall. He did. When a nurse shrieked, he snarled, \u201cI\u2019ll buy a new wing!\u201d</p> <p>Because he might be destroying this one.</p><p>Trace\u2019s hand settled on his shoulder once more. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Noah whirled back toward him. \u201cWhen that bastard had Skye, when you thought you\u2019d lose her...how did you stay sane?\u201d</p><p>Trace exhaled on a rough sigh. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p><p>It was worse. Noah felt like he was ripping apart. \u201cShe was bleeding. I couldn\u2019t get her to open her eyes.\u201d That image would never get out of his head. \u201cFire was lighting the sky, glass was raining down, and Claire was too still.\u201d</p><p>Trace took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let her go,\u201d Noah said. He couldn\u2019t. \u201cNo one is going to hurt her again. I\u2019ll make sure of it. I\u2019ll find the SOB. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what you say,\u201d Trace interjected, voice flat. A wave of his hand indicated the folks lurking close by.</p><p>Hell, half of the hospital seemed to be staring at them.</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t doing anything alone.\u201d Trace gave a grim nod. \u201cBecause you know I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since the funeral,\u201d Skye said carefully. She gave Claire a faint smile. \u201cAnd I was sure hoping when we met again, it would be under better circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Claire realized this hardly counted as \u201cbetter\u201d than anything. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she admitted. Confessing that truth to Skye wasn\u2019t hard. She\u2019d only met Skye a few times, but Claire had never felt as if Skye judged her.</p><p>She knows what it\u2019s like to be helpless.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Skye asked her.</p><p>\u201cHelp me to get away.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah could\u2019ve died because of me. They\u2019re all dying because of me. The senator, Ethan, Sloan Hall\u2014they were all tied to me.\u201d The senator who harassed her, the lover who nearly killed her, and the PI who stalked her. Their one common denominator\u2014it\u2019s me. \u201cNoah was the one who was supposed to go into that old hotel. He was the one being set up to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will you leaving help him?\u201d Skye shook her head. \u201cIt won\u2019t. It will just drive the guy crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it will take a target off his back.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s breath caught. \u201cAnd do what? Put that target straight on you?\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Claire was sitting up on the bed now. She really wanted to make a run for it. \u201cIf I leave, if I change cities, then, yes, perhaps this guy will come after me and leave Noah alone.\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between Skye\u2019s brows. \u201cJust how hard did you hit your head, Claire? Because I\u2019ve got to say, that sounds like a real piss-poor idea to me.\u201d</p><p>Claire blinked at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNoah isn\u2019t just going to let you walk away. I saw the way he looked at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sex.\u201d The words sounded hollow. \u201cNoah trades up his lovers all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And how long have you been his lover?\u201d</p><p>Just a few short days. Not long enough for him to really care, and certainly not long enough for him to put his life on the line for her.</p><p>\u201cClaire, I can\u2019t help you run. That would just be putting you in danger.\u201d</p><p>Then she\u2019d have to do it on her own. \u201cYou felt this way, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Claire asked her.</p><p>Skye stared at her with a troubled gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou knew someone was out there, and you just wanted to get away.\u201d</p><p>Skye\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cTrace has the best security firm in the U.S. He\u2019s got agents working on this case now. He\u2019s going to find the person doing this. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>But how long would it take? And would the man hunting out there, killing out there, have a chance to strike again?</p><p>I lose everyone...I can\u2019t lose Noah, too.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to sleep,\u201d Noah told Claire as he leveled a firm stare her way. \u201cNot for a few more hours.\u201d</p><p>So the doctors had said. They\u2019d agreed to release her, as long as Noah made sure that Claire wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t plan to leave her side any time soon.</p><p>They were back in his suite. Claire was wearing a pair of yoga pants and a loose top. There was a small bandage on the side of her head. The doctors had stitched her up, but the wound was right on her hair-line, so no one would even be able to see it once she was healed.</p><p>Heal fast, baby.</p><p>\u201cSince I don\u2019t feel sleepy, that shouldn\u2019t really be a problem,\u201d Claire murmured. She was gazing toward the large windows that looked out over the skyline.</p><p>Claire hadn\u2019t looked Noah in the eye, not since he\u2019d left her hospital room in order to talk with Trace.</p><p>When he\u2019d gone back, Claire had been too quiet. Withdrawn.</p><p>Afraid?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he said, and his fingers trailed over her arm.</p><p>Claire flinched. \u201cIt\u2019s not me that I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Then her head turned and she finally stared into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>He had to laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of this guy.\u201d If Claire only knew how many hell-holes he\u2019d fought in during his military days...</p><p>But I don\u2019t want her knowing.</p><p>The laughter stilled as she gazed at him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be afraid.\u201d Claire\u2019s body shifted slightly against the couch. \u201cIf you nearly die, it\u2019s okay to fear some.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been afraid, not since his parents had died. Even when he\u2019d been battling the enemy\u2014in ice, in sand, in the dankest forest he\u2019d ever imagined\u2014Noah hadn\u2019t been afraid.</p><p>But I was scared when she was so still on that sidewalk. Fear had come back then, and he wouldn\u2019t forget the feel of its icy claws raking into him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die for me,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>He leaned toward her. His finger slid down her arm. She didn\u2019t flinch at his touch that time. So much better. \u201cI have no intention of dying for you.\u201d</p><p>He thought some of the tension left her shoulders. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>But I would kill for you. I think that would be far more effective.</p><p>\u201cThe police are working,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbringing in their bomb experts. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll compare this blast with the one that took out Ethan. Bombers often have a signature. It\u2019ll take some time, but the authorities will be able to determine if the attacker was the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t have time?\u201d</p><p>His fingers lightly caressed her. \u201cWe have all the time we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s hunting.\u201d</p><p>He hated the fear in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m good at hunting, too.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth pressed into her lower lip. \u201cYour time...in the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after.\u201d He had his own demolitions expert coming in. Drake had stayed down in Alabama to learn more about the blast that killed Ethan, but he was already on his way up to New York.</p><p>\u201cYou killed, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away from her. \u201cMen die in battle all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t ask questions that you don\u2019t truly want answered.\u201d He looked back at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know, not really, do you?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled around the pillow on the couch. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true. People like to see the surface, not the darkness underneath.\u201d Life was easier that way.</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your darkness all along.\u201d</p><p>Her words caught him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to tell me your secrets,\u201d Claire said as her eyes gleamed. \u201cYou know every one of mine. No matter how painful, you know. Don\u2019t you think I deserve to hear yours, too?\u201d</p><p>He rose from the couch. Paced away from her. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t like what you hear?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to lose her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t actually had anyone to lose, not since his parents. But Claire\u2014she mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cHave you liked what you\u2019ve heard about me?\u201d He heard the rustle of the couch cushions as Claire rose. \u201cA woman who tried to kill herself when she was sixteen. I mean, hey, she\u2019s got to be some prize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He whirled back toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re a survivor. Everything I\u2019ve learned about you has just strengthened that belief.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his. \u201cMost people pity me...or else they think I\u2019m...pretending. That I\u2019m a manipulator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you for what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see you that way, too.\u201d She stepped toward him. Kept coming until her fingers lifted and pressed against his chest, right over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you some questions now, and I want you to know that your answers won\u2019t ever leave this room.\u201d</p><p>Her touch singed him.</p><p>\u201cHave you killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring my tours, and then...after. Trace, Drake, and I set up a security team of our own.\u201d</p><p>She waited, watching him with a gaze that seemed to see straight into his soul. The way her gaze always did.</p><p>And he found himself saying more. \u201cWe focused on retrieving very high-end assets. Businessmen, dignitaries who\u2019d been in the wrong place and been taken. Some of those guys were held for money, some held in hopes of a power swap.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted as she studied him. \u201cAnd your job was to get those people out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal channels wouldn\u2019t work. Uncle Sam didn\u2019t want the wreckage coming back to his door...so our team worked those cases.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got my start in the hotel business.\u201d Talk about a career change. \u201cOne of those guys thanked me with a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s quite a thank you.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. It sure had been, but seeing as how he\u2019d taken two bullets for the guy on that mission, Noah thought they\u2019d come out of the deal square. \u201cI had my own money, too, money left from my parents. I saved every dime while I was working with Trace and Drake, and then one day, I decided that I was done with that world.\u201d</p><p>The world of killing and death and blood.</p><p>\u201cI got out. I started fresh.\u201d He looked down at her hand. It looked so delicate against him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem so bad to me,\u201d Claire told him.</p><p>Tell her. \u201cI\u2019ve killed with guns. With knives. I\u2019ve attacked with my hands when they were the only weapons left to me. Killing is a talent I have, one that the government just honed even more for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not who you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who I will always be. When I see a threat, I want to eliminate it.\u201d He couldn\u2019t get more blunt than that. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t women last more than a night with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake talked too much.</p><p>\u201cHe said that your lovers come and go. One time is it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like sex.\u201d She\u2019d asked for his secrets. He\u2019d give her what he could. \u201cI satisfy the need, then I move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne time, then done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that makes me sound like a bastard, but ties just screw with your head.\u201d He\u2019d seen it happen. First with Drake\u2014and the man had been to hell and back because of that painful mistake. Then the same weakness had twisted Trace.</p><p>Claire\u2019s hand pulled away from Noah, but she still stood close to him. \u201cWhy am I still here?\u201d</p> <p>Because I need you to be.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you satisfied the-the \u2018need\u2019 yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, voice roughening, \u201cI haven\u2019t. That\u2019s the problem with you and me.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue swiped over her lower lip.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s the problem.</p> <p>\u201cThe need doesn\u2019t stop with you. The more I have you, the more it grows. The more I want.\u201d Until he felt like the need was consuming him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want gentle and easy. I don\u2019t want rose petals sprinkled on the ground. I want you naked and moaning. I want you screaming and clawing my back. I want everything that I can get from you.\u201d</p><p>I want to own you.</p><p>And he was starting to think...</p><p>The way you already own me.</p><p>Claire stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cScared yet?\u201d Noah had to push her.</p> <p>Claire shook her head.</p><p>You should be, Claire. With every moment that passes, I get hooked on you even more. He\u2019d seen Drake spiral, he\u2019d seen Trace sink into near madness.</p><p>And now I\u2019m on the brink.</p><p>The suite\u2019s phone rang. Its pealing cry seemed to echo around them. Noah didn\u2019t move.</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t know all that I\u2019ve done. When she did, what would happen?</p><p>The phone rang again. Swearing, Noah headed toward it. \u201cWhat?\u201d Noah snapped.</p><p>\u201cSir, it\u2019s Janelle at the concierge desk.\u201d Her voice was soft as she said, \u201cI know that you said no visitors were allowed up to your floor, but there\u2019s a very insistent gentleman here right now.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced over his shoulder at Claire. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAustin Harrison.\u201d</p><p>Harrison? His hold tightened on the phone. He\u2019d done his research. He knew Austin was the senator\u2019s other son. Three years older than Ethan, Austin had seemed to make keeping a low profile his priority. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep him right there. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d He slammed down the phone and marched for the door.</p><p>Claire beat him to that door. She blocked his path with her body. \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading downstairs for just a moment. I\u2019ll be right back and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No way. The last time you tried to go off on your own, a building exploded.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him. \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin Harrison.\u201d</p><p>Shock had her mouth dropping.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going downstairs to talk with him while you, baby, are staying right up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcussion, Claire.\u201d Gently, but firmly, he picked her up and carried her back to the couch. He put her down on the cushions. Pulled a blanket over her. Kissed her. \u201cYou stay here, and I\u2019ll go deal with the bastard at the door.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed into a determined line.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to argue with Claire. The last thing she needed right then was a confrontation. He headed for the door. Opened it\u2014</p><p>Talk about a bastard at the door.</p><p>Drake had his hand raised to knock.</p><p>\u201cNo one is supposed to get up to this floor.\u201d Noah glared at the two guards near the elevator. Guards who\u2019d been sent over from Weston Securities. Guards who were apparently damn inadequate.</p><p>\u201cTrace told them I was clear.\u201d Drake smiled. \u201cCome on, you know that you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. And that was why he yanked the guy in the suite. \u201cKeep Claire company until I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, wait, where are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah shut the door behind him and stalked to the elevator.</p><p>Austin Harrison.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d met the other two members of the family. Time to see if Austin was as much of a dick as they were.</p><p>The guy had just twisted her into knots and walked away. Claire shoved off her blanket and jumped to her feet. She was going after him and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI think the idea was for us both to stay put.\u201d Drake flashed her a broad smile. \u201cSo don\u2019t think you can just bat those big baby blues at me, and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>His smile slowly faded. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>He was always such a charmer.</p><p>Drake\u2019s hand lifted toward her face.</p><p>Instantly, Claire stepped back.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he murmured as he advanced. \u201cI just want to see the damage.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to stay still. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scratch that\u2019s got you purple and black on your temple.\u201d His head cocked and his fingers feathered over her cheek. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing the bandage is covering some stitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cBet that made Noah go insane.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his hand away. \u201cNearly getting blown up made us both react that way.\u201d</p><p>His hand caught hers. \u201cExplain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen Noah touch you, and you act like a cat getting stroked.\u201d</p><p>She did not.</p><p>\u201cBut I come close, and you tense up like you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll hit you.\u201d His voice and eyes had gone flat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Noah told you about my past, but I only did what I had to do. Killing my lover\u2014hell, no, that wasn\u2019t my plan. She went rogue. Turned on us all\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wow. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>She knew Drake had killed in Chicago, but that had been a fight-or-die situation. As for his past... \u201cLike you told me before, your past is your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t back away from me because you think I\u2019m a monster beneath the skin?\u201d</p><p>His words made her pause. Made her realize... \u201cI back away because I think everyone has a monster inside.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what she\u2019d learned from Ethan?</p><p>From herself?</p><p>Austin Harrison stood near the concierge desk in the lobby. Noah marched toward the guy, letting his gaze sweep over the last remaining Harrison.</p><p>The guy was tall, broad-shouldered. Dressed in a suit. Austin appeared tense, wary\u2014good, because he should be.</p><p>His hair was a dark blond, and it currently looked as if the guy had spent hours shoving his hands through it.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Noah said, turning sharply to the right. He wasn\u2019t about to have a public fight with Harrison. No, it was far better to do that in private.</p><p>Where no one can see what I\u2019ll do.</p><p>Noah took the guy back to the hotel manager\u2019s office. The manager, Louis, had conveniently cleared out, per Noah\u2019s orders during a quick phone call mid-elevator ride.</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t speak until they were secured inside. As soon as the door shut, though, the guy said, \u201cI\u2019m not a threat to you. Or to Claire Kramer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Austin swallowed. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing...just...stop, okay? I\u2019m not going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s gaze jerked around the office. \u201cMy father. Ethan.\u201d</p><p>He thinks I killed them?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be next on Claire\u2019s revenge list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Claire has a list?\u201d Had the guy not heard about the bombing? It had been all over the news. How the hell would he have missed that?</p><p>\u201cIf I were her, I would,\u201d Austin muttered as he yanked a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019d want revenge. Payback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Claire.\u201d She doesn\u2019t think like that.</p><p>Austin\u2019s hand fell to his side. His eyes met Noah\u2019s. \u201cI know you\u2019re fucking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to deny something that gave him such satisfaction.</p><p>Austin exhaled on a rough sigh. \u201cAre you killing for her, too?\u201d</p><p>Everyone sure seemed to think so. \u201cYou should turn on the news. The radio. Read a paper.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s eyebrows scrunched. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe you were flying up here, maybe you missed that huge story, so I\u2019ll just brief you.\u201d He rolled back his shoulders. \u201cSomeone tried to kill me and Claire with a bomb last night.\u201d</p><p>Austin backed up a step. He banged into the desk.</p><p>\u201cClaire isn\u2019t the one who went after your bastard of a father or your sick freak of a brother. Someone else out there did that. Probably the same someone who tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have to ask the bastard killing that particular question.\u201d He studied the man before him. \u201cYou don\u2019t reek of booze like your father.\u201d</p><p>Austin flinched.</p><p>\u201cAre you as insane as your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like Ethan.\u201d</p><p>The two looked alike. The similarity was clear as day. \u201cYou\u2019re the older brother. So when you were growing up, did you know what Ethan was? Did you see it?\u201d</p><p>Austin walked toward the window on the right. \u201cI saw it. Ethan was always hurting those weaker than he was. I told my father that he needed help, but that wasn\u2019t the way my old man worked. Harrisons don\u2019t need help. We don\u2019t need anything.\u201d He looked back at Noah. \u201cI came here because I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>Noah crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd you thought you were next on Claire\u2019s list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...because I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t help her. I didn\u2019t stop him. Ethan talked about her. So much. About how he couldn\u2019t live without her. How he wouldn\u2019t live without her. How he\u2019d do anything to prove his love to her.\u201d</p><p>Noah held his body perfectly still. \u201cDid you know he was planning to kill her parents?\u201d</p><p>Austin stared down at the floor. \u201cNo. Dear God...no. He was bad before Claire, he hurt some other girls, seemed to get off on the power rush, but with her, something broke in him.\u201d Then Austin squared his shoulders. His head lifted. His eyes met Noah\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced around the room. \u201cI just see you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hotel,\u201d Austin snapped. \u201cIf you\u2019re here, then she has to be close. Look, the PI called me and said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah jumped on that. \u201cYou mean Sloan Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Hall. He said you and Claire were together. I\u2019m not paying the guy anymore. That was my father\u2019s madness. Let Claire know that she\u2019s free, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan Hall is dead.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHe was shot in the head.\u201d</p><p>A shudder slid over Austin\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t think you have to worry about paying him,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cI do think you may have to worry about watching your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire, I need a list of your enemies.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d put a bit more distance between herself and Drake.</p><p>\u201cYou moved around jobs quite a bit,\u201d Drake continued as he rubbed his chin. \u201cSo maybe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly have an option on the job front. Senator Harrison made sure my past had a way of being brought to the attention of my bosses. If they didn\u2019t fire me immediately, he just exerted a little more...pressure on them.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to absorb that. \u201cSenator Harrison was your enemy.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yes. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan was locked away.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAs far as I know, there isn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d No one who hated her enough to kill.</p><p>He started to pace. He headed toward the door that led out onto the balcony. For a moment, he gazed at the city, then he tossed a hard glance back at her. \u201cCome on, tell me the truth. You\u2019ve got lovers that were burned. Maybe one of them is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cNoah is my lover. There hasn\u2019t been anyone else. Just Noah...and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that? Come on, try again.\u201d</p><p>Claire heaved out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. Why would I take a lover when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you can\u2019t even usually stand to be touched.\u201d He leaned back against the balcony door. \u201cSo why does Noah get the free pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so different about him? Because, sweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>She tensed at that endearment. Ethan had always called her that. She hated the word sweetheart.</p><p>\u201c\u2014if you want to talk about a man having a monster inside, Noah is your guy.\u201d</p><p>Now he was trying to scare her away from Noah? \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Good. Maybe it would last until Noah came\u2014</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Drake said.</p><p>Her gaze flew to his face. He looked completely serious.</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like when a man gets too lost in a woman. When he loses his control.\u201d</p><p>Drake was confused. \u201cNoah isn\u2019t...lost in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah clings so tightly to his control for a reason. If he breaks, I don\u2019t want to see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to apologize to Claire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah didn\u2019t plan to let this guy anywhere near Claire. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure and pass that along to her.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cI\u2019m not like them. I want to make this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen walk away from her and never look back.\u201d</p> <p>Austin blew out a hard breath. Then he turned and stormed for the door. His hand curled around the knob. His shoulders stiffened. \u201cI think it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>Noah slowly uncrossed his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s your fault?\u201d</p><p>Austin spun back toward him. \u201cBefore he died, Ethan said...he told me that I was the one who saw her first. I\u2019d forgotten about that. It was so long ago. Another life.\u201d</p><p>Noah advanced on him.</p><p>\u201cI must\u2019ve made some comment. Said I was going to ask her out. Ethan was always so competitive with me. I said I liked her, so he had to cut me out. He went after her first.\u201d He gave a miserable shake of his head. \u201cI brought Claire to his attention. He wanted to one up me, and he did it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy taking the girl you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan hated me.\u201d His hands were shaking. \u201cI realized just how much...at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead can\u2019t hate anymore. They can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>Austin nodded but his shoulders slumped. \u201cI want to tell her myself. Just say how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one in the Harrison family ever needs to see Claire Kramer again. You say you\u2019re sorry? Then prove it. Stay the hell out of her life. Claire doesn\u2019t need you and she doesn\u2019t need your apologies.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s lips pressed into a thin line.</p><p>Noah stood toe-to-toe with the man. \u201cClaire isn\u2019t your concern anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you fit into this?\u201d Austin\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cYou and Claire are lovers, okay, fine but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire is mine.\u201d That was all that needed to be said. \u201cNow, Harrison, seeing as how your business isn\u2019t in New York, I\u2019d advise you to get out of my town.\u201d</p><p>Austin held his gaze.</p><p>Noah waited. This guy would be leaving town, one way of another.</p><p>Then Austin sighed. \u201cRight. No business in New York, and no one left in Alabama. Maybe it\u2019s time for me to try something new.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Noah yanked open the door. \u201cBut stay away from Claire.\u201d</p><p>Austin stepped into the hallway. But he lingered. Lingered. \u201cI guess I had this wrong.\u201d</p><p>He sure as fuck had.</p><p>\u201cIf...if someone is after you and Claire\u2014you protect her, got it?\u201d</p><p>A warning, from that jerk?</p><p>\u201cI figure she\u2019s been through enough,\u201d Austin whispered, and then he finally walked away.</p><p>Noah stared after the guy. Yes, she has. It was time for Claire to know more than just blood and death.</p><p>Noah York would be a problem.</p><p>The man\u2019s guard was up. It wouldn\u2019t be so easy to lure him into another attack.</p><p>And Noah would have men watching Claire. Making sure she didn\u2019t slip away.</p><p>He thinks Claire is his.</p><p>Noah was dead wrong.</p><p>An attack would come again. He just had to be careful. Had to wait and plan. Had to draw out his enemy.</p><p>And I know just how to do it.</p><p>Noah had left loose ends in D.C. Those ends would come back...and bite the guy in the ass.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight,\u201d Noah said as he strode into Claire\u2019s office.</p><p>Claire smoothed her hand over the faint ridge near her hair-line. The stitches had come out yesterday. The doctors had given her the all-clear.</p><p>It had been eight days since the bombing.</p><p>Eight days during which Noah had treated her as if she were going to shatter if he touched her too hard.</p><p>He made love to her each night. Slow, tender sex. His control was always in place. He made sure she came, and then, he found his pleasure.</p><p>He held her during the night.</p><p>And he had a giant wall between them during the day.</p><p>Something had changed. Something was off between them. His stare was too guarded when he looked at her. His voice was too careful.</p><p>His touch was too careful.</p><p>Is he already finished with me? And he just doesn\u2019t know how to tell me? Maybe her time with him was up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big party tonight in the hotel\u2019s main ballroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Claire told him, slightly annoyed. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on details for it most of the week.\u201d Only he hadn\u2019t exactly been around to see that. The guys from Weston Securities weren\u2019t camped out by Noah\u2019s suite any longer, but Claire still had a guard. Drake was the one who tailed her like a shadow during the day. While Noah\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure where he went.</p><p>Or what he had been doing.</p><p>The party that night was to celebrate the one year anniversary of the opening of the New York branch of York Towers. It was supposed to be an epic event, with all the local power brokers in attendance. Claire had figured she\u2019d be working behind the scenes, and she already had a to-do list that stretched a mile long for\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be my date,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Her brows climbed. \u201cThanks for the invitation.\u201d Yes, her voice had bite. Something is so wrong. He was barely looking at her.</p><p>But at her snapped words, his gaze did shoot to her. \u201cI\u2019ll have a dress sent up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already did that, remember?\u201d Claire pushed to her feet. \u201cThe first day. You bought me a whole wardrobe. I don\u2019t need anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need this.\u201d He turned away. \u201cHead upstairs. It will be there within the hour.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cNoah, stop.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, he did. Noah glanced back at her, and, of course, his gaze was guarded. No expression was on his face. She felt like screaming. Instead, Claire managed to semi-calmly ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for a party.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. \u201cYou know what I mean. Things are different between us.\u201d Was it because she\u2019d pushed him to reveal more of his past? Was he trying to shut her out now?</p><p>\u201cNothing has changed.\u201d He turned back for the door.</p><p>Liar, liar.</p><p>\u201cAre we finished?\u201d The question slipped from her. She\u2019d more than passed his one night limit, so maybe it was time for her to go and he just didn\u2019t know how to tell her because of the train wreck that was her life. But there\u2019d been no more attacks. No more\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, Claire,\u201d the words were growled and Noah didn\u2019t look back at her, \u201cwe\u2019re far from finished.\u201d</p><p>When Noah entered his suite, he found Drake lounging on the couch. Drake glanced over at him, brows raised. \u201cDon\u2019t you look fancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Drake.\u201d He was already wearing his tux. He\u2019d changed earlier, before Claire had made it up to the suite. He\u2019d slipped in long enough to see the dress that he\u2019d ordered for her. Then he\u2019d headed back downstairs to make sure the staff was set on security guidelines for the night. When he\u2019d left the suite, Drake hadn\u2019t been there.</p><p>\u201cIn the last thirty minutes, you\u2019re the second person to tell me that I should fuck off.\u201d Drake gestured toward the closed bedroom door. \u201cClaire told me the same thing when I asked why she had tears in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s fingers tightened around the small, discrete box in his hands. \u201cClaire was crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Drake rose, slowly unfurling from the couch. \u201cClaire doesn\u2019t cry. She had tears in her eyes, but they never fell.\u201d He approached Noah and the guy\u2019s face held a hard flash of...anger? \u201cBut I think you probably know why they were there.\u201d</p><p>Are we finished? He\u2019d hated that question. \u201cThanks for watching her this week. Trace went to D.C. to chase down some leads, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you trying so hard to stay away from her?\u201d Drake asked him.</p><p>He looked down at the box. \u201cShe was hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were busy hunting.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze rose once more.</p><p>Drake laughed softly. \u201cThat\u2019s it, right? When you ran off each day, you were looking for the jerk-off who set that bomb. And you wanted me here because you knew I\u2019d take a bullet for your lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found him.\u201d He was turning up jackshit everywhere he turned. \u201cSloan Hall\u2019s crime scene was swept clean. There wasn\u2019t anything there. And at the Claymire Hotel bomb scene\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing was left but rubble,\u201d Drake finished.</p><p>Unfortunately. \u201cThis guy isn\u2019t just going to vanish. Another attack is coming, and I have to be ready.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door opened.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for her?\u201d Drake whispered as he backed away.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze locked on Claire. So beautiful.</p><p>Her dress was the same blue shade as her eyes. It hugged her breasts, revealing the sexy curves of her body so perfectly. There was a long slit in the dress, one that flashed her gorgeous legs as she walked.</p><p>She looked sophisticated. Sexy.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>She\u2019d tied ribbon around her wrists again, and, as he stared at her, Claire tucked her hands behind her back. \u201cThe dress wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI had plenty of things to wear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary for me.\u201d Because tonight, he had plans. Big plans.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to wait for an attack. I want the asshole to bring it on. Noah had never been the type to hide from a fight.</p><p>\u201cI figure you got things now,\u201d Drake murmured as he gave Noah a little salute. \u201cSee you at the party.\u201d He made his way to the door.</p><p>When Drake was gone, Claire\u2019s gaze dropped to Noah\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA present.\u201d He had to clear his throat because the words came out too rough and hard. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked a little at that. \u201cWell, I was hoping you hadn\u2019t bought jewelry for yourself.\u201d She walked toward him. The slit in her dress parted, his cock jerked, and he had to remember\u2014</p><p>Control.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice held a surge of heat that surprised him.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d Now he was confused. \u201cGetting you presents? Most women don\u2019t usually complain about gifts.\u201d</p><p>Claire gave a hard, negative shake of her head. \u201cStop shutting yourself off from me. I could actually see you doing it just then.\u201d She didn\u2019t reach for the jewelry box. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not most woman.\u201d</p><p>He knew that fact too well.</p><p>He opened the jewelry box. Offered the diamond bracelets to her.</p><p>Claire\u2019s breath caught. \u201cThose are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The diamonds caught the light, shining even more. Very rare, the natural blue diamonds had cost him a fortune\u2014and they were worth every penny that he\u2019d spent.</p><p>They were the same shade of blue as her dress.</p><p>The same shade to match her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI had the bracelets specially made for you. I\u2019d hoped they would be here sooner.\u201d He put the jewelry box down on the table. Reached for her right hand. His fingers slid over her wrist as he pulled the ribbon away. \u201cYou won\u2019t need this anymore.\u201d He took out one of the bracelets. The diamonds were surrounded by gold, a tight band that would slide over her wrist and hold easily in place.</p><p>He slid the first bracelet around her wrist. It fit her perfectly.</p><p>Then he removed the second ribbon from her skin. He eased the other bracelet into position around her wrist.</p><p>The bracelets were savage in their beauty. The blue diamonds gleamed, and the gold cuff design of the bracelets gave the jewelry a harder, sensual edge.</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. He stared into Claire\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever feel self-conscious again. Those scars don\u2019t define you.\u201d They just prove you\u2019re stronger than death. He stepped back. \u201cWe need to hurry downstairs. I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want your thanks. I just want you. He straightened his tux. \u201cThere will be a large number of photographers and reporters in the hotel tonight, so you need to prepare for their questions.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slid over the bracelet on her left wrist. \u201cAm I supposed to be your assistant tonight? Or your lover?\u201d</p><p>The question caught him off-guard. \u201cYou\u2019re both. I thought I made that clear.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers kept stroking the bracelet.</p><p>I want to see her in those bracelets and nothing else.</p><p>By the end of the night, he would.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fuck your employees, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than an employee.\u201d Soon, everyone would know that.</p><p>He offered her his arm. \u201cTime to go.\u201d There would be no going back after this.</p><p>She touched him lightly. Her body pressed against his. The woman smelled delicious.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his arm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning, but I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d He caught her hand. Lifted it to his lips. Pressed a kiss to her knuckles. \u201cI want you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>The instant words seemed to slam into him. Noah forced a smile. \u201cThen you have nothing to fear.\u201d</p><p>The packed hotel ballroom had Claire\u2019s knees knocking together. Energy filled the air. Laughter and drinks were flowing freely.</p><p>And it sure seemed like reporters were everywhere.</p><p>Claire and Noah had barely gotten past the gleaming, marble steps in the ballroom when the first set of reporters closed in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sure, the men were in perfectly cut tuxes and the women wore glittering gowns, but Claire could see the avid gleam in their eyes and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNoah York...\u201d A redhead murmured as her lips rose in a smile that never met her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJennifer.\u201d He inclined his head.</p> <p>\u201cAre the rumors true?\u201d she asked. Then Jennifer directed her stare at Claire. \u201cAre you the infamous Claire Kramer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennifer Swan sort of...manages the main gossip pages in town,\u201d Noah said to Claire as his finger stroked down her arm. \u201cAnd, baby, being called \u2018infamous\u2019 is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>Wait, had he just called Claire \u2018baby\u2019 in front of all those people?</p><p>\u201cThen the stories about the two of you being an item are true?\u201d Jennifer demanded as she inched closer. \u201cInteresting. Claire, how do you feel about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Noah said, and his voice seemed to carry all the way across the ballroom. \u201cSo, yes, Jennifer, we\u2019re an item.\u201d He gave the group of reporters a wide smile. \u201cAnd feel free to print that in the papers.\u201d</p> <p>Cameras flashed then.</p><p>\u201cSmile, Claire,\u201d Noah whispered. His lips brushed over her ear. She felt the sensual lick of his tongue against her.</p><p>Claire smiled.</p><p>And, just like that, with his one, earth-shattering announcement, she and Noah were the center of attention in that ballroom. Everyone was looking at them.</p><p>Some people were smiling. Some were whispering.</p><p>Claire wanted to vanish.</p> <p>The crowd closed in tighter.</p><p>Noah climbed up a few steps, pulling her back up with him. Then Janelle was there\u2014and she had a microphone in her hand. She offered it to Noah.</p><p>Noah planned this.</p><p>Now Claire knew why he\u2019d wanted her to wear the perfect dress. His fianc\u00e9e had to be perfect.</p><p>\u201cOn the first anniversary of this hotel...\u201d Noah sounded so smooth and polished as he addressed the crowd around them. \u201cIt only seems fitting that I get to share news that has made me the happiest man on earth.\u201d</p><p>Liar, liar. She hated it when Noah lied.</p><p>He lifted her hand into the air. The blue diamonds around her wrist caught the light and seemed to shine even brighter. \u201cClaire Kramer has just consented to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Applause shook the ballroom.</p> <p>Noah laughed. \u201cAnd I want you all to celebrate with us. Bring out the champagne!\u201d</p><p>And, at his order, the champagne flowed. As if they\u2019d been waiting for that cue\u2014and Claire suspected they had\u2014waiters bustled out with dozens and dozens of champagne flutes. The champagne was distributed quickly.</p><p>She even found a flute placed in her hand.</p><p>Dazed, Claire\u2019s gaze shot around the room. She saw Drake in the back, leaning against a broad, white column. Like pretty much everyone else, he had a champagne flute in his hand. He lifted it toward her.</p><p>Trace Weston stood beside him. Trace had his hand around Skye\u2019s shoulders. Skye stared back at Claire. Did the other woman looked worried?</p><p>Do I look terrified? Because Claire sure felt that way.</p><p>Everyone was lifting up their flutes as they toasted to her and Noah. Noah had freed her hand when he took his own flute of champagne.</p><p>He offered her a grin. \u201cTo my future wife,\u201d Noah said, the microphone catching every word he uttered. \u201cClaire, I always want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>Their glasses touched lightly, and she knew what he\u2019d just done.</p><p>The reporters. The people. The public display.</p><p>The killer had gone quiet, and Noah thought to draw him out again with show.</p><p>\u201cAlways mine,\u201d Noah whispered and his lips took hers.</p><p>Claire was running, and she knew it. Noah was surrounded by a throng of well-wishers, and it had been hard, but Claire had managed to slip away from the crowd.</p><p>And she was now dashing for the exit as quickly as she could.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were planning to marry Noah.\u201d Skye slipped into Claire\u2019s path. She was smiling, but her eyes flickered with concern. \u201cCongratulations. I hope you\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire caught Skye\u2019s hands. She brought her in close, as if she were hugging the other woman. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this was going to happen. He never asked me to marry him. This is all some plan of his.\u201d</p><p>A plan that was ripping her apart. Noah didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d actually dreamed of having a life, a husband who loved her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how hard it had been for her to stand there while he pretended they were the perfect couple.</p><p>She eased back from Skye, but made sure to keep that terrible, fake smile on her face. In case others were watching. And they were.</p><p>Skye\u2019s gaze searched hers. \u201cWhat plan?\u201d Skye whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s putting us in the spotlight. I think he wants the killer to come at him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Noah can catch the guy.\u201d Skye was gorgeous in a black dress that fit her like a glove. \u201cBut he\u2019s pulled you into the cross-fire, too.\u201d Anger roughened her words.</p><p>\u201cI was always in the fire.\u201d That danger was nothing new. She\u2019d been hunted since she was sixteen, in one way or another.</p><p>She eased away from Skye. \u201cI just...I need to be alone for a few minutes.\u201d Then she\u2019d get her control back. She\u2019d stop feeling as if she were about to break apart. But when Claire looked around the ballroom, she saw Trace striding toward them. And Noah had pulled free of his throng and he was closing in, too.</p><p>\u201cBuy me just a few minutes,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Skye nodded.</p><p>Claire rushed for the doors. A few more steps, and she\u2019d head outside and be able to breathe for a bit. She\u2019d suck in some air on the balcony, pretend that everything was fine, and she\u2019d be okay.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t make it to the balcony. A man\u2019s hand snaked out and caught her arm, and Claire opened her mouth to scream.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Drake said as his hold tightened around her. \u201cYou know you\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her behind one of the huge, towering columns that lined the outskirts of the ballroom. He caged her against that column, and he lifted her left hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no ring here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t look like a blushing bride-to-be up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know I was going to be one.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cHe should\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>Drake seemed to surround her fully then, and, hidden behind that heavy column, no prying eyes could see them. \u201cDid he tell you? Did you know what Noah was planning?\u201d It was her life. Noah should never have pulled a stunt like this without talking to her first.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. The guy\u2019s always twisting up the game.\u201d</p><p>There was no anonymity for her now. Her face would be everywhere. In the papers. On the news. Everyone would know who she was. Worse, they\u2019d know who she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d Claire said, nearly desperate. \u201cThose people\u2014it\u2019s too much. I feel like they\u2019re vultures circling in for the kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s exactly what they are.\u201d He stepped back, surprising her. Then he took her hand in his.</p><p>Claire\u2019s breath eased out.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Drake murmured.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll get you some freedom.\u201d Then he was guiding her though the ballroom\u2019s back doors. In moments, they were sliding into the private elevator. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re leaving your fianc\u00e9 in the middle of your own party.\u201d</p><p>A shiver had her tensing. \u201cI\u2019ll go back. I just need a few moments.\u201d</p><p>His hand still held hers.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tense on me,\u201d Drake said as the elevator doors closed.</p><p>She stared at their hands. No, when he\u2019d taken her fingers in his, she hadn\u2019t tensed. Claire had actually felt relieved by his touch then.</p><p>\u201cNot afraid of me anymore?\u201d Drake queried softly. \u201cDid you decide that I don\u2019t have a monster inside?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cI know you do.\u201d But, no, she wasn\u2019t afraid of him.</p><p>Maybe she should be.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong in Noah\u2019s world.\u201d</p><p>Those words had her blinking in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is all over, you need to leave. Run as fast and as far as you can, but be warned, Noah will follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>His smile was sad. \u201cBecause I like you, and I don\u2019t want to see you ripped apart by the vultures that always circle him.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened. Claire hurried out\u2014</p><p>And she slammed right into Austin Harrison.</p><p>\u201cShe wants some time alone,\u201d Skye said as she put her little ex-ballerina body right in front of Noah. Like she was going to slow him down. \u201cGive her that time,\u201d Skye ordered. Her hands were on her hips and a glower was on her face.</p><p>Noah started to brush by her, but then Trace slid up behind his wife. Trace lifted a brow. \u201cI\u2019d suggest you listen to that advice. I saw Claire\u2019s expression a few minutes ago. That woman is running scared.\u201d</p><p>And that was why he needed to get to her. He hadn\u2019t told Claire his plans beforehand because he\u2019d known that she\u2019d balk. But if he introduced her as his fianc\u00e9e in front of everyone...I gambled that she\u2019d stay quiet. That the shock would keep her at my side.</p><p>It had. For a time. But when the shock faded, Claire had sure run fast.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t keep running from me,\u201d he said. She needed to listen to him. He had a damn fine plan in place.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not running from you. She just wants to be able to breathe without every reporter in the room watching her.\u201d Skye\u2019s smile was grim. \u201cI know how that feels.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cYou think I screwed up tonight, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Skye didn\u2019t pull her punches.</p><p>His gaze hit Trace\u2019s.</p><p>His friend nodded. Dammit. They both thought he\u2019d screwed up?</p><p>\u201cI am protecting her.\u201d He expected Trace to get that. \u201cShe can\u2019t just keep hiding out at the Towers, waiting for that asshole out there to make a move.\u201d He couldn\u2019t do that. He\u2019d never been the type to wait for an attack to come. \u201cIn battle, you always take the offensive if you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t battle,\u201d Skye said softly. \u201cThis is her life.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you really think she liked that her first proposal was a fake one?\u201d Skye\u2019s voice sharpened even more. \u201cNo woman likes that.\u201d</p><p>He schooled his expression. \u201cWho says it was a fake proposal?\u201d</p><p>Trace brushed a kiss over Skye\u2019s cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a ring on her finger, just plenty of flash around her wrists. Those bracelets...were they supposed to show everyone that she was chained to you?\u201d</p><p>No, the bracelets had been designed to show Claire that she didn\u2019t have to constantly worry about her scars. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to worry about pulling down her sleeves to hide the scars or finding ribbons to bind her wrists. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand my relationship with Claire.\u201d</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think you don\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze scanned the ballroom. \u201cI need to find her.\u201d He should be talking to Claire, not Trace. He had to make sure she realized that nothing had changed between them. I\u2019m not using her.</p><p>Trace motioned toward the exit. \u201cDrake took her upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, excuse me, but I have an elevator to catch.\u201d He hurried by Trace.</p><p>\u201cAnd some groveling to do,\u201d he heard his friend mutter.</p><p>Noah\u2019s jaw locked as he entered the elevator. There would be no groveling. Claire would realize that an engagement was perfect for them. The attacker had targeted him once, so this would be like waving a red flag in front of the guy\u2019s face. He\u2019d come after Noah again but this time\u2014</p><p>I\u2019ll be ready for him.</p><p>Claire scrambled back even as Drake surged forward. Drake grabbed Austin and slammed the guy into the nearest wall. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Drake demanded.</p><p>Austin jerked in his grip, but Drake wasn\u2019t letting the guy go. \u201cI-I just needed to see Claire!\u201d</p><p>Her heart was about to burst out of her chest. Her hands were shaking, her stomach churning, and Claire couldn\u2019t look away from Austin\u2019s eyes\u2014it\u2019s like I\u2019m seeing Ethan again.</p><p>Only Austin...he\u2019d never been like Ethan. Austin had been the good brother. The one who graduated at the top of his class. The one who\u2019d held the door open for her when she used to work at the diner. He\u2019d been the one who\u2014</p><p>Came to tell me how sorry he was. When she\u2019d been in the hospital, recovering from the suicide attempt, he\u2019d been there.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get past security?\u201d Drake\u2019s hold on the guy tightened even more.</p><p>\u201cI-I bribed a guy downstairs. I heard about the party tonight and knew this would be my best chance to get in.\u201d Austin\u2019s voice was tight. His gaze was on Claire\u2014pleading? \u201cI just need a few minutes, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to get an ass beating, that\u2019s all you\u2019re getting,\u201d Drake snarled right back. \u201cThen the fool who let you up here is getting fired.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s gaze narrowed on Drake\u2019s furious face. \u201cI know you. You were at my father\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Drake just glared at him.</p><p>Austin\u2019s skin paled. \u201cYou were there...and my brother...his car exploded...when you were there!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, and stop looking at me like I did that shit. His death is one that can\u2019t be tied to me.\u201d Drake dropped his hold on the guy. \u201cYou\u2019re one dumb bastard to come up here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Austin knocked him back and ran toward Claire. His hands grabbed her shoulders. \u201cI just need a minute!\u201d His hold wasn\u2019t painful. Just desperate. \u201cI have to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The elevator dinged behind them. Claire heard the doors open. Awareness shot down her spine. Even though she couldn\u2019t see the occupant in that elevator, she knew who was inside.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d Claire told Austin, and she whirled just in time to see Noah step out of the elevator.</p><p>His gaze went first to her. Then to Austin\u2014and the guy had just made the mistake of curling his fingers around her shoulder again.</p><p>Rage flashed over Noah\u2019s face, and he attacked.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Claire yelled. She grabbed Noah\u2019s arms and tried to push him back. It was like trying to move a brick wall. \u201cNoah, I\u2019m okay!\u201d She cast a frantic glance toward Austin. Did the guy realize how close he was to danger?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt her,\u201d Austin said, his voice breaking with what sounded like fear. \u201cI told you...I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Drake locked his hand around the back of the Austin\u2019s neck. \u201cYou just need to stay away from her. That\u2019s what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>Austin winced, and Claire knew Drake\u2019s grip had to be painful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like them,\u201d Austin bit out.</p><p>No, no, he never had been.</p><p>Noah was still straining beneath Claire\u2019s hold. If he\u2019d wanted, though, he could have easily broken free. She knew that. He was staying still, for her.</p> <p>She looked back at Noah, and, staring into his eyes, Claire said, \u201cI want to talk with him.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cBad idea, baby. Anything he has to say\u2014it\u2019s just gonna hurt you. I don\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t protect her from everything. \u201cI want to talk with him,\u201d she said again as she eased way from Noah. Claire shook her head. \u201cBut not here, in the hallway.\u201d She inclined her head toward the suite. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside, and, um, Drake, do me a favor? Stop choking him.\u201d</p><p>Drake eased his hold.</p><p>Silence fell over their little group, and Claire marched toward the suite\u2019s door. She was scared and this could be a huge mistake, but...</p><p>Austin tried to help me. When he\u2019d gone to visit her in the hospital so long ago, he\u2019d given her money. Told her to get out of town. To start fresh.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t know what Austin had done. She was the only one how knew.</p><p>They filed into the suite. Noah stayed close to Claire, and Drake kept a careful watch on Austin.</p> <p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d Noah\u2019s golden eyes blazed at Austin. \u201cThen you\u2019re done. If I ever see you around again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Ethan had a problem, long before he met you.\u201d Austin was staring at Claire. \u201cHe hurt a few others girls. Roughed them up. One girl even wound up in the hospital with a broken jaw. She\u2019d made the mistake of trying to break up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the jerk didn\u2019t take rejection so well,\u201d Drake muttered, disgust obvious in his voice.</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI asked my dad to get him help, but Harrisons...we don\u2019t need help.\u201d Austin swallowed. The click of his Adam\u2019s apple seemed loud in that tense moment of silence. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s the line my father always used. He\u2019d tell us that no Harrison needed help, and then, when we did mess up, he\u2019d beat the shit out of us.\u201d</p><p>Claire stepped back. Noah immediately wrapped his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo one knew about that, right? I mean, a senator, beating on his kids. And it\u2019s not like he did it that often.\u201d Austin\u2019s stare turned distant. \u201cOnly when we screwed up.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cI learned not to screw up. So I didn\u2019t...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI thought things were better as we got older, but it turns out that things were just better for me. My father kept hurting Ethan, and Ethan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKept hurting anyone who got in his way,\u201d Noah said flatly.</p><p>His face miserable, Austin nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that your father abused him doesn\u2019t forgive the fact that your brother killed,\u201d Noah shot back. \u201cPlenty of other people have hell for an upbringing and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t hurt those who are weaker than us.\u201d Drake\u2019s face was tight. His words echoed with bitter fury.</p><p>We don\u2019t hurt those...</p><p>She looked at Drake with new eyes, but he wasn\u2019t staring at her. His attention was centered completely on Austin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to try and-and excuse what he did. I just thought...\u201d Austin\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault!\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t help my little brother. I didn\u2019t stop my father. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Austin\u2019s glittering stare found Claire\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop Ethan from seeing you. Hell, I\u2019m the reason he even asked you out. He was in competition with me. My father did that, put us against each other\u2014made us enemies when we should have just been brothers.\u201d His breath expelled in a hard rush. \u201cEthan took you because he thought he was taking something from me.\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cI am so sorry, Claire. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>Claire stared at him, lost. The powerful Harrison clan was gone. Austin stood before her, and he was crumbling right before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do this to me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His gaze held hers.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t shoot my parents. You didn\u2019t,\u201d she had to take a steadying breath as the memories surged through her, \u201cyou didn\u2019t find me on that dock and put a gun to my head. None of that was you. It was Ethan. Despite whatever else happened, he was the one. He chose to do it all.\u201d</p><p>They all had the right to choose in this life.</p><p>Austin\u2019s eyes lowered. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking through my father\u2019s records. I know he caused you to lose your jobs. He had that detective, Sloan, following you, and when you came to New York, he even got the guy to trash your hotel room here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Noah demanded, and fury vibrated in that word.</p><p>Austin\u2019s shoulders rolled in a helpless shrug. \u201cEven at the end, my father still wanted to find some evidence to prove that Claire manipulated my brother. He was in denial, and he wasn\u2019t going to let that go. Not ever.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think he wanted Sloan to find some kind of proof that would show Claire was guilty. Maybe he thought there would be something he could use against her in that hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing,\u201d Claire said simply. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Austin held her stare. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Noah stepped in front of her then. \u201cYour five minutes are up.\u201d He grabbed Austin\u2019s arm. \u201cTime to kick your ass out.\u201d</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t fight Noah\u2019s grip. \u201cNo more investigators, Claire!\u201d He called out as both Noah and Drake shoved him toward the door. \u201cNo more lost jobs! No more trouble from my family ever again, I swear!\u201d</p><p>She took a tentative step forward.</p><p>\u201cI know you never wanted money from me,\u201d Austin said, and he was right at the door now. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take it before, but if you need it\u2014if you need anything\u2014I want to help. I want to make this right. I have to make it right!\u201d</p><p>There were some things that couldn\u2019t be made right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him downstairs,\u201d Drake said as he once again curled his fingers over the back of Austin\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t get up here again.\u201d</p><p>Noah leaned in toward Austin. \u201cThis was it. You had your say. Now stay away, understand?\u201d</p><p>Austin nodded.</p><p>Then he was gone. Drake hauled Austin away and Noah slammed the door behind them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak. Neither did Claire.</p><p>The sound of her breathing seemed overly loud in that room. Her whole body was tense, and she pretty much wanted to sink into a puddle on the floor and just tell the world to go away.</p><p>But there were about two hundred people waiting down in the ballroom. This was supposed to be an engagement party. If they vanished for the rest of the night, what would people say?</p><p>So she squared her shoulders. She lifted her chin. Adjusted her bracelets. And she walked toward the door.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t move.</p><p>She slid around him. Reached for the doorknob.</p><p>In a flash, he was behind her. His body curved over hers and his fingers wrapped around her hand.</p><p>His touch seemed to electrify her. Claire closed her eyes. She couldn\u2019t handle the intensity between them, not at that moment. \u201cWe...we have to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He turned her around. Kept his grip on her right hand. \u201cI need to know that you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>The laughter that escaped from her held a ragged edge. \u201cOkay doesn\u2019t quite describe me right now.\u201d She was too raw for okay.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want him near you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAustin has never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered. \u201cHe said he tried to give you money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to see me when I was in the hospital after my\u2014\u201d Say it. \u201cAfter my suicide attempt. He wanted to give me money to leave town.\u201d She could still see the stark expression on his face. He\u2019d been so pale and shaken. \u201cBut taking money from his family, I-I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want anything from them.\u201d</p><p>I just wanted to get away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see him again, Claire. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a threat to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put his forehead against hers. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him, and I want you to stay away from the guy. And when I find out who let him up here, that jerk is done.\u201d</p><p>Claire put her left hand on his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t like games.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. His gaze gleamed.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me what you had planned. I nearly passed out when you announced to those people that we were getting married.\u201d She pushed against his chest. She needed some space between them. Talking was too hard when he was that close. Her body was hyper-aware of him. Too attuned.</p><p>Too weak where he was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say no,\u201d Noah admitted, and his words had her stilling. \u201cIf you knew what I wanted to do...\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly what he wanted to do now. \u201cYou think this killer is fixated on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t trying to deceive her anymore.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s picking off the people who\u2019ve hurt me.\u201d She\u2019d pieced this together. \u201cAnd he wanted to eliminate you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m standing between him and you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice lowered as she said, \u201cYou just put a big target on yourself. Didn\u2019t I tell you...I don\u2019t want you dying for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I\u2019m also not going to just wait for the bastard to strike again. I pushed him, so now he\u2019ll push back. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. He\u2019s good with demolitions, he uses a silencer when he hunts\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her brows climbed.</p><p>\u201cHe has to use the silencer because no one reported hearing gunshots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying \u2018he\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man called me. A man is focused on you.\u201d His pupils seemed to swallow the gold of his eyes. \u201cHe wants you, and he thinks that he is going to take you from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to publicly tell the world that I was yours.\u201d The anger and fear twisted inside of her. \u201cMy life, Noah. You shouldn\u2019t have pulled this stunt without telling me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to let you have a life!\u201d Noah snarled back.</p><p>His anger had her tensing. Noah had never really been angry with her before.</p><p>But he sure seemed furious then.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you always looking over your shoulder. I don\u2019t want you wondering who is watching you or what some sick freak might do next to you. I want you to be free.\u201d A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cAnd no matter what I have to do, I will get you that freedom.\u201d</p><p>Then he caught her chin. He tipped her head back, and his mouth crashed down on hers.</p><p>Drake escorted Austin Harrison out the back of the Towers. He stopped under a streetlight and jerked the guy close as he warned, \u201cDon\u2019t forget what Noah told you. Stay away from Claire.\u201d</p><p>Austin nodded. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be.\u201d Drake shoved him away.</p><p>Austin straightened his suit. Fumbled in his pockets. Hesitated.</p><p>Does he want an ass-kicking?</p><p>\u201cWhy were you at the funeral?\u201d Austin asked him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it was a pit-stop for me.\u201d</p><p>Austin stared down at the ground. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t died, Ethan would just have come after her again.\u201d</p><p>Drake tensed.</p><p>\u201cHe would have kept coming. He had pictures of her that he kept in his cell. He wouldn\u2019t have stopped. Not until Claire was dead.\u201d He swiped his hand over his face. \u201cI knew that, and this time, I had to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Was the guy making a confession?</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done it sooner.\u201d Austin turned away. Began to walk into the darkness of the night. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to send your own brother to hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had his hands on her, but Noah couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Claire was about to slip right out of his fingers. She was kissing him back, her mouth moving so perfectly beneath his, the taste of champagne on his tongue.</p><p>Don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>The kiss became harder, rougher. His hands curled around her hips, and he pulled her forward. His cock shoved against the front of his pants. Just one kiss from Claire, and he was hard and swollen. Aching. He remembered the feel of her silken mouth on his cock. The way she\u2019d licked him. Sucked him.</p> <p>His fingers slid down, and he found the slit in her dress. He put his hand on her thigh. No stockings for Claire. Just silken, golden skin. He parted that slit a little more and his hand rose. He touched the light scrap of lace that shielded her sex.</p><p>She was wet for him.</p><p>We touch, we kiss, and we ignite.</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t the only one addicted. For them, it worked both ways.</p><p>His mouth pulled from hers. He stared into her eyes. \u201cI want to fuck you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTh-they\u2019re waiting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them wait.\u201d He jerked on the panties, hard, and they tore. He needed her. There. Right there.</p><p>No foreplay. No sensual build-up to release.</p><p>He had to take her.</p><p>He would. He freed his cock. The damn thing sprang forward, so eager for her that moisture already beaded the tip.</p><p>He lifted Claire up. She had on her heels. Those incredibly sexy heels. He held her easily.</p> <p>And he drove into her as deeply as he could.</p><p>You\u2019re mine, Claire. I\u2019m not letting you go.</p><p>She thought the engagement was fake.</p><p>He withdrew. Thrust deep.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize...</p><p>I did it so you\u2019d be tied to me.</p><p>The sound of her moans filled his ears. Her sex was a tight, hot paradise around his cock. Squeezing him. Driving him out of his mind.</p><p>He had her pinned to the door. He thrust into her. Again and again. And his fingers strummed over her clit. He knew Claire\u2019s body better than she did. He\u2019d made a point to learn all of her weak spots. To learn how she liked to be touched. To learn just how to make Claire-</p> <p>Her sex clamped around him. She choked out his name.</p><p>Explode.</p><p>He drove into her even harder. The base of his spine tightened, and he came, climaxing inside of her on a long, powerful, mind-numbing release that left his legs feeling weak.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her go. He couldn\u2019t, not yet. He waited until his breathing evened, then he kissed her again.</p><p>This time, the kiss was soft. Slow.</p><p>He started to get hard inside of her again.</p><p>With Claire, he was always ready to go again.</p><p>His head lifted. Red stained her cheeks. Her eyes shined, and her lips were swollen from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going to know what we did,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>Good. He wanted them to know.</p><p>Claire\u2019s mine. I\u2019m not letting her go.</p><p>Even if he had to kill in order to keep her with him.</p><p>Noah had fucked Claire. Drake could tell. Sure, their clothes were perfectly in place again, but there was a flush on Claire\u2019s skin. A sensual gleam in her eyes.</p><p>And there was the obvious stamp of satisfaction and possession on Noah\u2019s face when he looked at her.</p><p>Oh, yeah, Noah had staked his claim all right. It would be apparent to every male in the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got it bad,\u201d Trace murmured as he slid up to the bar beside Drake.</p><p>The band was playing now. Some low, romantic tune that got on Drake\u2019s nerves. \u201cGuess you\u2019d know,\u201d Drake said, glancing over at him. \u201cSince Skye\u2019s made you crazy for years.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s gaze was actually on Skye as she talked with Claire. \u201cShe\u2019s worth every minute of insanity.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. Drake had been burned\u2014damn near lethally\u2014by a woman before. He didn\u2019t plan on ever getting onto the insanity-boat again. As far as he was concerned, no woman was worth that nightmare. \u201cI think your men need to focus more on Austin Harrison.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s brows climbed. \u201cThe brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the brother.\u201d Drake was done with champagne. He drained the whiskey he\u2019d just been given. He motioned to Noah, and his friend started crossing the room toward him.</p><p>A few seconds later, Noah leveled his gaze on Drake. \u201cYou took care of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did.\u201d He saluted him with his empty whiskey glass. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you recently fired an employee?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cFive minutes ago. And I\u2019ve doubled the security at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Trace told him as his fingers tapped against the bar. \u201cSeeing as how you\u2019re working so hard to get a killer to come after you.\u201d</p><p>Drake put his glass back down. No one was close enough to overhear them, but he still dropped his voice as he said, \u201cI think the brother did it. I think he set up the bomb to kill Ethan Harrison.\u201d</p><p>The faint lines near Noah\u2019s eyes deepened. \u201cHis own brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin knew Ethan would be at that funeral. He knew which car his brother would arrive and leave in.\u201d Austin had all but admitted his guilt outside of the Towers. \u201cHe said that Ethan would never stop going after Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Noah\u2019s face had hardened. \u201cHe was counting down the days until he we was free. He was as hung up on her as he always was.\u201d Noah glanced over his shoulder, obviously looking for Claire.</p><p>He\u2019s not the only one hung up on her.</p><p>But Drake was going to let his buddy dig his own grave on that one. His fingers curled around the empty whiskey glass. \u201cAustin said he didn\u2019t stop him before, but I think he made sure he stopped Ethan this time.\u201d</p><p>Trace was already pulling out his phone. Drake heard the guy giving orders for a deeper investigation on Austin Harrison. \u201cI want to know every move he\u2019s made for the last three months,\u201d Trace said into the phone.</p><p>When Trace gave an order, Drake knew his agents scrambled to obey.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the way he is with Claire,\u201d Drake added.</p><p>Noah glanced back at him.</p><p>\u201cHe looks at her the same way you do.\u201d And that fact worried Drake. \u201cIt can\u2019t be good.\u201d Drake just didn\u2019t get it. Claire was a pretty woman, sure, definitely. Great eyes. Hot body. And she was smart\u2014that was always sexy.</p><p>But...</p><p>Ethan Harrison had gone crazy for her.</p><p>Noah\u2014hell, Drake didn\u2019t even know what Noah was doing.</p><p>\u201cShe has to be fucking phenomenal in bed,\u201d Drake muttered, and he realized his mistake two seconds too late.</p><p>Because in those two seconds, Noah drove his fist into Drake\u2019s jaw. Noah had always possessed a killer punch, and that hit sent Drake flying off the barstool. He slammed into the floor, and the barstool fell beside him.</p><p>Shocked gasps filled the air.</p><p>The band stopped playing.</p><p>Drake looked up and saw Noah coming in for another hit. He braced himself, but Trace pulled Noah back.</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>And then Claire was there. She ran toward Noah and put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The reporters would be splashing this news all over the place. Especially the gossip reporter, Jennifer Swan. She lived for drama like this.</p><p>Noah glared at Drake. \u201cI was just having a little talk with my friend.\u201d</p><p>Drake smiled. \u201cI fell. Must\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d He stood up and rubbed his jaw.</p><p>Skye hurried over and straightened his suit. \u201cFalling is easy when you get a punch to the face,\u201d she murmured, her voice only carrying to him.</p><p>Yes, it was.</p><p>Claire\u2019s gaze darted between Noah and Drake. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the place. Not for...whatever is happening between you two.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook free of Trace. \u201cOf course.\u201d He motioned to the band. \u201cPlay something slow. I want to dance with my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d He pulled Claire into his arms. Started to walk past Drake. Then Noah slowed. He leaned in close to Drake and rasped, \u201cFucking phenomenal. You\u2019d better believe it.\u201d</p><p>Then he took Claire onto the dance floor.</p><p>Drake shook his head. No one woman\u2014and no sex\u2014was worth the kind of hell Noah was courting.</p><p>The ringing of a phone woke Claire that night. She blinked as her hand stretched out, seeking Noah in the darkness.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>The phone\u2014her phone\u2014rang again, vibrating from its position on the nightstand.</p><p>Claire flipped on the light. It shined down on her phone\u2014and on the framed photo of her family. She\u2019d brought that photo into Noah\u2019s suite because she\u2019d wanted to keep it close. She needed it close.</p><p>Claire picked up her phone. She didn\u2019t recognize the number, so she answered, hesitantly, \u201cH-hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire...\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her arms because that was a voice that Claire could never, would never forget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted back to the photograph of her family. Mom. Dad...</p><p>She jumped from the bed. Where was Noah?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long...\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Laughter. Soft. Familiar. \u201cDid you really think death would keep me from you?\u201d</p><p>She yanked open the bedroom door. Rushed forward. Noah wasn\u2019t in the outer room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my one and only. Always.\u201d The voice\u2014his voice\u2014thickened. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be your one and only. No one else, not for either of us.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t say his name. He was dead. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Her body was shaking. She seemed to be splintering apart. Dead. Dead. Dead. He\u2019s dead\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Claire.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t move. She could barely breathe as the suite seemed to whirl around her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she stood there, shaking, naked, but the suite door opened eventually. Noah stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d He hurried toward her.</p><p>She still had the phone clenched in her hand.</p><p>\u201cClaire, what the hell is happening?\u201d</p><p>She tried to talk, but her tongue felt too thick in her mouth.</p><p>He yanked the phone from her. His fingers flew across the screen as he checked her call log. \u201cThat\u2019s the same number that called me before the explosion at the Claymire Hotel. That\u2019s Sloan Hall\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>Claire managed to shake her head. \u201cI...know his voice.\u201d A woman didn\u2019t forget the voice of the man who\u2019d wrecked her world.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Claire, I couldn\u2019t understand you.\u201d His hand closed around her shoulder. \u201cDammit, baby, you feel ice cold.\u201d</p><p>She was. \u201cHe said...I was his \u2018one and only\u2019\u2014he always said that.\u201d At first, those words had made her feel special.</p><p>Then they\u2019d made her terrified.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone, baby? Who was on the phone?\u201d</p><p>She stared into his eyes. \u201cEthan.\u201d</p><p>Noah immediately tried to call the number back.</p><p>\u201cI know it was him.\u201d She could hear his voice in her mind, looping endlessly. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>Noah had the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s going to come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Gwen, there\u2019s a package on your desk!\u201d</p><p>Gwen waved at the cop who\u2019d just passed her. \u201cThanks, John.\u201d She\u2019d worked a double shift, and she was dead tired. She just wanted to get home and curl up with\u2014and around\u2014Lane.</p><p>She strode to her desk. Gwen frowned at the big brown envelope there. No return address. \u201cHey, John, when was this\u2014\u201d</p><p>John was gone. And, at close to 4 a.m., the bullpen was deserted. Sighing, she opened the package. She should probably wait but that damn curiosity of hers never let her hold back.</p><p>She slit open the side of the envelope. Photographs tumbled out.</p><p>Claire Kramer.</p><p>Gwen easily recognized the other woman, even though the photos were grainy and dark. She thumbed through the images. About eight pictures.</p><p>At Senator Harrison\u2019s hotel in D.C. Gwen\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Claire was standing right outside of the hotel. The pictures were even date and time stamped for her.</p><p>The times could be faked, of course, but...</p><p>What if the images were legit?</p><p>Then Gwen got to the last photograph. According to the time stamp on it, the image had been captured ten minutes after the last shot of Claire.</p><p>There was a man in this picture. A man rushing into the senator\u2019s hotel. The image only showed the side of the man\u2019s face, but she recognized him, too.</p><p>Noah York.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d thought Claire had acted alone, but it looked like the lady had gotten some help from her lover. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Gwen said. She reached for her phone. It was time for her to use some of her own power in this town. Favors were owed to her, and it was time they were called in.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d Claire said as she stalked toward Noah\u2019s desk around noon.</p><p>He glanced up at her. Damn, but she looked good in black. \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying you were.\u201d</p><p>She was still wearing the bracelets he\u2019d given her. As far as Noah knew, Claire hadn\u2019t taken those bracelets off. Now, as soon as he found the perfect ring to match her eyes, they\u2019d be\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Ethan Harrison called me last night.\u201d</p><p>He had to be very careful here. \u201cA cemetery full of people saw him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what they saw. I heard him.\u201d Her hands slapped down on his desk. \u201cI need you to believe me. That whole engagement scene last night, it was designed to draw out the killer, right? Guess what? It worked even better than you\u2019d hoped. Ethan is the killer.

Alibis don\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe he hired someone to kill his father! I don\u2019t know how he did it.\u201d She gulped. \u201cI just know he called me. He called using Sloan\u2019s phone, so maybe he killed Sloan, too. He killed Sloan and he set the bomb and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah caught her hands. \u201cBreathe, baby.\u201d</p> <p>She sucked in a shuddering breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this again.\u201d</p><p>She was breaking his heart. He pulled her closer. Put her right against that aching heart. \u201cHe\u2019s gone. Whoever called last night\u2014hell, it\u2019s someone who was trying to mess with you.\u201d That someone would pay. \u201cThe guy who called you must\u2019ve got some of Ethan Harrison\u2019s recordings. Ethan did a ton of interviews over the years. With a little splicing, it would be easy enough to run his words together and make it seem like he was calling you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands pushed against his shoulders as she looked up at him. \u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo screw with your head.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p> <p>\u201cThink about the call. Did he respond to any questions that you asked him? Or was it just his voice? Rambling?\u201d Because Noah had even used a tactic like this one before, on an enemy when he needed to get a guard to back away. A little voice manipulation, some splicing of a recording, and bam, he\u2019d gotten exactly what he needed.</p><p>\u201cI said he was dead.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was leaden. \u201cAnd he asked if I thought death could keep him from me.\u201d</p><p>Rage surged within Noah, but he held tight to his control.</p><p>Claire\u2019s long lashes swept down. \u201cHe said there wouldn\u2019t be anyone else, not for him and not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at his door. A visitor was the last thing he wanted. \u201cNot now!\u201d</p> <p>But the door opened anyway. \u201cPayback,\u201d Trace muttered as he came inside. \u201cYou did the same thing to me once.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed on him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time, Trace. I need to talk with Claire.\u201d He had to chase the fear from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here about Claire.\u201d Trace\u2019s gaze slid to her. \u201cMy men tracked down Sloan Hall\u2019s phone.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Some damn progress.</p><p>\u201cDid you find Ethan?\u201d Claire asked, voice sharp.</p><p>Trace glanced at Noah.</p><p>Noah shook his head.</p><p>Trace cleared his throat. \u201cWe just found the phone. It had been left at the Hamlet Hotel.\u201d</p> <p>Fuck. The phone had been left at the same hotel Claire had stayed in when she first came to New York? The caller was definitely enjoying his head games.</p><p>\u201cI did some talking to the staff there,\u201d Trace continued with a slow nod. \u201cTurned out they remembered seeing a man who fit Sloan\u2019s description, right around the time Claire checked in to the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe trashed her room,\u201d Noah said. But that was exactly what Austin had told them.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Trace rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThere were no prints on the recovered phone. It had been wiped clean and dumped at the Hamlet\u2019s front desk.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cYou know the security at that place is crap, so, of course, no one saw anyone actually leave the phone.\u201d</p><p>That would have been too much to ask for.</p><p>Claire stepped away from Noah. \u201cDo you have agents down in Alabama?\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. \u201cI sent them down after I heard about the explosion at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they sure Ethan is dead?\u201d</p><p>Noah rubbed his chest. The ache there just got worse.</p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe he got out before the car exploded. Maybe he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in the back of the cop car,\u201d Trace said softly, \u201cso he wouldn\u2019t have been able to open those doors. He was trapped in there.\u201d</p><p>Her hands twisted together. \u201cI know his voice. That wasn\u2019t a recording last night. It was him. He called me!\u201d</p><p>Noah had to touch her again. He reached for Claire.</p><p>She flinched away.</p><p>That one move hurt. She hadn\u2019t pulled away from him, not since the beginning. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>She whirled to stare into his eyes. \u201cI need you to believe me. I\u2019ve believed you, everything you said, right from the beginning.\u201d Tears glinted in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, and he\u2019s going to come after me.\u201d</p><p>Then she started backing toward the door. \u201cI need to get away. He knows that I\u2019m at the Towers. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to run again.</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. He hated the fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou said you believed in me, right?\u201d Noah asked her. Did she even realize how important those words were to him?</p><p>Her head moved in a faint nod.</p><p>Trace silently watched them.</p><p>\u201cThen believe that I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Whoever called you, I\u2019m going to get him. I will stop him. You don\u2019t need to fear anything when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath slowly eased out. Some of the wild panic seemed to fade from her eyes.</p><p>But then there was another knock at his door. Dammit. Why was everyone trying to rush inside his office?</p><p>Before he could call out, the door opened. Jonathan, one of his administrative assistants, rushed inside. \u201cSir, I\u2019m so sorry. You said Mr. Weston was always clear and the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>Others?</p><p>A man and a woman came in behind Jonathan.</p><p>A tall, blond male. A petite and fierce woman\u2014he would recognize her dark glare anywhere. \u201cDetective Lazlo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It was a shark\u2019s smile.</p><p>Jonathan glanced around with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all, Jonathan,\u201d Noah said because he didn\u2019t want the guy hearing what was to come.</p><p>Jonathan scurried away and shut the door behind him as quickly as possible.</p><p>Noah\u2019s glance slid over Gwen Lazlo. She had an envelope in her hand. This isn\u2019t good. He caught Claire\u2019s hand. Pulled her closer to him. Trace had taken up a position to Noah\u2019s right. \u201cDetectives, what brings you both to New York, and so far away from your jurisdiction?\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s smile widened. \u201cI hear congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came this far to congratulate me? I\u2019m touched.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s attention focused on Claire. \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly look like a thrilled bride-to-be, though. What\u2019s wrong? Did you discover some not so great news about the soon-to-be-hubby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Claire hadn\u2019t tried to slip away from Noah again. Good.</p><p>Noah looked up and found the blond\u2019s gaze locked on him. Lane Scott. He\u2019d run a check on the guy. Both Lane and Gwen were supposed to be very good at their jobs. Honest cops who worked hard.</p><p>So why are they here?</p><p>Gwen lifted the envelope in her hand. \u201cI got a package last night. Seems someone in D.C. managed to take a few photos during your last stay in my city.\u201d</p><p>He knew this wasn\u2019t going to be good.</p><p>Gwen crossed the room and spilled the contents of the envelope on his desk. \u201cThis is you, Claire. Right in front of the senator\u2019s hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never went inside his hotel.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you did.\u201d Gwen\u2019s fingers brushed through the photographs.</p><p>Noah caught sight of the next image. Shit.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s index finger tapped on the picture of Noah\u2019s face. \u201cBut York here, he went inside.\u201d</p><p>Because Noah was staring at Claire when the detective made her announcement, he saw the ripple of shock that went over Claire\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you mentioning to us that you\u2019d been to see the senator right before he died,\u201d Lane murmured. \u201cWant to tell us why you didn\u2019t mention that fact before?\u201d</p><p>Not particularly, but it seemed like there wasn\u2019t a choice then. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him before he died.\u201d</p><p>Claire was staring down at the picture. He wondered what she was thinking. Keep believing in me, baby.</p><p>Her eyes rose. Met his.</p><p>\u201cI got to the hotel after he was dead. His door was open. I went inside, just a foot or two, and I saw him.\u201d He\u2019d intended to warn the senator off. To tell the man to stay the hell away from Claire.</p><p>But his warning hadn\u2019t been necessary.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to buy that story?\u201d Lane demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy whatever you want.\u201d Noah kept his voice mild, and he managed to drag his gaze off Claire. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Gwen was watching him with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re used to getting exactly what you want, aren\u2019t you, York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost days,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>Trace had stepped closer to stare down at the photos.</p><p>\u201cYou walk in,\u201d Lane\u2019s voice had roughened. \u201cYou find a dead body, and you don\u2019t call the cops? Bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked in,\u201d Noah said, \u201cI found the dead body, and I got worried.\u201d</p><p>Claire jerked.</p><p>\u201cWorried about Ms. Kramer?\u201d Gwen scooped up the photos. \u201cBecause you thought she\u2019d killed Harrison?\u201d</p><p>He had to give them the truth here. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Claire rocked back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d killed him, and my first instinct was to get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d Now Gwen\u2019s sharp-eyed stare raked him, then Claire. \u201cBecause Ms. Kramer has a history of instability, and you worried that the confrontation in the lobby had\u2014what? Driven her over the edge?\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s hands fisted at her sides.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure she was safe,\u201d Noah said. Damn, this sucked. He wanted to grab Claire and pull her close. He wanted\u2014</p><p>You\u2019re used to getting exactly what you want, aren\u2019t you? The detective\u2019s question had been spot-on.</p><p>Hell, yes, he was used to getting what he wanted. Noah shifted his body, and his hands curled around Claire\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered to me,\u201d he said as he stared into Claire\u2019s eyes. \u201cI want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if she\u2019d just killed a man?\u201d Lane asked in disbelief.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t take his gaze off Claire. \u201cI needed to find you and see that you were safe.\u201d His breath heaved out. \u201cYou were, and I realized damn fast that you hadn\u2019t killed the senator.\u201d His eyes searched hers. For once, Claire seemed closed off from him. He couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking or feeling and that drove him crazy. \u201cMy priority is protecting you, it has been from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Not because of some debt he owed.</p><p>Because she was...Claire.</p><p>\u201cAnother little interesting coincidence we found,\u201d Gwen announced, drawing Noah\u2019s attention. \u201cWhen I was down in Alabama, I met a man named Drake Archer.\u201d</p><p>Hell. Noah kept his hold on Claire as he waited for Gwen to drop another bombshell.</p><p>\u201cIt turned out the guy has a military record, one linked to you and...\u201d She inclined her head toward a silent Trace. \u201cYou, too, Mr. Weston. You are Trace Weston, correct? Because you look just like the pictures I saw online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Weston,\u201d Trace agreed. His expression could have been carved from stone.</p><p>Lane whistled. \u201cSeems you three were quite the deadly team back in the day.\u201d</p><p>Back then, and now.</p><p>Suspicion shone in Gwen\u2019s eyes. \u201cArcher had demolitions training. I\u2019m thinking it would be pretty easy for him to rig a car to explode.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it would be. Noah let his brows climb. \u201cSo now you think I\u2019ve got my friends killing, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you get what you want...just like I said before.\u201d She flashed another hard grin. \u201cThis time, though, I\u2019m about to get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrace...\u201d He growled his friend\u2019s name because he knew what was coming. \u201cStay with Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a person of interest in the murder of Senator Harrison.\u201d Gwen pulled a small, white envelope out of her jacket pocket. \u201cAnd I have the authority to take you in for additional questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to drag me back to D.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be dragging you down to the NYPD. We\u2019re cooperating with them, you see. Because we think the murders of a PI named Sloan Hall and Senator Harrison are connected. Same MO. And the ballistics match proved the killer used the same gun for both crimes.\u201d</p><p>Claire gave a frantic shake of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Noah didn\u2019t kill Sloan. He was with me! He didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery minute? Was he really with you every, single minute?\u201d Lane pressed, his doubt obvious. \u201cBecause I\u2019m betting he could have slipped away, and I think you know that, too.\u201d</p><p>Claire swallowed. \u201cNoah didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can just explain to us who did kill the senator and Sloan Hall...he can explain all that down at the NYPD.\u201d Lane slapped his hand on Noah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go, York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall my lawyer,\u201d Noah said to Trace. Because he knew the cops were about to go after him with every bit of power they had.</p><p>Lane pushed him past Claire.</p><p>\u201cStay with Trace,\u201d he told her. \u201cStay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d Worry darkened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d But he would be damned if he\u2019d leave her unprotected until he got this shit sorted out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes later, Noah found himself being pushed into the back of Lane and Gwen\u2019s unmarked car. At least it wasn\u2019t a patrol car, but he knew word about this incident would spread through the city like wildfire. Engaged one night, arrested the next. A scandal like that would make headlines.</p><p>The cops climbed in the front of the vehicle. Before Lane could turn the key, Noah drawled, \u201cAre you both really sure you want to go up against me?\u201d</p><p>Gwen glanced back at him. \u201cAm I supposed to be afraid of you?\u201d</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cWe do our jobs, and we don\u2019t care how much power you have.\u201d</p><p>Under other circumstances, Noah would like Gwen Lazlo. But since she was trying to toss his ass in jail... \u201cFair enough. But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Because they were about to find out just how much influence he had in the Big Apple.</p><p>For a moment, Claire stood frozen in Noah\u2019s office. No, that hadn\u2019t just happened. As the shock faded, she turned and rushed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Trace grabbed her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go after them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re arresting him. For murder!\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d thought I killed Senator Harrison? Noah had thought she was a killer, and he\u2019d still protected her.</p><p>Trace shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re not arresting him. They\u2019re questioning Noah. The cops think they can push him into making some kind of mistake.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Noah well.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone. Called a lawyer. She tried to stop her knees from shaking. When he ended the call, Claire blurted, \u201cThey don\u2019t know Noah well, but you do.\u201d I thought I did, too.</p><p>Trace put the phone back into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the man survive hours of torture, and he never broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes slid over her face. \u201cBut I guess Noah doesn\u2019t want you knowing about that time, does he? I never wanted it touching Skye, either.\u201d</p><p>Her head was about to explode. \u201cWhen was Noah tortured?\u201d The idea of him being hurt that way made her sick.</p><p>\u201cIn one way or another, I think the guy\u2019s been tortured most of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really shitty answer,\u201d Claire snapped, fed up and pushed too far.</p><p>Trace blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cWho hurt Noah?\u201d Because she had the fierce desire to hurt them right back.</p><p>\u201cOne of our missions went to hell. Noah paid the price.\u201d</p><p>Her icy breath chilled her lungs.</p> <p>\u201cNoah has seen more death than most people can imagine, and because of that, the guy doesn\u2019t get real close to other people.\u201d</p><p>Neither did she, or at least she hadn\u2019t, until Noah. \u201cAnd he holds tight to his control.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. \u201cNoticed that, huh?\u201d</p><p>It was hard not to notice it.</p><p>\u201cConsider his control a good thing,\u201d Trace told her. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen him lose it before, and when Noah breaks...\u201d He gave a long sigh. \u201cMen die.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him. \u201cThat was war. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah values his control more than he values anything else, because he knows how dangerous he is without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Was he trying to scare her? Test her?</p><p>\u201cBecause I think you need to know exactly who you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. Noah had just been hauled away by cops. They should both be rushing out after him, but Trace was locking his steely gaze on her. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle him, all of him, then you need to pull back.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Pulling back wasn\u2019t an option. Noah needed her then.</p><p>\u201cI see what\u2019s happening between you. It may already be too late for him, and if you can\u2019t take him\u2014all of him\u2014then you\u2019ll wreck him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019d never hurt Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that? Because I saw your face when you looked at that photo of him at the senator\u2019s hotel. For an instant, you were terrified.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cYou thought he might have killed, and terror consumed you. He thought that you might have done the same thing, and he protected you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! It\u2019s not the same\u2014you don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that Noah is my friend. And the biggest threat that the man has ever faced...she\u2019s standing right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Claire straightened her spine. Focused on trying to calm her racing heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. And you don\u2019t know how Noah is with me.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let this man intimidate her. \u201cAnd now you need to get out of my way because I\u2019m not just going to stay in this place while he gets questioned. He was with me when Sloan was killed. Every minute.\u201d Trace wisely backed away. She marched for the door. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make those cops believe me.\u201d</p><p>Trace called her name, but Claire didn\u2019t stop. She hurried through the hotel. Ran by the doormen. The street outside was so busy. Packed with cars. She raised her hand, ready to hail her own taxi, and her gaze flew around the area as\u2014</p><p>Ethan Harrison.</p><p>He was standing across the street from the hotel. His hands were shoved into the pockets of the long, black coat that he wore. His eyes\u2014his eyes were on her. He was watching her.</p><p>Then he smiled.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Trace yelled from behind her.</p><p>Ethan turned away.</p><p>Trace\u2019s hand closed over her shoulder. \u201cClaire, come on, look, I\u2019ll get us down to the station\u2014\u201d</p><p>She yanked away from him and ran into the street. \u201cEthan!\u201d Cars honked. Brakes squealed. Trace roared her name.</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>She ran faster, and Claire could see him\u2014</p><p>She was shoved through the air. Claire slammed onto the cement with an impact that rattled her bones.</p><p>Trace rolled her over, swearing. \u201cDammit, Claire, that car almost hit you!\u201d His hands patted over her body. \u201cAre you hurt? I didn\u2019t think I was going to get to you in time.\u201d</p><p>She shoved his hands off her, shoved him off her, and leapt to her feet. \u201cEthan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d Trace echoed.</p><p>Not bothering to respond, Claire ran down the sidewalk. There were so many people. So many\u2014but where was Ethan? Where had he gone?</p><p>\u201cHe was here,\u201d Claire whispered. \u201cHe is here. I just have to find him.\u201d She whirled around. Looked to the left. The right. Bodies passed her in a blur as she kept searching for the man with the bright blond hair.</p><p>The man who should be dead.</p><p>Two New York detectives had joined the little party. One of the guys was named Sean Fuller, and the other guy, well, he hadn\u2019t volunteered his name.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Gwen pulled out the chair across from him. She was obviously the leader of the party. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we cut through the bull?\u201d</p><p>He was seated at a wobbly little table in an interrogation room. They\u2019d put a cup of coffee in front of him. The air blew overhead in a too-cold stream.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>His smile seemed to make her hesitate. She probably expected him to be nervous. Bring the tycoon downtown, throw him in interrogation, make him crack. Yes, he was sure that had been the general plan.</p><p>That plan was screwed.</p><p>\u201cI want to know...would you kill for Claire Kramer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gwen blinked.</p><p>\u201cBut have I killed for her?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Gwen and Lane shared a long look. \u201cSo you\u2019re planning to kill?\u201d Gwen asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to keep Claire safe. Someone planted a bomb at one of my hotels recently. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of that.\u201d The news had been flashed in a constant stream on TV. \u201cI won\u2019t just stand by while someone tries to hurt my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Noah figured he had about ten more minutes before his lawyer burst in, so he\u2019d keep playing this game a bit longer.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your visit to Senator Harrison\u2019s hotel room in D.C.,\u201d Gwen directed.</p><p>Sighing, Noah leaned forward. \u201cThe guy was being a total dick. Seemed to me like he was borderline insane. That insanity must run in the Harrison family.\u201d</p><p>Lane grunted.</p><p>The two New York detectives just frowned. Ah, are you two holding back because you just want me to be pissed at your D.C. counterparts? Worried I\u2019ll come after you? Because the New York cops did look nervous as they glanced his way. One of the guys had even started to sweat.</p><p>Noah stretched and took his time answering. \u201cI wanted to deliver a personal message to Colby Harrison. The senator needed to realize that he wouldn\u2019t be able to threaten or harass Claire ever again.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyebrows arched. \u201cAnd had he been harassing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He kept his hands flat on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s where Sloan Hall came in. The Harrisons hired him to keep watch on Claire. For years, they\u2019ve been stalking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that pissed you off,\u201d Lane tossed out. \u201cKnowing they were trying to hurt your lady.\u201d</p><p>Pissed didn\u2019t begin to cover the way he felt.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess it\u2019s no wonder you shot the senator and Sloan Hall,\u201d Lane continued as he rubbed his chin. \u201cYou wanted to make sure they didn\u2019t hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s fingers tapped on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t understand...\u201d</p><p>Noah waited for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you meet Claire Kramer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months ago, in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? It was love at first sight?\u201d Her words mocked the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening for a guy like you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her again. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the romantic sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the intense sort. You\u2019re also the sort who goes from woman to woman, night after night.\u201d</p><p>His reputation sure seemed to get around. Had the lady been talking to Drake? \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...not anymore...not since Claire.\u201d She tilted her head to the right and a line appeared between her brows. \u201cWhat is it about her? Why the change for Ms. Kramer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s a survivor. I admire that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a survivor, too?\u201d</p><p>Ah, he should have seen that coming.</p><p>Gwen rifled through some files that waited on the table. \u201cYou survived your parents\u2019 death, didn\u2019t you? You were the only survivor when the boat sank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and Claire...it\u2019s like to like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Gwen gave a little frustrated growl. \u201cSurvivor to survivor. You both lost the ones closest to you, and you had to keep going.\u201d</p><p>That door was going to open any second but he\u2019d humor the lady a bit longer. \u201cI\u2019m with Claire because she\u2019s what I need.\u201d After so many years of going through the motions of life, she actually made him feel alive. She made him want to start thinking about a future.</p><p>\u201cAnd are you what Claire needs? Someone who is willing to...kill for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she have that before?\u201d Lane questioned, the words rapping out.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze cut to his. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there with me.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Lane\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cDon\u2019t I? There were lots of stories circulating about Claire Kramer. Her parents were too strict, and they didn\u2019t want her seeing her lover, so she decided to just get rid of them. She slipped away, giving herself the perfect alibi, and she got her lover to come and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah started laughing. \u201cThere went your badge.\u201d</p><p>Lane\u2019s smile vanished.</p><p>\u201cYou should be careful what you say about Claire,\u201d Noah continued. His voice had dropped to a lethal softness. \u201cI have a very long memory, and I don\u2019t forgive easily.\u201d</p><p>Lane\u2019s eyes turned to slits. \u201cYou threatening me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that you want to ask your questions. Nailing me for these murders would probably make all your damn careers, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Noah rose. \u201cAnd if you keep screwing with me, you will find yourself without any career.\u201d</p><p>The door opened. Only his lawyer didn\u2019t stand there. Claire did. Her eyes were big, haunted, and her face was far too pale. Trace was right beside her. The guy\u2019s lip was bleeding, and he had scratches on the side of his face. What. The. Hell?</p><p>\u201cNoah didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Claire announced. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill Sloan Hall.\u201d Her words tumbled together because she was speaking so quickly. \u201cEthan Harrison did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d Claire asked as she turned to face Gwen Laszlo. The detective had taken Claire back to York Towers, and they were just entering the suite that Claire shared with Noah.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re under a lot of stress.\u201d Gwen pushed back her shoulders, and Claire saw the gun holster on the detective\u2019s side. \u201cI was there when the patrol car exploded. You can trust me on this. Ethan Harrison is in hell right now.\u201d</p><p>The cops had sent a team to search the streets near York Towers. They\u2019d searched for several hours. Turned up nothing. Claire had been the only one to see Ethan. Even Trace hadn\u2019t noticed the guy.</p><p>Noah was downstairs in the lobby. The cops had finally let him go, and Claire needed him to hurry up there so they could talk. He\u2019ll believe me this time.</p><p>\u201cYou came up here because you wanted to question me,\u201d Claire said wearily as she shoved back her hair. \u201cWe both know that\u2019s your plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gwen searched her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m seeing dead men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a very dangerous taste in men.\u201d</p> <p>Claire flinched. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d She turned and started pacing toward the window. She eased out of her coat, tossed it onto the couch. She started to remove her gloves. \u201cI don\u2019t have...\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s words trailed away. Her picture was on the floor. The picture of Claire, Sara, and her parents\u2014the only thing that had been salvaged from her time at the Hamlet Hotel. The frame was gone, and the photo...there were large X\u2019s on all the faces. An X on Sara\u2019s face. An X on Claire\u2019s mother. An X on her father.</p><p>An X on me.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Gwen continued. \u201cI\u2019m worried because you could be in trouble, and you don\u2019t even realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the photo from the floor. \u201cHe was here.\u201d She whirled toward Gwen. \u201cHe was here\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Claire saw the gun. The one aimed right at the back of Gwen\u2019s head. Gwen was looking at Claire. The detective didn\u2019t see the threat behind her.</p><p>Claire screamed and lunged forward. Her body collided with Gwen\u2019s and they slammed into the floor. There was no explosion of sound, no blast as the gun fired but...</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Claire whispered. She\u2019d tried to move so fast. Her trembling hand touched Gwen\u2019s head, and she felt the sticky wetness of blood.</p><p>There was no blast because a silencer was on the gun.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t fast enough, Claire.\u201d The dark, rumbling voice mocked her.</p><p>She looked up and saw that, this time, the gun was pointed straight at her.</p> <p>Noah paused in front of the elevator. \u201cYou coming up, detective?\u201d</p><p>Lane gave him a grim smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ll wait down here. There are a few of your staff members that I wanted to chat with.\u201d</p><p>The guy was so obvious. \u201cI know you came to grill them, just like I know your partner is up there questioning Claire right now.\u201d The cop was probably trying to make Claire feel more comfortable by questioning her in a place that would put Claire at ease.</p><p>No interrogation room for her, huh? Trying a different approach?</p><p>Lane seemed to brace his body as he studied Noah. \u201cYour lawyer got you out of there, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get your ass back on a plane to D.C.,\u201d Noah told him bluntly. He stepped onto the elevator. \u201cI think you\u2019ve worn out your welcome in New York.\u201d</p><p>The doors began to close.</p><p>Lane\u2019s hand flew out and stopped that closure as he curled his fingers around the door on the left. \u201cDo you think Claire saw Ethan Harrison today?\u201d</p> <p>Noah stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if my lover told me that the man who tried to kill her, the man who murdered her parents...if she told me that asshole had been in town, standing less than thirty feet from her, I\u2019d freak the hell out,\u201d Lane said.</p><p>\u201cMove your hand.\u201d Or I\u2019ll move it for you.</p><p>\u201cBut your buddy Weston didn\u2019t see the guy, did he? Just Claire, and I don\u2019t exactly see you freaking the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not the type to do that.\u201d I need to get upstairs to Claire.</p><p>\u201cOr else you don\u2019t believe her. Do you think she\u2019s having another breakdown? Is all the stress too much for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire isn\u2019t going to break.\u201d Anger hummed in his words.</p><p>\u201cShe did before. And they barely got her to the hospital in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove. Your. Hand.\u201d</p><p>Lane shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me.\u201d</p><p>The sonofabitch was pushing too far\u2014</p><p>\u201cMr. York!\u201d Janelle\u2019s frantic voice caught Noah\u2019s attention. He looked over Lane\u2019s shoulder and saw Janelle, running toward him. All of the color was gone from her face.</p><p>Noah shoved Lane out of his way. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cG-Greg...one of our bellmen...I just found him...\u201d Janelle\u2019s fingers were shaking as she pointed toward the staff door on the far right. \u201cSomeone shot him. In the head. H-he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Lane immediately lunged toward the staff door.</p><p>But Noah spun around and leapt back into the elevator.</p><p>He only had one thought.</p><p>Claire.</p><p>The light glinted off the gunman\u2019s blond hair. His green eyes gleamed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re on your knees again, Claire, and there\u2019s a gun pointed at your head. Brings back memories, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her left hand was still pressed to Gwen\u2019s head, but her right was beside the cop\u2019s body. Just inches from Gwen\u2019s holster. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Claire whispered as she looked up at the killer\u2014</p><p>Not Ethan Harrison.</p><p>Austin. Austin Harrison.</p><p>The good brother smiled down at her. \u201cYou ruined my life, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Rage flashed across his face. \u201cYes! You did! You destroyed everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I never wanted Ethan to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay his name again, and I\u2019ll put a bullet in your brain.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the gun. A long silencer covered the tip of the weapon. \u201cAren\u2019t you planning to do that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually...no.\u201d He motioned with the weapon. \u201cGet up. I\u2019m not my brother. I don\u2019t need you to beg me.\u201d</p><p>She rose. Claire kept her right hand behind the leg of her pants.</p><p>\u201cYou just killed a cop.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou should never have gotten out of that mental health facility all those years ago. You just aren\u2019t well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking killed me!\u201d His rage exploded again. \u201cYou ruined my life! My family lost everything because of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my family,\u201d Claire said, keeping her voice low. He didn\u2019t realize that Gwen was still alive. Claire did. The blood matted Gwen\u2019s hair, but the wound wasn\u2019t deep. Claire had knocked the cop aside in time. The bullet had grazed over her, but it hadn\u2019t driven into Gwen\u2019s skull. She just needed to keep Austin from realizing that Gwen was still alive. Because if he discovered the truth, Claire knew he\u2019d shoot the cop again in an instant.</p><p>\u201cYour family was trash. They didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. Don\u2019t talk about my family that way. \u201cThey weren\u2019t murderers so I\u2019d say they mattered a whole hell of a lot more than the Harrison clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have just let him screw you! Until he was done!\u201d Spittle flew from Austin\u2019s mouth. \u201cThen he would\u2019ve walked away. Ethan liked to be the one to leave. It gave him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower,\u201d Claire finished.</p><p>Because power was so important to the Harrisons.</p><p>\u201cYou broke him. And when Ethan fell, he took my father down with him.\u201d His smile flashed again, chilling her. \u201cOf course, the old man always was a twisted bastard. Didn\u2019t realize quite how much, not until Ethan told me...\u201d</p><p>The gun was inches from her chest.</p><p>\u201cWalk toward the balcony.\u201d He jerked the weapon toward the balcony door. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal view out there. A real helpful bellman let me see it earlier. I flashed some cash and got a free pass up here.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cDid I mention that folks here are bribed too easily? No matter. I made sure to tie up those loose ends this time.\u201d</p><p>Claire walked, backward, toward the balcony. Her hands were still down.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to be president.\u201d A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cI was groomed for that position. I spent so many years being perfect for that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cThen the dream was gone. Scandal was all my family knew. Scandal because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014I thought you wanted to help me. In the hospital...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to vanish. I figured that if you disappeared, there would still be some hope for me.\u201d</p><p>Claire opened the door and slipped out onto the balcony. It was cold out there, and the wind sent her hair whipping around her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a killer view, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Austin asked as he followed her out.</p><p>Claire glanced over and saw the lights of the city below. Killer.</p><p>\u201cMy father drained our fortune tracking you. Trying to free Ethan. He used all of his money, and even though I was working my ass off, he took mine, too, and I had nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin, you\u2014you don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I need to do. I need to get rid of the problems in my life. I need to be free. It\u2019s time for my new start.\u201d His shoulders straightened. His hold on the gun was rock-steady. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing, you see. Cleaning house. My father was a dead weight, so I had to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Her breath choked out.</p><p>\u201cHe never would\u2019ve stopped. He would have bled me bone dry as he tried to free Ethan, but that just couldn\u2019t happen. If Ethan ever got out, hell, he\u2019d go after you again, and the scandal would be even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here with a gun. You just shot a cop.\u201d He\u2019s crazy. \u201cYou think the scandal isn\u2019t going to be bad from this? You need to think again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAh, Claire, I didn\u2019t shoot a cop. You did.\u201d He lifted the gun, and she saw that he wore black gloves. \u201cNo fingerprints from me, and you...you\u2019re wearing gloves right now because it was cold outside and you didn\u2019t get the chance to take them off when you came back to the suite.\u201d</p><p>He was right.</p><p>\u201cYou shot the cop because she realized you had killed Senator Harrison and his PI, Sloan. And after you shot her, you panicked. You knew there was no escape, so you did the only thing you could do...you then took your own life.\u201d</p><p>A dull ringing filled Claire\u2019s ears. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried suicide before. You just didn\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d He nodded toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll do better this time. A jump from this height will make sure you end up in the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you said you had help in the hotel.\u201d A bellman. \u201cThe cops will find him. The cops will get him to talk and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>His words had her heartbeat stuttering.</p><p>\u201cAnd, by the way,\u201d he added darkly, \u201cyou killed the bellman, too. Even used this same gun for the crime.\u201d</p><p>Claire wouldn\u2019t look over the edge of the balcony again. \u201cWhy would I have killed him? I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Claire. You\u2019ve been seeing my dead brother this week. Getting phone calls from him.\u201d He laughed. \u201cTalk about perfect timing! When I heard that shit, I couldn\u2019t believe how wonderfully things were falling into place.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat shook her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it. You are. You killed all those folks. And now, you\u2019re going to jump over the edge of that balcony, and you\u2019re going to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt enough people.\u201d He advanced toward her with slow, gliding steps. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the nightmare to be over. You caused all of this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll be the one to end it.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself. Where was Noah? He\u2019d been downstairs, talking with Lane. Noah should be coming up to the suite at any moment.</p><p>Would Austin shoot Noah, too?</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t let that happen. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d His grin flashed. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll go downstairs. I\u2019ll find your lover. And I\u2019ll put a bullet in his brain.\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped down Claire\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou were the one who planted the bomb at his other hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His brows rose. \u201cDamn, maybe you are crazy.\u201d</p><p>No, he was. \u201cYou\u2019ve been planning to kill Noah all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou destroyed everything, Claire! I had a great future. I could\u2019ve had\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire lifted the gun that she\u2019d taken from Gwen\u2019s holster. She\u2019d hidden that gun so carefully.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>Austin\u2019s mouth hung open as he stared at the weapon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going over that balcony,\u201d Claire told him. The weapon was shaking in her grip. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to hurt Noah.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dipped to the weapon, then back to her face. He laughed at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have what it takes to pull that trigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Actually, it was taking all of her strength not to pull it right then. \u201cI\u2019ve lost everyone close to me. My parents. My sister. I won\u2019t lose Noah. I\u2019d do anything to protect him.\u201d Claire pulled in a deep breath. \u201cSo drop your weapon, or I will shoot you.\u201d</p><p>He took another step toward her. \u201cYou bitch! You don\u2019t get to tell me what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Noah\u2019s roar reached them, spilling through the open balcony door.</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t take her eyes off Austin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be arrested,\u201d Claire told him. \u201cGwen\u2019s not dead. She\u2019ll recover. She\u2019ll tell everyone it wasn\u2019t me who shot her. She\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to jail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. You\u2019re going to jail just like Ethan did. Your whole family\u2014you\u2019re the crazy ones!\u201d</p><p>Then Noah was there. He ran onto the balcony. \u201cClaire!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Austin whirled toward Noah.

Not this time!\u201d</p><p>She tried to look back, but Noah grabbed Claire and shoved her behind him.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you escape,\u201d Austin shouted.</p><p>Noah had put his body in front of Claire. He\u2019d yanked the gun from her hand.</p><p>Gunshots filled the night.</p><p>But...</p> <p>Austin\u2019s gun had been equipped with a silencer. She shouldn\u2019t have been able to hear so many shots. Claire craned her neck to see around Noah.</p><p>\u201cNo one shoots my partner.\u201d</p><p>She looked to the left. Lane was there, standing on the balcony, his weapon still drawn. Pointed at Austin.</p><p>Her gaze flew back to Austin. He was on his feet, but staggering. Under the lights of the balcony, she could see the dark balloon of blood on his chest. From several wounds.</p><p>Noah had a gun aimed at Austin, too. Noah and Lane had both shot the guy. That was why she\u2019d heard the sound of so many gunshots.</p><p>Austin sank to his knees. \u201cClaire...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she whispered back to him.</p><p>And, he did. Austin tumbled back, and the blood pooled beneath him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s head turned at the husky words. Gwen had just been loaded onto a stretcher, and Lane was right beside her, holding tightly to her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely a scratch, love,\u201d Lane told her. \u201cJust another kick-ass battle wound for you to show off to the guys back in D.C.\u201d</p><p>Claire stepped toward them. Gwen\u2019s eyes were open. She whispered something to Lane\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he told her as he bent to kiss her hand.</p><p>Then the EMTs wheeled Gwen out of the suite. Claire watched her go, frozen, heart-sick. Gwen had been hurt because of her. A hotel bellman had been found with a gunshot wound to the head. When Austin had said that he had tied up loose ends, the sonofabitch had meant it.</p><p>His body was still out on the balcony. Cops and crime scene techs swarmed around him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d At the gruff question, Claire looked up and found Drake standing near the doorway.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cClaire...\u201d He sighed her name. \u201cStop trying to bullshit me.\u201d Then she found herself being yanked into his arms. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to shatter.\u201d</p><p>She felt that way. \u201cI-I thought Austin wasn\u2019t like them.\u201d Maybe that was what hurt the most.</p><p>\u201cNoah wants you out of here.\u201d Easing back, Drake stared down at her. \u201cHe has to talk with the cops, but he wanted me to take you downstairs so you\u2019d be safe.\u201d</p><p>And all she wanted was...Noah.</p><p>She\u2019d told him that she loved him. She hadn\u2019t meant for those words to spill out. In that one instant, she\u2019d just been so afraid and her guard had lowered.</p><p>\u201cThe cops will want to talk with me, too.\u201d Her gaze darted back to the balcony. Noah was out there with the cops.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Claire. You don\u2019t need to\u2014hell, you don\u2019t need to watch them bring out the body.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t want to watch that. \u201cNoah killed him.\u201d Her voice was just for his ears. \u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me they didn\u2019t know yet if Lane\u2019s bullet or his ended the bastard. Either way, I figure it\u2019s good riddance.\u201d He turned, and with a steady hold on her, Drake led her to the door.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back when they slipped out of that suite. The EMTs and Gwen were already gone. Claire glanced down and realized she still had blood on her hands.</p><p>A few moments later, the elevator dinged. She and Drake slipped inside when the doors parted. Then, as soon as they were alone and on their way down, Claire confessed, \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to do it.\u201d</p><p>Drake lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted Noah to kill for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a gulp of air. \u201cWhy did it have to happen like this?\u201d</p><p>With his eyes on her, Drake shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible, got it? Austin Harrison is to blame. The man was twisted, and he needed to be put down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, it is. And for Noah, the choice was kill or be killed. He did just what he\u2019d been trained to do.\u201d</p><p>I love you.</p><p>She stared at her blood-stained hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s up to you and Noah.\u201d</p><p>Noah hadn\u2019t said much. That was the problem. After Austin had fallen, Noah had pushed her inside the suite as fast as he could. His hands had roamed over her, checking for injuries, and when he\u2019d been satisfied that she was unharmed, he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>I love you. \u201cI think I made a mistake.\u201d She straightened her shoulders.</p><p>The elevator stopped. The doors opened, and she hurried to exit. But Drake caught her shoulder. \u201cWhat mistake?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, Claire looked over at him. \u201cI fell for Noah.\u201d He\u2019d gotten right past her guard. \u201cAustin wanted to hurt him. I couldn\u2019t let that happen. I-I was the one to fire the first shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were saving Noah.\u201d</p><p>She had saved him, barely. Austin\u2019s bullet hadn\u2019t hit Noah. She licked her lips. \u201cI shot first because I love Noah.\u201d</p><p>And everyone I love gets hurt.</p><p>\u201cAustin Harrison.\u201d Lane shook his head as he watched the body get bagged and tagged. \u201cNever seen crazy run in a family as much as it did in that one.\u201d</p><p>A thick knot of tension curled at the top of Noah\u2019s spine. \u201cHe was going to kill Claire.\u201d Every time he thought of just how close he\u2019d come to losing her...I\u2019ll have nightmares forever about that moment.</p><p>His hands fisted.</p><p>When he\u2019d rushed into the suite, he\u2019d found Gwen on the floor. There\u2019d been so much blood around her, but her eyes had been opening. She\u2019d been whispering for Claire.</p><p>Noah had been shouting for her.</p><p>He\u2019d burst onto that balcony. Seen Austin with his gun\u2014</p><p>Then Claire fired. Her bullet had found its mark, and Austin\u2019s shot had gone wild.</p><p>She\u2019d fired and then run right into Noah\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cI think Claire is finally going to be free,\u201d Lane said, his eyes still on the black body bag. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any Harrisons left to try and wreck her life anymore.\u201d</p><p>So it would seem.</p><p>\u201cThe New York detectives are going to be taking over.\u201d Lane finally pulled his gaze off the body bag and inclined his head toward the two suits in the corner. \u201cThe press will go wild, but I figure a guy like you is used to handling the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but Claire isn\u2019t.\u201d His eyes locked on the New York detectives. \u201cAfter we answer their questions, I\u2019m going to take Claire away from the city. I don\u2019t want her steps dogged by every reporter within a fifty mile radius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do the same damn thing in your position.\u201d Lane offered his hand. \u201cI know we didn\u2019t exactly get off on the right foot, York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because you thought I was a killer?\u201d Noah took his hand. Shook it once.</p><p>\u201cHell, I know you\u2019re a killer. I\u2019ve got friends at the Pentagon, so I got my hands on your military records.\u201d Lane gave him a hard grin. \u201cI mean because I thought you were a pompous rich jerk who was playing games in my city.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cI like you, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you respect me, and that\u2019s just as good.\u201d Lane hesitated. \u201cI really hope my bullet was the one that ended that bastard\u2019s life.\u201d His jaw hardened. \u201cNo one hurts my Gwen.\u201d</p><p>And no one hurts Claire.</p><p>Noah realized that he and the detective had quite a few things in common.</p><p>When the detective walked away, Noah glanced around the suite. He\u2019d seen Drake leading Claire away minutes before, and he was glad that she had escaped from the death that clung to that place. Claire had seen enough death.</p><p>It was time for her to live.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Those words had been so soft that Noah hadn\u2019t been sure he\u2019d heard them, not at first. Then he\u2019d looked into Claire\u2019s eyes and seen her love.</p><p>\u201cMr. York?\u201d</p><p>He glanced to the right. One of the New York detectives was coming toward him. More questions. He and Claire would both have their turn being grilled. But as soon as they got the all-clear...</p><p>I\u2019ll get you out of here, Claire. They\u2019d go back to the Hamptons. They\u2019d walk on the beach. Fuck on the balcony.</p><p>Live.</p><p>And there wouldn\u2019t be any more fear for Claire. Because Noah wasn\u2019t going to let her out of his sight anytime soon.</p><p>Seeing her on that balcony had scared a good fifteen\u2014twenty?\u2014years of his life away. In that one instant, when Austin had swung with his gun up, Noah had realized one very, very important fact.</p><p>I can\u2019t live without Claire.</p><p>Love or obsession? Claire had asked the question once. She\u2019d wondered if there was a difference between the two things.</p><p>For a while now, Noah had thought that he would kill for her.</p><p>Yet in that one, desperate moment, he\u2019d been ready to die for her.</p><p>Love, Claire. It\u2019s love, not just obsession.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The last twenty-four hours had been hell. Claire climbed the steps to Noah\u2019s beach house, feeling exhaustion pressing over every inch of her body.</p><p>There had been questions. Then more questions. Detectives who grilled her. Detectives who seemed to comfort her.</p><p>There had been reporters. Dozens of them. Camped out around the hotel. Waiting outside of the police station.</p><p>They\u2019d shouted at her. Snapped images.</p><p>She\u2019d already seen a few newspaper headlines. Another Harrison Driven to Kill?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t driven Austin to do anything.</p><p>But the press loved a story about sex and murder. Claire knew she\u2019d be in the headlines for a long time to come.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Noah\u2019s fingers brushed over her arm. She realized that she\u2019d just stopped in front of the door. \u201cBaby, what is it?\u201d He turned her in his arms so that she stared up at him.</p><p>Night had fallen again, but the house was lit. Gleaming from within. Noah had called his caretaker earlier and told him to prepare the house.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d wanted her to have a place to hide. Escape. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my nightmare spilled over onto you. Sometimes, I know you have to wish that I\u2019d never walked into your hotel.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI never wish that. The day you walked into my hotel was one of the best days of my life.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>His head lowered toward her, and Noah\u2019s lips took hers. The kiss was long, slow, and so thorough. So...Noah.</p><p>When he ended the kiss, he stared down at her with eyes that seemed to blaze with emotion. The problem was that Claire couldn\u2019t read that emotion. Need? Lust? Or something more?</p><p>She wanted it be to something more so badly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside, or I\u2019ll take you right here.\u201d</p><p>Her own eyes widened at that, and Claire hurried to get inside the beach house. Noah locked the door behind her, and she stopped by the couch, wondering\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said the words like an accusation. Claire turned and blinked at him. \u201cI, um, didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d She\u2019d been trying to save him.</p><p>\u201cYou shot Austin. A damn ballsy move, but then you ran toward me.\u201d His eyes glinted. \u201cThe guy still had his weapon. I could see him trying to get it up and aimed, and you were between him and me. He could\u2019ve shot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t his plan.\u201d Noah hadn\u2019t been there when the cops questioned her so he didn\u2019t realize... \u201cHe wanted me to jump from the balcony. A bullet to my head wouldn\u2019t have worked with the suicide story he was trying to create.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke once, so he thought everyone would easily buy the story that I broke again.\u201d</p><p>Only about five feet separated her and Noah. He started walking toward her, stalking forward, and he eliminated that space quickly. His fingers closed around her shoulders. \u201cI never would\u2019ve bought that story.\u201d</p><p>Still trying to understand the emotion in his eyes, Claire searched his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been afraid for a long time. Not in the military. Not during my...extra stints with Trace and Drake. Hell, not since that boat sank and my world changed. I was afraid then. Fucking terrified, and there was nothing I could do to save the people I loved most.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned to kill the man who was after you.\u201d He said this bluntly, easily, as if death didn\u2019t matter to him. \u201cIt was an easy choice. Someone was hurting you. I had to stop him. So I used the engagement, thinking that it would draw him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt drew him to come after you, not me.\u201d His hold on her tightened. \u201cThat was never what I intended. I never wanted you to be hurt or to be afraid or\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, cutting through his words. And she did.</p><p>But Noah shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve screwed up a lot with you. Made mistakes. Blundered my way around, and that\u2019s not my way. I can usually charm women, but when I\u2019m with you, I feel like I can barely speak sometimes.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like Noah. \u201cYou seem so confident to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. Most days with you, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what I can do to keep you close.\u201d He exhaled slowly. \u201cAfter we met in Chicago, I...wanted to see you again. But you vanished after Sara\u2019s funeral. You just disappeared. I figured that was a sign you weren\u2019t interested in me, and that I should just forget about you.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut you\u2019re not easy to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d She\u2019d tried to forget him after Chicago, but he\u2019d started to slip into her dreams. He\u2019d made her feel, made her fantasize, and that had terrified her. So she\u2019d run. Tried to start a new life\u2014only that hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you walked into my hotel in New York, I knew the instant I saw you that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to let you go. I was going to do anything necessary in order to get you to stay in my bed and in my life.\u201d</p><p>Claire lifted her hand. Pressed it to his chest. She was still wearing the bracelets he\u2019d given her, and the diamonds gleamed. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you, I\u2019m talking about forever.\u201d</p> <p>Now it was hard for her to breathe. \u201cYou...you heard me when I said that I loved you.\u201d That was why he was doing this. He felt like he\u2019d put her in danger with the engagement, and he was trying to make up\u2014</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I heard you. Those were the most important words of my life. Do you really think I wouldn\u2019t hear them?\u201d Then he dropped before her, sliding down on one knee.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to breathe. It was impossible. Claire had just stopped breathing entirely.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you, Claire Kramer. This isn\u2019t some bullshit fake engagement. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d Claire felt her heart thundering in her chest. \u201cThe Press. You know what they\u2019ll say about me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew them. I don\u2019t give a damn about them or what they have to say.\u201d His fingers slid over the bracelet on her left wrist. \u201cI care about you. I love you. Enough to kill for you. Enough to die for you. And, baby, enough to live for you, too. That\u2019s what I want to do. I want us to live together and make love and be happy for the next fifty years.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded so good. So perfect. \u201cEveryone I love...they all die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, Claire. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019ll be right by your side, from here on out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes burned, and Claire had to blink away tears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Her fear. Her weakness\u2014him. She loved him so much. And it was love, not obsession. Loving him...she wanted to put him first. Wanted him to be happy. Safe.</p><p>Loving him gave her hope. Without Noah, Claire didn\u2019t know what would happen to her.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d Then he reached into the pocket of his coat. Pulled out a small, black box. When he opened that box, Claire saw a huge, blue diamond ring nestled inside. A ring to match her bracelets. To match... \u201cJust like your eyes,\u201d Noah told her.</p><p>He was on his knees. Offering her everything that she had ever wanted.</p><p>And fear was there. Surrounding Claire. Choking her.</p><p>I lose everyone.</p> <p>She stared into his eyes, and in that moment, Claire was finally able to read the emotion there. It was the emotion that had always been in his gaze, but she\u2019d been too scared to see it for what it was.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Noah loved her.</p><p>And she loved him. \u201cYes,\u201d Claire whispered, and she threw herself against him. Noah fell back. They both hit the floor, but Claire didn\u2019t care. Her mouth was on his, and Claire was kissing Noah with all of the love and passion that she had.</p><p>This was her chance. Their chance. They could be happy. They could have everything that they wanted.</p><p>Noah was laughing and kissing her, too. They stripped in a tangle of limbs. He put the ring on her finger. Sealed it with a kiss. Then he was thrusting into her. Claiming her with a fast and hot lust that stilled the laughter.</p><p>The sex was intense. Hard. Consuming. Their fingers linked. Their eyes held.</p><p>There was no fear. It was gone.</p><p>There was only pleasure. Love.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about control or power.</p><p>Just pleasure.</p><p>Claire called his name when she came.</p><p>And when he came, Noah kissed her. There was lust in that kiss. Raw need.</p><p>So much love.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him. Held him as tightly as she could.</p><p>This was an ending she\u2019d never seen coming. Wrapped in a lover\u2019s arms. Dreaming of a future.</p><p>Life.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>Claire slipped from Noah\u2019s bed. He felt the mattress shift as she rose, and Noah opened his eyes. He enjoyed the view of her back and her perfect heart-shaped ass before Claire slipped on her clothes.</p><p>Frowning, he sat up. He didn\u2019t care that he was stark naked. He\u2019d rather hoped Claire would join him for an early morning round of mind-blowing sex.</p><p>He\u2019d never get enough of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Claire tensed and glanced back at him. Then the tension drained away, and she smiled. \u201cJust for a walk. The sun\u2019s coming up, and I thought that I\u2019d watch it. Seems like a good way to start a new life.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the bed and pulled on a pair of jeans and snagged a sweatshirt. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Because it did seem like a damn good way to start their life together.</p><p>And I want to be with you, Claire.</p><p>Their fingers twined together as they headed out of the house. They walked down the steps. Their toes sank into the sand. Claire laughed a little then, and she flashed him the smile that had first stolen his heart.</p><p>The smile that started with the little curve of her bottom lip. The smile that made her dimples wink. The smile that ended when it reached her eyes and made them shine.</p><p>He pulled her close. The wind was chilly against them, and he wanted to warm her. Noah sank his hands into the thickness of her hair and kissed her. Noah took his time with that kiss, savoring Claire. She\u2019d always be the sweetest thing that he\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>When he pulled away, Noah knew there was one more thing he needed to share with his Claire. She\u2019d proven just how much she loved him.</p><p>It was Noah\u2019s turn to prove his love to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you out today,\u201d he told her as he kept her close. \u201cOn the boat.\u201d</p><p>Claire searched his eyes. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to put the past to rest. For both of us.\u201d And he wanted to show Claire that he\u2019d share all of his life with her. The good and the bad.</p><p>They walked toward the boat. It gleamed, already set in the water. The day was clear and bright. The waves were easy. It was the perfect weather for a trip out.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Claire said, stopping him on the dock. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first woman I\u2019ve taken out with me, and you\u2019ll be the woman who stands by my side for the rest of my life.\u201d This mattered to him. She mattered.</p><p>Claire smiled again. Damn but he loved her smile.</p><p>They climbed on board. Noah untied the vessel. He started the engine. The boat roared to life, and soon, they were pulling away from the dock and heading out toward that rising sun.</p><p>Claire slipped below the deck. Noah\u2019s hands tightened on the wheel as the salty scent of the water filled his nose. He\u2019d expected to feel the pain from his past as soon as he got on the water. He usually did. But he didn\u2019t feel those old ghosts this time. Because she was with him? \u201cClaire?\u201d Noah called.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>The boat was forty feet long, so Claire could still be exploring below deck. He waited a few more moments.</p><p>But Claire didn\u2019t come back up.</p><p>A tendril of unease snaked through Noah. He killed the engine. Left the boat drifting a bit. \u201cClaire, is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Then he saw the top of her blonde head as she climbed back up. Her face became visible, and his heart stopped when he saw the fear heavy in her expression.</p><p>Not just fear\u2014terror.</p><p>Then Noah saw the gun barrel pressed under Claire\u2019s chin. She kept rising, climbing up from below deck, and soon the man who held her was visible, too.</p><p>Blond hair. Green eyes. A smile that was smug and evil.</p><p>\u201cI told you she was my one and only,\u201d Ethan Harrison said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve believed me.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in Noah\u2019s body locked down. \u201cI thought you were still in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Claire gasped. The gun barrel shoved harder against her skin.</p><p>Noah glanced at her face. The desperation in her eyes undid him. \u201cYou said that you saw him,\u201d Noah said simply. \u201cI believed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s why you wanted me out of New York so badly?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. Yes. It hadn\u2019t been about the reporters. The escape to the Hamptons had been about protecting Claire. Trace and his men were tearing apart the city. Noah had thought Claire would be safe at his beach house.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong. Noah focused on Ethan once more. The man\u2019s gaze was wild, too bright with intensity, and his fingers trembled around the weapon. \u201cYou need to move that gun. I know you don\u2019t want to hurt Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ethan lifted the weapon, just an inch. \u201cI love Claire, and she loves me.\u201d He kept a tight grip on her. \u201cBut Claire has to be punished. She let you touch her. I saw...\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cEthan, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Ethan told her. He pressed a kiss to Claire\u2019s temple. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be together. We\u2019ll sail away, and no one will ever bother us again.\u201d</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t happen. Noah would not let that bastard take Claire. \u201cSloan Hall. You found out about this place through him, didn\u2019t you, Harrison?\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled. \u201cYou know my brother killed him? Right before I could.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd Austin always pretended to be so perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get away?\u201d Claire whispered. She pressed back against Ethan, and the man\u2019s gaze jumped to her.</p><p>\u201cI had to get away. I had to come for you.\u201d The gun pushed back against her skin once more. \u201cYork visited me in that damn prison. Talked as if you were his. I knew I had to find a way to you then...\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He\u2019d caused Ethan to escape?</p><p>\u201cYou faked that car bomb.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was so calm it surprised Noah. Her eyes were lit with terror, but her voice was flat.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fake it. It was a very, very real bomb. Just ask those dumb cops who were there...oh, wait, nothing\u2019s left of them now.\u201d He laughed again.</p><p>The boat kept drifting in the water.</p><p>\u201cI called in my favors,\u201d Ethan said, his lips curving. \u201cWarden Quill still owed my family, so he set things up for me.\u201d</p><p>The warden?</p><p>\u201cQuill made sure the back doors of that patrol car were...a little broken. I could get out, easy. And I did. Right before the dumb prick turned the key in the ignition, I jumped out and slipped into the woods.\u201d</p><p>Noah realized that Ethan was damn proud of himself. The guy was talking and talking...and not even realizing that Noah was reaching for the knife he kept stashed near the wheel. The knife had been used the few times he\u2019d fished, and he always kept it close at hand when he was on deck.</p><p>It was the only weapon he had available, but Noah was good with a knife. Very, very good.</p><p>\u201cI slipped through the woods.\u201d Ethan just sounded boastful now. \u201cYou remember those woods, don\u2019t you, Claire? They led to the little bayou. We made love there. Our first time.\u201d He inhaled deeply, as if drinking in her scent. \u201cI missed you so much.\u201d He pulled her even closer, but kept the gun against her. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>Claire was staring right at Noah as she said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Noah tensed.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Claire repeated to Ethan, her voice wooden. Then she lowered her lashes. Cleared her throat, and said again, \u201cI missed you.\u201d But emotion was in those words, shaking them.</p><p>Satisfaction flashed across Ethan\u2019s face. \u201cI told you. Claire\u2019s mine. She\u2019ll always be mine.\u201d Then he lifted the gun and pointed it at Noah. \u201cAnd you\u2019re dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ethan\u2019s grip on her had loosened and Claire whirled in his arms. She put her hands on Ethan\u2019s chest. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t matter. You and I...we matter.\u201d</p><p>Noah took a slow, gliding step forward.</p><p>Ethan had lowered the gun to Claire\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just leave him,\u201d Claire said, her words flying out quickly. \u201cMake him jump off the boat. You and I\u2014we can keep going on this ride, and no one will stop us. No one will ever find us.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s blond eyebrows lowered. \u201cBut I want to kill him. He touched you. He thought he\u2019d take you from me.\u201d</p><p>Noah took another step forward. Claire stood between him and his target.</p><p>\u201cNo one will do that,\u201d Claire said. Her hands were curving around Ethan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re my-my one and only. We\u2019ll be together always.\u201d She glanced back over her shoulder. Her gaze held Noah\u2019s for just a moment. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Then she looked back at Ethan. \u201cPlease, just let him go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan smiled at her. Noah caught the flash of his grin. \u201cI love it when you beg me.\u201d Then he kissed her.</p><p>Noah leapt forward.</p><p>A gunshot blasted.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s entire world stopped then.</p><p>Claire staggered back from Ethan.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re begging for him,\u201d Ethan shouted at her. \u201cFor his life, and you know what that tells me?\u201d He lifted his gun, preparing to shoot it again. Preparing to shoot Claire again.</p><p>Claire\u2019s blood was dripping onto the boat.</p><p>A roaring filled Noah\u2019s ears. He didn\u2019t even realize that he was the one making that sound.</p> <p>\u201cIt tells me that you love him!\u201d Ethan fired again.</p><p>Noah shoved Claire to the side. The bullet drove into Noah\u2019s shoulder, but he didn\u2019t even feel the impact. He was too busy holding Claire.</p><p>There was blood on her shirt. The bastard had shot her, at point blank range. The bullet had sank into Claire\u2019s stomach, and she stared up at Noah as tears poured down her face. \u201cL-love...s-sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Claire, you\u2019re okay,\u201d he told her, frantic. \u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not,\u201d Ethan snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re both dead. And you\u2019re in just the position I like. On your knees.\u201d His laughter grated in Noah\u2019s ears. \u201cLook up at me, asshole. The last thing I want Claire to see is you dying.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, oh, so carefully, Noah eased Claire down on the deck. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. Did she realize just how much? That she was his whole world?</p> <p>That world was bleeding out in front of him.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cI told you what would happen if you ever came near Claire again.\u201d</p><p>Ethan advanced on him. His fingers gripped the gun tightly. \u201cI\u2019m the one with the power here. Claire should\u2019ve been true to me! You ruined everything! Now you are going to die!\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cI told you to forget Claire. And I told you that if you didn\u2019t...\u201d Noah lunged up. With his left hand, he grabbed Ethan\u2019s hand-the hand that held gun\u2014and he broke the man\u2019s wrist. \u201cI said you\u2019d be a dead man.\u201d Noah\u2019s right hand drove his knife into Ethan\u2019s chest. Right into the bastard\u2019s heart.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s breath choked out. He stared at Noah with wide, stunned eyes. \u201cPl-please...\u201d</p><p>Noah twisted that knife. \u201cYou\u2019ll never hurt her again.\u201d He yanked the knife back.</p><p>Blood poured from Ethan\u2019s wound. The man fell back. And, furious, snarling, Noah, plunged the knife into Ethan\u2019s throat.</p><p>Go join your bastard father and brother in hell.</p> <p>Then Noah spun around. He fell to his knees beside Claire. \u201cBaby, baby, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had closed. When he touched her, Claire\u2019s skin was so cold.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Claire. Please, please don\u2019t leave me.\u201d He was begging her, and he didn\u2019t care. Noah would have done anything for Claire right then.</p><p>Her lashes lifted. Her eyes\u2014the blue seemed so dim\u2014met his. \u201cLove...y-you...\u201d</p><p>He pushed down on her stomach, trying to apply pressure to her wound. \u201cFight for me. You love me, so that means you have to fight.\u201d He kissed her, desperate, breaking. \u201cFight to stay with me. Because I don\u2019t want to be without you, Claire. I don\u2019t think I can be. Please, baby, hold on.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. Her lips started to curl. The smile that began with her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cChanged...me...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The smile wasn\u2019t flashing her dimples. It wasn\u2019t reaching her eyes. It had to reach her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was...yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still are.\u201d He grabbed for the boat\u2019s radio. Called for help even as he kept applying pressure to her wound. \u201cAnd I\u2019m yours. Yours\u2014always. Do you hear me, Claire? Always. This isn\u2019t the end for us. We\u2019ve just started. We\u2019re getting married. I\u2019m going to buy you so many blue diamonds that you get sick of them, and I\u2019m going to make you scream over and over again when you and I are in bed and I make\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had closed once more.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d No, no. \u201cGet me help!\u201d he yelled into the radio. \u201cShe needs a helicopter! I need a life flight for her. Dammit, I\u2019m out on the water and I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Claire.</p><p>His hand was on her wound. She was terrifyingly still on that deck. The water was all around him, blue for miles. No help in sight.</p><p>If they stayed there and waited for help to come, Claire would be dead.</p><p>\u201cLive for me,\u201d he begged her. \u201cPlease, God, Claire, live for me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her up, holding her as best he could even while he kept trying to put pressure on that wound. His left arm wrapped around her, and she hung limply against him.</p><p>His mother had been limp like that. So long ago. He\u2019d thought that she\u2019d just passed out. But...</p><p>Still holding her, Noah sent the boat racing forward. It bounced against the waves at first, then cut through the water.</p><p>He kept holding Claire.</p><p>He\u2019d always hold her.</p><p>Because she was the only thing that mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cPlease hold on, Claire,\u201d he said, and he knew he was begging her. \u201cJust...hold on. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>When the helicopter landed at the hospital, Drake tensed. He was inside the hospital, watching from his position in the waiting area. He saw the figures jump from the chopper, and, a few moments later, the medical attendants ran forward, pushing the small figure on the gurney toward the hospital\u2019s emergency room entrance.</p><p>Noah was right beside that gurney.</p><p>The emergency room doors flew open. Drake had only a flash of Claire. The doctors were working on her. Yelling. Saying that she\u2019d lost too much blood.</p><p>Fuck, not her.</p><p>Claire vanished as the operating room doors swung closed. Drake glanced over his shoulder. Now Noah stood just inside the emergency room waiting area. His shirt was covered with blood. So were his hands.</p><p>Cautiously, Drake approached his friend. He could see that Noah was on the edge. The very dangerous edge that he\u2019d always sensed with Noah.</p><p>\u201cHe was on the boat,\u201d Noah said, and his voice stopped Drake. That low, deadly whisper\u2014Noah normally only used it in battle. \u201cI wanted to take Claire out and show her that she could know all of me...but he was on my boat. Ethan Harrison was on my fucking boat.\u201d</p><p>Trace had called Drake to let him know about the deadly situation. Trace had told him to haul ass to the hospital, and Drake knew that Trace would be arriving there any minute, too.</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to protect me.\u201d Noah\u2019s eyes were haunted. \u201cShe told him to let me go. That she\u2019d stay with him.\u201d His hands had fisted. \u201cShe would\u2019ve done it, too. I saw it in her eyes. If he\u2019d let me go, she would have gone away with that bastard and let him hurt her. Let him kill her. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah...\u201d He put his hand on Noah\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Noah shoved him back. \u201cI didn\u2019t move fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Drake swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew she loved me. Ethan knew. I was going to attack him, but I didn\u2019t move fast enough.\u201d Grief ravaged his face. \u201cHe shot her in front of me. We were out on that water, and I couldn\u2019t help her. There was too much blood. I kept telling her to hold on. To hold on...\u201d</p><p>The ER doors burst open again. Trace stood there, breath heaving, as his gaze flew around the waiting area. He saw Noah and Drake, and he rushed toward them.</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t open her eyes again,\u201d Noah whispered. His head sagged forward. \u201cI need her to open her eyes. I. Need. Her.\u201d</p><p>Drake couldn\u2019t even lie to his friend and tell him that Claire would be all right. She\u2019d been so pale\u2014ghost white\u2014on that gurney. And he hadn\u2019t even been able to see her breathing. Drake cleared his throat. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her to fight for me. I begged her.\u201d Noah swiped a hand over his cheek. When his hand fell again, Drake saw a line of blood on his face. Claire\u2019s blood. \u201cBut I don\u2019t even know if she could hear me.\u201d</p><p>When Trace came up to the men, his gaze went straight to Noah. \u201cTell me what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s attention was on the shut operating room doors. \u201cI used to envy you, Trace. You always loved Skye. She loved you. You seemed to have it all.\u201d</p><p>Trace\u2019s face reflected his worry.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it would...hurt so much.\u201d Noah rubbed his chest. \u201cIt feels like someone is clawing my heart out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love her,\u201d Trace said.</p><p>Noah\u2019s head sagged forward. \u201cI\u2019d kill for her. I\u2019d die for her.\u201d His shoulders rolled back and his face slowly lifted. \u201cBut how can I live without her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d Trace told him, voice fierce. \u201cYou got her to the hospital. This isn\u2019t like the time with your parents. The doctors are in there, and they\u2019ll get her sewn up. She\u2019s going to make it.\u201d Maybe Trace\u2019s words were a lie, but Drake was glad Trace had said them. Drake didn\u2019t like the haunted, desperate look in Noah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze flickered to Drake. \u201cShe loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I figured that one out pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one was obvious, too,\u201d Drake muttered. \u201cWhen you stopped the revolving bedroom door routine you enjoyed so much.\u201d</p><p>Trace exhaled on a long, rough sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Ethan Harrison managed to get all the way up to New York. He must\u2019ve had help and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe warden helped him.\u201d Noah\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cSo we need to destroy him.\u201d</p><p>Trace nodded. \u201cConsider it done.\u201d He backed away.</p><p>Drake knew Trace had found his way to \u201chelp\u201d Noah. Within the hour, Drake figured that the warden would be in either police custody or in the custody of Trace\u2019s agents. The man wouldn\u2019t get away.</p><p>Noah started to pace then, walking back and forth on the tiled floor of the waiting room. His gaze darted back to the operating room doors every few moments.</p><p>There was so much blood on the guy. Drake had to ask, \u201cNoah, are you all right? Do I need to get a doctor for you?\u201d The last thing he wanted was for Noah to keel over. The guy could be so focused on Claire that he was ignoring his own injuries.</p><p>Noah stopped pacing. \u201cI think I got shot. Maybe my shoulder? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yes, it did. Drake motioned to a nurse.</p><p>Noah looked down at his clothes. \u201cMost of the blood is Claire\u2019s...and Ethan Harrison\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Drake had gotten that bit of information from Trace on his way over and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI stabbed him in the heart and drove my knife into the bastard\u2019s throat.\u201d Noah started pacing once more. The nurse nervously hovered nearby. \u201cHe\u2019ll never hurt Claire again.\u201d</p><p>Drake whistled soundlessly. No, Ethan would never hurt Claire again. And if Claire didn\u2019t survive the surgery...he knew that Noah York would never be the same again, either.</p><p>He\u2019s lost control. He\u2019s gone over the edge.</p><p>Claire would be the only one who could bring him back.</p><p>She looked so pale against the white covers.</p><p>Noah pulled his chair closer to Claire\u2019s bed. She was connected to about five different beeping machines, and an IV fed into her left arm.</p><p>Her eyes were closed. Her wound stitched up.</p><p>The anesthesia was still in her system, but the doctors had assured him that Claire would be waking up soon. The surgery had been a full success.</p><p>She was going to make it.</p><p>He could actually breathe again.</p><p>Noah reached for Claire\u2019s hand. His fingers threaded through hers. He just needed to hold her. To feel her, warm and alive, against him.</p><p>\u201cThat was too close,\u201d he rasped to her. \u201cPlease, baby, don\u2019t ever do that to me again.\u201d Because for a while there, his whole world had gone dark.</p><p>He bowed his head, and he kept holding her.</p><p>When Claire opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was...Noah. He was in the chair right next to her bed. And his gaze was on her.</p><p>She tried to smile at him.</p><p>He immediately leaned forward. \u201cBaby?\u201d His hand was holding hers. So warm and strong.</p><p>But that was Noah. Her strong, sexy Noah.</p><p>\u201cI...it\u2019s over...\u201d Her throat was desert dry, so she swallowed and finished, \u201cisn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cEthan\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember him dying. She remembered a gunshot. Remembered falling. Remembered Noah begging her to hold on.</p><p>She\u2019d tried so hard to hold on to him. \u201cDidn\u2019t...want you hurt...\u201d The machines beeped around her.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to trade your life for mine.\u201d He shook his head. The faint lines around his eyes and mouth were deeper, and Noah looked more grim than she\u2019d ever seen him before. \u201cThat shit just wasn\u2019t working. No one takes you from me. You\u2019re mine, Claire and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>She could see her ring gleaming on her finger. The bracelets were gone, but the ring was still there. Noah had asked her to spend her life with him.</p><p>And, even though Ethan had tried to take that life away...I\u2019m still here. \u201cI wasn\u2019t...leaving you.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a tender kiss to her lips. \u201cGood. Because I was ready to fight death to get you back.\u201d His jaw clenched. \u201cI love you, Claire Kramer, more than I ever thought it was possible to love anyone or anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was how she felt about him. No, Claire hadn\u2019t thought that she could love. Then Noah had walked into her life. He\u2019d changed everything for her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having a long engagement,\u201d his voice warmed as he stared into her eyes. His hand still held hers. \u201cI...can\u2019t wait. I need you too much.\u201d</p><p>And she needed him.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re out of this hospital, we\u2019re heading to Vegas. Or, hell, we\u2019ll go any place you want. I just want you with me.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cAlways, Claire. Always.\u201d</p><p>There was no other place she wanted to be. \u201cAlways, Noah,\u201d she swore, and the love she felt for him filled her. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>The chapel was covered in roses. Noah knew they were Claire\u2019s favorite, so he\u2019d made sure the florist he used in Vegas brought in as many roses as possible.</p><p>He suspected that every rose in Vegas was in that little chapel.</p><p>The Justice of the Peace smiled as Claire walked down the aisle.</p> <p>She wore a simple white dress. Her bracelets gleamed around her wrists, but the blue reminding him so much of her eyes.</p><p>Her eyes had gotten to him from the very first moment. If the eyes were the windows to the soul, then Claire\u2019s soul was perfect. Beautiful.</p><p>Drake walked Claire down the aisle. The guy was grinning as he put Claire\u2019s hand into Noah\u2019s.</p><p>And when he touched her, some of the tension Noah felt eased away. Trace stood behind Noah. The guy was his best man. Skye was Claire\u2019s matron of honor, and she wore a grin nearly as big as Drake\u2019s.</p><p>The Justice of the Peace started speaking. Noah didn\u2019t look away from Claire. He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d be getting married. Never thought this was the life he\u2019d have.</p><p>But without her, I don\u2019t have a life.</p> <p>\u201cNoah?\u201d Claire whispered as alarm flickered in her gaze.</p><p>He tensed and leaned toward her. Then Noah became aware of the silence. All around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to repeat after him,\u201d Claire said, nibbling her lower lip. \u201cI...is everything okay? You haven\u2019t...haven\u2019t changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, I haven\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d just gotten lost in her eyes, and he hadn\u2019t heard a word the Justice of the Peace said. He curled his fingers under her chin and kissed her. A deep, long kiss, as he savored the sweetness that was his Claire.</p><p>The Justice of the Peace cleared his throat. \u201cThat comes later.\u201d</p><p>No, it came any damn time Noah wanted.</p><p>After a moment, after he\u2019d enjoyed her, Noah lifted his head. The uncertainty was gone from Claire\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cAh...repeat after me,\u201d the Justice mumbled. \u201cI, Noah Robert York, take Claire Cassandra Kramer to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo hold forever,\u201d Noah promised her, cutting through the other man\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ll love you forever, Claire.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. Her lower lip curled. The dimples winked. Her eyes glinted.</p><p>And he knew that he\u2019d spend the rest of his life loving this woman.</p><p>Claire was his, and that was only fitting because the woman truly owned him, body and soul. </p> </body></html>"]
