The three generations of females lived quietly and modestly in a two-story frame house on Barnett Street just two blocks from the city square in Sheldon Beach, Florida. The atmosphere on Barnett Street was vastly different after Jilly left home. The household, which had once been in a constant uproar, was now peaceful. Carrie even learned to laugh again, and for five wonderful years, life was very nearly idyllic.</p> <p>The previous years with Jilly had taken their toll on Grandma Lola, however. She hadn\u2019t become a mother until she was almost old enough to begin the change of life, and she was an old, tired woman now. The day Avery turned five, Lola began having chest pains. She could barely get the icing on the child\u2019s birthday cake without having to sit down and rest a spell.</p><p>Lola didn\u2019t tell anyone about her problem, and she didn\u2019t see her regular doctor in Sheldon Beach because she didn\u2019t trust him to keep quiet about his findings. He might just take it upon himself to tell Carrie about her illness. She made an appointment with a cardiologist in Savannah and drove all the way there to see him. After giving her a complete physical, his diagnosis was grim. He prescribed medication that would ease the pain and help her heart, told her she had to slow down, and also, as gently as he could, suggested that she get her affairs in order.</p><p>Lola disregarded his advice. What did that quack of a doctor know about anything? She may have one foot in the grave but, by God, she was going to keep the other firmly planted on the ground. She had a granddaughter to raise, and she wasn\u2019t going anywhere until she got the job done.</p><p>Lola was an expert at pretending everything was fine. She\u2019d perfected the art during the turbulent years trying to control Jilly. By the time she got home from Savannah, she had convinced herself that she was as healthy as an ox.</p><p>And that was that.</p> <p>Grandma Lola refused to talk about Jilly, but Avery wanted to know everything she could about the woman. Whenever she asked a question about her mother, her grandmother would pucker her lips and always answer the same way. \u201cWe wish her well. We wish her well away.\u201d Then, before Avery could try again, her grandmother would change the subject. And that, of course, wasn\u2019t a satisfactory answer, especially for a curious five-year-old.</p><p>The only way Avery could find out anything about her mother was to ask her aunt. Carrie loved to talk about Jilly, and she never forgot a single one of the bad things her sister had ever done, which, as it turned out, added up to a considerable number.</p><p>Avery idolized her aunt. She thought she was the most beautiful woman in the whole world, and she wished more than anything that she looked like her instead of her no-good mama. Carrie had hair the exact color of Grandma\u2019s homemade peach jam and eyes more gray than blue, like the furry white cat Avery had seen colored pictures of in one of her storybooks. Carrie was constantly on a diet to lose twenty pounds, but Avery thought she was perfect just the way she was. At five feet six inches, Carrie was tall and glamorous, and when she put on one of her glittery barrettes to keep her hair out of her eyes while she was studying or working around the house, she looked just like a princess. Avery loved the way her aunt smelled too, like gardenias. Carrie told Avery it was her signature fragrance, which Avery knew had to be special. When Carrie was away from home and Avery was feeling lonely, she would sneak into her bedroom and squirt some of the special perfume on her arms and legs and pretend her aunt was there in the next room.</p><p>What Avery loved most about Carrie, though, was that she talked to her like she was a big person. She didn\u2019t treat her like a baby the way Grandma Lola did. When Carrie spoke about Avery\u2019s no-good mama, Jilly, she always began by saying in her no-nonsense tone of voice, \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat the truth just because you\u2019re little. You\u2019ve got a right to know.\u201d</p><p>One week before Carrie moved to California, Avery went into her bedroom to help her pack. She kept getting in the way, and when Carrie had had enough, she sat her niece down at her vanity table and placed a shoe box filled with cheap costume jewelry in front of her. She\u2019d collected the baubles at neighborhood garage sales as a present to give to Avery before she left. The little girl was thrilled with the sparkling treasures and immediately began to primp in front of the oval mirror.</p><p>\u201cHow come you got to go all the way to California, Carrie? You\u2019re supposed to stay home with Grandma and me.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie laughed. \u201cI\u2019m \u2018supposed to\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Peyton says her mama says. Peyton says her mama says you already went to college and now you\u2019re supposed to stay home and help take care of me \u2019cause I\u2019m a handful.\u201d</p><p>Peyton was Avery\u2019s best friend, and because she was a year older, Avery believed everything she said. In Carrie\u2019s opinion, Peyton\u2019s mother, Harriet, was a busybody, but she was nice to Avery, and so Carrie put up with her occasionally butting into family business.</p><p>After folding her favorite, baby blue, angora sweater and placing it inside the suitcase, Carrie once again tried to explain why she was leaving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten that grant, remember? I\u2019m going to get my master\u2019s, and I know I already explained at least five times why the extra schooling is important. I have to go, Avery. It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for me, and after I\u2019ve started my own company and I\u2019ve become rich and famous, then you and Grandma will come and live with me. We\u2019ll have a big house in Beverly Hills with servants and a swimming pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I can\u2019t take my piano lessons, and Mrs. Burns says I have to \u2019cause I\u2019ve got ears.\u201d</p><p>Since her niece sounded so serious, Carrie didn\u2019t dare laugh. \u201cShe said you\u2019ve got the ear, and that means that if you practice, you could be good, but you can take piano lessons in California. You could take karate lessons there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like taking karate here. Sammy says I\u2019m getting stronger with my kicking, but you know what, Carrie? I heard Grandma tell Peyton\u2019s mama she doesn\u2019t like me taking karate. She says it isn\u2019t ladylike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI\u2019m paying for the lessons, and I want you to grow up knowing how to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how come?\u201d Avery asked. \u201cPeyton\u2019s mama asked Grandma how come too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want anyone to be able to push you around the way Jilly used to push me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to grow up being afraid. And I\u2019m sure there are wonderful self-defense schools in California with teachers just as nice as Sammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton\u2019s mama says that Grandma said Jilly went away to be a movie star. Do you want to be a movie star too, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to build a company and make tons of money. I\u2019ll make other people stars.\u201d</p><p>Avery turned back to the mirror and clipped on a pair of fat green rhinestone earrings. Then she untangled the matching necklace and put it around her neck. \u201cYou know what else Peyton said?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a reply. \u201cShe says her mama says when Jilly had me, she was old enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Carrie answered. She pulled out her sock drawer, dumped the contents on the bed, and began to match the pairs. \u201cJilly was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did Petyon\u2019s mama mean? How come she should know better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe meant that Jilly should have taken precautions.\u201d</p><p>The drawer fell on the floor. Carrie picked it up and slid it into the dresser, then went back to the chore of sorting through the pile of socks.</p><p>\u201cBut what does that mean?\u201d Avery asked. She was making faces at herself in the mirror as she put on the second necklace.</p><p>Carrie ignored the question. She didn\u2019t want to get into a long-winded discussion about sex and birth control. Avery was too young to hear about all that now. Hoping to turn her niece\u2019s attention, she said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I have you and Grandma to look after me \u2019cause I\u2019m a handful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut you\u2019re also lucky because Jilly wasn\u2019t drinking like a fish or taking feel-good pills by the fistful when she was carrying you. If she had put all that garbage inside her, you would have been born with serious problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton says her mama says I\u2019m lucky I got borned at all.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Carrie said, \u201cPeyton\u2019s mother sure likes to talk about Jilly, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. \u201cAre \u2018feel-good pills\u2019 bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how come people take them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re stupid. Put that jewelry away and come sit on this suitcase so I can get it closed.\u201d</p><p>Avery carefully put the earrings and the necklaces back in the shoe box. She climbed up on the canopy bed.</p><p>\u201cCan I have this?\u201d she asked as she picked up a small book with a blue vinyl cover.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. That\u2019s my diary,\u201d Carrie answered. She snatched the book from Avery\u2019s hand and tucked it into one of the side pockets. She closed the suitcase and Avery scooted on top. Leaning on it with all her weight, Carrie finally got the latches to lock.</p><p>She was helping Avery off the bed when her niece asked, \u201cHow come you\u2019re packing now and not next week? Grandma says you\u2019re doing it backwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacking before I paint the room for you isn\u2019t backwards. This way, my things will be out of the way, and we can get you all set up in your new room before I leave. Tomorrow, you and I will go to the paint store and pick out the color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You already told me I could pick the color. Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked as she set the suitcase by the door.</p><p>\u201cDid my no-good mama hate me when she saw me?\u201d</p><p>Carrie turned around, saw the worry in Avery\u2019s eyes, and was instantly furious. Even though Jilly wasn\u2019t there, she was still causing pain. Would it never end?</p><p>Carrie remembered, as though it had happened yesterday, the night she found out her sister was going to have a baby.</p><p>Jilly had graduated from high school on a balmy Friday evening in May. She then came home and ruined the celebration by announcing that she was almost six months pregnant. She was just barely showing.</p><p>Reeling from the shock, Lola at first thought about the embarrassment and shame the family would have to endure, then came to her senses. \u201cWe\u2019re a family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work this out. We\u2019ll figure a way to get through this. Isn\u2019t that right, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>Standing at the dining room table, Carrie picked up the knife and cut herself a piece of the sheet cake Lola had spent all morning decorating. \u201cIn this day and age you\u2019ve got to be really dumb to get pregnant. Haven\u2019t you ever heard of birth control, Jilly, or are you a complete moron?\u201d</p><p>Jilly was leaning against the wall, her arms folded, glaring at Carrie. Lola, hoping to avoid a screaming match between the two daughters, hastily interjected, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any need to be snide, Carrie. We don\u2019t want to get Jilly upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to get her upset,\u201d Carrie corrected.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, you will not take that tone with me.\u201d</p><p>Contrite, she bowed her head and scooped the piece of cake onto a plate. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did think about birth control,\u201d Jilly snapped. \u201cI went to the doctor over in Jacksonville to get rid of it, but he refused to do it because he said I was too far along.\u201d</p><p>Lola slumped into a chair and covered her face with one hand. \u201cYou went to a doctor . . .\u201d</p><p>Jilly had already lost interest in the subject. She went into the living room, plopped down on the sofa, grabbed the channel changer, and turned on the television.</p><p>\u201cShe causes the trauma and then she walks away,\u201d Carrie muttered. \u201cLeaving us to clean up the mess. How typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, Carrie,\u201d Lola pleaded. She rubbed her brow as though to ease a headache and then said, \u201cJilly just doesn\u2019t always take the time to think things through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should she? She has you to clean up her mistakes. You\u2019ve let her get away with everything but murder just because you can\u2019t stand her fits. I think you\u2019re afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Lola blustered. She got up from the table and went into the kitchen to do the dishes. \u201cWe\u2019re a family and we\u2019re going to get through this,\u201d she called out. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to help, Carrie. Your sister needs our moral support.\u201d</p><p>Carrie clenched her fists in frustration. What was it going to take to get her mother to open her eyes and see the selfish bitch she\u2019d raised? Why wouldn\u2019t she see the truth?</p><p>The rest of that summer was an awful memory. Jilly was her usual demanding nightmare, and their mother was run ragged waiting on her hand and foot. Fortunately, Carrie had a summer job at Sammy\u2019s Bar and Grille, and she did her best to get as much overtime as possible so she wouldn\u2019t have to go home.</p><p>Jilly went into labor at the end of August. After she gave birth in the county hospital, she took one look at the squirming, blotchy-faced infant who had caused her so much pain and decided that she didn\u2019t want to be a mother. Not now, not ever. If the doctors had agreed, she would have had her uterus yanked out or her tubes tied that very day.</p><p>Lola dragged Carrie to the hospital to see her sister. They hadn\u2019t even walked into the room before Jilly announced that she was too young and pretty to be saddled with a baby. There was a big world outside of Sheldon Beach, Florida, just waiting to pay her some attention, but no man with any money would ever notice her if she was lugging a baby around on her hip. No, motherhood wasn\u2019t for her. Besides, she had her heart set on becoming a famous movie star. She would get her start by being crowned Miss America. She had it all figured out, she told them. Boasting that she was much prettier than those cows she had seen on television last year marching around the stage in their swimsuits, she was positive that, as soon as the judges got a good look at her, they would give her the crown.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re ignorant,\u201d Carrie muttered. \u201cThey don\u2019t give the crown to girls who have had babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the ignorant one, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, you two,\u201d Lola ordered. \u201cDo you want the nurses to hear you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if they hear me or not,\u201d Jilly said.</p><p>\u201cI told you to hush,\u201d Lola snapped. \u201cUse your head, Jilly. You\u2019re a mother now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a mother. I want to be a star,\u201d Jilly screamed.</p><p>Mortified, Lola pulled Carrie into the room and told her to shut the door. Gripping the potted plant she\u2019d brought Jilly in one hand, Lola held on to Carrie\u2019s arm with the other so she wouldn\u2019t bolt.</p> <p>Carrie was annoyed that she was being forced to be supportive. She leaned against the door and glared at her sister.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jilly, I don\u2019t care what you want,\u201d Lola said in a low, furious whisper.</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t usually use that tone with Jilly. Carrie perked up and began to pay attention to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be responsible,\u201d Lola said. Her voice turned earnest as she moved toward the bed. \u201cYou will be a good mother, and Carrie and I will help you raise the baby. It will all work out. You\u2019ll see. I do think you should call the baby\u2019s father\u2014\u201d Jilly\u2019s laugh stopped her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Jilly replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my life all mapped out, don\u2019t you? Always trying to make me behave and act the way you think I should act. Really, Mother. I\u2019m a grown-up now. I\u2019m eighteen,\u201d she reminded her. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do whatever I want to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Jilly, the father has a right to know he has a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Fluffing her pillow behind her head, Jilly yawned loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the father is. It could be the college boy from Savannah, but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</p><p>Lola let go of Carrie. \u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t be sure? You told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied. You want me to tell you the truth? Fine, I will. The father could have been a dozen other men.\u201d</p><p>Lola shook her head. She refused to believe her daughter. \u201cStop talking like that. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s head came up. \u201cOh, my God, Jilly.\u201d</p> <p>Jilly loved shocking people and being the center of attention. \u201cI am telling the truth. I really have lost count of the men I\u2019ve been with. I couldn\u2019t possibly know who the father might be.\u201d She saw the disgust on her mother\u2019s face. \u201cHave I upset you?\u201d Jilly asked, inordinately pleased by the possibility. \u201cMen love me,\u201d she boasted. \u201cThey\u2019ll do anything I want just to please me. They give me expensive gifts and cash too, which I\u2019ve had to hide from you and Carrie so you wouldn\u2019t get jealous and act like you are now, so holier than everybody else. You would have taken the money and the jewelry away from me, wouldn\u2019t you? Only, I wouldn\u2019t give you the chance. I\u2019m smarter than you think, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Lola closed her eyes, battling the waves of nausea. \u201cHow many men have there been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know? Weren\u2019t you listening? I just told you I lost count. All I had to do was let them use my body for a little while. They adore me and I let them. I\u2019m much more beautiful than all the actresses in Hollywood put together, and I\u2019m going to be more famous. You just wait and see. Besides, I like sex. It feels good when they do it just right. You just don\u2019t understand the modern woman. You\u2019re old, Mother, and all dried up inside. You probably don\u2019t remember what sex is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking money for sex? Do you know what that makes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiberated,\u201d Jilly snarled.</p><p>Carrie stepped away from the door. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. It makes you a dirty little whore, Jilly. That\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jilly shouted. \u201cMen don\u2019t want you the way they want me. I can drive them crazy, and they don\u2019t give you the time of day. I am liberated and you\u2019re just jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mother. Let\u2019s leave.\u201d Carrie touched her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>Turning her head into the pillow, Jilly muttered, \u201cYes, leave. I\u2019m sleepy now. Go away and let me rest.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had to help Lola to the car. She had never seen her mother so distraught, and it scared her.</p><p>As they drove away from the hospital, Lola stared blankly out the window. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known what she was like, and you tried to tell me, but I wouldn\u2019t listen to you. I\u2019ve been living in a fog, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Jilly. The mean streak inside of her goes beyond . . . it isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do that to her?\u201d Lola asked, sounding bewildered. \u201cYour father spoiled her, and after he left us, I spoiled her too so she wouldn\u2019t feel abandoned. Did I make her the monster she\u2019s become?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them said another word until they reached home. Carrie pulled the car into the driveway, parked it in front of the garage, and turned the motor off. She was opening the door when Lola grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the way I\u2019ve treated you.\u201d She began to weep then. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl, and I\u2019ve taken you for granted all these years. Our lives have revolved around Jilly, haven\u2019t they? It seems I\u2019ve spent the better part of her eighteen years keeping her calm . . . happy. I just want you to know that I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019ve never told you so, have I? I guess it took this nightmare to make me realize what a treasure you are. I love you, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t know how to respond. She couldn\u2019t remember if or when her mother had ever told her she loved her before. She felt as though she\u2019d just won some kind of a contest, but by default. The golden child was tarnished, and because she was the only one left, she got the prize.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cWhat are you going to do about Jilly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make her do the right thing, of course.\u201d</p><p>Carrie pulled away. \u201cYou still don\u2019t get it. She won\u2019t do the right thing. Maybe she can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s sick, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Lola shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s spoiled, but I can work on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carrie stopped her. \u201cYou\u2019re still living in dreamland,\u201d she muttered. She slammed the door when she got out of the car and went into the house.</p><p>Lola followed her into the kitchen, took an apron from the wooden peg on the wall, and tied it around her waist.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened on my eighth birthday?\u201d Carrie asked as she pulled a chair from the kitchen table and dropped into it.</p><p>Hoping to avoid the unpleasant remembrance, Lola didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cNot now, dear. Why don\u2019t you set the table and I\u2019ll start dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me that Barbie doll I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I don\u2019t want to talk about this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. We need to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened a long time ago. Why do you need to go over it again?\u201d</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t going to back down this time. \u201cI came into your bedroom that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, damn it. You can\u2019t keep living this way. You have to face the facts. Sit, Mother.\u201d She wanted to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.</p><p>Lola gave in. She took the chair across from her daughter, and primly folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI remember your father was very upset by your accusations,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Jilly was crying. You woke the whole household that night carrying on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted my doll,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cWhen I wouldn\u2019t give it to her, she told me she was going to cut my eyes out with scissors. I woke up around midnight and she was standing over me with your shears in her hand. She had this sick smile on her face. She was opening and closing the scissors making this horrible clicking sound. Then she held up my new Barbie doll and I saw what she\u2019d done to it. She\u2019d stabbed the eyes out, Mother, and that smile on her face . . . it was so awful. As I was about to scream, she leaned down and whispered, \u2018Now it\u2019s your turn.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too young to remember exactly what happened. You\u2019ve blown this little incident way out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I haven\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how it happened. You didn\u2019t see the look in her eyes, but I\u2019m telling you she wanted to kill me. If I had been alone in the house with her, she would have done exactly what she wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, she was just trying to scare you,\u201d Lola insisted. \u201cShe never would have hurt you. Jilly loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you and Dad hadn\u2019t been there, she would have hurt me. She\u2019s crazy, Mother. I don\u2019t care what happens to her, but there\u2019s an innocent baby now.\u201d She took a deep breath, and then blurted out, \u201cI think we should encourage Jilly to give the baby up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>Lola was outraged by the suggestion. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, and slammed her hand down on the table. \u201cThat baby is your niece and my granddaughter, and I\u2019m not going to let strangers raise her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her only hope for a decent future,\u201d Carrie argued. \u201cShe\u2019s already got one huge strike against her with Jilly as her mother. I only hope whatever is broken inside of Jilly isn\u2019t genetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. The only thing wrong with Jilly is that she\u2019s used to getting her way. Lots of young women are fooling around with men these days. It\u2019s wrong,\u201d she hastily added, \u201cbut I understand why Jilly wanted men to love her. Her father left her, and she\u2019s been trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you listen to yourself?\u201d Carrie shouted. \u201cFor a little while, I thought you were finally seeing what Jilly was, but I guess I was wrong. You\u2019re never going to open your eyes. You asked me if you had made her the monster she\u2019s become, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to say that her behavior was monstrous, but Jilly\u2019s a mother now. When I go back to the hospital to bring her and the baby home, you\u2019ll see. She\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>It was like talking to a brick wall. \u201cYou think the maternal instincts are going to kick in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Lola said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she repeated. \u201cJilly will want to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Carrie gave up. Sickened, she went to her room and stayed there the rest of the night. When she came down the following morning, there was a note on the kitchen table. Her mother had gone to Sears to purchase a crib, baby clothes, and an infant car seat.</p><p>\u201cDreamland,\u201d Carrie muttered.</p><p>On Monday morning, Lola went to the hospital to bring Jilly and the still unnamed baby home. Carrie refused to go with her mother. She told her she had to work an early shift at Sammy\u2019s and left the house before Lola could question her.</p><p>Jilly was waiting for her mother. She was dressed and standing in front of the bathroom mirror brushing her hair. She waved her hand toward the screaming infant she\u2019d dropped in the middle of the unmade bed seconds after the nurse had left the room and told Lola she could either keep her, sell her, or give her away\u2014she didn\u2019t much care what she did with her. She then picked up her overnight bag and walked out of the hospital with the money she\u2019d stolen from her sister\u2019s college fund tucked into her bra.</p><p>The withdrawal didn\u2019t appear on the bank statement until two weeks later. Carrie was outraged. She\u2019d worked hard to save the money, and she was determined to get it back. She tried to report the theft to the police, but Lola wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cFamily business stays in the family,\u201d she decreed.</p><p>Carrie graduated from high school the following spring and worked two jobs that summer. Lola used some of her savings to help with Carrie\u2019s college tuition, and Carrie found part-time work on campus to help with expenses. When she came home for Christmas break, she could barely look at Jilly\u2019s baby.</p><p>However, Avery wasn\u2019t the kind of child who put up with being ignored. It only took a couple of drooling smiles, and Carrie was smiling back. Each time she returned home, the bond grew stronger. The child adored her, and the feeling, though never openly stated, was reciprocated.</p><p>Avery was the sweetest, most intelligent little girl, and Carrie in every way possible had become her substitute mother. She certainly had all the protective instincts of a mother. She would do anything to keep Avery safe.</p><p>Yet here they were, five years later, and Jilly was still able to cause the family pain.</p><p>\u201cDid she, Carrie? Did she hate me?\u201d</p><p>Carrie forced herself to concentrate on the child\u2019s question. Planting her hands on her hips, she took a deep breath and then asked, \u201cWhat do you care what Jilly thought about you?\u201d</p><p>Avery lifted her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you listen to me. Your no-good mama probably did hate you, but not because of who you are or what you looked like when you were born. You were a perfect baby. Jilly just didn\u2019t want responsibility.\u201d She pointed to the chair adjacent to the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something important, and I want you to pay attention, so sit down.\u201d</p><p>Avery hurried to do as she was told.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably too young to hear this, but I\u2019m going to tell you anyway. Your mother\u2019s a frickin\u2019 maniac.\u201d</p><p>Avery was disappointed. She thought she was going to hear something new. \u201cYou already told me that, Carrie. Lots of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just another reminder,\u201d she said. \u201cJilly has never been normal. Fact is, she should have been locked up in a loony bin a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Avery was intrigued by the thought of her mother being locked away. \u201cWhat\u2019s a loony bin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place where sick people go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jilly sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut not the kind of sick where we feel sorry for her. She\u2019s mean and hateful and just plain crazy. She\u2019d have to be crazy to walk away from someone as wonderful as you,\u201d Carrie added. Leaning forward, she brushed the hair out of Avery\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour mother grew up with something important missing from inside her head. She might not be a pure sociopath, but she\u2019s damn close.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s eyes widened. In a hushed voice she said, \u201cCarrie, you just said \u2018damn.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said, and I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Avery got out of her chair and went to sit beside Carrie on the bed. She latched on to her hand and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to explain. A sociopath is a person who doesn\u2019t have a conscience, and before you ask, I\u2019ll tell you what a conscience is. That\u2019s what\u2019s inside your head that tells you when you\u2019ve done something wrong. Your conscience makes you feel . . . bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike when I told Grandma I already practiced on the piano, but I didn\u2019t, and then she told me I was a good girl, but I wasn\u2019t \u2019cause I lied, and then I felt bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mother doesn\u2019t have any heart or soul, and that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the song you like to sing? Is it that kind of heart and soul?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, just like the song,\u201d Carrie assured her. \u201cJilly doesn\u2019t have room in her heart to feel any emotion that doesn\u2019t directly involve or benefit her.\u201d</p><p>Avery was leaning into her side, looking up at her with those wonderful violet blue eyes that were so much more beautiful than her mother\u2019s. Carrie could almost see the purity and goodness behind them. \u201cJilly\u2019s too busy loving herself to love anyone else, but you can\u2019t waste your time feeling bad about that. None of it is your fault. You believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Avery solemnly nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my no-good mama\u2019s fault, all right.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a soul?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do. Everyone but your no-good mama has a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Jilly hurt Whiskers and made him die, did he have a soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she allowed, thinking of the kitten Jilly had cruelly taken from her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour soul?\u201d Carrie had to think about the question for a few seconds before answering. \u201cIt\u2019s inside you, wrapped around your heart. Your soul is as pure as an angel\u2019s, and I mean to help you keep it that way. You\u2019re nothing like Jilly, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I look like her. You said so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you look like that\u2019s important. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside you that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jilly love you and Grandma and just not me?\u201d</p><p>Carrie was exasperated. \u201cI thought you understood what I was telling you. Jilly doesn\u2019t love anyone but herself. She doesn\u2019t love Grandma, she doesn\u2019t love me, and she doesn\u2019t love you. Now do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cCan I play with the jewelry now, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled. The child, it seemed, had moved on to more important matters. She watched her sit at the vanity and begin to dig through the box again. \u201cYou know what\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t look around when she answered. \u201cHaving you for my aunt Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think is the best thing?\u201d she asked, surprised and pleased. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause that\u2019s what you told me is the best thing.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie laughed. \u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s something even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t growing up afraid all the time the way I was. Jilly\u2019s never going to come back. You won\u2019t ever have to see her . . . not ever. That\u2019s definitely the best thing.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran down Carrie\u2019s back the second the words were out of her mouth. Was she tempting fate by making such a boast? Could one summon up a demon simply by proclaiming that it didn\u2019t exist? The chill felt like a premonition. But of course it wasn\u2019t. She was just a worrier, that was all. Shaking off her grim feeling, she went back to work.</p><p>The following week was busy. Avery chose pink for her walls, and Carrie added white trim. She thought the bedroom looked like an explosion of Pepto-Bismol, but Avery loved it. She was all settled in the big front bedroom by Sunday afternoon. Carrie\u2019s suitcases had been packed in the trunk of the car. Carrie was going to sleep in Avery\u2019s old bedroom on the grossly uncomfortable daybed her last night.</p><p>They had all of Carrie\u2019s favorite foods for dinner that night\u2014forbidden food on her perpetual diet\u2014fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans simmering in bacon fat. Lola had made a fresh salad, using the vegetables she\u2019d grown in her backyard, but Carrie barely touched it. Since she\u2019d already decided to take a day off from her diet\u2014one wonderful, guilt-free day\u2014she ate two helpings of everything else with unbridled gusto.</p><p>After Grandma Lola had read Avery a story and tucked her into bed, Carrie went in to kiss her good night. She turned on the nightlight, shut the bedroom door, and then went back downstairs to put some last-minute paperwork in her carry-on.</p><p>One task led to another, and she didn\u2019t get back upstairs until after eleven. Lola was already asleep in her room at the back of the house. Carrie checked on Avery\u2014oh, how she was going to miss the pip-squeak\u2014and she almost burst into laughter when she spotted her niece in the big bed. The child was wearing at least five necklaces and four bracelets. The tarnished tiara with most of its glass diamonds missing was tangled in strands of her hair and tilted to the side of her head. She was sleeping on her back clutching a worn-out teddy bear in her arm. Carrie sat down on the bed and tried not to disturb her niece as she gently removed the jewelry.</p><p>After she put the trinkets back in the box, she walked quietly to the door. She was pulling it closed when Avery whispered, \u201cGood night, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already closed her eyes by the time Carrie turned around to look at her. In the soft glow from the streetlight the little girl looked like a cherub. Carrie didn\u2019t think she could love her any more if she were her very own child. The instinct to protect was overwhelming. She hated the thought of going away, felt as though she were abandoning her.</p><p>She had to leave, she reminded herself. Avery\u2019s future depended on her. When she was financially secure, she would be able to support her mother and her niece in the style she felt they both deserved. Guilt was a powerful deterent, but Carrie wasn\u2019t about to let it interfere with her plans. She had her goals and her dreams, and Avery and Lola were tied to both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d she whispered as she walked down the hall to the bathroom. She was still trying to convince herself when she stepped into the shower.</p><p>Carrie had just turned on the water full blast when the slamming of the car doors awakened Avery. She heard a deep laugh and got out of bed to see who was making the noise. She saw a man and a woman. They were standing by the side of an old, beat-up car, their heads together, laughing and talking.</p><p>The woman had golden hair. The man was as dark as she was fair. He had something in his hand. Avery peeked around the side of the window so they wouldn\u2019t see her and maybe shout at her to stop being nosy. The man raised a bottle and took a big drink. Then he offered the bottle to the woman, and she tilted her head back and took a drink too.</p><p>What were they doing in front of Grandma\u2019s house? Avery got down on her knees and hid behind the lace curtains. She ducked when the woman turned and started up the sidewalk. The mean-looking man didn\u2019t follow her. He leaned against the fender of the car, one ankle crossed over the other. He took another drink, then threw the empty bottle into the street. The sound of the glass shattering was almost as loud as Avery\u2019s gasp. It was bad to litter. Grandma Lola told her so.</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t looking at the house. He was watching the street, so Avery thought it was safe to straighten up and get a better look. She saw something sticking out of his back pocket when he turned toward the car. What was it? Maybe another bottle?</p><p>The mean-looking man wearing the dirty T-shirt must be awful thirsty \u2019cause he reached behind and pulled the bottle out. Only it wasn\u2019t a bottle after all. She gasped again. The bad man was holding a shiny black gun. Just like the kind she\u2019d seen on television.</p><p>She was too excited to be scared. Just wait until she told Peyton what she was seeing. Should she wake up Grandma and Carrie and tell them about the gun? Maybe they\u2019d call Officer Friendly at the police station and then he would come and take the bad man away.</p><p>Avery jumped when the banging started at the front door. It was the lady, she thought, calling on Grandma in the middle of the night.</p><p>The lady was shouting terrible bad words. Avery ran back to bed and hid under the covers in case her grandmother checked on her before she went downstairs to tell the lady to stop making so much noise. She knew what her grandma would say to the woman. \u201cAre you trying to wake the dead?\u201d That\u2019s what she\u2019d say, all right. It was the same thing she always said to Carrie when she had the television or the stereo up too loud. But if Grandma looked in and saw that Avery was out of bed before she went downstairs, then Avery would never know what was going on.</p><p>Sometimes you had to do bad things to find out anything important. Peyton had told her that it wasn\u2019t awful bad to listen to other people talking as long as you didn\u2019t ever tell anyone what you heard.</p><p>The banging turned into pounding as the lady demanded that Grandma let her in.</p><p>Grandma opened the door, and Avery heard the lady shouting some more. She understood every word she said. Avery suddenly wasn\u2019t curious any longer. She was terrified. Throwing the sheet off and jumping to the floor, she dropped to her belly and crawled underneath the bed. She scooted up to the headboard and rolled into a ball with her knees tucked under her chin. She was a big girl, too big to cry. The tears streaming down her cheeks were just there because she was squeezing her eyes shut so tight. She cupped her hands over her ears to block out the terrible yelling.</p><p>Avery knew who the bad lady was. She was her no-good mama, Jilly, and she had come back to take her away.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>THE WAIT WAS MAKING AVERY CRAZY. SHE SAT IN HER LITTLE square cubicle, her back against the wall, one leg crossed over the other, drumming her fingertips against the desktop with one hand and holding an icepack against her wounded knee with the other. What was taking so long? Why hadn\u2019t Andrews called? She stared hard at the phone, willing it to ring. Nothing. Not a sound. Turning in her swivel chair, she checked the digital clock for the hundredth time. It was now 10:05, same as it was ten seconds ago. For Pete\u2019s sake, she should have heard something by now.</p><p>Mel Gibson stood up and leaned over the partition separating his workspace from Avery\u2019s and gave her a sympathetic look. That was his honest-to-goodness, real name, but Mel thought it was holding him back because no one in the law enforcement agency would ever take him seriously. Yet, he refused to have it legally changed to \u201cBrad Pitt,\u201d as his supportive coworkers had suggested.</p><p>\u201cHi, Brad,\u201d Avery said. She and the others were still trying out the new name to see if it fit. Last week it was \u201cGeorge Clooney,\u201d and that name got about the same reaction \u201cBrad\u201d was getting now, a glare and a reminder that his name wasn\u2019t \u201cGeorge,\u201d it wasn\u2019t \u201cBrad,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t \u201cMel.\u201d It was \u201cMelvin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably should have heard by now,\u201d he said.</p><p>She refused to let him rile her. Tall, geeky-looking, with an extremely prominent Adam\u2019s apple, Mel had the annoying habit of using his third finger to push his thick wire-rimmed glasses back up on his ski nose. Margo, another coworker, told Avery that Mel did it on purpose. It was his way of letting the other three know how superior he felt he was.</p><p>Avery disagreed. Mel wouldn\u2019t do anything improper. He lived by a code of ethics he believed personified the FBI. He was dedicated, responsible, hardworking, ambitious, and he dressed for the job he wanted . . . with one little glitch. Although he was only twenty-seven years old, his clothing resembled the attire agents wore back in the fifties. Black suits, white long-sleeved shirts with button-down collars, skinny black ties, black wingtip shoes with a perfect shine, and a crew cut she knew he got trimmed once every two weeks.</p><p>For all of his strange habits\u2014he could quote any line from The FBI Story, starring Jimmy Stewart\u2014he had an incredibly sharp mind and was the ultimate team player. He just needed to lighten up a bit. That was all.</p><p>\u201cI mean, don\u2019t you think you should have heard by now?\u201d He sounded as worried as she felt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d Then, less than five seconds later, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We should have heard by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI said that you should have heard. Lou and Margo and I didn\u2019t have anything to do with your decision to call in the SWAT team.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, what had she been thinking? \u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t want to take the flak if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot flak,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fall. I need this job. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019m going to get to being an agent. With my eyesight . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelvin,\u201d he automatically corrected. \u201cAnd the benefits are great.\u201d</p><p>Margo stood so she could join the conversation. \u201cThe pay sucks, though.\u201d</p><p>Mel shrugged. \u201cSo does the work environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still . . . it\u2019s the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our work environment?\u201d Lou asked as he too stood. His workstation was on Avery\u2019s left. Mel\u2019s was directly in front of hers, and Margo\u2019s cubicle was adjacent to Lou\u2019s. The pen\u2014as they lovingly called their hellhole office space\u2014was located behind the mechanical room with its noisy water heaters and compressors. \u201cI mean, really, what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d he asked again, sounding bewildered.</p><p>Lou was as clueless as ever, but also endearing, Avery thought. Whenever she looked at him, she was reminded of Pig-Pen in the old Peanuts cartoon. Lou always looked disheveled. He was absolutely brilliant, yet he couldn\u2019t seem to find his mouth when he was eating, and his short-sleeved shirt usually had at least one stain. This morning there were two. One was jelly from the raspberry-filled doughnuts Margo had brought in. The big red spot was just above the black ink stain from the cartridge pen in his white shirt pocket.</p><p>Lou tucked in his shirttail for the third time that morning and said, \u201cI like being down here. It\u2019s cozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe work in the corner of the basement without any windows,\u201d Margo pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Lou asked. \u201cWhere we work doesn\u2019t make us any less important. We\u2019re all part of a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be a part of the team that has windows,\u201d Margo said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have everything. Say, Avery, how\u2019s the knee?\u201d he asked, suddenly changing subjects.</p><p>She gingerly lifted the icepack and surveyed the damage. \u201cThe swelling\u2019s gone down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d Mel asked. He was the only one who hadn\u2019t heard the grisly details.</p><p>Margo ran her fingers through her short dark curls and said, \u201cAn old lady nearly killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her Cadillac,\u201d Lou said. \u201cIt happened in her parking garage. The woman obviously didn\u2019t see her. There really ought to be an age restriction on renewing a driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she hit you?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Avery answered. \u201cI dove to get out of her way when she came roaring around the corner. I ended up flying across the hood of a Mercedes and whacked my knee on the hood ornament. I recognized the Cadillac. It belongs to Mrs. Speigel, who lives in my building. I think she\u2019s about ninety. She\u2019s not supposed to drive anymore, but every once in a while I\u2019ll see her taking the car out to do errands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she stop?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think she had a clue I was there. She was accelerating so fast I was just glad there weren\u2019t any other people in her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Lou,\u201d Margo said. She disappeared behind her cubicle wall, bent down to push the box of copy paper into the corner, and then stood on top of it. She was suddenly as tall as Mel. \u201cThere should be an age limit on keeping a license. Avery told us the woman was so little she couldn\u2019t see her head over the back of the seat. Just a puff of gray hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bodies shrink as we age,\u201d Mel said. \u201cJust think, Margo. When you\u2019re ninety, no one will be able to see you.\u201d</p> <p>Margo, a petite five feet two inches, wasn\u2019t offended. \u201cI\u2019ll just wear higher heels.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, interrupting the conversation. Avery jumped at the sound, then checked the time. It was 10:14.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d she whispered as it rang a second time.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it,\u201d Margo anxiously demanded.</p><p>Avery picked up the phone on the third ring. \u201cAvery Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Carter would like to see you in his office at ten-thirty, Miss Delaney.\u201d</p> <p>She recognized the voice. Carter\u2019s secretary had a distinct Maine accent. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Three pairs of eyes watched her as she hung up the phone. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Margo, the most impatient of the group, demanded.</p><p>\u201cCarter wants to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. That can\u2019t be good.\u201d Mel made the remark, and then, as if he realized he\u2019d said something he shouldn\u2019t have, added, \u201cYou want us to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Avery asked, surprised by the offer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take the bullet alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we should all go,\u201d Margo said. \u201cA mass firing. I mean, we\u2019re all in this together, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Avery agreed. \u201cBut you three tried to talk me out of going to Andrews. Remember? I\u2019m the only one who screwed up.\u201d She stood, put the icepack on top of the file cabinet, and reached for her jacket.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be good,\u201d Mel repeated. \u201cThey\u2019re breaking the chain of command. It must be really bad to get the boss\u2019s boss involved. Carter was just promoted to head of in-house operations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he\u2019s now the boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss,\u201d Margo pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if all the bosses will be there,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Avery muttered. \u201cMaybe all three of them want to take a turn firing me.\u201d She buttoned her suit jacket and then said, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone tried to run over you,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cYour hose are shredded,\u201d Margo told her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought I had another pair in my drawer, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an extra pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Margo, but you\u2019re a petite, and I\u2019m not. Mel, Lou, turn around or sit down.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they turned their backs, she reached up under her skirt and pulled off her panty hose. Then she put her heels back on.</p><p>She was sorry now she\u2019d worn the suit. She usually wore pants and a blouse, but she was going to a luncheon today and so she\u2019d pulled out all the stops and put on the Armani suit her aunt Carrie had sent as a present two years ago. The color was a wonderful taupe gray and had a matching sleeveless V neck shell. At one time there had been an obscene slit up the side, but Avery had sewn it together. It was a great-looking suit. Now it would be remembered as the suit she wore the day she got fired.</p><p>\u201cCatch,\u201d Margo said as she threw the new package of panty hose at Avery. \u201cThese are the one-size-fits-all kind. They\u2019ll work just fine. You have to wear hose. You know the dress code.\u201d</p><p>Avery read the label. It did say the hose would fit every size. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said as she sat down again. Her legs were long, and she was afraid of tearing the hose when she pulled them up over her hips, but they seemed to fit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Mel told her when she stood up again and adjusted her skirt. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed how short it was? The hem barely touched the top of her knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got four minutes left.\u201d After she\u2019d put on some lip gloss and clipped her hair back behind her neck with a barrette, she slipped the heels back on. Only then did she notice how loose the right heel was. She must have broken it when she slammed into the hood of the car.</p><p>Can\u2019t do anything about it now, she thought. She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and limped toward the aisle. With every step, her left knee throbbed.</p><p>\u201cWish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery,\u201d Mel shouted. He waited until she turned around, then hurled her clip-on ID. \u201cYou should probably wear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. They\u2019ll want to take it from me before they escort me out of the building.\u201d</p><p>Margo called after her. \u201cHey, Avery, think of it this way\u2014if you get fired, you won\u2019t have to worry about all the work piling up while you and your aunt chill out at that fancy spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to meet my aunt or not. She still thinks I\u2019m chaperoning those kids around D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now that that got canceled, you ought to go get pampered,\u201d Margo argued.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you should go,\u201d Lou said. \u201cYou could stay at Utopia a whole month and work on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping, guys,\u201d Avery said without looking back.</p><p>Carter\u2019s office was four flights up. On any other day she would have taken the stairs as aerobic exercise, but her left knee ached too much, and the heel on her right shoe was too wobbly. She was exhausted by the time she reached the elevator. While she waited for it, she rehearsed what she would say when Carter asked what in God\u2019s name she thought she was doing.</p><p>The doors parted. She took a step forward and felt something snap. Glancing down, she spotted the heel of her shoe lodged in the seam between the elevator and the floor. Since she was alone, she hiked her skirt up and bent down on her good knee to pry the heel loose. It was then that the elevator doors closed on her head.</p><p>Muttering an expletive, Avery fell back. The car began to move and she grabbed the railing. She clutched the broken heel in her hand and pulled herself to her feet just as the doors opened on the first floor. By the time she reached the fourth floor, the elevator was full of passengers, and she was squeezed to the back of the car. Feeling like an idiot, she excused her way to the front and limped off.</p><p>Unfortunately, Carter\u2019s office was located at the end of a long corridor. The glass doors were so far away she couldn\u2019t even read the name etched above the brass handle.</p><p>Suck it up, she thought as she started walking. She was halfway there when she stopped to check the time and give her leg a rest. She had one minute. She could make it, she thought as she started walking again. Her barrette slipped out of her hair, but she caught it before it fell to the floor. She clipped it back in place and continued on. She was beginning to wish Mrs. Speigel\u2019s car had actually struck her. Then she wouldn\u2019t have to come up with any excuses, and Carter could call her at the hospital and fire her over the phone.</p><p>Suck it up, she repeated. Could it get any worse?</p><p>Of course it could. At precisely the second she was pulling the door open, her panty hose began to slip. By the time she\u2019d limped over to the receptionist, the waistband was down around her hips.</p><p>The stately brunette woman wearing a knockoff Chanel suit looked a bit startled as she watched Avery approach.</p><p>\u201cMiss Delaney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right on time. Mr. Carter will appreciate that. He keeps a tight schedule.\u201d</p><p>Avery leaned forward as the woman picked up the phone to announce her. \u201cIs there a ladies\u2019 room close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s down the hall, past the bank of elevators, on your left.\u201d</p><p>Avery glanced behind her and considered her options. She could be late for the appointment, try to run like hell down the mile-long hallway and rip off the damn pantyhose, or she could\u2014</p><p>The receptionist interrupted her frantic thoughts. \u201cMr. Carter will see you now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYou may go inside,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Avery slowly straightened. The panty hose stayed put. Smiling, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go on in then.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted and held her smile as she grabbed the edge of the desk, and then tried to walk as though her shoe still had a heel. With any luck, Carter wouldn\u2019t even notice her condition.</p><p>Who was she kidding? The man was trained to be observant.</p><p>Tall, distinguished-looking, with a thick head of silver-tipped hair and a square chin, Tom Carter stood when she entered. She hobbled forward. When she reached the chair in front of his desk, she wanted to throw herself into it, but waited for him to give her permission.</p><p>Carter reached across the desk to shake her hand, and it was then, as she was stretching forward, that her panty hose gave up the fight. The crotch was now down around her knees. In a panic, she grabbed his hand and shook it vigorously. Too late she realized she was clutching the heel of her shoe in her right hand. She hadn\u2019t sweated this much since she took the graduate record exam.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, sir. An honor, really. You wanted to see me? My, it\u2019s warm in here. Would you mind if I removed my jacket?\u201d</p><p>She was rambling but couldn\u2019t seem to stop. The remark about the temperature had gotten his attention, though. Thank God, the rumors were right. Carter did have his own thermostat and liked to keep his office just below freezing. It was like an Alaskan tomb. Avery was surprised she couldn\u2019t see her breath when she exhaled. That\u2019s when she realized she wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Calm down, she told herself. Take a deep breath.</p><p>Carter enthusiastically nodded. He didn\u2019t mention the heel that had dropped on top of a stack of files on his desk. \u201cI thought it was warm, but my assistant keeps telling me it\u2019s cold in here. Let me just turn down the thermostat a notch.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to give her permission to sit. The second he turned his back, she snatched the heel off the files\u2014which she noticed were labeled with her name and the names of the other members of the pen\u2014and then fell into the chair. Her panty hose were in a wad around her knees. She frantically unbuttoned her jacket, removed it, and draped it over her lap.</p><p>Her arms and shoulders were covered in goose bumps seconds later.</p><p>Suck it up, she thought. It was going to be okay. Once he sat down behind his desk, she could slowly work the hose down her legs and get rid of them. Carter would never be the wiser.</p><p>It was a great plan, and it would have worked if Carter had cooperated, but he didn\u2019t return to his chair. He walked over to her side, then leaned back to sit on the edge of his desk. She wasn\u2019t short by Margo\u2019s standards, but she still had to tilt her head back in order to look into his eyes. There seemed to be a twinkle, which she thought was quite odd, unless, of course, he enjoyed firing people. God, maybe that rumor was true too.</p><p>\u201cI noticed you were limping. How did you hurt your knee?\u201d he asked. He bent down to pick up the barrette that had fallen to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAn accident,\u201d she said, taking the barrette and dropping it in her lap.</p><p>She could tell from the quizzical look in his eyes she hadn\u2019t given him a satisfactory answer.</p><p>\u201cAn elderly lady . . . quite elderly, as a matter of fact, driving a rather large vehicle, didn\u2019t see me when I was walking toward my car in my parking garage. I had to jump out of the way so she wouldn\u2019t hit me. I ended up on top of a Mercedes, and I think that\u2019s when I broke my heel and bruised my knee.\u201d Then, before he could make a comment about the unfortunate incident, she plunged on. \u201cActually, I only loosened the heel then. It broke off in the elevator as the doors were closing on my head.\u201d He was staring at her as though she had just turned into a babbling fool. \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t been a good morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d brace myself if I were you,\u201d he said, his voice suddenly grim. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. Carter finally went behind his desk and sat down. She seized the opportunity. Slipping her hands under her jacket and skirt, she worked the panty hose down her legs. It was awkward but doable, and, other than appearing to be squirming in the hot seat, she managed the feat. While he opened her file and began to read the notes he or someone else had compiled against her, she grabbed the hose and wadded them into a ball. She had her shoes back on by the time he looked up at her again.</p><p>\u201cI received a call from Mike Andrews,\u201d he began. There it was again, that grim, you\u2019re-gonna-get-your-ass-fired tone of voice.</p><p>Her stomach felt as though it had just dropped to her ankles. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Not well,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cI found his number and called him before I left the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd during that phone call you convinced him to deploy a SWAT team to First National Bank on . . .\u201d He looked down again, searching the file for the location.</p><p>She rattled off the address, adding, \u201cThe branch is near the state line.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, crossed his arms, and said, \u201cTell me what you know about these robberies.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to relax. She was on safe ground now, in control. Since she had typed all the agents\u2019 reports into the computer and looked at the bank tapes, she\u2019d learned, and pretty much memorized, every little detail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe robbers call themselves the Politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are three of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cThere have been three robberies in the past three months. The men, all wearing white clothes, entered the first bank, First National Bank and Trust on Twelfth Street, on March fifteenth, exactly three minutes after the bank had opened for business. The men used guns to subdue the personnel and one customer, but they didn\u2019t fire those weapons. The man shouting the orders held a knife against the security guard\u2019s neck. When the other two were running toward the door, the leader stabbed the guard, dropped the knife, and then left. The guard had done nothing to provoke the man. There was absolutely no reason to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t,\u201d Carter agreed.</p> <p>\u201cThe second robbery took place on April thirteenth at the Bank of America in Maryland. A bank manager, a woman, was killed during that robbery. The leader was on his way out the door. He suddenly turned around and fired point-blank. Once again, there didn\u2019t seem to be a reason, because the personnel had been desperately trying to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the third robbery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one took place on May fifteenth at Goldman\u2019s Bank and Trust in Maryland,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you know, the violence escalated. Two people were killed, and a third was left for dead but has miraculously recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got your facts down,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, tell me. What made you think a little branch of the First National Bank in Virginia would be the next target?\u201d</p><p>His stare was unnerving. She glanced down at her lap while she gathered her thoughts and then looked up again. She knew how she had arrived at the conclusion, but explaining it to the head of in-house operations was going to be difficult.</p> <p>\u201cI guess you could say it\u2019s all in how I look at things. It was all there . . . most of it anyway, in the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else saw it in the file,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThey hit different banks with the three robberies, but you convinced Andrews that they were going to hit another branch of First National again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . remarkable how you talked him into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she said, hoping Andrews hadn\u2019t told Carter every word she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYou used my name.\u201d</p> <p>She inwardly cringed. \u201cYes, sir. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Andrews the order came from me. Is that correct, Delaney?\u201d</p><p>Here it comes, she thought. The you\u2019re-getting-your-ass-fired part. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the facts, shall we? Here\u2019s what I want to know. The Politicians had struck on March fifteenth, April thirteenth, then May fifteenth. We didn\u2019t know why they were hitting on those specific days, but you did, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s what you told Andrews,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t go into an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s time now. How did you arrive at your conclusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare, sir,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cShakespeare?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir. The robberies all followed the same pattern, almost like a ritual of some kind. I got a printout of the first bank\u2019s records for the week prior to the robbery. I did the same with the other two banks. I thought something might show up that would link them,\u201d she said.</p><p>She paused to shake her head. \u201cI had reams and reams of printouts all over the office, and I did find something a little curious. Fortunately, I had the discs from the banks, and I was able to cross-check with the computer.\u201d</p><p>Carter rubbed his jaw, distracting her. She could see a hint of impatience in his eyes. \u201cSir, bear with me another minute. Now, the first bank was robbed on March fifteenth. Does that date trigger anything in your mind?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, she plunged ahead. \u201cThe ides of March? Julius Caesar?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been in the back of my mind last night while I was reading all the printouts, and I noticed an ATM withdrawal was made by a man named Nate Cassius. I still hadn\u2019t quite put it together,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I realized, if I was right, and I was hoping to heaven I was, that the leader of the Politicians was leaving us clues. Maybe he was playing some twisted game. Maybe he was waiting to see how long it would take us to catch on.\u201d</p><p>She had his full attention now. \u201cContinue,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAs I mentioned before, the dates frustrated me until I did my research. I looked up the Roman calendar and found that when the Romans were calculating the length of the months, they also figured the date of the ides. We know from Shakespeare\u2019s play Julius Caesar that the ides of March falls on the fifteenth. But not all the months. Some fall on the thirteenth. So, using that logic, I went back over the ATM withdrawals the week prior to the second and third robberies, and guess what I found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Nate Cassius make a withdrawal from those banks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut a William Brutus did in one bank, and Mario Casca did in the other . . . and the withdrawals happened just two days before the robberies. I think they were sizing up the layout of the banks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, leaning forward now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put it together until the last minute. I had to pull up the transaction records for all of the banks in the tri-state area from the eleventh on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the other two withdrawals were made exactly two days before the actual robberies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent most of the night cross-checking with the data I had in the computer for the eleventh, and by gosh, there it was. Mr. John Ligarius had made a withdrawal from that little branch of First National at three-forty-five in the morning. All of these names\u2014Cassius, Brutus, Casca, Ligarius\u2014they were conspirators against Caesar. I didn\u2019t have time to run a check on the people who owned these cards, but I did find out that the cards were issued from banks in Arlington. It added up. Ligarius made a withdrawal from The First National Bank. So, The First National Bank was the next target.</p><p>\u201cI thought that time was critical, and my superior, Mr. Douglas, wasn\u2019t available. He had already left to catch a four-hour flight, and it wasn\u2019t possible for me to talk to him. I used initiative,\u201d she stressed. \u201cAnd I would rather have been wrong and lose my job than keep silent and find out after the fact that I was right. Sir, my conclusions and subsequent actions will be in the report I\u2019m typing up, and when you read it, you will note that I take full responsibility for my actions. My coworkers had nothing to do with my decision to call Andrews. But in my defense,\u201d she hastened to add, \u201cI, like the others in my department, have a master\u2019s degree, and we\u2019re all very good at what we do. We aren\u2019t simply typists transferring agents\u2019 notes into the database. We analyze the information we\u2019re given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does the computer program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the computer doesn\u2019t have heart or instincts. We do. And, sir, now that we\u2019re on the subject of job descriptions, I would like to mention that the minimum wage has gone up, but our salaries have not.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cAre you hitting me up for a raise?\u201d</p><p>She winced. Maybe she had said too much, but at least if she was going to lose her job, Lou and Mel and Margo might benefit. She felt a sudden burst of anger because she and her coworkers were so undervalued. She folded her arms and looked directly into his eyes. \u201cAs I\u2019ve reviewed the facts for you, I\u2019ve become more convinced than ever that I was right. I had no other choice than to notify Andrews, and he wouldn\u2019t move until I used your name. I know I overstepped my authority, but there simply was no time and I had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got them, Avery.\u201d</p><p>She stopped short and then said, \u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said Andrews and his men got them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she was so shocked by the news, but she was. \u201cAll of them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAndrews and his team were waiting, and at precisely three minutes after ten, the three men stormed the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThank heavens.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. \u201cThey were wearing white. Did you figure out the significance of the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. The Roman senators wore white robes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three men are being interrogated now, but I imagine you have already figured out what their game was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably consider themselves anarchists trying to bring down the government. They\u2019ll tell you they\u2019re trying to kill Caesar and probably even hail themselves as martyrs for the cause, but you know what? When you cut through all the phony baloney, it\u2019s the same old same old. Greed was the real motivator. They were trying to be clever about it. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling, feeling quite pleased with herself, when a sudden thought occurred to her. \u201cSir, you said my morning was going to get worse,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a press conference in . . .\u201d He paused to glance at the clock. \u201c. . . ten minutes, and you\u2019re the star attraction. I understand you have an aversion to being in the spotlight. I don\u2019t like press conferences either, but we do what we have to do.\u201d</p><p>Avery could feel the panic building. \u201cMike Andrews and his team should do the press conference. They apprehended the suspects. I was simply doing my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being modest, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward as she interrupted him. \u201cSir, I\u2019d rather have a root canal.\u201d</p><p>He caught himself before he smiled, but the twinkle had returned to his eyes. \u201cSo this aversion is deep-rooted then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. It is.\u201d She appreciated his attempt to lighten the mood, but she couldn\u2019t get rid of her growing apprehension. \u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is my file on your desk? I did follow procedure . . . as best I could,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t plan to fire me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to familiarize myself with your department,\u201d he said as he picked up the file.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting a new superior.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like hearing that. She and the others got along well with Douglas, and change was difficult.</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Douglas retiring, then? He\u2019s been talking about it for as long as I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carter answered.</p><p>Bummer, she thought. \u201cMay I ask who my new boss is?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up from the folder in his hand. \u201cMe,\u201d he answered. He let her absorb the information before continuing. \u201cThe four of you will be moved into my department.\u201d</p><p>She perked up. \u201cWe\u2019re getting new office space?\u201d</p><p>Her excitement was quickly squelched. \u201cNo, you\u2019ll stay where you are, but starting Monday morning, you\u2019ll report directly to me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to look happy. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll be running up and down four flights of stairs every time we need to talk to you?\u201d She knew she sounded like a whiner, but it was too late to take the words back.</p><p>\u201cWe do have elevators, and most of our employees are able to ride them without getting their heads caught between the doors.\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm didn\u2019t faze her. \u201cYes, sir. May I ask if we\u2019ll be getting raises? We\u2019re all way past due for our evaluations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour evaluation is taking place right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She wished he\u2019d mentioned that fact starting out. \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the interview portion of the evaluation, and during an interview I ask the questions, and you answer them. That\u2019s pretty much how it works.\u201d</p><p>He opened her file and began to read. He started with the personal statement she\u2019d written when she\u2019d applied, then scanned her background information.</p><p>\u201cYou lived with your grandmother, Lola Delaney, until the age of eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>She watched him flip through the pages, obviously checking facts and dates. She wanted to ask him why he felt the need to go over her history, but she knew that if she did, she\u2019d sound defensive and maybe even antagonistic, and so she gripped her hands together and kept quiet. Carter was her new superior, and she wanted to start off on the right foot.</p><p>\u201cLola Delaney was murdered on the night of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFebruary fourteenth,\u201d she said without emotion. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cYou saw it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He began to peruse the notes once again. \u201cDale Skarrett, the man who killed your grandmother, was already a wanted man. There was a warrant for his arrest in connection with a jewelry heist where the storeowner was murdered, and over four million in uncut stones were stolen. The diamonds weren\u2019t recovered, and Skarrett was never formally charged.\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cThe evidence against him was circumstantial, and it\u2019s doubtful they would have gotten a conviction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Carter agreed. \u201cJill Delaney was also wanted for questioning in connection with the robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t at the house the night your grandmother was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure she sent Skarrett to kidnap me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach began to tighten. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knew what had happened until the next morning, and by the time the police arrived, Skarrett was long gone and you were in critical condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought I was dead,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cYou were airlifted to Children\u2019s Hospital in Jacksonville. One month later, when you had recovered from your injuries\u2014a remarkable feat given the extent of the damage\u2014your aunt Carolyn took you to her home in Bel Air, California.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cThat\u2019s where Skarrett came after you again, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the tension building inside her. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the only eyewitness who could put him away for life. Fortunately, I had a guardian angel. The FBI was protecting me without my knowing it. Skarrett showed up at school just as it was letting out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was unarmed and later told the authorities he only wanted to talk to you. Skarrett was arrested and charged with second degree murder,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was convicted and is currently serving his sentence in Florida. He was up for parole a couple of years ago and was denied. His next hearing should be coming up sometime this year.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI regularly check with the prosecutor\u2019s office, and I will be sent notification once the date for the hearing is set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the new trial?\u201d he asked. He tapped the papers with his knuckles and said, \u201cI was curious to know why his attorney thinks he has grounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he does have grounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe brief that was filed accused the prosecutor of withholding vital information. My grandmother had a heart condition, and the physician who treated her came forward after he read about her death. That information wasn\u2019t handed over to Skarrett\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t heard yet if, in fact, there will be a new trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get back to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be cooperative a second longer. \u201cSir, may I ask why you\u2019re so interested in my background?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re being evaluated,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cTwo weeks after Skarrett was convicted, Jill Delaney was killed in an automobile accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Avery had forgotten much of her childhood, but she remembered that phone call clearly. She had just celebrated Carrie\u2019s birthday, a belated event since Avery had been in the hospital on the actual date, and was helping the housekeeper put the vegetables on the table before they all sat down to dinner. Avery had placed the mashed potatoes next to Uncle Tony\u2019s plate when Aunt Carrie answered the phone. A funeral director was calling to tell her that Jilly had been cremated in a fiery car crash, but there were enough of her remains left to put in an urn. He wanted to know what Carrie wanted done with the ashes and the personal effects, which included a charred driver\u2019s license. Avery was standing in front of the bay window staring out at some frantic hummingbirds when she overheard Carrie tell the man to throw them in the nearest Dumpster. She could recall every second of that moment.</p><p>Carter drew her attention back to their discussion when he suddenly switched subjects.</p><p>\u201cYou did your undergraduate work at Santa Clara University, graduated with honors with a major in psychology and a minor in political science and another minor in history. You then went to Stanford and received a master\u2019s in criminal justice.\u201d Having said that, he closed her file. \u201cIn your personal statement you said you made up your mind to become an FBI agent when you were twelve years old. Why?\u201d</p><p>She knew he\u2019d already read her answer. It was there in the personal statement she\u2019d made when she\u2019d applied to the Bureau. \u201cAn FBI agent named John Cross saved my life. If he hadn\u2019t been watching out for me . . . if Skarrett had taken me from school, my life would have been over.\u201d</p> <p>Carter nodded. \u201cAnd you believed you could make a difference working for the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you become a field agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBureaucracy,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up in my current position. I was going to put in another six months and then request a transfer.\u201d</p><p>His assistant interrupted. \u201cMr. Carter, they\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>The panic grabbed her again. \u201cSir, Mike Andrews really should handle the press conference. Any credit should go to him and his team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, none of us likes doing this,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut this was such a high-profile case, and frankly, most people would appreciate receiving some recognition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy coworkers and I would rather have raises . . . and windows, sir. We\u2019d like windows too. Are you aware that our offices are located behind the mechanical room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpace is at a premium,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when did you get the idea we were negotiating?\u201d</p><p>Her back stiffened. \u201cSir, in an evaluation\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cYou told me you acted alone when you called Andrews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct, but the others were . . . integral. Yes, sir, they were integral in helping me go through those files for names.\u201d</p><p>One eyelid dropped. \u201cYou do realize that lying won\u2019t get you a raise, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, Mel and Lou and Margo and I are a team. They did help. They just weren\u2019t as convinced as I was . . .\u201d</p><p>The buzzer sounded on his intercom. Carter impatiently hit the button and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Then he reached for his suit jacket and put it on, frowning at her all the while.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Delaney,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou\u2019re off the hook. I\u2019m not going to make you do the press conference.\u201d</p><p>Her relief made her weak. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>She stood when he walked around the desk, the wadded panty hose hidden under the jacket draped over her arm. Carter stopped at the door and then turned back with the frown still creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever use my name again without my permission, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>MARRIAGE ISN\u2019T FOR THE SQUEAMISH. BOTH HUSBAND AND wife must be willing to let their inner children play dirty if they want their marriage to survive and flourish. They must let their inner children roll around in the mud. Mistakes will be inevitable, of course, but a shower of love and forgiveness will cleanse the union, and the healing will then begin.</p><p>What a crock. Carolyn Delaney Salvetti sat in wide-eyed disbelief as she listened to the garbage the marriage counselor pontificated from his self-help, self-published manual, aptly and ludicrously titled Let Your Inner Child Get Dirty. Was the moron talking about marriage or mud wrestling? Carrie didn\u2019t know, and at the moment she didn\u2019t particularly care.</p><p>Without being too obvious about it, she pushed the sleeve of her silk blouse up over her wrist and glanced down at her Cartier watch. Ten minutes to go. God, could she last that long?</p><p>She took a deep breath, let go of her sleeve, and leaned back in the plush chair, nodding ever so sagely so her husband and the moron would think she was paying attention.</p><p>Marriage isn\u2019t for the squeamish, he repeated in his slow, nasal, baritone drawl. His voice was like a loofah made of steel wool, irritating every nerve in her body.</p><p>The counselor was a pompous, fat, flatulent fraud who insisted on being called Dr. Pierce because he felt his full name, Dr. Pierce Ebricht, was too formal for such an intimate discussion. After all, he was supposed to be helping them bare their guts. After the first session, Carrie had dubbed him Dr. Prick. Her husband, Tony, had chosen him because he was \u201cin\u201d at the moment. The counselor, with his drive-through-window degree, was the newest guru whom everyone who was anyone flocked to for marriage rejuvenation. Dr. Pierce was the Dr. Phil for the rich and famous, but unlike Dr. Phil, the prick was a complete buffoon.</p><p>But then, so was Tony. He sat beside Carrie, his sweaty palms held together as though in prayer, looking so earnest and engaged, like a wooden Howdy Doody the counselor manually manipulated, nodding in quick agreement whenever Dr. Prick paused from reading his bible to look up expectantly.</p><p>Chewing on her lip was the only way she could keep from laughing . . . or screaming. Oh, how she wanted to scream. She didn\u2019t dare, though. She had made a bargain with her faithless sleazebag of a husband, and if she didn\u2019t behave and pretend that she was really trying to save their Titanic marriage, she would be paying alimony for the rest of her life. It was a chilling possibility.</p><p>The odds were against her. Tony came from a long line of centenarians. His uncle Enzo was still chugging wine out on his postage-stamp piece of land on the good side of Napa at the ripe old age of eighty-six and didn\u2019t seem to be slowing down at all. His only concession to living healthy was, at the age of eighty-five, to quit smoking his unfiltered Camels\u2014a three-pack-a-day habit\u2014and increase the amount of garlic he put on everything he ate, including his morning wheat toast. If Tony turned out to be as healthy and fit as Enzo was, by the time Carrie croaked, she would be drained dry financially, and there would be nothing left in the coffers to leave to the only person she had ever loved, her niece, Avery. If, on the other hand, she cooperated with Tony and attended all ten sessions with Dr. Prick, and the marriage still ended\u2014a foregone conclusion, in her opinion\u2014then, Tony promised, he would give up his interest in the business and not ask for a dime in alimony.</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t a fool. Cynical to the bone, she wasn\u2019t about to accept the word of a man she considered a habitual liar and a thief. There was a hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars missing from one of their business accounts. She couldn\u2019t prove that Tony had helped himself to the money, but she knew he had taken it, most likely to buy expensive trinkets for his mistress. The bastard. And so, to ensure he couldn\u2019t change his mind and come after her for alimony, she had made him put his promise in writing, then had called in her assistant to witness her husband signing the document. The paper was now safely locked away in her safe-deposit box at First Commerce Bank.</p><p>How had they come to this? she wondered. Tony used to be a loving and thoughtful man.</p><p>Carrie remembered the night she\u2019d awakened in excruciating pain. She was sure her agony was due to food poisoning\u2014they had eaten dinner at a new Thai restaurant all of her friends had been raving about. She refused to go to the hospital, and Tony was beside himself with worry. He finally picked her up, carried her to the car, and drove her to the hospital. He saved her life that night. After treatment in the emergency room, she was admitted, and Tony sat in a chair the rest of the night watching over her. He charmed the hospital staff into putting up with her complaints and demands, and filled the room with gerbera daisies, her favorite flowers.</p><p>Tony was so charismatic then. He still was, damn it, which was probably why all the young wanna-be starlets flocked around him. Was the temptation too much to resist? After all, she was getting older, and the years were beginning to show. Was that the reason he\u2019d decided to be unfaithful?</p><p>Surreptitiously checking her watch again, she suppressed a heartfelt sigh. In just five minutes the last session would be over and she wouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be nice to Dr. Prick. Then, like it or not, she was going away for a little rejuvenation of her own. Her Prada workout clothes were stuffed into her Gucci bags, along with her state-of-the-art laptop computer, three battery packs, and two cell phones with chargers. The luggage waited in the trunk of the limo that would take her from Dr. Prick\u2019s office to the airport.</p><p>The forced vacation was the first time she would be away from her company, Star Catcher, in over eight years, and she was filled with trepidation. She had a good staff, and she knew they could handle any problems that came up while she was away, but she was admittedly a control freak and couldn\u2019t stand the idea of letting anyone else make decisions, if only for fourteen days. According to Avery, Carrie was a Type A personality. She couldn\u2019t abide being idle or bored. She hadn\u2019t even taken time off for a honeymoon when she\u2019d married Tony. The short weekend in Baja had felt like a year away from her fledgling company, which was damned ironic considering she had allegedly been in the throes of love at the time.</p><p>The gold embossed reservation from the posh Utopia Spa had arrived three weeks ago\u2014just after their second session with Dr. Prick, and Carrie, after taking one look at the invitation, had been certain that Tony was behind the scheme to get her out of L.A. Her husband had feigned surprise, but she hadn\u2019t been fooled. He\u2019d been urging her to take some time off for months now and use the hiatus to work on their struggling marriage.</p><p>No matter how she nagged him to admit it, Tony wouldn\u2019t \u2019fess up. He insisted he hadn\u2019t made the reservation or paid the outrageous fee, and because he was even more stubborn than she was, she finally gave up trying to pry the truth out of him.</p><p>The reservation was accompanied by an elaborate brochure displaying the luxurious facility and outlining the treatments available at Utopia. There was also a letter attached with a list of testimonials from famous men and women who were regular clients.</p><p>She had heard of the spa\u2014everyone in Hollywood knew about it\u2014but she hadn\u2019t known how obviously popular it was with the rich and famous. Because the cost was so exorbitant, she hadn\u2019t ever considered it.</p><p>Carrie was torn. How important was it for her to go? Where one was seated at the \u201cin at the moment\u201d restaurants in L.A. was of paramount importance because one was seen and noticed, but a spa? It was so elegantly quiet and hush-hush, who would ever know besides the people attending that she had been there? Would the owner ask her to give a testimonial? God, wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful? If her name went on the list of the rich and famous, what an incredible boost that would be for her company. In her line of work, the only reason for doing anything these days was with the singular goal of impressing others and making them squirm with envy. Only the high rollers who didn\u2019t need to work got work in Hollywood.</p><p>What guarantee did she have that her name would go on that list, though? Carrie did the math, figured out to the penny how much each day would cost, and decided to stay home. She wasn\u2019t about to let Tony spend so much of her money. She would call the spa in the morning and request a refund. No way in hell was she going to fork over that much. She must have shouted those very words to Tony at least five times before he began to read aloud the names of those who regularly attended the rejuvenation spa and sang Utopia\u2019s praises. She stopped shouting when she heard the name Barbara Rolands. Everyone referred to the aging actress with three Oscars under her belt as the best face-lift on the coast. Barbara had disappeared for three weeks just last year, and when she next made a public appearance at a trendy fund-raiser, she looked incredible. Had she had the work done at the spa?</p><p>Carrie snatched the papers out of Tony\u2019s hands. She read the names of the personnel on call to attend to the client\u2019s every need. Two world-renowned plastic surgeons topped the list.</p><p>Would she be getting evaluated by the same physicians who had worked on some of the most influential men and women of the century? God only knew she could use some freshening up. Not a face-lift\u2014she wasn\u2019t even forty-five yet\u2014but the bags under her eyes were getting more and more pronounced, and she really did need to do something about that. Lack of sleep, long hours of work, and twenty cups of strong coffee every day without ever taking time to work out had definitely taken their toll.</p><p>According to the letter, she would fly from L.A. to Denver, then go by smaller plane to Aspen. Utopia was located in the mountains, fifteen minutes away from the closest ski resort. She would arrive in the shank of the evening, and the following morning she would be evaluated by the physicians there. Liposuction, she noticed, was offered as one of the choices available. The procedure was listed just below full body massage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could she refuse? How could she, indeed, especially after Tony mentioned that the anonymous gift was nonrefundable. She just knew he\u2019d used company money to pay for the trip. The man couldn\u2019t keep a dime in savings. Since they had merged their two companies and she had brought in their first multimillion-dollar account, he had been living high off the hog. He had absolutely no business sense.</p><p>Tony said it didn\u2019t matter where it came from and suggested she take the vacation as an early birthday present. He firmly believed one should never look a gift horse in the mouth. He told her he hoped she would use the time to reflect on all the wonderful words of wisdom Dr. Prick had spoken about the sanctity of marriage. She knew Tony was hoping that, once she slowed down, as one was wont to do on a vacation, she would realize how she had wronged him with her accusations and she would know in her heart that she still loved him.</p><p>Carrie had her own agenda. While she was being \u201credone,\u201d she would work on coming up with a killer commercial that would land her company another Clio. It had been too long since she\u2019d received the last award, almost four years now, and she was becoming more and more anxious. Advertising was a cutthroat business, and her competition, based mostly in Manhattan, was fierce. The twenty-year-old set was taking over. Some executives wouldn\u2019t even speak to a man or woman over the age of thirty, which was why Carrie had added three young, with-it, business majors to her staff. She called the Nintendo fanatics her babies.</p><p>It was imperative that Carrie stay in the moment, every moment. In her work, it didn\u2019t matter how many past achievements there had been. With all the new movers and shakers pushing their way into her circle of influence, Star Catcher had to be out there as much as possible. Hollywood was a fickle town. Those with the power were only interested in who was creating the buzz that day. If Carrie didn\u2019t keep pushing her staff to grab bigger and bigger accounts, she would find herself in the has-been category overnight.</p> <p>She owed her first Clio to her niece. She\u2019d begged Avery to step in when the temperamental teen actress she\u2019d hired threw a tantrum and demanded double her fee at the last moment. The silly girl thought she had Star Catcher by the balls because of the time crunch, and if Avery hadn\u2019t come to the set with Carrie that day, Carrie would have had to pay the little bitch. Avery had been mortified by what Carrie wanted her to do, but she had a good voice and a great body, and that was all that was required. The soap commercial was a resounding success, and Carrie, acting as Avery\u2019s agent, could have gotten her at least a year\u2019s work. Avery wasn\u2019t interested, though. As soon as spring break was over, she went back to finish high school and then went on to college.</p><p>Her niece did continue to work with Carrie every summer, but she hated leaving the office to meet with company executives. Carrie couldn\u2019t understand her reserve. Avery didn\u2019t seem to know\u2014or if she did know, she didn\u2019t particularly care\u2014that she was, as Tony often remarked, a knockout.</p><p>The problem with her niece was that she wasn\u2019t the least bit superficial. She was sweet and wholesome and had a firm grasp on what was important in life, and what wasn\u2019t. But what could Carrie expect? After all, she\u2019d raised her to sort out such things. Ironic, Carrie thought, that she herself should end up working in a field consumed with the superficial. What a hypocrite she had turned out to be. When would she learn to practice what she had constantly preached to Avery? Maybe after she made another couple of million?</p><p>Carrie had eventually become excited about the spa. Once she had made the decision to go, she called Avery and begged her niece to join her at Utopia for one week. She knew Avery was using part of her vacation to chaperone teenagers around D.C., and Carrie tried to guilt-trip her into giving her family equal time. Carrie was feeling confident that Avery would come for at least a few days, but knew she would have heart failure if she ever found out how much the stay would cost her aunt. Carrie didn\u2019t have any qualms about paying the fee for Avery. She would do anything for her, anything at all. Probably because Avery never asked her for anything. Carrie didn\u2019t know how her niece could live on the tiny salary she made, and though she offered her money every time she talked to her, Avery always declined. She was doing just fine, or so she said.</p><p>Avery kept her grounded, and in the back of her mind, she knew that her niece wouldn\u2019t let her get swept up in the moment at Utopia and sign up for every treatment available.</p> <p>Avery was going to pitch a fit when she found out that Carrie was thinking about booking an appointment for liposuction. She smiled as she thought about the argument her niece would give. Avery would shake her head when she saw her workout clothes too. Everything matched and had designer labels. Oh, yes, Avery would roll her eyes, no doubt, and then launch into her favorite lecture about getting fit and healthy.</p><p>God, how she missed the brat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling about, honey?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>Jarred back to the present, she realized both her husband and their marriage counselor were staring at her. She shrugged to cover her embarrassment. \u201cI was thinking about all the things I need to think about.\u201d That nonsense was the best she could come up with on the spur of the moment.</p><p>Dr. Prick looked pleased enough to roll around in the mud with his inner child. He nodded agreement and then stood, indicating the session was finally over.</p><p>Tony towered over her as he walked by her side to the waiting limo.</p> <p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to ride to the airport with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you remember to bring the reservation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulled away from her husband when the driver opened the back door for her. \u201cI still haven\u2019t heard from Avery, and I\u2019ve left three messages for her. I was hoping to talk to her before I left L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how busy she is at work. She probably just hasn\u2019t had time to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if there\u2019s an emergency while I\u2019m away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll call me or try to get you on your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of her working with children. It\u2019s too hard for her. She\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do it if she didn\u2019t love it,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop worrying. Avery\u2019s a big girl now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck my e-mails when you get home,\u201d she said then. \u201cMaybe she sent me a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll check and call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parole hearing is the sixteenth. I wonder if Avery was notified yet. I just got my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she knows. Why are you worrying about that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t miss,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI always go with Avery. Both of us speak before the board decides . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you aren\u2019t going to miss the hearing, and neither will Avery. It\u2019s a month away, for Pete\u2019s sake. You didn\u2019t miss the last one, and you won\u2019t miss this one. Now try to relax. I want you to enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, okay.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t sounded sincere. Frowning he said, \u201cYou\u2019re tense because you haven\u2019t had any time off in such a long time. It\u2019s just last-minute jitters.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, then tried to get into the car, but Tony grabbed her by the shoulders and kissed her. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you. From the moment we met. I want this marriage to work again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she answered, her tone dismissive.</p><p>The second the car pulled away from the curb, Carrie reached for her laptop. She had just turned it on when her cell phone rang. Assuming that it was Tony calling to once again nag her about their marriage, she answered curtly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d Avery said.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie. I thought you were Tony. Are you enjoying your vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m finishing up some last-minute details at the office. I had a big meeting with my new boss a couple of days ago, and I can\u2019t wait to tell you about the case I helped solve. How about sharing a late dinner in Aspen?\u201d</p><p>Carrie screeched. \u201cYou\u2019re going to join me? All my nagging and browbeating worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say yes, then you\u2019ll just get worse. Guilt worked this time, Carrie, but don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the kids you were going to drag around Washington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trip got rescheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So I win by default.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want you to come. I\u2019ll call Utopia right away. Have you got your flight yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at the computer screen right now. I can get a connecting flight in Denver, but I won\u2019t get in until late,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m excited. We\u2019re going to have such fun. Let me know your arrival time. As soon as you\u2019ve booked it, call me back. See you soon, Avery. Love you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s frame of mind vastly improved. She disconnected; then she called Utopia. After that, she went to work. She made notes until the limo pulled up to the airport. The lines through security moved at a snail\u2019s pace. Carrie, shifting the strap of her carry-on from one shoulder to the other, took a palm recorder from her purse and dictated instructions for her office staff. When the plane had taken off and she was comfortably seated in business class with a chilled glass of Chardonnay, she opened her laptop and went to work again.</p><p>Her thoughts kept going back to Avery. She could call her now, she decided, and find out what time her flight was. She reached for the phone hooked into the armrest, then changed her mind. Better to wait. If she used the plane phone, she\u2019d have to shout to be heard over the drum of the engines and the static, and then the other passengers around her would hear every word.</p><p>As soon as she got off the plane in Aspen, she moved out of the main traffic stream and sat down to dig through her carry-on for her cell phone. She\u2019d pulled everything out before she remembered she\u2019d stuck the phone in her purse. It wasn\u2019t like her to be so disorganized, she thought as she closed the carry-on. She happened to glance up and see the man holding a sign with her name on it. Another limo driver, she assumed, dressed in a dark navy business suit. He was quite distinguished looking and handsome, a younger version of Sean Connery. She quickly stood as she tucked the phone in the pocket of her blazer. Adjusting the collar of her blouse, she called out, \u201cI\u2019m Carolyn Salvetti.\u201d</p><p>His smile was dazzling. \u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Salvetti.\u201d He had a charming British accent. The name tag pinned to his lapel read \u201cMr. M. Edwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you with Utopia? . . . The spa?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have your reservation with you?\u201d</p><p>She reached for her travel bag. \u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need to see it, Mrs. Salvetti. I was to make certain you had the papers with you. Shall we go get your luggage?\u201d</p><p>She felt ridiculous, all but running in her Manolo Blahnik slingbacks, trying to keep pace with her long-legged escort. She slipped once, and if he hadn\u2019t grabbed her arm to steady her, she would have fallen on her face. She\u2019d meant to change her shoes before she got on the plane, but then she\u2019d gotten caught up in work and had forgotten about it.</p><p>They passed a phone bank that reminded her she still needed to know Avery\u2019s flight itinerary. Damn it, she\u2019d told her to call as soon as she\u2019d booked her flight. Carrie knew what had happened. Avery had gotten waylaid with work and then had to run to get everything done.</p><p>It was probably too late to catch her at work or at home. She was probably already at the airport or perhaps on the plane now. Still, Carrie wanted to try. Maybe Avery would check her phone messages when she got to Denver. Yes, she would call as soon as they reached the baggage claim area.</p><p>\u201cWill any other guests be going with us to the spa?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two other guests. They\u2019re waiting in the lounge. As soon as I pick up your luggage, we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anyone scheduled for pickup this afternoon or this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is my last trip. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy niece, Avery Delaney, is joining me at the spa.\u201d</p><p>Her comment so surprised him he stopped in the middle of the corridor. \u201cYou were expecting Miss Delaney to join you?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she said so? \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she\u2019s flying out of D.C. If you aren\u2019t scheduled to come back and pick her up, the spa must be sending another escort.\u201d</p><p>They continued walking. \u201cYes, that must be so,\u201d he said, sounding somewhat preoccupied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have Avery\u2019s flight information, but she might have called the spa to tell them so someone would pick her up. Could you call Utopia and find out? It would be lovely if we could wait for her. I do know she\u2019s coming through Denver,\u201d she thought to add.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to call the spa,\u201d he said. Glancing around, he nodded toward a line of empty chairs in front of a deserted gate. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat.\u201d</p><p>He was placing her carry-on at her feet when she asked, \u201cWhat does the \u2018M\u2019 stand for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name. \u2018Mr. M. Edwards.\u2019 What does the \u2018M\u2019 stand for?\u201d</p><p>He saw no reason to lie. \u201cMonk. The \u2018M\u2019 stands for Monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delightfully different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer that all clients call me Mr. Edwards.\u201d</p><p>What a stiff-neck, she thought. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me . . .\u201d He moved to the window as he pulled out his cell phone. Carrie grabbed her bag and went after him. She wanted to ask him to find out if there were any messages waiting for her at the spa.</p><p>His back was to her as she approached. She tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cMr. Edwards.\u201d</p><p>Startled, he whirled around. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said into the phone. Then, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you ask the receptionist if I have any messages?\u201d</p><p>He repeated the question, waited a moment, and then shook his head. Carrie felt foolish standing there and so she went back to the chair and sat down.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t on the phone long, and when he returned to her side, he picked up her bag and apologized for the delay.</p><p>\u201cThere is another escort assigned to Miss Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just wait?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you say something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His preoccupation was irritating. \u201cI asked if we could wait for my niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe other two clients have been waiting for you. I couldn\u2019t ask them to wait even longer. I hope you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe others will, no doubt, appreciate your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d she bluntly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asking, Mr. Edwards, who the other clients are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Trapp is from Cleveland, and Judge Collins\u2019s plane arrived from Miami.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie hadn\u2019t heard either name before and wondered if they were famous. She certainly hoped so. She could use as many influential connections as she could get. Maybe the judge was one of those celebrities on television. Wouldn\u2019t that be something?</p><p>They finally reached the baggage claim area and joined the hordes of passengers pushing their way to the front. \u201cHow long will the drive to the spa take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou won\u2019t be going directly to Utopia this evening, however,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was a problem with the water main, but it will be repaired by midnight. So that you won\u2019t be inconvenienced, the director has made arrangements for you and Mrs. Trapp and Judge Collins to spend the night at a private retreat.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was about to protest that, yes, it was an inconvenience. She would have to unpack and then pack again, but then Mr. Edwards said in a casual, off-handed way, \u201cI believe Mr. Cruise and a companion were the last guests.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cTom Cruise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Then tomorrow morning,\u201d he continued smoothly, \u201cyou\u2019ll be taken to the spa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill my niece be staying at the retreat too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain. If the problem has been solved by the time her flight arrives, then she\u2019ll be taken directly to the spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the retreat near Aspen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust outside, high up in the mountains in an area called Land Between the Lakes. It\u2019s quite beautiful there. Cold nights and warm, mostly sunny days this time of year. Great climate for hiking and camping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the outdoor type, but you certainly look like you are,\u201d she said, noticing the thickness in his shoulders and the bulging muscles straining the fabric of his obviously custom-made suit. What were they paying chauffeurs these days?</p><p>They must have stood side by side for a good ten minutes before the bags began to roll along the conveyor belt.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s mine,\u201d she said, pointing to an overstuffed, black Gucci bag moving along the conveyor. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she warned. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the only one?\u201d</p> <p>Surely he was joking. \u201cNo, there are three more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to be at the spa?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks. How long have you worked there?\u201d she asked, making idle chitchat to pass the time while she waited for the rest of the luggage. If they lost any of her bags, she was up a creek because her extra batteries for her laptop and her other cell phone were packed inside.</p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she remarked, not really interested. Where the hell were her other suitcases? She could feel herself getting anxious and took a deep breath. Relax, she told herself. You\u2019re on vacation.</p><p>She glanced around the luggage area, spotted a ladies\u2019 room and said, \u201cBefore we leave, I\u2019d like to splash some cold water on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could wait until we get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d she interrupted. She handed him her carry-on but kept her purse. \u201cDon\u2019t let go of that bag. It\u2019s got my laptop and my cell phone inside.\u201d</p><p>Then she hurried into the rest room. As she was washing her hands, she remembered she\u2019d put the other cell phone in her pocket and decided to call Avery right then.</p><p>Carrie went into the last stall so she would have some privacy, prayed the signal wouldn\u2019t get blocked, then hit speed dial. She called Avery\u2019s apartment first, listened to the answering machine, and told her to call her as soon as she got this message. Then, thinking she might have left for the airport, Carrie hit speed dial again. The number was a direct line to Avery\u2019s desk. Her voice mail picked up on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Avery, you were supposed to call me back with your flight information, but you forgot, didn\u2019t you? I hope to heaven you\u2019re on the plane now and will check your messages from Denver. I think I\u2019m obsessing because I don\u2019t want you to bail on me. I know how that job of yours sucks you in. If I find out you\u2019ve missed your plane because you got stuck in one of those horrid meetings, I\u2019ll pitch such a fit your ears will be ringing for a month. Honestly, Avery, when I think about all the things you could be doing and all the money you could be making, and here you are, stuck in that windowless dungeon analyzing God only knows what. It\u2019s a waste of your talents. Surely you realize that. I wish you\u2019d let me help you change careers.\u201d</p><p>Carrie realized what she was doing and laughed. \u201cListen to me going on and on. You\u2019ve heard it all before, haven\u2019t you? Anyway, I called to tell you I\u2019m in Aspen now. I wanted to wait until you landed so we could ride to the spa together, but there are other guests here, and it would be too much of an inconvenience to make them sit and wait. I won\u2019t be going to the spa tonight. They had some kind of plumbing problem, which my escort tells me should be fixed by the time you get there. I\u2019ll be sound asleep by then. The other two women and I will be spending a luxurious night at a posh mountain retreat. I\u2019ve already forgotten the other women\u2019s names, but one of them is a judge. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s famous. Then tomorrow,\u201d she continued, \u201cI\u2019ll check in at Utopia and find you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie felt another burst of excitement. \u201cThe retreat is called The Land Between the Lakes. How quaint is that? Tom Cruise was their last guest, so you know it has to be incredibly beautiful. I mean, he\u2019s on top of the A list, and they wouldn\u2019t put him in anything shabby. I better hang up now before my escort comes looking for me in the ladies\u2019 room. I can\u2019t wait to see you. We\u2019re going to have such fun. Oops, I hear my escort calling my name. The spa sent a real hunk to carry my luggage. He\u2019s kind of stiff and formal, and he has the faintest British accent. And, oh, is he sexy. His name\u2019s Monk Edwards, but trust me, he doesn\u2019t look like any monk I\u2019ve ever seen. Maybe they\u2019ll send another hunk to pick you up. Bye, brat. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>THE TRAIL LED TO UTOPIA. JOHN PAUL RENARD HAD BEEN tracking the professional killer for over a year now, but he hadn\u2019t had much success. The last known hit had taken place on the Riviera, an execution of a wanted man named John Russell, but since then, the killer calling himself Monk seemed to have vanished off the face of the earth. There had been a hint of his work in Paris and in Cannes, but nothing substantial enough to be considered a real lead.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>When John Paul had been in the Marines and then, for a short time, had worked for the Agency, he\u2019d learned patience. He figured that eventually the killer would return to the United States. It had been a hunch, nothing more, but lo and behold, he\u2019d been right. Just three weeks ago, Monk had finally resurfaced. He\u2019d actually messed up too. He\u2019d used one of his old credit cards. It was such a sloppy thing to do and so out of character for a man who, up until now, had been pretty damned flawless in his executions. John Paul wondered if Monk had thrown the card away and someone else had found it and used it.</p><p>It was worth checking out. A charge had been made at a spa in Colorado called Utopia for a woman named Carolyn Salvetti. John Paul ran a credit check on her and discovered that she had more than enough money tucked away in her IRAs and her pension plans to buy a couple of spas. Was there a connection to Monk here? Had she hired him to kill someone? Or was she his next victim?</p><p>John Paul also ran her name through the government database. He used his old code to get access, knowing full well that as soon as he logged on, the men who had run him would immediately know it and would leap to the incorrect assumption that he was ready to come back. For that reason he didn\u2019t stay on the computer long. In less than two minutes he found out what he needed to know. Salvetti was clean as a whistle. No warrants outstanding, no parking tickets, no illegal activities of any kind. Her husband was also clean. Carolyn Salvetti was president of a company called Star Catcher. Tony Salvetti was vice president.</p><p>The database hadn\u2019t given him any answers. If Carolyn Salvetti was Monk\u2019s next target, then who had hired him? Who wanted the woman dead?</p><p>John Paul was determined to find out. Since his brother, Remy, lived in Colorado Springs, he decided to drive there to see him. Known in his hometown, Bowen, Louisiana, as a surly recluse, John Paul shocked his family and few friends when he purchased an old Ford SUV. He made a few alterations, souped up the engine, packed it with a couple of kitchen chairs he\u2019d made for Remy, and headed out.</p><p>He spent two days with his brother, but on June sixteenth, the day Salvetti was scheduled to arrive at the spa, John Paul was there waiting for her. His hope was that Monk was right behind her, and he could nail the bastard.</p><p>Carolyn Salvetti didn\u2019t show. The desk clerk, an uptight, exceedingly nervous young man with weird, oversized, capped teeth, told John Paul that Mrs. Salvetti had canceled her reservation at the last minute. \u201cBut it\u2019s noted right here, under her old reservation, that her niece, Avery Delaney, will be staying at the spa. Miss Delaney will only be here one week,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cIs that at all helpful?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering the question, he asked to speak to the manager. The clerk tripped when he hastily pivoted, then went running to fetch his employer.</p><p>Tim Cannon showed up a minute later, with the clerk half hiding behind his back. Since John Paul had left the Agency, he didn\u2019t have any credentials to threaten the tight-lipped, sweaty little man, and so he used intimidation. As usual, it worked like a charm. For some reason he couldn\u2019t quite understand, people tended to be afraid of him. His sister, Michelle, told him it was because of his size and the fact that he rarely smiled. Though he thought it was peculiar that strangers backed away from him, he used their fear to his advantage. Cannon, operating under the false assumption that John Paul worked for the government\u2014an assumption John Paul had hinted at but hadn\u2019t actually stated\u2014and obviously embarrassed to admit that he was afraid of John Paul, didn\u2019t call security or ask to see identification. The fact was, the manager couldn\u2019t have been more helpful. He invited him into his office, offered him the use of his desk and phone, and then, stammering about an emergency errand he simply had to complete, he left his office and pulled the door closed behind him.</p><p>The second he was alone, John Paul turned on Cannon\u2019s computer, found the site, and typed in his access code. How he hated the technology, but it was the only way he could get the information he needed. He wanted to see if an alert had been posted regarding Monk and was pleasantly surprised that there hadn\u2019t been. The spa wasn\u2019t swarming with agents yet\u2014in John Paul\u2019s estimation, they were as easy to spot as nuns in black habits\u2014which could only mean that the Bureau didn\u2019t know that Monk was back in the States. John Paul wasn\u2019t inclined to tell them. The FBI would only screw it up. Monk would spot the agents, get spooked, and vanish into thin air again.</p><p>John Paul wasn\u2019t about to let that happen. He was one step in front of the Bureau, and that was all he needed. He had a personal reason for going after the killer, and he wasn\u2019t going to let anyone get in his way.</p><p>A little over a year ago, Monk had tried to kill John Paul\u2019s sister, Michelle, and had it not been for her husband and a friend, he would have succeeded. Monk got away, which, in John Paul\u2019s estimation, was unforgivable. He vowed he wouldn\u2019t rest until he had hunted the bastard down and sent him to Hell where he belonged.</p><p>Once he started doing the research, John Paul\u2019s need for vengeance intensified. One case in particular had really shaken him up. A father had hired Monk to kill his teenage daughter so that he could collect the insurance money and pay his gambling debts. The FBI knew Monk had murdered the girl because the killer always left behind a rose, and though the father had removed the evidence, a thorn was found in the girl\u2019s bedspread. There wasn\u2019t any other family to mourn or seek justice for the young girl. John Paul knew there were other victims the FBI didn\u2019t even know about yet. How many more innocents would die before the killer was stopped?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>MONK KEPT THE THREE WOMEN ENTERTAINED WHILE HE drove them to their destination. Carrie thought he was charming and oh so terribly correct. He was her idea of the perfect English butler.</p><p>He had transferred their luggage into the back of a brand-new, fully equipped Land Rover, explaining that the SUV was suited for the mountain roads, and for that reason he hadn\u2019t driven one of the spa\u2019s limos. Anne Trapp sat in the front, and Carolyn sat next to Judge Sara Collins in the back. The seats were plush beige leather and very comfortable.</p><p>All of them were excited and nervous, but there was little conversation among them. Monk told them a brief history of the spa and then regaled them with several fascinating stories about some of the famous people who had stayed at the mountain house he was taking them to.</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t sure how long they had been driving. She hadn\u2019t checked the time when they\u2019d left the airport, but it seemed that at least an hour had passed, maybe even more. Monk\u2019s stories so intrigued her she didn\u2019t mind the long drive or the slight case of car sickness. While Sara ooh\u2019d and ah\u2019d over the scenery as they climbed higher and higher up the mountain and Anne sat in stony silence, Carrie questioned Monk about the previous guests he\u2019d served. She wasn\u2019t particularly interested in hearing about politicians. She wanted to hear all about the peculiarities of the movie stars.</p><p>\u201cRussell Crowe was a guest? What was he like?\u201d</p><p>Monk replied with an amusing tidbit about the Australian actor. \u201cHe was quite fond of the house,\u201d he added, \u201cand wanted to purchase it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must really be nice,\u201d Sara remarked.</p><p>Monk assured them that the house had all the amenities and that he would be acting as their butler until they checked into Utopia.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope there won\u2019t be any more screwups,\u201d Anne said irritably. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas there a screwup?\u201d Sara asked her.</p><p>\u201cThere certainly was,\u201d Anne said. She turned in her seat so she could look at Sara while she explained. \u201cNo one from the spa was waiting for me at my gate to help me with my carry-on, and if I hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Edwards holding up the sign at your gate as I was walking toward the baggage claim area, I would have been left to fend for myself. I was quite weary,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the thought of carrying my luggage to a taxi stand was more than I could bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were skycaps around who could have assisted you,\u201d Carrie told her.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the point,\u201d Anne snapped. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been inconvenienced.\u201d</p> <p>What a bitch, Carrie thought. The look on Anne\u2019s face was almost comical. She was pouting like an eight-year-old.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, Mrs. Trapp, your every need will be taken care of by an excellent staff, and I once again apologize for the inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be servants at the retreat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019ll be arriving from the spa shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to have one of them assigned to me,\u201d Anne demanded. \u201cWill you see to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, and she sounded mollified.</p><p>Sara and Carrie exchanged a look that spoke volumes. Then Anne said, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to know we won\u2019t be alone tonight . . . in the event something should happen . . . or break. You just never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is getting a new alarm system. The wires haven\u2019t been properly hidden yet, but it\u2019s workable,\u201d he promised. \u201cOnce it\u2019s turned on, you won\u2019t be able to open your windows or outside doors, of course, but it does get quite chilly up here at night, so I can\u2019t imagine you would want to keep any windows open.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie studied her traveling companions. They both looked vaguely familiar to her, but she couldn\u2019t pinpoint where they might have met.</p><p>She stared at the back of Anne\u2019s head and then finally tapped her on her shoulder and asked. The blond woman with deep-set brown eyes half turned in her seat and smiled slightly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you ever been to Cleveland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carrie answered.</p><p>Up close, she noticed how sallow the woman\u2019s complexion was. She didn\u2019t think Anne was at all well. Her eyes were dull and lifeless, and her skin was almost waxy, but that could have been due to the heavy makeup she was wearing. Perhaps Anne had paid her fee for some kind of miracle cure for her waiflike, nearly anorexic body. Carrie judged her to be around her own age, give or take a few.</p><p>Judge Sara Collins had just the opposite problem. She could have stood to loose a good sixty or seventy pounds. Perhaps she was going to have liposuction or stomach staples. She looked old, around seventy or so, and her face definitely showed her age. Maybe she was there to have a face-lift. Carrie was dying to ask but didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>Where could she have recognized her from? Maybe she\u2019d seen her on television. Court shows were the rave now. Did Sara have her own program like Judge Judy?</p><p>She would have asked, but their chauffeur had turned into a tour guide and was keeping up a steady monologue about Colorado. One story led to another and another, but they were interesting tidbits, and Carrie thought it would be rude to interrupt. Still, he wasn\u2019t giving them time to get to know each other. She decided she\u2019d ask Sara if she was a celebrity when they were settled in the house.</p> <p>Then she began to wonder what the other women thought about her. She knew she looked older than her actual age. An old hag, she thought. Yes, that\u2019s what they probably thought.</p><p>They\u2019d been on private roads now for quite awhile, and it was getting steeper. Winding around and around was making Carrie more carsick. Great, she thought. I\u2019m going to throw up on our proper English butler. Wouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful way to impress the other houseguests?</p><p>\u201cDoes the company own all this land?\u201d Sara asked Monk.</p><p>\u201cYes, madam,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cIs the house much farther?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just around the next bend.\u201d</p><p>They were in the middle of nowhere. A wilderness, Carrie thought, and she began to feel uneasy . . . nervous. She suddenly realized she hadn\u2019t seen a house or even a cabin in quite a long time. Then it occurred to her that an alarm system wouldn\u2019t do any of them any good. If the alarm went off, who would hear it? Was it tied into the nearest police station, and if so, where in God\u2019s name was that? An hour away? Two hours? Or would the alarm sound at the spa?</p><p>Yes, that was surely how it worked. And that meant that the spa was close by. Having figured it out, Carrie leaned back in the leather seat and tried to relax.</p><p>The house suddenly came into view. It was incredible. Massive gables of natural cedar rose into the sky, and two-story panes of glass reflected the mountain peaks behind them, as if the magnificent structure were placed there with no other purpose than to pay tribute to the grandeur that surrounded it. A circle drive curved toward the wide porch that stretched across the front of the house. Waist-high stone walls were built as protective barriers from the sheer drop at the back.</p><p>Sara gasped. \u201cLook at that wonderful porch and those lovely rocking chairs. I simply must try one of them out.\u201d</p><p>Monk parked the Land Rover in the center of the stone circle drive and rushed to open the doors for his passengers.</p><p>\u201cIf you stand on the porch and look in the window, you can see through the house to the vista beyond,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, it is lovely,\u201d Anne said. \u201cIt looks brand-new,\u201d she added as she walked to the wall on the side of the drive and looked down at the trees below.</p><p>\u201cIt was built four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in heaven\u2019s name did they get all the glass up these mountains?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cVery carefully, I would imagine,\u201d Carrie replied.</p><p>\u201cI believe you ladies will be very comfortable here,\u201d Monk said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we will be.\u201d Sara was so enthusiastic that Carrie wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if she\u2019d started clapping her hands.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t Sara used to such ambience? She was a judge, for heaven\u2019s sake. Surely she had money. And obviously so did Anne. Neither one of them would have been able to afford the spa if they weren\u2019t well-off.</p><p>\u201cIf you ladies would like to go inside, there\u2019s champagne chilling for you. I\u2019ll bring the luggage in.\u201d</p><p>Carrie opened the door and led the way inside. She noticed the thin wires up against the house and assumed they were part of the alarm system.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t trip over the wires.\u201d</p><p>The floor plan was open, very spacious. To the left of the huge marble entry was a magnificent spiral staircase that reached up three stories. Light flooded the room, and when they raised their eyes higher, they could see the golden clouds through a long rectangular skylight.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the staircase beautiful?\u201d Sara said. \u201cThe wood . . . the steps, they\u2019re twice the length and depth of any I\u2019ve ever seen. It must have cost a fortune to build it,\u201d she added. \u201cLook at the railing. The craftsmanship is exceptional.\u201d</p><p>Carrie agreed. Then Anne called to them. \u201cThe mountains look like they\u2019re on fire with the sunset. Come see.\u201d Even Anne, a difficult woman to please, couldn\u2019t contain her enthusiasm.</p><p>Carrie stood in the foyer taking in the view. Colorful oriental rugs\u2014high-quality rugs\u2014were scattered across the living room\u2019s pale brown, marble floor. In harmony with the mountains, the furnishings were done in soft browns and beiges. The stone fireplace was at least sixteen feet high and similar, she thought, to the fireplace in the villain\u2019s house she\u2019d admired when she\u2019d watched one of her favorite movies, North by Northwest. The room was square like the living room in the movie too. No, this one was much better, the furniture updated and more exquisite.</p><p>Directly ahead, the sun was setting, and the burst from the fiery ball filled the room with a soft orange hue.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in heaven,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cIf you go to the top of that spiral staircase, you will be in heaven,\u201d Carrie joked.</p><p>Anne spotted the silver bucket with a bottle of champagne on the sideboard. There was a beautiful crystal vase with three long-stemmed, bloodred roses next to it. The petals were just beginning to open. \u201cShall we have a glass of champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Sara answered.</p><p>The three women stood in front of the window overlooking the panorama as Anne struggled to get the bottle uncorked. She laughed nervously when the cork popped and the liquid bubbled over, then carefully filled each Waterford crystal flute.</p><p>\u201cWe should have a toast,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Sara agreed.</p><p>She and Anne lifted their glasses and waited for Carrie to do the honors.</p><p>\u201cTo us,\u201d she said. \u201cMay all our dreams come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>They sank down onto the plush, down-filled sofas and sipped their champagne, making idle chitchat, carefully avoiding any personal topics, while Monk carried their luggage upstairs to their suites. Carrie was still feeling a little nauseous, so she didn\u2019t drink more than one tiny sip.</p><p>Monk joined them ten minutes later with a tray of canap\u00e9s. As he was placing the linen napkins next to the tray on the coffee table, Carrie heard a door close. She looked toward the hallway leading from the dining room and saw a woman wearing a black dress walk into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMaids have arrived,\u201d she remarked to Sara.</p><p>\u201cDo have one of these cucumber canap\u00e9s,\u201d Anne suggested. She\u2019d just finished eating the bite-size treat. \u201cThey\u2019re quite tasty.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t want to tell either woman she wasn\u2019t feeling well, and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to admit she\u2019d gotten carsick.</p><p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d she said. She popped the little sandwich into her mouth, barely chewing it before swallowing it down. \u201cIt is good,\u201d she said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make herself eat another and became even more queasy watching Anne eat two salmon puffs as well as the cucumber sandwiches, and Sara devour twice as many.</p><p>Within minutes they were all yawning. Monk noticed. \u201cIf you ladies will follow me, I\u2019ll show you to your rooms,\u201d he said as he leaned down to turn on one of the table lamps. Now that the sun was going down, the room was filled with shadows.</p><p>\u201cI am so sleepy,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cIt must be the mountain air,\u201d Sara suggested. \u201cI\u2019m feeling lethargic myself.\u201d</p><p>They followed Monk to the spiral staircase. Carrie looked up and remarked, \u201cWho would have thought stairs could be a work of art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate stairs,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThe next house I build will be a sprawling ranch.\u201d</p><p>Sara and Carrie ignored her comment. Monk drew their attention when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve unpacked your overnight bags. Mrs. Trapp, you and Judge Collins will be in suites on the second level on opposite ends of the floor. Mrs. Salvetti, you\u2019re one floor up. I hope you\u2019ll all find the accommodations satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>Anne followed Monk, then came Carrie, and Sara, gripping the banister for support, was the last in line.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been in this house before,\u201d Sara said. \u201cYet I\u2019ve never seen a spiral staircase like this, so I don\u2019t know why I feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the fireplace,\u201d Carrie said. She paused on a step to look down into the living room once again. \u201cDid you ever see the movie North by Northwest? It starred Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, and in the cl**ax, they had to climb out on the presidents\u2019 faces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember. The stone fireplace is very like the one in the movie. That must be why it seems so familiar to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw the movie,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>Carrie was floored. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. It was one of Hitchcock\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>Anne shrugged. \u201cI was busy running my business,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to go to movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a classic. It\u2019s been on television at least a hundred times,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I never watch television.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t know how to relate to the woman. Anne sounded as though she were boasting about the fact that she didn\u2019t watch television. Carrie\u2019s life revolved around networks and sponsors. She looked up at Anne now as if she were an alien. Not watch television or go to the movies? Amazing. No wonder the woman was so dull.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel at all guilty about her snap judgment. Anne, unknowingly, had just insulted everything that Carrie worked for or believed in.</p><p>Monk showed Sara into her suite first.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to call it a night,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Carrie called as she followed Monk down the long hallway.</p><p>He opened Anne\u2019s door for her, and then turned to Carrie. \u201cYour suite is directly above Judge Collins\u2019s,\u201d he said. He led her up the staircase to the next level.</p><p>\u201cSo there are four full suites?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>They reached her door, and Monk stepped back to let her go inside. The large bedroom with an adjoining sitting room was a soothing amber color. Two overstuffed chairs flanked a fireplace, and the four-poster bed made of light, burled pine was covered with a thick down comforter.</p><p>She yawned loudly. Monk or one of the maids had laid out her robe and gown on the bed. She spotted her carry-on on the luggage rack. It was open and empty, and she was going to ask where her laptop was, but then a wave of nausea and dizziness struck, and she had to sit down. She took several deep breaths as she held on to the bedpost.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, Mrs. Salvetti?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be difficult or complain the way Anne did, and so she simply said that she was weary from the long day. \u201cI\u2019m usually a night owl, and I don\u2019t go to bed until two or three in the morning, but tonight I can barely keep my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Monk\u2019s expression was sympathetic. \u201cIt takes awhile to get used to the mountain air, and the staff from the spa did suggest that all of you have an early night. Tomorrow promises to be quite busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the last to retire,\u201d he said as he walked to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll set the alarm then. Please remember not to open any windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if the alarm goes off? Who will hear it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alarm is electronically connected to the spa. I thought I had mentioned that before. Should we need it, help will arrive in less than three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spa\u2019s that close?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the trees, you\u2019d be able to see the domes from your window. Would you like me to close the drapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I prefer them open.\u201d She turned away, gripping the bedpost now as the bile came rushing up into her throat. She was going to ask him where the servant quarters were located, but her throat burned too much to get the question out.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said. \u201cClose the door behind you, please.\u201d</p><p>The second she heard the door click shut, she bolted from the bed and ran into the bathroom, one hand covering her mouth. She barely got the lid up in time before she threw up the canap\u00e9 she\u2019d eaten. The damn car sickness. She\u2019d had the problem since she was a child. She should have spoken up and explained she couldn\u2019t sit in the backseat. Worried what the others would think of her, she hadn\u2019t said a word.</p><p>What the hell was the matter with her? What did she care what strangers thought about her? She would probably never see them again after breakfast.</p> <p>Her stomach heaved at the thought of food. She hadn\u2019t felt this ill in years, not since that horrid case of food poisoning. Avery was fourteen at the time, and she\u2019d stayed home from school to help take care of Carrie. Tony had been a real gem back then too. She remembered how he\u2019d held her when the chills got so bad.</p><p>Carrie felt too weak to take a shower. She brushed her teeth, washed her face, and put on her nightgown. She stumbled back into the bedroom, heard the clinking of glasses, and assumed that Monk was cleaning up. Then she heard a woman\u2019s laughter. Was the maid flirting with him? Might as well, she thought. There wasn\u2019t anything else for them to do, since she and Anne and Sara were already going to bed. My heavens, it wasn\u2019t even nine o\u2019clock yet, and she was so exhausted, she could barely focus.</p><p>The room kept spinning. God, she felt awful. She fell into bed, struggled to get the covers up, and tried resting on her side. The nausea was still coming in waves. She slowly, carefully rolled onto her back. That was better, much better. She closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d slept, but it was dark in the room when she heard someone faintly calling out to her. She couldn\u2019t respond. Then she heard a clicking sound over and over. No, the noise was snapping, like fingers coming together, or clinking, like knives being sharpened. Carrie couldn\u2019t understand why the noise wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Someone nudged her shoulder, calling her name again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t summon the strength to open her eyes. \u201cYes?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The noise made it difficult for her to concentrate. And, oh, she was so sleepy. She tried but couldn\u2019t even raise her hand to cover her eyes when a light went on.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said, her voice a croak.</p><p>\u201cI heard your toast, Carrie. Do you remember what you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay all your dreams come true. But what about your nightmares? Those come true too.\u201d</p><p>The words weren\u2019t making any sense. \u201cWhat? Nightmares? No . . . no nightmares.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>The sound was getting louder. \u201cCome on. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>The voice floating above her became more demanding, more menacing. Carrie was finally able to open her eyes a little. She saw the scissors opening and closing in front of her face. They were shiny. That was the snapping noise, she realized. But why were there scissors?</p><p>And then the noise stopped, and the scissors vanished. A face appeared just inches above her own, and that smile, that hideous, gloating smile that was horrifically familiar.</p><p>She tried to scream. \u201cNo . . . no . . . no . . . oh, my God, help me . . . no . . . Jilly.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>AVERY LOST TRACK OF THE TIME. SHE WAS FRANTIC TO GET as much work done as possible before she had to leave for the airport. Her desk had been clear when she\u2019d left the night before. She\u2019d gotten to the office at six-thirty that morning just so everything would be caught up.</p><p>She was so bleary-eyed now she could barely focus on her computer screen. And doing a slow burn. Someone, she didn\u2019t know who the culprit was, had dumped twenty-two files on her desk, and she was expected to transfer all the information into the database. She also had at least sixty e-mails to read and answer, and she hadn\u2019t remembered to check her private voice mail in over twenty-four hours.</p><p>Her cubicle still looked like a cyclone had hit. The files seemed to be multiplying, and how was that possible?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be on a plane?\u201d Margo asked. She was juggling a stack of files, her empty water bottle, and a doughnut box.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a little time left,\u201d Avery answered as she typed a reply to one of her e-mails.</p><p>Lou stood and stretched his arms. \u201cMargo, are there any Krispy Kremes left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d she answered. \u201cAvery didn\u2019t eat hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>Lou grabbed the box out of Margo\u2019s arms and opened it. \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s flying,\u201d Margo said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it all figured out down to the minute. If I leave at four-fifteen on the dot, I\u2019ll have time to drive home, change clothes, and pick up my luggage, then take the interstate to the airport, park in long-term, and make it to the gate in plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>Margo took her purse from her drawer and came back around the corner. \u201cHey, Avery, did you have time to call Mrs. Speigel\u2019s caretaker and tell her to do a better job of hiding those car keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to look up her phone number and call her? She\u2019s got to do something to protect the public from that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you would call,\u201d Avery said. \u201cBut don\u2019t be bossy, Margo. Mrs. Speigel\u2019s a sweetheart. She knows she shouldn\u2019t be driving, but sometimes she gets confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, she almost killed you.\u201d Margo sighed then. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t be bossy.\u201d</p><p>Mel joined the conversation. \u201cEveryone in D.C. will be on the interstate. There\u2019s bound to be a pileup. You ought to take the Jefferson Davis, then cut over to ninety-five. It\u2019ll save you a good twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Margo disagreed. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving in rush hour. The interstate is much faster.\u201d</p><p>Avery was only half listening. Her fingers were flying over the keyboard as she replied to interoffice inquiries. \u201cI feel terrible leaving you guys with my mess,\u201d she said to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all split the work,\u201d Margo said. \u201cLou, you\u2019ve got some powdered sugar on your belt.\u201d</p><p>She reached over Avery\u2019s head, grabbed a tissue from the box on the shelf, and handed it to Lou. Then she turned back to Avery. \u201cI\u2019m planning to dump all my work on all of you when I go to San Diego next month for my cousin\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better type up that route you should take to the airport,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019ll hand you the printout as you\u2019re leaving the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m out of here by four-fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you are,\u201d Mel promised. \u201cShall we synchronize our watches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nerdy thing to do,\u201d Margo told him. \u201cNow, Brad Pitt would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her phone rang, interrupting her thought. While she hurried to her cubicle, Lou picked up where she\u2019d left off. \u201cFace it, you guys. We are nerds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cI mean, think about it. Bill Gates is a nerd, and he\u2019s doing all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but we aren\u2019t making his billions, now are we? And we\u2019re thought of as nerds by everyone in the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mel argued. \u201cWe\u2019re all important members of the team.\u201d</p><p>Margo interrupted. \u201cAgent Andrews is on his way down here,\u201d she called out. \u201cDouglas\u2019s secretary heard him ask where the pen was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably coming down to thank you, Avery, for letting him have the glory,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s late,\u201d Margo said. \u201cHe should have thanked her the other day, after the press conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrews is going to cut into your time,\u201d Mel said. \u201cMaybe I better go ahead and print out that alternate route. You can decide which way to go once you\u2019re in the car. Just be sure to turn the radio on and listen to the traffic updates.\u201d</p><p>Avery tried not to smile. Mel did tend to obsess over the tiniest details. \u201cThanks, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Andrews talk for what? Four? Five minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you interrupt,\u201d Mel told Lou. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p><p>Andrews ruined the schedule. Although Avery had never met the agent, she had him all figured out in less than a minute. He thought he was a charmer. It was an incorrect assumption on his part. He got the \u201cthank you\u2019s\u201d over with quickly but then perched on the edge of her desk and invited her to have dinner with him. His stare wasn\u2019t quite a leer, but it was damned close. Lou and Mel immediately tried to get rid of him.</p><p>\u201cAvery\u2019s leaving on vacation,\u201d Mel said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>When Andrews didn\u2019t take the hint, Lou decided to be more blunt. \u201cYou better leave. She\u2019s on a tight schedule, and you\u2019re messing it up.\u201d</p><p>Andrews\u2019s response was to fold his arms and widen his goofy smile.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take investigative skill to know what was happening. Andrews was suffering from LAFS, \u201clust at first sight,\u201d but that didn\u2019t make him unusual. Most of the men who got close to Avery became temporarily afflicted by the debilitating condition. Mel theorized that the syndrome was brought on by her big, baby blue eyes. When she looked at a man and gave him her full attention, his brain simply shut down. Lou didn\u2019t agree with Mel\u2019s assessment. Blue eyes might have had a little to do with catching a guy\u2019s interest, but it was Avery\u2019s killer body and long, silky blond hair that turned him into a blithering idiot.</p><p>Andrews was blithering now. It was sad, really, to watch a skilled professional sink so quickly into the quagmire.</p><p>Mel, the more protective of Avery, hoped Andrews would hurry up and compliment her. They all did, sooner or later, and then Avery would send him on his way. Mel checked the time as he silently willed Andrews to tell Avery how pretty she was. If he didn\u2019t hit on her soon, Avery would miss her plane.</p><p>Come on, come on, Mel silently urged. Go for it. Tell her what a knockout she is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to ask you something,\u201d Andrews said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>\u201cHow come such a beautiful woman like you is stuck down here in the basement?\u201d The agent all but crooned the question like a country singer. \u201cWith your looks\u2014\u201d It was as far as he got. Poor guy never knew what hit him.</p><p>Avery\u2019s voice sizzled as she curtly responded, \u201cAgent Andrews, I had nothing to do with the way I look. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have work to do, and I assume you do too. Get off my desk and go away.\u201d</p><p>That having been said, she swiveled in her chair and began typing again. Andrews had that what\u2019d-I-say? look of bewilderment on his face as he stood and slowly walked away, blushing like a girl.</p><p>Mel didn\u2019t start laughing until he was out of earshot. \u201cSo I guess you won\u2019t be going to dinner with Andrews when you get back from vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to work here.\u201d</p><p>Lou put his hand out, and Mel, frowning as he pulled his wallet from his back pocket, extracted a dollar bill and handed it to his friend. The two men had a standing bet as to the nature of the compliments given Avery. Since Andrews hadn\u2019t said anything about her legs, Lou won the dollar. Her legs were pretty amazing, and most men noticed them right away, but Andrews apparently wasn\u2019t a leg man.</p><p>\u201cHow come that never happens to me?\u201d Margo asked. \u201cI\u2019m cute, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure you are,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to get married one day and have a family,\u201d she continued as though Lou hadn\u2019t answered. \u201cWhereas Avery has made it perfectly clear on countless occasions that she\u2019s never going to get married. It\u2019s just not fair. I\u2019d be perfect for Andrews. I really would. But he never even glanced my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019d be perfect for him?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a hottie,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd no one appreciates a full-fledged hottie more than I. We\u2019d be perfect for each other,\u201d she said over her shoulder as she went back to her workstation.</p><p>Mel shoved his wallet back into his pocket and went to work. At four-fifteen, he stood up and called, \u201cIt\u2019s time to leave, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me another ten minutes . . .\u201d</p><p>The ten turned into forty-five, and she didn\u2019t get out of the office until after five. Fortunately, her knee was much better today, and she was able to run. Nevertheless, she still missed her flight. There was an accident on the interstate, blocking two lanes, and by the time she finally arrived at the airport and sprinted to the terminal, the plane was in the air.</p><p>Avery toyed with the idea of going back home and crashing in her own bed. She hadn\u2019t averaged more than four hours\u2019 sleep a night in over a week, and she was exhausted. She didn\u2019t dare give in to the urge, though. Carrie would kill her if she were a full day late.</p><p>Utopia wasn\u2019t her idea of a great vacation. She was going only to please her aunt. When she went someplace new, she wanted to see the sights, soak in the local color. She didn\u2019t relish the idea of being stuck in a spa for six days, but Avery had given her word, so she couldn\u2019t back out.</p><p>The next flight through Denver into Aspen was full, and she was forced to take a convoluted route from D.C. She ended up in Grand Junction, Colorado. She would have to wait until morning to board yet another flight. After she collected her luggage and checked into the hotel adjacent to the airport, she called Carrie on her cell phone. She got her voice mail on the first ring. She assumed her aunt was recharging her phone and had already gone to bed\u2014it was midnight Aspen time. She left a message that she would arrive at the spa around noon tomorrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she called the spa to let them know she was delayed. Since she\u2019d left a message on Carrie\u2019s cell phone, she didn\u2019t ask the receptionist to connect her to her aunt\u2019s suite.</p><p>That night Avery slept like the dead. The following morning, while she ate her continental breakfast of toast, juice, and milk, she called her office voice mail. There were over twenty messages in her mailbox, but fortunately none of them was urgent. She made notes as she listened and then erased each one. Carrie\u2019s message made her smile. She sounded so excited about staying in a mountain house where Tom Cruise had allegedly been a guest. How like her aunt to get stars in her eyes over such a silly little thing. Avery erased that message and continued on until she was finally finished.</p><p>She was downstairs and checking out by eight-fifteen. While the receptionist printed her bill, Avery looked over a map of Colorado. Aspen wasn\u2019t all that far from Grand Junction, just two and a half hours away by car. Then she heard an elderly couple talking about the lovely sights in the area, and on the spur of the moment, she decided to rent a car and drive to the spa. She took the shuttle back to the airport, rented a sedan, and headed out.</p><p>Avery was wearing her weekend uniform, a pair of old jeans, a plain white T-shirt, and a pair of scuffed tennis shoes. Carrie wouldn\u2019t approve of the outfit, but Avery opted for comfort over fashion.</p> <p>Once she was on I-70 heading east toward Aspen, she felt as if she was really on vacation. It was a beautiful, crisp, summer morning. The sun was shining, and the sky was such a brilliant shade of blue it looked almost artificial. She rolled the window down and took a deep breath. It was wonderful. The air was so clean and light, as though she were breathing pure oxygen. It was a refreshing change after the smog of the big, overcrowded city.</p><p>She stopped at a McDonald\u2019s for a bottle of water and a Diet Coke. After she paid for her order, she sat down in one of the booths to look over the map. There might be an interesting side trip she could take on her way to the spa, maybe see something historical. She knew that once she checked in, Carrie wouldn\u2019t let her leave, and she did want to see a little of Colorado. What she\u2019d already seen on her drive was beautiful, but she felt she was only glimpsing a tip of what the state had to offer. Besides, Carrie was going to be irritated anyway because Avery was late. What difference did it make if she was another hour or two behind schedule?</p><p>She spread the map on the table in front of her and, first of all, tried to find the spot where Carrie had told her she\u2019d spent the night. What was it? Land of the Lakes? No, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cAre you lost, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The deep baritone voice jarred her. Annoyed her too. She simply wasn\u2019t in the mood to get hit on. Suppressing a sigh, she frowned as she looked up, ready to tell whoever was trying to bother her to go away, but then she saw the gentleman standing before her and she smiled. He was at least eighty years old. Immaculately dressed in a freshly pressed denim shirt with a turquoise bolo tie, and Levi\u2019s tucked into tan cowboy boots with scrollwork around the tops, he held a tan Stetson in one hand and a cup of steaming coffee in the other. His face was full of character, from his sparkling golden brown eyes and his leathered complexion to the handlebar mustache that was perfectly waxed and groomed. Both his mustache and his hair were pure white.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you were lost,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI saw you looking over that map, and I figured I might be able to help you get where you\u2019re wanting to go since I know just about every little nook and cranny in Colorado. I\u2019ve lived here all my eighty-four years, come September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just looking over places of interest,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, I could use your help. Would you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted,\u201d he said. He put his coffee down, then scooted into the booth across from her and carefully placed his Stetson on the seat next to him. \u201cCan\u2019t stay but a couple of minutes. My granddaughter will be swinging by to pick me up. She\u2019s got a nice little Western store, and I help her with the customers two days a week. That\u2019s why I\u2019m duded up,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow, where are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAspen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be lost then. There are signs all around you. Aspen\u2019s just a few miles away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was trying to locate an area called Land of the Lakes or Around the Lakes. Have you ever heard of such a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Land Between the Lakes, then, yes, I sure have heard of it. My name\u2019s Walt Gentry, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery Delaney,\u201d she said as she offered her hand to shake his.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you,\u201d he said. He moved his coffee so he wouldn\u2019t knock it when he stacked his hands on the table and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t find the place on that map, so you might as well stop looking. Most folks outside of Colorado wouldn\u2019t even know about it. You see, people come in here from California and Washington and buy a couple of acres of land. Then they build themselves a big house, and they think they ought to name the place, like it was the Ponderosa or something. Now, a fella named Parnell, Dennis Parnell, purchased about forty acres of prime land up high above Aspen some time back. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to buy it, but he did,\u201d he added with a shrug. \u201cThen, about six years ago, he decided to build his dream home up there. It took more than two and a half years to finish it, and Parnell made those environmentalists crazy tearing up that beautiful, untamed land the way he did. Big old semis going up and down the mountain, tearing out trees to make room for a road. It was a crying shame what he did, but Parnell got away with it because money talks, and he got every kind of permit he needed. Don\u2019t think that could happen today,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the last couple of years, we got stronger laws passed protecting our land. Anyway,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhen Parnell\u2019s house was all finished, he put up a big fence all the way around it. I heard the house came in at eight million, but that was a few years ago, so I\u2019m sure the price has more than doubled. It was rumored that Parnell paid cash and owns the house and the land free and clear. I didn\u2019t believe that gossip, but folks around here did, and then, of course, they had to speculate as to where he could have gotten his hands on so much money.\u201d</p><p>Avery was caught up in the story. \u201cHow did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFolks thought it must be drug money, but turns out Parnell owned a little computer company out in Silicon Valley. One of his engineers designed a new computer chip that revolutionized the business. Don\u2019t understand any of it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut since that engineer worked for Parnell, he got the patent. He made his fortune, sold the company before it went belly-up, and moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t still own the place, does he?\u201d she asked, thinking that Parnell must have sold it to the owner of Utopia to use as a retreat for important visitors.</p><p>\u201cHe does and he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Walt replied. \u201cThis is where the story takes a sordid turn. Parnell got married at the church about a mile from here. It was quite an event too, and cost a fortune. Five hundred people were invited to the reception,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard it took a year to plan the big party. They even had flowers flown in from Europe. I guess the flowers in the United States weren\u2019t good enough. Anyway, the planning of the marriage lasted longer than the union. Parnell was only married eighteen months when he filed for divorce.\u201d</p> <p>He paused to shake his head. Then he got sidetracked. \u201cI sure don\u2019t understand this modern world. Me and my wife, Ona May, have been married forty-seven years, and sure, there have been times when I wanted to leave and never come back. I imagine she felt the same way every now and again, but we stayed together because we said our vows and we meant them. Now I read in the papers about this new trend called \u2018starter marriages.\u2019 Have you ever heard of them?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cThose couples ought to just live together and leave the vows out of it. I think Parnell thought he was in a starter marriage, the way he filed so quick. It\u2019s been a real nasty divorce with lots of mudslinging, which of course hits the papers. People gobble that trash right up. He filed over a year ago, and it\u2019s still dragging on. Everyone\u2019s waiting to hear who\u2019s gonna end up owning that house. The soon-to-be-ex-wife swears he promised it to her, and she thinks she ought to be able to keep it. The judge is deciding now which one of them is going to get it. Pamela Parnell says she\u2019ll die before she lets him have it, and he says that\u2019s fine with him. They\u2019re both acting like five-year-olds, if you ask me. Just last week Parnell gave another interview and was quoted as saying that no matter what the judge ruled, he was never gonna let his ex have that house. Those two are quite a pair,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the folks around and in Aspen are just as bad. Do you know they got a lottery going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean they\u2019re betting over which one gets the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The odds are ninety to ten in favor of Pamela Parnell getting it because of the shady way Dennis got himself those permits. There\u2019s talk he\u2019ll be indicted. And the judge who\u2019s deciding which one of those sorry characters will get the house is a real dedicated environmentalist. Time will tell, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, tapped the map with his forefinger. \u201cRight there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s Land Between the Lakes. It was so named, you see, because it sits between two big, clear-water lakes. Have you got a pen on you? I could circle it for you.\u201d</p><p>Avery dug through her backpack, found a ballpoint pen, and handed it to Walt. His fingers were crippled with arthritis. He had trouble holding the pen as he made the circle.</p><p>\u201cFrom where we\u2019re sitting, it\u2019s about a two-hour drive away. There are some other fancy homes up there, but you won\u2019t get near any of them because all the roads are privately owned and gated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my aunt was staying at a retreat called Land Between the Lakes, but I must have been mistaken. Maybe I didn\u2019t hear her correctly. There was a lot of static on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould she have said Twin Lakes?\u201d he asked. \u201cNow, Land Between the Lakes is up north, but Twin Lakes is south of here, and it is marked on the map.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the location. Avery nodded, then folded the map and put it in her backpack. She shook his hand again as she stood. \u201cThank you for helping me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou be sure to buckle up, darlin\u2019. There are some crazy drivers out there, taking those winding roads at seventy miles an hour. They\u2019re begging for death. Don\u2019t you let them take you with them.\u201d</p><p>She got back in the car and started out again. Guilt prevented her from taking any side trips. Besides, she had soaked up a little local color when she\u2019d visited with Walt. He was a genteel old man, and she\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed listening to him.</p><p>Maybe she could talk Carrie into doing a little hiking. That thought was so absurd, she laughed. Avery had heard that her aunt actually had been quite a jock in high school. She\u2019d played volleyball, basketball, and just about every other sport that was offered. Avery remembered playing with Carrie\u2019s tennis trophies. Did her aunt still have them, or had she thrown them away? Oh, well, no matter. Carrie definitely wasn\u2019t an outdoors girl now. She detested exercise.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s goal for her stay at Utopia was to be pampered, not whipped into shape. Avery sighed loudly. She hoped to heaven Carrie didn\u2019t make her do all that girly stuff with her, like mud baths and seaweed wraps. It wasn\u2019t that she had anything against being pampered, but she didn\u2019t have all that much time to have fun, and she would rather get muddy exploring the countryside.</p><p>Avery drove through Aspen and continued on. An hour later she was certain she was lost. She was about to pull over and check the map again when she spotted the sign for Utopia. The road curved sharply, then climbed and narrowed to a gravel driveway. Then the gate came into view. She stopped to give her name to the guard on duty.</p><p>\u201cYour name isn\u2019t on the list for today\u2019s check-ins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a reservation,\u201d she insisted. \u201cMy name should be there.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer to the car and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a mix-up. You can straighten it out at the front desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she called out as she drove through.</p><p>They certainly were friendly at the spa if the guard was an indicator. She glanced in her rearview mirror and saw him standing in the middle of the road watching her drive away.</p><p>His salt-and-pepper hair reminded her of her uncle Tony. Oh, Lord, she forgot to call him last night. As soon as she checked into her room, she\u2019d do just that. Tony was such a worrier. Avery knew that he and Carrie were having problems, but she hoped that they would be able to work them out. Carrie was probably the reason they weren\u2019t getting along. Although Avery loved her aunt with all her heart, she wasn\u2019t blind to her faults. Carrie could be a real pain sometimes. Marrying Tony was the best thing she had ever done, and maybe, while she was relaxing at the spa, she would take the time to think about her priorities. She had always taken Tony for granted, and no marriage could survive long that way. Fortunately, her uncle had the patience of a saint. He\u2019d hung in there longer than any other man would have.</p><p>She went around another sharp curve. For Pete\u2019s sake, where was the spa? Since passing through the gate, she had to have driven halfway up the mountain, and she was completely surrounded by wilderness. Then, when she was sure she must have taken a service road by mistake at the last fork, Utopia came into view.</p><p>It was aptly named. \u201cMy goodness,\u201d she whispered. The place was gorgeous and seemed to radiate tranquillity. The buff-colored stucco buildings were nestled in the lush landscape of towering evergreens. The main structure looked as though it were part of the sloping mountain. Small bungalows dotted the hillside with stone paths winding in and around the thick pines. There were wildflowers everywhere. She could hear the sound of rushing water. She turned and saw a fountain of steps built into the side of the lower hill. The bubbling water rolled down the slate and splashed over a golden sphere suspended in a circular pool.</p><p>A maintenance truck pulled out in front of Avery\u2019s car from a service road. She braked and waited as the crew quickly unloaded some barrels, her gaze taking in the beauty and serenity of her surroundings. A young couple, obviously in love, caught her attention. They were holding hands as they strolled down the path parallel to the fountain. They stopped halfway, turned to each other, and kissed passionately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avery felt a pang of envy and forced herself to look away. And then she couldn\u2019t stop herself from glancing back at the couple and noticing the way they looked into each other\u2019s eyes. They were probably newlyweds, she thought.</p><p>The truck moved out of her path, and with a sigh, she drove up the steep incline. At the crest was a cobblestone circle drive. Huge clay pots overflowing with ivy and pink and yellow flowers were placed liked sentinels in front of the marble steps leading up to the entrance.</p><p>People were coming and going, all at a sedate pace. Like the lovey-dovey couple on the hillside, the guests were dressed in identical navy blue jogging suits. On the jacket, above the breast pocket, was a little logo of a sphere with the name of the spa printed in gold thread.</p><p>Avery put the car in park as the doorman rushed forward. He opened her door, put his hand out to assist her, and said, \u201cWelcome to Utopia.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>MONK WAS IN LOVE. THOUGH HE HADN\u2019T BELIEVED SUCH A miracle could happen, he had met the woman of his dreams, and since then he had been acting like a crazy, ridiculous fool. Jilly was his soul mate. No doubt about it. They were absolutely perfect for each other, for they shared the same dreams, the same fantasies, the same goals, and most important of all, the same sense of unfair play.</p><p>She had hypnotized him from the moment they\u2019d met in that dirty nameless little bar and grill on the outskirts of Savannah. His breath had caught in his throat when she walked in, a vision in a silky red dress and red stiletto heels. She was simply . . . magnificent. As he had instructed over the phone, he was waiting in the corner booth with a blue folder in his hands. When she saw him, she smiled, and in that instant, he knew he was lost.</p><p>The bloom of first love hadn\u2019t worn off. He still ached with his love for her. Even when he was supposed to be working, he couldn\u2019t stop smiling. These days his mind only had room for thoughts of her. While he was doing the necessary drudge work of surveillance, one of his favorite ways to pass the time was to recall, to the most intimate detail, the first time they had made love. It had happened exactly three hours after they had met. Jilly had taken him back to her hotel room, stripped him of his clothes and his inhibitions, and had made passionate love to him. He closed his eyes in bliss as the memory flooded his senses. The sweet taste of her in his mouth, the musky scent of her perfume, the heat of her silky body pressed against his, the deep, almost animal sounds she made when he touched her just so. She had been wild, forceful, and rough\u2014just the way he liked it\u2014and yet, at the same time, she had been exquisitely vulnerable.</p><p>Monk marveled over his lack of discipline when it came to Jilly. Never in his wildest imagination would he have believed he was capable of silly romantic behavior, or that he would ever marry. Yet, two months ago he had proposed\u2014down on one knee, no less\u2014and she had thrilled him with her acceptance. He told her he would do anything for her, anything at all, and then set about proving it. Desperate to please her, he knew he was putty in her hands, yet he couldn\u2019t seem to mind.</p> <p>Jilly was the first person in the world whom he completely trusted to keep his secrets. He knew all of hers too. They had been living together for four months when, late one night, after they had made love and were cuddling together on the sofa in their silk robes and sipping chilled champagne, he opened up to her and told her all about his bleak life on the dried-up patch of farmland in Nebraska with his dried-up, stern, joyless parents. His father hadn\u2019t believed in sparing the rod, and his mother, a weakling who was afraid of her own shadow and who never went anywhere or did anything outside of the home except church on Sunday mornings, would stand with her hands folded behind her back and watch as her husband tried to whip the wanderlust out of their only child. Monk learned early in life never to complain to her because she always told his father what he had said. By the time he was ten, he hated both of them and would fall asleep at night dreaming of new ways to torture them.</p><p>His life had been claustrophobic. He stole money from the church safe\u2014just a little here and there on Sundays. After he graduated from high school, he packed up his bag, a grocery sack actually, and left the farm. He went to college in Omaha. He had enough saved to pay for the first semester and received government loans to pay the rest of the tuition, loans he never intended to repay. Four years later, he left the state of Nebraska, vowing never to return.</p><p>To this day, he didn\u2019t know if his parents were dead or alive, and he didn\u2019t particularly care.</p><p>He\u2019d never really cared about anyone\u2014until now.</p><p>He told Jilly everything about himself. He told her he had committed his first murder at the ripe old age of twenty-two. He also told her he had once had dreams of working in the theater. He loved getting into costume and taking on different roles. And he was a good actor, he boasted, so good that he tried out for a major part in a summer stock play. Another actor mocked his performance and humiliated him in front of the director. Monk became so rattled by the heckling that he made a mess of his audition and, of course, didn\u2019t get the part. Vowing to get even, he bided his time, and two years later he went after the boy. He\u2019d used his knife that time and had found the experience both exciting and liberating.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you change your name?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe day I enrolled in college,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a fake birth certificate, and I managed to make it look real enough to fool the administrator\u2019s office. It was really quite crude, but it got the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to go to college,\u201d she told him. \u201cI wanted to, but my mother didn\u2019t think I was smart enough. She took the money I\u2019d saved and used it to pay for Carrie\u2019s education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your life like growing up?\u201d</p><p>Jilly\u2019s eyes welled up with tears. \u201cLoveless,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember my father. He left when I was little. It was because of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cShe drove him away. He ran off with another woman, but looking back, I can\u2019t blame him. Mama was a cold and bitter woman. She never showed me any affection, and I think that\u2019s why I got into trouble . . . you know . . . got pregnant. I was looking for someone to love me. I shamed the family. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times my sister and mother shouted those very words at me.\u201d She shook her head and then whispered, \u201cI was such an innocent fool. I was so sure that, once I had the baby, my mother and my sister, the golden girl, would forgive me and help me raise her. I wanted to do the right thing by my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen, did it?\u201d</p><p>She gripped his hand. \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. It was so awful. Mama and Carrie came to the hospital. I thought they were going to take me and my daughter home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened, my love?\u201d he asked when she was too overcome to continue. He leaned forward to pour more champagne into her glass.</p><p>\u201cCarrie left the hospital room with my daughter. She never said a word to me. She just went to the bassinet, picked her up, and left. Mama grabbed my arm when I tried to go after my sister. I asked her where Carrie was going with my beautiful baby, and she said that she was taking little Avery home. \u2018Avery.\u2019 That\u2019s the stupid name my mama came up with for my daughter.\u201d She wiped the tears away from her face with her fingertips. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even let me name my own child. Carrie was making all the decisions, telling Mama what she ought to do, and Mama went along with whatever her golden girl decreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama told me I had to leave town and that I could never come home again. She said I had humiliated her and Carrie for the last time. I couldn\u2019t get through to her, and even though I begged her to forgive me, she wouldn\u2019t. I can still see that ugly, pinched look on her face. It was just like Carrie\u2019s. She called me terrible names, and then she opened her pocketbook and pulled out a hundred-dollar bill. She threw it in my face and walked out of the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there anyone who would help you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMama was real tight with the chief of police. She had him wound around her little finger. He used to drop by late every other night when Carrie and I were supposed to be sleeping, but one night I heard all this groaning and grunting going on, and I snuck down to see what was happening. I peeked in the living room, and there was the chief sprawled out as pretty as you please on our sofa with his pants down around his ankles. Mama was kneeling between his legs, servicing him. The fat pig was a married man,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd he\u2019d do anything to keep Mama from telling his wife about their sordid affair. Mama told me that the chief would lock me up in jail if I didn\u2019t leave town right away. I knew she had the power to make him do it.\u201d</p><p>She was sobbing uncontrollably now. He put his arm around her and held her close until she was able to calm down. Then he asked, \u201cWhat happened to your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie raised her and brainwashed her against me. My sister has always hated me. She wasn\u2019t . . . pretty the way I was, and she was eaten up with jealousy. Stealing my baby was her way of getting even with me, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet Dale Skarrett?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter I left Sheldon Beach, I worked odd jobs to support myself. I was trying to save up enough money to hire a lawyer and get my baby back. I didn\u2019t have any training to do much of anything, so I worked in bars and restaurants. I stole money a couple of times to help pay the rent, and I slept with men too. Twelve in all,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI kept count . . . I don\u2019t know why, but I did, and I took every precaution so I wouldn\u2019t get any disgusting diseases. I hated doing it, but I needed the money. I was so desperate to get my daughter back.\u201d She turned away as she recalled the anguish. \u201cThen, one night when I was working at a flea-infested bar down in Savannah, I met Dale Skarrett. God, he disgusted me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he had money. He made sure I saw the wad of bills, and he wanted me. We lived together off and on for what seemed an eternity. I tried to move on with my life, but he kept coming back. And then one night he told me about this jewelry store he and his buddies, Frank and Larry, were going to rob. Larry was shacking up with the daughter of the owner of the store, and she liked to talk about her family\u2019s money. Dale pretty much planned the robbery, but I helped with all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were an accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe robbery went off without a hitch, but Frank had a big mouth, and he started talking about all the money he was going to get when Dale sold the diamonds. Dale had hid the uncut stones, and we had all agreed to wait at least six months before fencing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut things went wrong, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. An informant told the police about Frank\u2019s bragging. They picked him up for questioning, and he ended up making a deal with them. He gave them Larry\u2019s name, but he didn\u2019t give them Dale\u2019s or my name until later. He was holding out for a better deal, I guess. Larry called us and warned us in time, and we were able to get out of town. Larry didn\u2019t make it, though. There was a shootout, and Larry killed a policeman before he was killed.\u201d</p><p>Jilly started crying again. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about the diamonds. Dale promised me that he\u2019d help me get my daughter back. That was going to be my cut for helping him with the robbery. We drove back to Sheldon Beach, and he went to Mama\u2019s house to get Avery. I didn\u2019t look at it as kidnapping. I was simply taking back what my sister had stolen from me. I didn\u2019t know Carrie had made Mama go to court to have Carrie named Avery\u2019s legal guardian. The court took away all my rights as a mother and gave them to my sister. She stole my baby from me, Monk. She stole her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your heart\u2019s breaking, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery was just a little girl when Dale went to get her, but Carrie had already turned her against me. Dale told me he tried to calm Avery down by telling her how much I loved her and that she would be happy with me. Avery became hysterical. God only knows what horrid lies Carrie had told her. She fought him like a tigress, kicking and trying to scratch his eyes out. He said he took off his belt to tie her hands together and that he gave her a couple of swats to get her to stop her tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Monk handed her another Kleenex so she could wipe her tears away. \u201cGo on. You\u2019ll feel better after you get all that poison out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Avery\u2019s screams woke Mama. She came running out with a gun in her hand. The chief of police had given it to her for protection. She tried to kill Dale. He told me he was backing away with Avery when she fired the gun. She shot my daughter by mistake.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cDale didn\u2019t tell me about that for a long time, so I didn\u2019t go to the hospital to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she saw what she had done, Dale said she screamed, then suddenly clutched her chest and fell down. She was dead before she hit the floor . . . according to Dale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t cry about her dying. She had turned against me, and I pretty much did the same to her. I didn\u2019t shed a single tear,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale tried to keep his promise to me. He followed Avery when she went to live with my sister in California. He watched her school, thinking he could grab her when she came outside. She had a bodyguard, though, an FBI agent looking out for her. Carrie obviously convinced them that Dale would come after Avery. My sister is very clever,\u201d she added with a sneer. \u201cShe must have alerted the principal because he told the security guards that Dale was dangerous. There was always someone watching her. Dale tried to grab her as she was crossing the campus, but the FBI agent spotted him and tackled him to the ground. Dale wasn\u2019t armed,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was arrested and sent back to Florida to stand trial for my mother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was convicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The autopsy report proved Mama had a heart attack, but the jury still believed Dale was responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t care if he was responsible or not, but Mama did have a bad heart. I have something to confess now, darling. Please don\u2019t be angry. Let me explain before you react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never become angry with you. I promise,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the money you gave me to pay off all my debts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thirty thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Her hand slid under his robe, and she began to caress his chest. \u201cI gave most of the money to an attorney as a retainer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy did you need an attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hired him to help Dale. I want to get him out of prison, and now it looks like that might happen. When the attorney was going through the boxes of evidence, he found a bill from a cardiologist in Savannah. He went to see him,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd the doctor told him my mother\u2019s condition was fatal. More important, he said that he had come forward and told the prosecutor that he had treated Mama, but the prosecutors withheld that information from the public defender who had been assigned to represent Dale.\u201d</p><p>Monk was suddenly feeling insecure and angry, but he contained his emotions.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe attorney I hired did it,\u201d she said. \u201cDale\u2019s getting a new trial, and it\u2019s going to be soon. The judge was outraged when he heard that the prosecutor had suppressed evidence to help him win. It seems there\u2019s bad blood between the two men, and this was the last straw. Dale\u2019s attorney told me another case was postponed, and the judge gave Dale that opening. Carrie and Avery can\u2019t testify. Dale will stay in prison if they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the parole hearing? Is that still scheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the trial should be over by then. If Dale doesn\u2019t get out of prison, I\u2019ll never get those diamonds. After all I\u2019ve been through, I think I deserve them. Of course, whatever I get belongs to you too. Am I being too greedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you must be honest with me now. Do you have feelings for Dale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, no,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated him, and I know how I can prove it to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked, intrigued by the sly smile of hers he found so titillating.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Dale leads us to the diamonds, I\u2019ll let you watch me kill him.\u201d</p><p>All of his insecurities faded with that promise. She kissed him then and whispered, \u201cI love you with all my heart. I would die rather than hurt you. Killing Dale will prove my love, but I want proof from you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked. He wasn\u2019t a man given to poetry, but he tried to be romantic as he vowed, \u201cIf you wish me to walk on water, I swear I\u2019ll find a way to do it. I\u2019ll do anything for you, dearest Jilly. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled up against him. \u201cMy sister and Avery both spoke at the last parole hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the reason he didn\u2019t get out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to find a way to keep your sister and your daughter away from the trial and the parole hearing this time? Is that what you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarling, I don\u2019t want you to just keep them away. I want you to make it impossible for them to testify. I want you to kill them.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>CARRIE WOKE UP IN A COLD SWEAT. THE NIGHTMARE HAD consumed her, terrified her. Trembling like a child, she wrapped herself in the down comforter and tried to calm her racing heartbeat. She felt as if she were having a heart attack. She put her hand to her chest and took a couple of deep breaths. The nightmare had been so real. My God, what had brought that on? She hadn\u2019t thought about Jilly in years. Why was her sister suddenly tormenting her sleep again?</p><p>Maybe she was just overly tired. Yes, that was it, she thought, latching onto the possibility. It made sense, didn\u2019t it? She had been working seventy-, eighty-hour weeks for the past two months, firming up and then nailing the incredibly lucrative Bliss account. The contracts were all signed and delivered, and now that she could finally slow the pace, her overloaded brain had simply had a minor meltdown.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, she closed her eyes against the piercing sunlight streaming in between the partially opened drapes and tried to remember some of the yoga exercises Avery had taught her. Take deep, cleansing breaths. She remembered that much. Clear the mind and concentrate on relaxing every muscle of the body. Okay, it was coming back to her. First the toes. Then the legs. That\u2019s it, she thought. Now relax, damn it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t working. Anxiety, like the boogeyman hiding in the closet, was still lurking, waiting to pounce.</p><p>For heaven\u2019s sake, it was just a nightmare. Vivid as hell, but still not real, so stop freaking out.</p><p>Carrie wished Valium were still in vogue. She would have taken a couple to soothe her nerves. Then she realized she was calming down. Her heart no longer felt as though it were trying to leap out of her chest like one of those creatures in Alien.</p> <p>What she needed was a good long shower. Carrie threw the covers off and sat up. What time was it? Did the sun come up brighter here in the mountains than in L.A.? Of course it did, because there wasn\u2019t any smog.</p><p>Coffee, she thought. I\u2019ll ring for coffee. The caffeine will clear the fog in my head, and I\u2019ll be able to start thinking like a human being again.</p><p>Carrie was swinging her legs over the side of the bed when she saw them. There, pointed toward her on the nightstand, was a pair of shiny steel-bladed scissors. She froze, the scream lodged in her throat. She couldn\u2019t make herself look away, couldn\u2019t make the scissors disappear.</p><p>Her heart was slamming against her rib cage again. Could a person die of fright? Was this some kind of a sick joke? No. Whoever had put the scissors there couldn\u2019t possibly know about her nightmare. Think, damn it. Try to think.</p><p>Were they real? Carrie tentatively reached out to touch them, thinking she was having some kind of hallucination. When her fingers touched the hard, cold steel handle, she whimpered. Son of a bitch, they were real.</p><p>There had to be a reasonable explanation. Maybe the scissors had been there on the nightstand the night before, and while she hadn\u2019t consciously noticed, her subconscious had picked up on them. The possibility sounded desperate, but she clung to it. Then she spotted the yellow, invitation-sized envelope with her name handwritten in beautiful script propped up against the lamp. She was positive it hadn\u2019t been there the night before. Her hand trembled as she picked it up and opened it. The stationery was expensive, but there wasn\u2019t a Utopia seal or logo printed on it, or a return address.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d she whispered. And then she pulled the two sheets out, unfolded them, and read the note.</p><p>Carrie:</p><p>Did you mourn me when you heard I died in that car crash so many years ago? Or did you celebrate? You always believed you were so superior. I was just a stupid girl. Do you remember how you called me that? I\u2019ve never forgotten. Your biggest problem was that you always underestimated me. Always. Surely you recall how I so loved to get even. That glorious day has finally arrived, and now you\u2019re right where I want you to be.</p><p>The house is wired, Carrie, and there isn\u2019t any way out. If you open a window or an outside door . . . boom. A simple push of a button and the house will disintegrate. Do you wonder how long I\u2019ll wait?</p><p>Tick. Tick. Are you scared?</p><p>Shall I tell you how I plotted and planned? I began by finding the man of my dreams. He loves me, of course, but then they all do, don\u2019t they? This one is very special. A perfectionist, actually. His name is Monk, and when I first seduced him, I must say he was terribly set in his ways. He\u2019s a hit man, my hit man, though he prefers to be called a professional.</p><p>He does whatever I ask him to do, and in return I\u2019ve taught him how to have fun with his job. He\u2019s a proud man, proud of what he does, and he\u2019s careful and methodical, and so he won\u2019t let me make any mistakes. In the past, he only took on one job at a time, but I\u2019ve convinced him to reach for bigger and better. He\u2019d already contracted to blow up the house. It just took a little more planning to kill a few inconsequential women at the same time.</p><p>You know why you must die. You stole my dream from me and gave it away. You took my child from me too, and you turned her against me. Those are just two reasons, Carrie, but when all is said and done, your biggest sin is that you have made me unhappy.</p><p>Jilly</p><p>P.S. Don\u2019t worry about Avery. I\u2019m going to take care of her too.</p><p>Carrie screamed once and began to sob. She was terrified. Shaking, she leapt from the bed and ran to the sliding glass doors. She grabbed a fistful of the drapes, ripped them out of her way, and looked outside. Then down. She saw the blinking red light protruding from the explosives, as evil and horrific as the devil\u2019s eye, and shouted, \u201cOh, God, oh, God . . .\u201d</p><p>She ran for the bedroom door, tripped over her shoes and slammed her right foot into the bedpost. Pain shot up her calf. Cursing, she continued on. She stopped short in the hallway just outside her door and called out, \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Not a sound. Too late, she realized she should have grabbed the scissors to use as a weapon just in case someone had been waiting, but Jilly had touched those scissors. Jilly, who had written the horrific, gleeful letter. Jilly, the psycho.</p><p>God help them all.</p><p>She edged along the wall to the spiral staircase. She was afraid to look down, afraid not to. It took her a good minute to get up the courage, and then relief, sweet, sweet relief, made her weak because no one was looking up at her. Maybe Carrie and Sara and Anne were all alone in the house. No, not a house now. A bomb.</p><p>She ran down the stairs, then raced to the judge\u2019s suite. She didn\u2019t bother to knock, but threw the door open and rushed inside.</p><p>The room was pitch black. Carrie couldn\u2019t even see her hand in front of her face. She felt her way across the sitting room, nearly knocking over a lamp when her elbow bumped into the shade. She grabbed it, and finally got it turned on.</p><p>Sara was in bed. Carrie could see a form huddled under the blanket, but she couldn\u2019t see her face. The drapes were tightly drawn. Carrie opened them and looked down. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she muttered. There it was, another blinking red light.</p><p>Turning, she slowly approached the side of the bed as she strained to hear the sound of Sara\u2019s breathing. She couldn\u2019t hear anything but the noise of the air conditioner as it kicked on.</p><p>Carrie gently shook her. \u201cWake up, Sara,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. She shook her again, much harder this time. \u201cCome on, Sara. You have to wake up.\u201d Sara groaned.</p><p>She put her hand on Sara\u2019s wrist, feeling for a pulse with her fingertips. When she finally found it, she felt like shouting with relief.</p><p>Carrie knew what had happened. The food they\u2019d eaten last night had been drugged, but because she had thrown up, she\u2019d gotten rid of most of the poison. How much had Sara and Anne eaten?</p><p>She grabbed Sara by her shoulders and started shaking her. \u201cOpen your eyes, damn it. Wake up, Sara.\u201d</p><p>Another groan was her only response. Carrie looked at the clock on the bureau and saw that it was already one in the afternoon. Then she turned to the nightstand, and just as she expected, there was another envelope propped against the lamp with Sara\u2019s name written on it. The handwriting was identical.</p><p>Should she open it?</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Carrie jumped at the sound of Sara\u2019s gruff voice. She was struggling to open her eyes. Carrie stepped back as Sara rolled onto her back and told her once again to go away.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep your eyes open. You have to wake up.\u201d</p><p>Sara heard her. She struggled to sit up but only made it halfway before she collapsed against the pillows. She focused on Carrie, awareness slow to penetrate.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Carrie ordered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drugged. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? Please, try to pay attention. We\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t take drugs.\u201d</p><p>In her frustration, she shouted at the woman. \u201cThey put it in the food, Sara. Can you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re telling me the food was drugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cKeep your eyes open. I\u2019m going to get a cold wet cloth. Come on, Sara,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cSit up.\u201d</p><p>By the time Carrie returned from the adjoining bath with a washcloth dripping with cold water, Sara had managed to pull herself up. Her shoulders were pressed against the headboard.</p><p>She looked at Carrie as though she was only just now seeing her. \u201cWhy are you in my room?\u201d</p><p>Carrie tried to put the wet cloth on Sara\u2019s face, but the woman knocked it away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI have to go wake Anne. So you have to listen to what I\u2019m going to tell you. Okay? Can you concentrate yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop shouting at me? I\u2019m awake now. What kind of trouble are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is wired.\u201d</p><p>Sara blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prisoners,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cIf one of us opens a door or a window, the house will blow up. Look at the glass door,\u201d she urged. \u201cSee the red blinking light?\u201d</p><p>Sara wouldn\u2019t believe her. \u201cThis is just some kind of sick prank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. Then she grabbed the envelope from the nightstand. \u201cOpen it,\u201d she said. \u201cI got one too. Bring the letter with you down to the living room, and I\u2019ll bring mine. Even if you can\u2019t believe it, don\u2019t open any windows or doors. Okay? Now I\u2019ve got to get to Anne before she wakes up and decides to open a window.\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>She was opening the envelope when Carrie rushed out of the room. Anne\u2019s suite was at the opposite end on the same level. She ran to it.</p><p>Anne wasn\u2019t in bed. Carrie could hear her in the bathroom. She was throwing up. Carrie went to the door and knocked. \u201cAnne, do you need help?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer her. Carrie tried again and again. She didn\u2019t know how long she stood there pounding on the door. Finally, Anne opened it.</p><p>The frail woman looked green. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked. She was swaying on her feet.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d Carrie said. She put her arm around her waist, thinking it was the size of a pencil, and helped her back to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay away from me,\u201d Anne said, her voice weak. \u201cI\u2019ve got some kind of a bug. Now you\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a bug.\u201d She was all but carrying the woman across the room. When she reached the bed, she pulled the sheet back and helped Anne sit down.</p><p>\u201cI was up half the night, throwing up,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I have a bug. It\u2019s probably just one of those twenty-four-hour viruses.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an envelope on Anne\u2019s nightstand. \u201cYou were up all night?\u201d she asked as she helped the woman into bed. \u201cDid you hear anyone . . . see anyone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cLet go of me. I don\u2019t want to lie down.\u201d She adjusted the pillows and slowly leaned back on one elbow.</p><p>\u201cWe were all drugged,\u201d Carrie explained. \u201cThe stuff had to have been in the food we ate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. It was spoiled food, that\u2019s what it was. Am I going to give them an earful when I get to the spa. I could sue,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just might. First, the inconvenience at the airport and now food poisoning. It\u2019s simply unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t argue. She plodded ahead, telling about the envelopes she and Sara had received.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important thing you need to know is that there are detonators on every window and door in this house. If we open one of them, the house will blow up.\u201d</p><p>Anne was looking at her as though she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. What\u2019s the matter with you, trying to scare me like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare you. I\u2019m telling you the truth. Did you find an envelope with your name on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>The answer was too quick, too angry. Carrie knew she was lying, but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t understand why.</p> <p>\u201cAnne, we\u2019re all in this together. You have to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>Indignant, she responded, \u201cI am telling you the truth. Now get out of here and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much time we have, and we have to find a way to get out of here without triggering the explosives.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s pinched face was rapidly turning red. \u201cI asked you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Carrie tried a different approach. \u201cSara and I . . . we need you, Anne. We have to work together to figure out what is going on.\u201d</p><p>Anne glared at her. \u201cWhy do you need me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly know if I\u2019m smart or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran your own company, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s what you told me.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s chin came up a notch. As she smoothed the sheets around her waist, she said, \u201cI started on a shoestring and turned my little hobby\u2014that\u2019s what my father called my shipping company\u2014into a forty-million-dollar operation. By next January, I\u2019ll have increased my profit margin to quadruple the amount my accountants anticipated.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t have time for this. To be forced to pander to the stupid woman\u2019s ego just to gain her cooperation was outrageous. Didn\u2019t Anne realize what they were all up against?</p><p>With effort, Carrie was able to control her temper. \u201cDo you think you could join Sara and me downstairs in the living room to talk about our situation? We could sure use your . . . advice on how to proceed.\u201d</p><p>Anne tilted her head to the side and stared at Carrie for a long minute without saying a word. Then she shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re really serious about this story of yours, aren\u2019t you? You believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>Anne nodded. \u201cWhat is your name? I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarolyn,\u201d she answered, trying not to shout at the obtuse woman. \u201cYou may call me Carrie if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Carrie. I\u2019ll join you and Sara downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel strong enough, Sara and I could come in here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not strong enough?\u201d She sounded angry again.</p><p>\u201cI heard you in the bathroom. You were throwing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the food was poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I was throwing up. I\u2019m not sick.\u201d</p><p>Who gives a damn if you\u2019re sick or not, she longed to ask. She took a deep breath, nodded, and said, \u201cAll right. Come downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see what all the fuss is about.\u201d</p><p>Carrie completely lost it then. \u201cFuss?\u201d she roared. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting inside a time bomb. Did you just not listen to a word I\u2019ve been saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I listened. But isn\u2019t the answer right in front of you? Simply pick up the phone and call Utopia. Have them send someone to disarm the thing.\u201d</p><p>The phone. My God, why hadn\u2019t she thought to try calling for help? Carrie ran around to the other side of the bed and picked up the phone. Her excitement and hope were short-lived. The line was dead.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t bother to hang up the phone but dropped it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cell phones?\u201d Anne asked. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be able to get a signal up here?\u201d Glancing at the table beside her, she frowned and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s my cell phone? I had it sitting in the charger right over there, but now it\u2019s gone. Did you move it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took it,\u201d Carrie cried out. She ran to the sliding glass doors that opened to Anne\u2019s balcony, drew the drapes back, and said, \u201cSee that light, Anne? See it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee all the wires? The house is rigged,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you understand yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right,\u201d Anne said. She looked sullen now.</p><p>Maybe Sara could get through to the woman. Carrie took a breath and then said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to my room to see if they took my cell phones. Please hurry downstairs,\u201d she added, \u201cand remember, don\u2019t open any doors or windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t so sure about that. She didn\u2019t want to antagonize the woman, and so she pretended to agree. She paused in the open doorway and said, \u201cBring the letter with you . . . please. Sara and I are bringing ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any letter on my nightstand,\u201d Anne snapped.</p><p>Carrie turned around. \u201cI never said anything about a nightstand.\u201d</p><p>Anne turned her head away from Carrie. \u201cShut the door after you.\u201d</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was the matter with Anne? Why was she lying? What could she possibly have to gain?</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t have any answers. She went back to her suite but stopped short just inside the door. Her beautiful Gucci bags had been ripped open with a knife, and all of her clothes were strewn about the sofa and chair. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed the mess before? Just as she suspected, one of her two cell phones, her chargers, and the laptop were all missing.</p><p>She sprinted for the closet. \u201cPlease, God,\u201d she whispered as she threw the double doors open. Maybe Jilly hadn\u2019t been that thorough. Maybe she hadn\u2019t found the cell phone in her pocket.</p><p>Carrie started to cry when she saw her blazer on the floor. Her sister had found the phone. She looked away, sobbing now as the magnitude of her situation overwhelmed her.</p><p>She let herself weep for a couple of minutes, then struggled to get her emotions under control. \u201cI\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said out loud. Wiping her face with the backs of her hands, she staggered to her feet and went into the bathroom. She stared at herself in the mirror. God, she was a mess. Her eyes were swollen, and her face looked haggard.</p><p>Carrie took the time to brush her teeth and wash her face. She lifted her robe off the hook behind the bathroom door and put it on. She felt better now, more in control. After she picked up the letter and the envelope her dear, demented sister had left for her, she went downstairs.</p><p>Neither Sara nor Anne was waiting for her. Carrie went into the kitchen and was surprised to find the pantry hadn\u2019t been stripped. There were boxes of unopened cereal, canned vegetables, and fruit. She noticed the tops had dust on them, indicating they\u2019d been there quite awhile. The refrigerator was empty, but there was a full container of Folgers coffee in the freezer.</p><p>Carrie kept going to the hallway to see if Sara or Anne had come down yet. What the hell was taking them so long? She went back into the kitchen, made a pot of coffee, and then carried a mug of the steaming brew into the living room. She deliberately kept away from the windows, just in case someone was out there watching.</p><p>She sat down in one of the easy chairs near the dining room and waited tensely. Her hand trembled, and hot coffee spilled over the rim, burning her fingers. Five minutes later, she saw Sara slowly making her way down the winding staircase. She was dressed in a royal blue floral silk robe. From the way she clung to the railing, she appeared to be woozy still.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Carrie called out when Sara stopped for the fifth time. She had a white-knuckle grip on the railing.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can make it. I\u2019m a little dizzy. What in heaven\u2019s name was in that food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cBut it was powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have killed us.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that have been something? Carrie thought. To die from a canap\u00e9 and never know about all the trouble Jilly had gone to. Her sister would have been enraged. Carrie smiled at the thought, as sick as it was.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can handle it just yet. How do you know that it wasn\u2019t poisoned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d she assured her. \u201cMy letter was from my sister. She\u2019s gone to a lot of trouble to terrify me. She obviously wants me to suffer before I die, and poison would act too quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did she drug the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo knock us all out,\u201d Carrie answered. She waited until Sara had taken a seat across from her, and then said, \u201cShe came into our rooms last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone was here,\u201d Sara agreed. \u201cHe or she went through all my things. My cell phone and Palm Pilot are both missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone line\u2019s dead too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI checked.\u201d</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Carrie that the judge was awfully calm. She asked her why.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to become hysterical. What would it solve? I\u2019d rather exert my energy figuring out a way to get out of here . . . in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Carrie took another long drink of her coffee. It was tepid now and bitter, but she drank it anyway.</p><p>\u201cMy sister came back from her grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister . . . I thought she was killed in a car accident years ago,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cMy husband and I celebrated after my niece went to bed. I was told that her body was cremated in the inferno, but there were items from her purse that had been thrown clear during the impact, and those items convinced the police that the victim was my sister. I was a fool to believe it. Jilly was wanted for questioning by the police at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she feigned her own death,\u201d Sara said, nodding. \u201cClever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Carrie agreed. \u201cJilly was always sneaky and clever.\u201d She got up and handed the letter to Sara. \u201cShe\u2019s hired a hit man. That\u2019s what she called him. Her hit man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own sister did this to you.\u201d</p><p>Sara didn\u2019t sound surprised, just intrigued. Carrie wondered at her reaction. In normal families, if there really was such a thing, sisters certainly squabbled. Some might even hate each other, but how many would go to the extreme of hiring someone to kill a sibling?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not shocked,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Carrie shook her head. \u201cJilly isn\u2019t like anyone you\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d Sara said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve put away hundreds of men and women who committed heinous crimes. I believe I\u2019ve heard and seen it all in the twenty-two years I\u2019ve sat on the bench. Nothing can shock me now.\u201d</p><p>Carrie scoffed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that. So tell me, Sara. Who wants you dead?\u201d</p><p>Sara carefully adjusted the belt on her robe so that the bow was perfect, then folded her hands in her lap. \u201cWho wants me dead? Oh, quite a few people, I would imagine.\u201d</p><p>She handed the letter to Carrie and watched as she unfolded the note and read it. It was short and to the point.</p><p>Judge Collins:</p><p>I told you I would get even, and I\u2019m a man of my word. Now it\u2019s your turn to suffer. I wish I could be there to watch . . . from a safe distance, of course. You\u2019re going to die very soon now.</p><p>Rot in hell, bitch.</p><p>Carrie dropped the letter on the coffee table. Then she handed Jilly\u2019s letter to Sara.</p><p>\u201cWhile you read her short but not-so-sweet note, I\u2019m going to get another cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a cup now,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>Carrie went back into the kitchen, and when she returned a minute later with two mugs, Sara had placed the note on the coffee table next to the one she\u2019d received. Carrie handed her a mug, warned her the coffee was very hot, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cYour sister hates you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe accused you of stealing her child and turning her against her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to believe that all of her failures were your fault and that your success was stolen from her.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cJilly always had the unique ability to rewrite history. Once she said it, in her mind it was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cIt was never officially diagnosed, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</p><p>Sara began to trace the worry line in her forehead with her fingertip as she listened to Carrie. Back and forth, back and forth. She was so deep in thought she probably wasn\u2019t even aware of what she was doing. \u201cWhat happened with the child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery,\u201d she said. \u201cHer name is Avery, and she\u2019s an adult now, not a child. Jilly left her in the hospital. She told my mother and me that we could keep her, sell her, or give her away. She didn\u2019t care what happened to her.\u201d Tears sprang into Carrie\u2019s eyes. She hated herself for showing such weakness in front of a virtual stranger, but she was powerless to do anything about it. \u201cJilly\u2019s going after Avery too. Oh, God, she could already have her locked away somewhere now. My niece was going to join me at the spa . . .\u201d She covered her face with her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here soon. We have to find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister has gone to quite a lot of trouble to hurt you,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>Carrie told her about Jilly coming into her room during the night and how she had believed she was having a nightmare. Sara was a good listener and so calm Carrie was actually comforted.</p><p>\u201cJilly could be very patient when she really wanted something, and, oh, how she loved complicated plans. Nothing could ever be simple.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sara put her coffee cup down and leaned forward. \u201cHow much time do you think we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to a lot of trouble setting this up. She\u2019ll want to prolong my agony.\u201d</p><p>Both of them kept glancing at the spiral staircase, expecting to see Anne coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already checked every window I could reach. They\u2019re all wired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I would expect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be calm like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calm,\u201d Sara protested. \u201cI\u2019m quite . . . discombobulated.\u201d</p><p>Her choice of words made Carrie smile. \u201cSo am I,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow curious it is that the three of us are in this house together. What is it that we have in common?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have the time to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Her resolve bolstered Carrie. \u201cYes, we must, and we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s keeping Anne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cShe won\u2019t admit she received a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s in shock.\u201d</p><p>Carrie thought Sara might be right about that. \u201cAnd denial,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to all have to work together, but I don\u2019t know how much help I can be. I\u2019ll do whatever I can. I\u2019m sixty-eight years old.\u201d Sara shrugged. \u201cAnd I\u2019m terribly out of shape. When I received the invitation for a free two-week stay at the spa as a promotion, I thought to myself, why not? The experts say it\u2019s never too late to turn your life around. I decided to get into better shape. As you can see, I\u2019m overweight, and once we get outside\u2014and we will find a way to do that,\u201d she said with conviction, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to walk far. I should have had both of my knees replaced several years ago. I\u2019m walking with bone on bone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Anne and I will hide you somewhere . . . somewhere safe in the woods while we go get help.\u201d</p><p>They heard a door close and both looked up. Anne had finally decided to join them. Carrie\u2019s mouth dropped open when the frail woman started down the stairs. She couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. Anne was all dressed up in a hot pink St. John pants suit. Her gold earrings matched the buttons. She had taken the time to put on makeup and curl her hair. When she reached the bottom of the stairs, she smiled, and then crossed the living room to join them. Her high heels clicked against the marble floor. Where in heaven\u2019s name did she think she was going? A formal brunch?</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Sara whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, ladies,\u201d Anne said. \u201cOr rather, good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so cheerful. Had her mind snapped? Carrie wondered. She was about to ask the woman what the hell was the matter with her when Sara suggested Anne sit down.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Anne asked Sara. Then, before she could answer, Anne continued on. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I slept so long. It must be this wonderful mountain air. Coming from Cleveland, it\u2019s a delightful change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care for some coffee?\u201d Sara asked. She was watching her closely, as though she was trying to interpret the woman\u2019s bizarre behavior.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet. I\u2019ll ring when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Carrie turned to Sara. \u201cI told you she was going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you say?\u201d Anne asked. She carefully sat down and crossed one ankle over the other.</p><p>Carrie turned to her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wonderful mountain air that made you sleep so long, Anne. We were all drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. Look where we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWho would do such a thing in this beautiful\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carrie cut her off. \u201cDid you bring your letter down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Carrie asked Sara.</p><p>The judge took over. \u201cAnne, Carrie and I each received a letter. They\u2019re there on the coffee table. Please read them.\u201d</p><p>Carrie noticed that Anne\u2019s hand was violently shaking as she reached for the letters. She picked them up and then quickly placed them back on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t need to read these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Sara gently asserted. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that we\u2019re in trouble here. Someone has wired this place to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rubbish,\u201d Anne muttered. \u201cI will not have my day ruined with this ridiculous game you two are playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re locked inside this house,\u201d Sara told her.</p><p>\u201cWe are not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI tried to tell her all of this upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>Carrie considered punching the woman. She thought she\u2019d probably kill her if she did because Anne was so painfully thin and sickly. A good wind could have done her in.</p><p>\u201cIf any of us opens a window or door, the house will blow up,\u201d Sara patiently explained.</p><p>Neither she nor Carrie anticipated Anne\u2019s reaction. The woman bolted from her chair and ran across the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re only lying to get me upset. The house isn\u2019t wired, and I\u2019m going to prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>She was headed for the front door.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>JOHN PAUL HAD TO HANG AROUND UTOPIA LONGER THAN HE\u2019D anticipated, but the wait was worth it. He was sitting, or rather sprawling, in an easy chair half hidden behind a couple of limp palm trees inside the lobby\u2019s bar when Avery Delaney walked inside. One hard look and he had her all figured out. She was a typical California blonde. No, maybe not typical. She was unique, he\u2019d give her that. But she was definitely all about her body. Why else would she want to spend a week at a spa? Why would anyone?</p><p>The Delaney woman wore a short white T-shirt that fit snugly across her full breasts, and tight jeans, obviously intending to show off her long legs and her tight ass. Her long, straight, blond hair shimmered in the light. It looked natural, but he doubted that it was. Probably came from a bleach bottle. Her sunglasses hid her eyes, but he figured she was probably wearing colored contact lenses. Her T-shirt hid her belly button, but he wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find that she\u2019d had it pierced. Wasn\u2019t that the fashion these days?</p><p>She was hot, all right. In fact, Avery Delaney was a beautiful woman, but she wasn\u2019t his type. She was a little too perfect for his tastes. Sexy as sin, though. As he watched her stop and take in her surroundings\u2014pretending she didn\u2019t notice how the other guests had stopped to stare at her\u2014John Paul wondered how much of her was real and how much had been cosmetically \u201cenhanced.\u201d The breasts, definitely. And maybe even the ass.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman he\u2019d want to have a lasting relationship with, but then he didn\u2019t want a lasting relationship with any woman. One night with her, however, sounded like a damned good idea. Hell, the woman probably had the IQ of a tsetse fly, but in bed, brainpower really didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Miss Airhead couldn\u2019t seem to figure out where check-in was. Was she waiting for someone to take her hand and lead her across the lobby? She was looking up at the golden sphere slowly rotating like one of those old disco balls. Had the thing hypnotized her?</p><p>Avery knew she was gawking like a tourist. She couldn\u2019t help it; Utopia was incredible. The lobby was gigantic, the floors a shiny, ebony marble. Above her, hanging from the gilded dome was a glistening orb. She couldn\u2019t take her gaze off it. Was it real gold? It must have cost the owners a fortune, she thought.</p><p>She turned to her right and stopped again. One entire wall was a waterfall, and in the center of the gathering pool was a statue of Atlas. Another smaller sphere was perched on his shoulder. Both the sculpture and the bubbling waterfall were meant to impress the guests willing to pay a fortune to be pampered in such an environment, and in Avery\u2019s estimation, the owners got the job done.</p><p>Shaking her head over the expense of it all, she pulled up the strap of the old, hand-me-down Gucci backpack Carrie had given her, and crossed the lobby to the reception desk. A man about her age wearing a name tag labeled \u201cOliver\u201d stood behind the granite counter waiting to welcome her. His smile was dazzling, his teeth astonishingly white. Freakishly so. He or his dentist had obviously overdone the bleach job, and his artificially tanned face only made his teeth more prominent. She tried not to stare as she gave him her name and leaned against the cool counter while he pulled up her reservation on the built-in computer screen.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s smile blessedly vanished. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking at her now, but stared intently at the screen when he said, \u201cYour reservation was canceled, Miss Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that has to be a mistake. I didn\u2019t cancel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to my computer, you canceled. It\u2019s noted right here,\u201d he added, pointing to his screen, which she couldn\u2019t possibly see unless she pole-vaulted over the countertop.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe computer\u2019s never wrong. You called Utopia at . . .\u201d He was trying to pull up the exact time she called in.</p><p>\u201cOliver,\u201d she said. Her impatience was brimming in her voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t cancel. In fact, I called to tell reception I would be a day late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d he agreed, pointing to the screen once again. \u201cBut then you called again and canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cBut my computer\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him before he could tell her his computer was infallible again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just book me into another room. Anything will do.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her backpack and placed it on the counter. She began to dig through it looking for her billfold so she could give Oliver her credit card. Against her wishes, the week had been paid for by her aunt, but Avery wanted the charges transferred to her card.</p><p>Oliver, she noticed, had stopped typing. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He coughed delicately and finally looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be possible to book you into another room, and unfortunately, the room you canceled has already been assigned to another guest. We\u2019re at a hundred percent occupancy,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to put you on our waiting list, but I must warn you. There\u2019s little chance of an opening. Our guests book months in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain my aunt was able to reserve a room for me here,\u201d she protested. \u201cIf there had been a problem I\u2019m sure she would have told me.\u201d</p><p>He was frantically typing again. Then he stopped and nodded. \u201cYes, we were able to accommodate you because of another cancellation. That is peculiar,\u201d he added. \u201cOur guests rarely cancel at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he said the last, as though by canceling, he thought she had committed a terrible breach in etiquette.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t cancel,\u201d she said. Lord, this was frustrating. \u201cI\u2019m joining my aunt here,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe checked in yesterday afternoon or early evening. Could you give me her room number? Her name\u2019s Carolyn Salvetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we aren\u2019t allowed to give out the room numbers of our guests.\u201d</p><p>Of course he couldn\u2019t. She knew that. \u201cPlease call her room. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be able to clear up this misunderstanding. She might have decided that I should stay with her.\u201d</p><p>Oliver looked relieved that the problem would be solved and he could get rid of her. Fortunately, there weren\u2019t any other guests waiting in line to check in. He flashed her another startling smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what must have happened. Guests simply do not cancel at the last minute the way you did.\u201d</p><p>She had the sudden urge to grab him by his shoulders and shake him until he admitted the spa had screwed up. Gritting her teeth to keep from saying something she would regret, she spelled the name Salvetti and waited.</p><p>\u201cI know that name,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA gentleman was in here yesterday asking for your aunt. He was very disappointed she wasn\u2019t here.\u201d He started typing, but a couple of seconds later, he was frowning again.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked, knowing full well there was.</p><p>\u201cThere are no problems at Utopia,\u201d he said, and it was such a quick, automatic response she thought he\u2019d been programmed to say those very words. \u201cWe do occasionally have minor inconveniences.\u201d</p><p>Give me a break. \u201cAll right. Explain the minor inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Salvetti canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oliver\u2019s shoulders slumped. She knew what he was thinking. Here we go again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Mrs. Salvetti did cancel. It is odd, I\u2019ll agree. It\u2019s so rare to get two last-minute cancellations like this. Of course, you\u2019re both members of the same family, so I guess we could say it was really only one last-minute cancellation for two rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me. My aunt didn\u2019t cancel. She called me from the Aspen airport yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps something came up at the last minute and she had to return home,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s very wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right here in my computer, Miss Delaney. Your aunt called yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>What in the world was going on? As much as Avery wanted to continue to argue with Oliver, she knew it wouldn\u2019t solve anything. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do now. If an emergency had come up at work and Carrie had had to return to Los Angeles, she would have called. She wouldn\u2019t have left Avery hanging like this. Oh, God, what if something had happened to her or Uncle Tony? What if there had been an accident?</p><p>Calm down, she told herself. If anything bad had happened to either Carrie or Tony, one or the other would have called her.</p><p>Avery began searching her backpack for her phone. She would get hold of Carrie on her cell phone right this minute and find out what was going on.</p><p>She pulled out her Day-Timer and her billfold, clutched them in her right hand, and kept searching for her phone with her other hand. The damned thing always ended up on the bottom. \u201cMy aunt didn\u2019t cancel,\u201d she muttered. Then, more to herself than Oliver, she added, \u201cThere must have been a crisis at work. That\u2019s all I can think of to make Carrie turn around and go back home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, your friend\u2019s back.\u201d Oliver didn\u2019t sound very cheerful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend . . . he\u2019s coming this way. Maybe he can clear up this misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. She didn\u2019t have any friends meeting her here. She turned around to see whom Oliver was watching, but there was only a man striding toward the counter, a big man, she corrected. Odd, but he seemed to be staring at her. And he didn\u2019t look happy.</p> <p>\u201cAre you referring to the gentleman coming this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe was the one I was telling you about. He was here yesterday, looking for your aunt.\u201d In a low voice he added, \u201cIf anyone could benefit from our aroma stress-relief massage therapy, it\u2019s definitely your friend. I suggested the treatment to him, but he was quite . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResistant to the idea. Actually, he was quite difficult about everything. I know I shouldn\u2019t say anything negative about a potential guest, but your boyfriend is wound tight inside. He should be practicing yoga on a daily basis. I mean, the man growled at me. He really did. Can you imagine? I told him you were scheduled to check in. It was noted in the computer under Mrs. Salvetti\u2019s reservation, and that\u2019s who he asked for when he came up to the counter. Your aunt called in and canceled. I had the unfortunate duty of telling him. Let me tell you, he wasn\u2019t happy about that news. He told me he\u2019d come back today to see you, and he\u2019s been here since early morning. I noticed him when I came on duty. I hope he\u2019s in a better mood today.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t paying much attention to Oliver\u2019s prattling. She was busy watching the man crossing the lobby. He was something else. She\u2019d never seen anyone like him, except maybe in the movies. The closer he came, the bigger he got. Tall and muscular, with dark hair and a weathered complexion. She guessed that he spent a good deal of his time outdoors or in a gym somewhere working on his abs. He was ruggedly good-looking, but he was too into the physical to appeal to her. She much preferred brains over muscle.</p> <p>The man had great bone structure. That thought led to another, and she suddenly thought she knew who he was and what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou do know the gentleman, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a friend of my aunt\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had probably used him in one of her commercials, and maybe, since he was in the area and had found out she was staying at the spa, he\u2019d decided to stop by and say hello. It was either that, or muscle man was out of work and hoping that Carrie would take a liking to him and offer him a job.</p><p>Avery had great sympathy for actors because it was such a competitive field and so much of the decision-making process was out of their control. The odds against making it in Hollywood were astronomical. She made up her mind to do what she could to help. She waited until he was about three feet away, then put her hand out and introduced herself. \u201cMy name\u2019s Avery Delaney.\u201d Oh, yes, he was definitely an actor. He had the dark, brooding look down cold.</p><p>He grasped her hand in his. \u201cMy name\u2019s John Paul Renard.\u201d His voice was deep and wonderfully southern.</p> <p>Lordy, he had great eyes. The color of a gray dawn. She couldn\u2019t imagine him holding up a roll of paper towels in a commercial. Explosives, maybe, but not paper towels.</p><p>His body language intrigued her. He turned so that his back was to the counter; then his gaze slowly scanned the lobby. She got the odd feeling he was memorizing every face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of my aunt Carrie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>No further explanation, no embellishment whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an actor, right?\u201d</p><p>The question so surprised him he smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . I thought . . . then what do you do for a living?\u201d God, she hated it when people asked her that question, and it was really none of her business how the hunk, who couldn\u2019t even bother to look at her when she spoke to him, paid his rent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a carpenter.\u201d</p><p>No way. \u201cA carpenter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He drawled out the answer and stared into her eyes. She could feel the heat rush to her face and hoped to heaven she wasn\u2019t blushing. The man did have the strangest way about him.</p><p>Carrie was right. She really needed to start dating again. It had obviously been way too long. If a brute of a man like this one could affect her . . . way too long.</p><p>\u201cA carpenter,\u201d she repeated. Then, \u201cOkay.\u201d She\u2019d go along. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve done some work for my aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was back to watching the people strolling into the lobby as he answered. \u201cI need to talk to her,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s important. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m about to find out.\u201d She turned around to search through her backpack again when a sudden, horrid thought occurred to her. She almost groaned out loud. \u201cDid my aunt want you to meet me here?\u201d</p><p>Carrie was up to her old tricks again, Avery decided, trying to play matchmaker. She was a little surprised at her aunt\u2019s nerve. She thought that her last talk with Carrie had done the trick. Her aunt had promised\u2014vowed, actually\u2014never to try to fix her up again.</p><p>Avery\u2019s voice was curt when she said, \u201cCarrie isn\u2019t here today. If you\u2019re in the area, you could try back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the hint and go away. Deciding to ignore him\u2014no small feat considering his size\u2014she continued to hunt for her phone. She finally found it on the very bottom and pulled it out. Oliver began to shake his head. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are no problems at Utopia, but the use of cell phones on the premises is frowned upon.\u201d Having said that, he pointed to a black-and-gold sign propped on the counter near the corner.</p><p>She flipped open the phone\u2019s cover, pushed the speed dial to Carrie\u2019s cell phone, and said, \u201cThen I guess you better start frowning.\u201d</p><p>John Paul liked her response. Spunk, he thought. What a surprise. The plastic California girl with the too-blue-to-be-true eyes had a backbone.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s voice mail came on after the first ring, which meant the phone was either still being recharged or she was out of signal range. She called Uncle Tony next. He answered, and the second he heard her voice, he proceeded to give her hell because she hadn\u2019t called before her aunt left for the spa.</p><p>\u201cYou know how she worries when she doesn\u2019t hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you talked to Carrie since she left L.A.? Has she called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t expect to hear from her. We said good-bye in L.A. She wouldn\u2019t let me ride to the airport with her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I promised her I wouldn\u2019t bug her at the spa. She\u2019s there to relax and think about her . . . priorities. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to talk to you, though. Give her a call and be sure to tell her I send my love.\u201d</p><p>Her uncle didn\u2019t know she was at Utopia. Avery was about to explain her last-minute decision to join her aunt but then changed her mind. She didn\u2019t want to get Tony upset over what she still hoped was just a colossal screwup.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t answer her phone, don\u2019t fret. She\u2019s probably just getting a massage or something.\u201d</p><p>The lobby was becoming crowded. A raucous and loud group of twelve came into the hotel. Avery put her hand over her ear as she asked, \u201cTony, were there any problems at work? Has the office called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you expecting trouble? I talked to Jeanie this morning. Everything\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cStar Catcher isn\u2019t going to fall apart in two weeks. When you talk to Carrie, tell her to stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later, Tony. Love you.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call and looked at Oliver. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to your manager.\u201d</p><p>Oliver looked offended by the request. He stiffened and his voice turned snippy. \u201cI assure you Mr. Cannon will tell you the same thing I just did. We\u2019re booked to capacity. It\u2019s a misconception to think that we hold back rooms. I\u2019ll be happy to assist you in finding suitable lodging in Aspen. Nothing will compare to Utopia, of course, but you could take advantage of our day spa treatments. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d enjoy our stress-relief hot-stone massage. It\u2019s quite invigorating.\u201d</p><p>His tone was grossly condescending. She wasn\u2019t interested in his damn massage. She wanted to find her aunt. Keeping her irritation in check was difficult, but she managed it. She had never used her job to get around obstacles before, and she wasn\u2019t about to start now, but the urge was nearly irresistible. Oh, how she would have loved to pull out her ID and flash it in front of Oliver\u2019s face. He\u2019d sure as certain stop being so snippy then, wouldn\u2019t he? She couldn\u2019t do it, though, because it wouldn\u2019t be honest, acting like a full-fledged agent when she actually worked in the basement keyboarding all day. Besides, it wasn\u2019t a real FBI badge, and anyone with half a brain would know it.</p><p>She suddenly realized she was projecting her frustration and anger on the innocent clerk. Oliver was simply doing his job. Maybe Carrie had lost track of the time. She might have met a famous movie star at the mountain retreat and didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>That had to be it. Her aunt was busy networking and had forgotten to call. Avery clung to the possibility because it was all she had. Her anxiety didn\u2019t go away, though. Why had Carrie canceled her reservation at the spa?</p><p>\u201cI really need to talk to your manager.\u201d</p><p>Oliver didn\u2019t move.</p><p>John Paul said quietly, \u201cDo as the lady asks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cannon went downstairs to the mailroom to see about a package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get him and tell him that John Paul Renard is back and wants to talk to him again. We\u2019ll wait in his office.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what John Paul said but how he said it that got Oliver moving. He stepped back from the computer, turned, and jogged down the corridor.</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t give Avery time to ask questions or argue. He started shoving her things back in her backpack, then grabbed her hand and pulled her along. \u201cCome on. I know the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle this, Mr. Renard. You don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me John Paul.\u201d He led her behind the counter, then down a long, red-carpeted hall.</p><p>She jerked away from him and dug in her heels at the door to the manager\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I want some answers,\u201d she demanded. \u201cFirst of all, exactly how do you know my aunt?\u201d</p><p>He had his own question. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your uncle that your aunt is missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to worry. I\u2019m not certain she is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where is she?\u201d</p><p>Good point. Carrie was probably drinking mimosas on top of a mountain somewhere having a fine old time. And making Avery nuts worrying about her. No, Carrie would never be so thoughtless. Something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is, but I\u2019m going to make some calls and find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she cancel?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe clerk said a woman called\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel must have screwed up our reservations. You don\u2019t need to hang around. If you\u2019d like to leave your phone number, I\u2019ll make sure Carrie gets it. She\u2019ll probably come strolling into the lobby any second now with some outrageous excuse.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe a word of what she\u2019d just told him, but she hoped he would buy it and go away.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait with you until she gets here.\u201d</p><p>She gave up. The man was more tenacious than she was. She would find out what his agenda was after she located her aunt.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she was sitting behind Mr. Cannon\u2019s art deco desk in his spacious wind tunnel of an office overlooking the serenity pool. The overhead ceiling fan was on low and making a clicking sound with each rotation. The noise reminded her of Mrs. Speigel. The sweet old woman made the same sound when she spoke because of her ill-fitting false teeth.</p><p>Cannon also had another fan perched on top of his black lacquered filing cabinet, but that one was going full speed. All the papers on his desk were weighted down with gold sphere-shaped paperweights.</p><p>\u201cCannon\u2019s taking too damned long. While you make your phone calls, I\u2019ll go find him,\u201d John Paul said. \u201cYou stay put.\u201d</p><p>Avery waited until he\u2019d left the office and closed the door before she dialed her home answering machine. She hoped Carrie had left her a message explaining her absence, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Then Avery tried her office voice mail, and there wasn\u2019t a message from her aunt there either.</p><p>Now what? In desperation she called the pen. Maybe, just maybe, Carrie had talked to Margo or Lou or Mel.</p><p>Margo answered the main line. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called, Avery. You\u2019re not going to believe this. I called your neighbor\u2019s caretaker like I told you I would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargo,\u201d Avery interrupted. \u201cYou can tell me later. I\u2019ve got a problem here, and I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to hear what I found out,\u201d her friend insisted. \u201cMrs. Speigel broke her hip.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s nerves were nearing the breaking point, but she knew that she was going to have to wait until Margo finished talking about Mrs. Speigel before she\u2019d let her get a word in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe broke her hip two weeks ago, and then she got pneumonia. She almost died,\u201d she added. \u201cBut Marilyn, the lady who takes care of her, told me the antibiotics are finally working, and it looks like she\u2019s going to recover. That\u2019s pretty amazing considering the fact that Mrs. Speigel is in her nineties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d She rubbed her brow as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? Mrs. Speigel couldn\u2019t have snuck her car out. She was in the hospital. Someone stole her car, and whoever it was was in such a hurry to get out of the parking garage, he or she almost hit you.\u201d Before Avery could comment, Margo enthusiastically continued. \u201cThe car was abandoned on M Street. It was illegally parked, so they towed it. Marilyn told me that it would break Mrs. Speigel\u2019s heart if the family sold her car. Even though she never drives it, she feels independent having it in the garage. Marilyn uses it to take the old lady on errands. Aren\u2019t you happy to know Mrs. Speigel wasn\u2019t trying to kill you?\u201d she added with a laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMargo, I need help. Stop talking for a minute and listen. My aunt\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>She filled her in on the information she had, then said, \u201cThere\u2019s a man here waiting to talk to Carrie. He won\u2019t tell me how he knows her or what he wants. He\u2019s the strong, silent type. Run his name through the computer, will you? There\u2019s something about him. His name is John Paul Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018There\u2019s something about him\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s a carpenter, but he doesn\u2019t look like one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a carpenter supposed to look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Margo. See if there\u2019s anything in the system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m typing in the name right now. Are you looking for parking tickets or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s got this air about him. When I first saw him across the lobby, I was sure he must be an actor, but later, I noticed the way he was watching the people coming and going. He might be . . . dangerous. I think he could be.\u201d She sighed dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m probably overreacting because I\u2019m so worried about Carrie. It isn\u2019t like her to take off like this. Just look up the name, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Avery. You think he\u2019s a criminal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You found something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy, did I. Your John Paul isn\u2019t a criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to work for the government. Wait, I\u2019m scrolling down. Whoa. Get this. His file is classified.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClassified?\u201d She wasn\u2019t prepared to hear that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to access . . . ah, here we go. I could lose my job for this, and so could you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just tell me what you see, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRenard was in the Marines. Honorable discharge,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was recruited while he was still a Marine according to the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecruited for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just says \u2018special branch operations.\u2019 There\u2019s a bunch of numbers and initials, but I don\u2019t know what any of it stands for.\u201d She read the information to Avery as she scrolled down. She stopped suddenly, then said, \u201cHe\u2019s taken a leave of absence.\u201d Then, a few seconds later, she sighed loudly into the phone. \u201cIt won\u2019t give me any more information. That\u2019s all I can get because I don\u2019t have the necessary clearance. Hold on. I\u2019m pulling up an old photo ID. Ah, here we go.\u201d She whistled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet serious,\u201d Avery said. She described John Paul to verify.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the same guy. He\u2019s from Louisiana. He has family there. His brother-in-law is an attorney for the Justice Department.\u201d She read a few more personal facts and then said, \u201cIt looks like he went on quite a few missions when he was a Marine. Wait a minute, here\u2019s something interesting. It says one of the missions involved rescuing some hostages in the Middle East, but get this, Renard carried out the assignment despite the fact that he\u2019d suffered a compound fracture of his left arm.\u201d Margo was silent as she scrolled through the rest of his record; then she said, \u201cBeyond the Marine duty, it won\u2019t tell me anything. Do you want me to go to Carter? The man intimidates me, but I\u2019ll do it if you want me to. I\u2019m sure he could get into Renard\u2019s file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t ask him. At least, not until I think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Margo asked. \u201cWhat does this Renard want with your aunt Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Listen, Margo, when Carrie called me from the Aspen airport, she said there was a driver there from the spa waiting to take her and two other women to a mountain retreat for the night. Carrie said the spa had trouble with a broken water pipe or something. The driver\u2019s name was Monk Edwards . . . or Edward Monk. I\u2019m not sure which. I know it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. I remember Carrie also said the driver had a British accent. Run the name through, and if you find anything, call me on my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many Edwardses there are in the United States?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk isn\u2019t such a common name, though . . . unless it\u2019s just a nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Margo said. \u201cGive me your room number at the spa in case I can\u2019t reach you on your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying at Utopia because my reservation was canceled. I\u2019m leaving anyway,\u201d she added. \u201cCarrie said she was staying in a house owned by the spa. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s still there. If she\u2019s not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t borrow trouble. Your aunt probably lucked into something much cooler than the spa. She\u2019ll get in touch with you. You\u2019ll see. And I\u2019ll get right on that search for a Monk Edwards or an Edward Monk.\u201d</p><p>Margo had just hung up the phone when it rang again. The call was from the department head reminding her that she still hadn\u2019t turned in her vacation forms. She spent ten minutes finding and then filling out the forms between interoffice business calls, then had to hand deliver the papers to Human Resources. She didn\u2019t get a chance to run the search for Avery until midafternoon.</p><p>After she typed the first name Avery had given her and hit the search key, she called out to Lou and Mel as they were heading to lunch and told them about Carrie. Each man had a theory as to what had happened to Avery\u2019s aunt. Lou was sure she went back to L.A.\u2014they all knew the woman was a workaholic and obsessive to boot\u2014but Mel thought she had probably hooked up with a business associate out in Colorado and called the hotel and left a message for Avery, but the spa had misplaced or erased the call.</p><p>\u201cI never get my messages when I stay in a big hotel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe probably found something better to do than sit in a mud bath all day and forgot about Avery,\u201d Lou suggested.</p><p>\u201cCarrie wouldn\u2019t be so thoughtless,\u201d Margo argued. \u201cShe and Avery are really close.\u201d She happened to turn back to her computer screen and noticed the alert flashing. \u201cWhat the . . .\u201d Scrolling down, she saw in big, bold letters, the priority code. She shouted to Mel and Lou again as she frantically read the information.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>Margo jumped up and started running to Carter\u2019s office.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>MR. TIMOTHY CANNON, DRESSED FOR THE TROPICS IN A white Palm Beach business suit, stepped into the office and introduced himself. He was a dapper gentleman with a soft, prissy voice.</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to locate your aunt yet?\u201d</p><p>Just then John Paul walked inside. Avery watched him shut the door and then lean against it. When he folded his arms, she noticed the faint scar, about two inches long, on his left forearm. How could she have thought he was an actor? How could her instincts be that off base?</p><p>She forced herself to focus on the manager. \u201cNo, not yet,\u201d she said. \u201cMay I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cannon sat down in the chair facing his desk, crossed one leg over the other, and began to straighten the crease in his pants with his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cDo you always send a staff member to the airport to pick up your guests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we certainly do. We don\u2019t want our guests to be inconvenienced by having to find transportation on their own or carry their luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you send a staff member to the airport yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Cannon smiled. \u201cI see where you\u2019re heading. You\u2019re wondering about the rash of cancellations, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s so unusual, you see, to have a last-minute cancellation at Utopia. The rooms are booked months in advance, but some of our more prominent guests do have last-minute schedule conflicts, and we try to be accommodating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by a \u2018rash of cancellations\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised by the question. He obviously thought she already knew about them. \u201cI had scheduled three separate pickups at the airport yesterday afternoon,\u201d he said. The guests were all ladies,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cOne flight, as I recall, arrived at three-fifty. Another came in at four-twenty, and the last was coming in at five-fifteen. I could check and tell you which time your aunt was scheduled to arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like the flight information, credit card numbers, and anything else you\u2019ve got on all three women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t give you that information.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, he could. And would, she thought. She didn\u2019t want to put the manager on the defensive yet. She had too many other questions she needed answered first, and Cannon was doing his best to be cooperative.</p><p>\u201cIf all three women were coming in within an hour or so of one another, why would you send three separate cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is Utopia,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe pride ourselves on excellent service. None of our guests should be expected to wait for another. That would be an inconvenience. So, you see, I was going to send three separate cars, but when all three guests canceled at the last minute, I notified the staff members not to make the trip. As it turned out, we had unexpected guests arrive at our desk last night, and they were thrilled that we had openings for them.\u201d</p><p>She filed the information away and immediately asked another question. \u201cDid you have a problem with a water main yesterday? Or a broken pipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater pipe problems? At Utopia?\u201d He scoffed at the notion. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any problems. We have an excellent maintenance crew here, and they anticipate problems before they arise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get your water from outside the spa. Did one of those pipes break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a mountain house . . . a retreat?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes Utopia own such a place in the mountains for guests to use when there is a problem?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cWe don\u2019t have problems at Utopia,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd the owners of Utopia don\u2019t have a mountain retreat. Clients who come to us stay with us. We don\u2019t parcel them out to other locations.\u201d</p><p>After he finished his explanation, he made a point of letting her see that he was checking his watch, then said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any other questions, I really must get back to work. Most of our clients who come for a week\u2019s stay are checking in today. It\u2019s going to become hectic. I wouldn\u2019t worry about your aunt,\u201d he added as he stood. \u201cI\u2019m certain she\u2019ll turn up soon.\u201d</p><p>He was blowing her off. Avery didn\u2019t budge from her chair. \u201cMay I have a list of your employees? All of your employees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a specific name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pride myself on knowing every one of my employees. Give me the name and I\u2019ll tell you if he or she works for Utopia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdwards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe name is either Monk Edwards or Edward Monk.\u201d</p><p>Cannon didn\u2019t show any reaction to the name. He simply shook his head. John Paul, however, reacted as though she\u2019d just thrown a fiery torch at him. He jerked away from the door and moved to the desk with the speed of light. Planting his hands on the blotter, he leaned toward her and demanded, \u201cHow do you know that name?\u201d</p><p>The look on his face gave her goose bumps. They weren\u2019t the good kind.</p><p>A chill of dread settled around her heart. \u201cHow do you know the name?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt called me from the Aspen airport. She left the message that she and two other women were being driven to a mountain house by a staff member from Utopia. She said his name was Monk Edwards. She also said the man had a British accent.\u201d Turning to Cannon, she asked, \u201cAre there any employees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a British accent? No, I\u2019m afraid not. Someone is playing a cruel trick,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not dispatch a driver to the airport yesterday. Perhaps your aunt was . . . misinformed.\u201d</p><p>John Paul picked up the phone on Cannon\u2019s desk and began dialing. He turned away from Avery and spoke in a low voice, but she still heard every word.</p><p>\u201cNoah, it\u2019s John Paul. Yeah, well, what can I tell you. Stop trying to interrupt and listen. I\u2019m at a spa called Utopia just outside of Aspen. Monk\u2019s back. Looks like he\u2019s taken on three this time. Must be going for some kind of a record.\u201d</p><p>Avery pushed the chair back and stood. She was reaching into her backpack when John Paul said, \u201cYou better call in the troops. We both know they won\u2019t find anything, but you should probably go through the routine anyway. It\u2019s too late,\u201d he added, his tone antagonistic now. \u201cHe\u2019s already got them.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and started for the door but stopped when she called out, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He kept walking. \u201cI\u2019ve called in some people who will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat people? The police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the FBI.\u201d He paused at the door. \u201cNoah\u2019s a friend of my brother-in-law\u2019s. He knows Monk real well. I\u2019ll let him explain it to you when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the FBI will be able to locate my aunt?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her that he thought her aunt was already dead and that the agents would eventually, with luck, be able to find the body . . . unless Monk had left her for the wild animals to dine on.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll mess it up.\u201d</p><p>She was taken aback by the venom in his voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause they\u2019re FBI.\u201d</p><p>She left it alone. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check out a couple of possibilities, but I doubt I\u2019ll find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>If she had a gun, she would have considered shooting him in the foot. He was such a jerk. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving until you tell me what you know about Monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, lady. There isn\u2019t anything I can do to help you now. I thought I had a head start, but I was still too late. I\u2019ve called in help for you, so just hold tight and let them try to do their job.\u201d</p><p>As he left the office, Avery turned to Cannon. \u201cI want the names, addresses, phone numbers, and any other pertinent information you have on those two other women traveling with my aunt . . . the two who canceled. If I don\u2019t get this information in the next two minutes, I swear to heaven I\u2019ll tear this place apart, and I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re arrested for obstruction. Now get me that information.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled out her FBI credentials and waved them in front of his face. Cannon blinked twice, then rushed to his computer to get what she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly irregular,\u201d he muttered as she grabbed her backpack, slung it over her shoulder, and went running after John Paul. \u201cHighly irregular.\u201d</p><p>Avery caught up with John Paul as he was walking past reception. The lobby was crowded with incoming guests now, and she had to cut around three separate groups to get to him. When she finally reached him, she grabbed hold of his upper arm and tried to make him stop.</p><p>The creep didn\u2019t even slow down. He just kept going, pulling her along as she held tight. She noticed he didn\u2019t walk around people. They got out of his way. She dug in and tightened her hold. If she\u2019d had long nails, she would have broken every one of them. His skin was warm, indicating he was human, but his muscle felt like rock.</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop? I need to talk to you.\u201d Then, when he still didn\u2019t slow down, she added, \u201cPlease, John Paul. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. She sounded as if she was going to cry. There wasn\u2019t a damned thing he could do for her, but she was too naive to know that. She\u2019d probably been sheltered from the real world all her life and couldn\u2019t possibly know how to cope. Like it or not, she was about to find out that life didn\u2019t always end happily ever after.</p><p>He felt sorry for her. Cursing under his breath, he finally turned to her. He thought about trying to soft-pedal the truth, but then decided she was going to have to deal with reality sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean when you said it was already too late? I heard you on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let the FBI explain. Do you have someone you could call to come and sit with you? Some family member or close friend who could take care of you?\u201d</p><p>Avery stopped abruptly. God, he was callous. \u201cYou think my aunt is dead, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately answer her, but the way he was looking made her think he was trying to judge if she was strong enough before he said anything. Was he worried she\u2019d become hysterical?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fall apart. Just answer me.\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think your aunt and the other two women are already dead.\u201d</p><p>She let go of his arm and stepped back. \u201cWhy? Why do you think that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone you could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall?\u201d she snapped. \u201cAunt Carrie and Uncle Tony are my only family, and I\u2019m not going to scare my uncle half to death the way you\u2019re trying to scare me until I have all the facts. Tell me how you know this Monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Delaney?\u201d</p><p>Oliver was calling to her. She turned and saw the clerk holding up a house phone and beckoning her.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be Margo, she thought. Her friend would have called her on her cell phone. Who then? Carrie . . . Maybe Carrie was on the line. Avery was suddenly so frightened, she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. Please, let it be Carrie.</p><p>She dropped her backpack as she sidestepped a couple. She was in too much of a hurry to pick it up. As she neared the counter, Oliver said, \u201cThe caller says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>John Paul followed with her backpack. He saw her grab the receiver, then heard her say, \u201cCarrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, darling girl. It isn\u2019t Carrie.\u201d</p> <p>Jarred by the endearment and the whisper-soft voice of the woman on the line, Avery asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I am isn\u2019t important at the moment, but your Carrie is, isn\u2019t she? We have her. Would you like to see her again?\u201d</p><p>The voice was muffled. Avery didn\u2019t think she had ever heard it before.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done with her? Is she all right? If you hurt her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid girl, be quiet and listen,\u201d the woman ordered. \u201cI\u2019m only going to say this once, so pay attention. Three lives depend upon your cooperation. I\u2019ve left a manila envelope on the counter with your name on it. It\u2019s right there, on your left. Ah, don\u2019t turn around,\u201d she said in a hushed croon that made Avery\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cIf you see me, all the rules will change and your poor, poor Carrie and her new best friends will have to pay the price.\u201d</p><p>Avery stiffened. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the voice answered. \u201cI\u2019m watching you. You want to look, don\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be a killjoy and ruin my game. Pick up the map, Avery. That\u2019s my girl. See the nice watch? Put it on. Now.\u201d</p><p>Avery picked up the man\u2019s Swatch athlete\u2019s watch and quickly slipped the band over her hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d the woman said. \u201cNow open the map and find the little red X I\u2019ve marked for you. Hurry now.\u201d</p><p>Avery propped the phone on her shoulder, opened the map, and began to search for the mark. She dropped the phone as she leaned forward, trying to see a glimpse of a face in the reflection of the shiny granite wall behind the counter.</p><p>John Paul reached around her and picked up the phone. She grabbed it from him.</p><p>\u201cClumsy girl,\u201d the voice chided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>John Paul watched Avery closely. The color had drained from her face, and she had a white-knuckle grip on the phone. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from putting his arm around her, concerned now that whatever she was hearing was going to be too much for her. He wasn\u2019t any good at comforting women\u2014he\u2019d actually never attempted it before\u2014but he felt obligated to try.</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that sweet,\u201d the voice was syrupy now. \u201cIs he your lover?\u201d</p><p>She was so rattled she couldn\u2019t think. \u201cYes . . . no.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Avery said the first thing that popped into her head. \u201cHe\u2019s an actor. He worked . . . works for Carrie in commercials. I\u2019ll send him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do that. He\u2019s in the game now, darling girl. By now he knows you\u2019re having trouble finding Carrie. We don\u2019t want him asking questions or calling the police. Besides, he\u2019ll have more fun on the treasure hunt with you. But no one else. You say one word to anyone, and we\u2019ll know it. From the time you hang up this phone, we\u2019ll be monitoring your progress. You\u2019re going to tell the manager Carrie called and everything\u2019s fine. Then you\u2019re going to take your cell phone out of your purse and drop it in the fountain on your way out of the hotel. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your boyfriend\u2019s cell phone. Let me see you do it.\u201d</p><p>She turned to John Paul. \u201cGive me your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>She repeated what he\u2019d said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying. It really doesn\u2019t matter, though. You won\u2019t be able to get a signal where you\u2019re going, but I still want to see you get rid of your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will. Is Carrie all right? Is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine . . . for the moment. Do what I tell you to do if you want her to stay that way.\u201d The tone of her voice turned hard and brittle, yet there was an underlying edge of excitement there as well. \u201cHave you found the red X?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow the directions I\u2019ve written at the bottom. You\u2019ve got exactly two hours to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s at least a three-hour drive from here. It isn\u2019t possible. It doesn\u2019t look like there are any roads once we get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said two hours,\u201d the woman interrupted. \u201cOne hundred and twenty minutes, Avery, and not one minute more. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what if we don\u2019t make it in time? What if we\u2019re late?\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed. \u201cBoom.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>THE WOMAN SOUNDED DEMENTED. SHE WAS LAUGHING AS SHE disconnected the line. Avery, shaken to the core, handed the receiver to Oliver, and as she did so, she leaned into the counter and, slipping her hand into her backpack, pushed the speed dial number that would connect her to the pen. She waited a second, then pushed the star to signal an alert. Cannon hurried toward her and dropped the printout of information she\u2019d demanded on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she said, her voice strained with what she hoped sounded like good cheer. \u201cThat was Carrie on the phone. It was all just a crazy mix-up. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us, John Paul and I are going for a ride.\u201d</p><p>She was trying not to let them see how frantic she was. She shoved the papers Cannon had placed on the counter into her backpack before he could snatch them back, grabbed her cell phone and the map, and sprinted for the entrance.</p><p>She glanced at each face she passed, but there were so many people loitering in the massive lobby, it was impossible to get a good look at all the women. Where were the phone banks? There were palms and huge ficus trees everywhere. The caller could be hiding as she watched Avery now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she shouted to John Paul before she realized he was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She rushed to the fountain, dropped her cell phone into the water, and then ran out the front doors and bumped into the bellman.</p><p>\u201cMiss Delaney, if you\u2019ll give me your room number, I\u2019ll take your luggage up\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she ran down the stairs and stopped in the middle of the circle drive as she tried to locate her rental car. Where was it?</p><p>John Paul lifted the black duffel bag from the luggage rack. \u201cThis one hers?\u201d he asked the bellman.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. See, her name\u2019s on it. Has she checked in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done with my car?\u201d she shouted at the same time.</p><p>She was running toward the valet stand when John Paul intercepted her. She wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere until he let her, and he wasn\u2019t going to do that until she told him what the hell was going on. She was shaking violently.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath and calm down. You aren\u2019t going to faint, are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, tell me what happened. Talk to me, damn it. Who was on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a woman. I didn\u2019t recognize her voice. She said they have my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re sure she said they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She was growing more frantic with each passing second. \u201cCarrie\u2019s in trouble, and I have to get to her before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the woman tell you to get rid of your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>Struggling to get away from him, she whispered, \u201cYes. Look, this isn\u2019t a prank. I could tell. She said that they would kill Carrie and two other women who are with her if we don\u2019t get moving. Please,\u201d she pleaded in desperation. \u201cYou have to go with me. She said you\u2019re in the game now. We have to hurry. She\u2019s given us two hours to get to a place she marked on the map, and I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll make it in time. It\u2019s so far away . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this is probably a trap, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve got to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she shouted, no longer caring who heard her. \u201cAnd once we\u2019re on our way, I\u2019m going to try to think of a way to stay alive and help Carrie. Listen to me. I don\u2019t have a choice. If it were your mother or your daughter, would you stand here analyzing the situation? I know you wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d do exactly what I\u2019m going to do. Play along and seize whatever chance you can. Now move it, Renard. Time\u2019s running out.\u201d</p><p>She was right. He would have paid the ransom or done anything humanly possible to keep someone he loved alive a little longer.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take my car.\u201d</p><p>Weak with relief because he wasn\u2019t arguing, she whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and ran to the parking lot, with her stumbling along behind him. His SUV was illegally parked in front of a walkway. There was a security guard standing beside the hood shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you the owner of this\u2014\u201d He stopped when he saw the expression on John Paul\u2019s face, then quickly backed away, stepping into a bed of pansies.</p><p>John Paul ignored him. He pushed the security button on his key chain to unlock the doors and tossed Avery\u2019s bag into the back with his gear while she ran around to the front passenger seat.</p><p>She had the map out and was pointing to the red X by the time he slid behind the wheel. \u201cWe\u2019ve got exactly two hours. No, one hour and fifty-seven minutes now, to get to this spot. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>John Paul studied the map for about ten seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be close,\u201d he said as he started the ignition.</p><p>\u201cBut we can make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d was all he would allow. \u201cYou navigate. Put your seat belt on.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t floor it until they were out of the parking area, but by the time they\u2019d reached the gate at the end of the long, winding road, he was going fifty.</p><p>Avery was leaning forward, rocking, as though that motion would help them get closer to their destination. She realized what she was doing and forced herself to sit back while she concentrated for the moment on giving him directions.</p><p>He sped down the highway. \u201cThere,\u201d she shouted when she saw the sign. \u201cTake the cutoff up ahead. It should be about a mile or so. You can stay on that two-lane for at least twenty miles, maybe thirty.\u201d Gripping her hands together, she watched the road until the turnoff came into view. \u201cSlow down. There it is. You\u2019ll miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>He took the blacktop road on two wheels. Avery braced herself with her hand against the dashboard. Didn\u2019t these things turn over all the time? That was all they needed, for John Paul to wreck the car. Carrie would be doomed.</p><p>Calm down, she told herself. We\u2019ll make it. We have to.</p><p>She looked down, saw the masculine Swatch watch half on top of her little Timex, and quickly removed it. After she examined the front and the back, she carefully placed it in the cup holder between them.</p><p>The road straightened ahead, and he glanced over. \u201cNow you start talking,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me exactly what she said.\u201d</p><p>She told him what she could remember, and then she said, \u201cShe was there watching us. I tried to find her on my way outside, but there were so many people milling around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not have been inside. Didn\u2019t you notice all the security cameras?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll she had to do was hook into their system.

She just sounded . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCreepy. She told me not to be a killjoy, called what she was doing a game.

Then there\u2019s Judge Sara Collins from Miami. It appears that all three reservations were made on credit cards. Each with a different name on it.\u201d She read the names to him.</p><p>\u201cDo the names mean anything to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t think Carrie\u2019s ever mentioned any of them, and I don\u2019t know how she would know them. Carrie and my uncle live in Bel Air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that was where you were from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while I was,\u201d she said. \u201cI live in Virginia now.\u201d She picked up the watch and checked the time again. \u201cCan\u2019t we go any faster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going close to eighty now. The speed limit is fifty-five. I just hope the highway patrol isn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, she hadn\u2019t thought about that. They would be delayed indefinitely if they were stopped.</p><p>\u201cSlow down then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake up your mind, sweetheart. Fast or slow? It\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make up the speed on the access road. Slow down for now.\u201d</p><p>He did. \u201cYou\u2019re sure the woman on the phone said, \u2018We have her\u2019?\u201d stressing the plural.</p><p>\u201cYou already asked me that, and, yes, I\u2019m still sure she said they have her. Why is that important?\u201d</p><p>He could barely contain his excitement. \u201cBecause just maybe Monk is waiting for you at that spot on the map, and that gives me a unique opportunity to kill the bastard. If I can figure out a way to get ahead of him . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t go on, but she noticed he increased their speed again. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to answer some questions,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you looking for Carrie? How do you know her?\u201d</p> <p>He had to confess. \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI know the man who . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho what?\u201d</p><p>He was going to say the man who killed her because, if Monk was continuing with his pattern, those three women were already dead and buried. He had changed one thing, John Paul acknowledged. He was obviously now working with a partner.</p><p>\u201c. . . who is after the women,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man calling himself Monk. I doubt that\u2019s the name on his birth certificate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know about him. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA professional killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d she asked sharply.</p><p>He repeated himself, and then he glanced at her face to see how she was taking the news. Not well, he decided. Not well at all. She was rapidly turning green.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna get sick?\u201d He asked the question without a bit of sympathy in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cRoll down the window and lean out if you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, even as she hit the button to automatically lower the window. She took a couple of deep breaths. The air was heavy with an earthy, musty scent. It made her want to gag. No, fresh air wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>A professional killer. My God, she thought.</p><p>She exhaled and tried to clear her thoughts. Deal with what you know as fact, she told herself. Think it through.</p><p>Anne Trapp. Sara Collins. Those two women were throwing a wrench in her analysis. What was the common denominator?</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a connection,\u201d she said, and as soon as the words were out of her mouth, she shook her head. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t assume that.\u201d</p><p>He concentrated on the road. He had increased the speed once again because there weren\u2019t any other cars around, and he was betting the highway patrol was busy monitoring the more congested areas. He eased up on the gas pedal when the needle hit seventy.</p><p>\u201cRoad ends in five miles.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the map. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just read the sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to take the access road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced at the watch for what had to be the hundredth time and saw that a full twenty minutes had passed. Then she measured the distance in her mind to the red X.</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cWithout good roads, it\u2019s going to be close. We might not make it, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWe have to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, here we go,\u201d he said as he swerved off the road onto an access. Gravel spit up over the tires and hit the windshield as he fishtailed up the winding road. It was only wide enough for a single car, and the branches of the evergreens scraped the sides of the SUV as it zoomed past.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction, and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, maybe farther up we\u2019ll hook into a better road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr no road at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly do you know Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. He\u2019s become a hobby of mine. He went after someone close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone hired him to kill this friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut she got in the way. It was my sister. He was hired to get some information she had, and he tried to kill her to get it. Fortunately, his plans got all screwed up, and he ended up going to ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been tracking him for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe man I called from Cannon\u2019s office also has a vested interest in Monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClayborne,\u201d he answered. \u201cNoah Clayborne. He\u2019s FBI,\u201d he added with a note of disdain.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call him that.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head as she studied him. What was his problem? He turned her attention then when he said, \u201cLike I said, Monk went underground for over a year. Couldn\u2019t find more than a hint of his work . . . until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know he was in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used a bogus credit card he\u2019d used before in Bowen . . . that\u2019s where I live,\u201d he said. \u201cBowen, Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the FBI knows he\u2019s in Colorado too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you tracked him with the credit card receipt, surely the FBI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about the credit card receipt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notify them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, that surly edge of hostility.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want them to screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI does not screw up investigations. They\u2019re experts and extremely efficient in their\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cSpare me the platitudes. I\u2019ve heard all the propaganda before. I didn\u2019t buy it then, and I don\u2019t buy it now. The Bureau has become too glutted with bosses all trying to break the backs of the agents working under them so they can get to the top. There isn\u2019t any loyalty these days. It\u2019s just dog eat dog. They\u2019re . . . bureaucratic,\u201d he added with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cynical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the side window. \u201cThank you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing with me. You could have refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you understand. I\u2019m not doing this for you or your aunt. I want to get Monk before he kills anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you have your own agenda, and you aren\u2019t doing me any favors. I understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand, though. How could anyone be that hardened? She found herself wondering if he ever went out of his way to help anyone in trouble. Probably not. He was the type of man who drove past accidents and stepped over heart attack victims.</p><p>They rode in silence for several minutes, and then Avery said, \u201cTell me what you\u2019ve learned about Monk. He must have a pattern. They all do.\u201d</p><p>He thought it was odd she\u2019d know about such things. \u201cActually he did have a pattern, but it\u2019s obviously changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has it changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk always kept a low profile. In and out as fast and as clean as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you admire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t admire him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying his pattern never varied much before. In the beginning, the murders he committed all took place within a two-week span every year. That didn\u2019t change for seven years. I have a theory about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he holds down a full-time job somewhere? That he\u2019s living two separate lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he used to,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMurder obviously pays a hell of a lot more, so I\u2019m guessing he probably quit his other job. Couldn\u2019t you just picture him sitting at his desk, diligently working. He would have been the nice guy. You know, the one who draws the chart for the football pools, and because he was so well liked, people would tell him their troubles. I\u2019ll bet you this, Avery. When he gets caught, the people he worked with will be shocked. They\u2019ll all say the same thing. Bob was such a sweet, charming man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was Ted Bundy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know the early murders were his work? Did he leave a card or something so he\u2019d get credit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe likes roses. He leaves a long-stemmed red rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s eerie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he used to be a nine-to-fiver, and killing people was his idea of a great vacation, but now he\u2019s strictly a professional killer . . . any time of the year. What else is different about him these days? You seem to have studied his work closely.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s never tried anything like this . . . taking three victims. He isn\u2019t a showman. And he\u2019s always acted alone before. Now it appears that he\u2019s hooked up with a woman. Maybe he\u2019s showboating to impress her.\u201d</p><p>They struck a bump in the road. Avery grabbed the dashboard again as the top of her head hit the roof.</p><p>\u201cAre we still headed north?\u201d It was impossible to tell. The trees hid the sky, and it was ominously dark in this stretch of forest.</p><p>\u201cNorthwest,\u201d he said.</p><p>She heard a scream in the distance. No, it was more like an animal\u2019s screech. The sound gave her chills.</p><p>\u201cHow does he get his contracts? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m guessing the Internet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s easy. It\u2019s anonymous, and up until now, he\u2019s been careful and discriminating in selecting his targets. He probably has enough work to keep busy for the next fifty years. You\u2019d be surprised how many husbands want their wives dead and how many wives would pay through the nose to get rid of their husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Tony had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she answered emphatically.</p><p>He let it go for the moment. \u201cYou said there had to be a connection between the women . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was analyzing what we know, trying to put it together. I made the assumption that one man or woman hired Monk to kill all three women, so that\u2019s why I was trying to think of something they all had in common. But my premise might not be valid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to allow for the possibility that three different people hired Monk, and that, for whatever reason, he decided to kill the victims all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He had to admit she was right. \u201cOne thing is certain. Monk was paid a hell of a lot of money to kill these women. He doesn\u2019t come cheap. If he has lumped them together, the real question is, who wants your aunt dead?\u201d</p><p>He expected her to immediately tell him what a sweet, lovable woman her aunt was and that she didn\u2019t have an enemy in the world.</p><p>\u201cLots of people dislike my aunt. Some, I would imagine, hate her.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for that. He actually smiled. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie can sometimes be . . . abrasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s in a cutthroat business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What business is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommercials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes commercials.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound harsh in the confines of the car.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d she continued, ignoring his reaction, \u201cnone of her business associates would go to such extremes to get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just am,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then that brings us back to your uncle Tony. How strong is their marriage? Any problems you know about?\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly feeling sick to her stomach. \u201cCarrie thinks Tony\u2019s cheating on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been seeing a marriage counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony loves Carrie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you know your uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as well as I should,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI went away to boarding school and was only home during the summer, and then I worked in Carrie\u2019s office. Still, I think I\u2019m a good judge of character. Tony would never be unfaithful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWives usually know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie isn\u2019t your typical wife. She\u2019s got a very suspicious nature. I think, deep down, she can\u2019t believe any man could love her. She\u2019s . . . insecure, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s often abrasive. She doesn\u2019t want anyone to see her vulnerability.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo that leads us right back to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they are separate contracts, and one person hired Monk to kill Carrie and me, then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>THE FIRST HOUR WAS A NIGHTMARE, AND THEN IT GOT WORSE.</p><p>The crazy woman had almost blown them to kingdom come. Anne\u2019s hand was on the doorknob when Carrie tackled her to the floor. She was so skinny she went down hard, and Carrie landed with a thud on top of her. Both of them were screaming. Carrie had her hands full, and it was impossible to get the woman to listen to reason. Twisting and turning, Anne tried to claw Carrie\u2019s eyes with her long, tapered, acrylic nails. She made it to her knees and nearly got away from Carrie when Sara grabbed her by her ankles and dragged her from the door.</p><p>As thin and frail as Anne appeared, her rage gave her almost superhuman strength, but fortunately it was quickly spent. Panting from exertion, Carrie kept the woman pinned to the marble floor by sitting on her spine. She held Anne\u2019s head down with both her hands pressed against the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cFind something we can tie her up with,\u201d Carrie shouted to Sara so she could be heard over Anne\u2019s screeching.</p> <p>Ten minutes later Anne was sitting in a chair at the round table in the breakfast nook. Her wrists were tied to the arms of the chair with two phone wires.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you treat me this way. You\u2019re not going to get away with this. You just wait and see. I\u2019m going to report you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie, exhausted, fell into the chair adjacent to Anne\u2019s. She covered her brow with her hand, her elbow propped on the table, and calmly asked, \u201cHow do you plan to do that, Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d Anne railed. \u201cI\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest. Use the phone. Oh, wait. You can\u2019t because the damn phone\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie turned to Sara, who was leaning against the counter, watching. \u201cIs she just on another planet? I think her mind\u2019s completely snapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Sara said. \u201cShock will sometimes make a person . . . irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are we going to do?\u201d Carrie whispered.</p><p>Sara pulled out a chair and sat down across from Anne. She folded her hands on the tabletop. \u201cNow, Anne, it won\u2019t do for you to continue to pretend that everything is all right. We\u2019re all in trouble here, and we need your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s immediate response was a glare. \u201cLeave me alone, you fat pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Carrie muttered.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Anne shouted at the top of her voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue to scream every word, Anne, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to gag you,\u201d Sara warned. \u201cAre you going to calm down?\u201d</p> <p>Anne\u2019s glare grew even stronger.</p><p>\u201cAnne, where\u2019s the letter that was left for you?\u201d When Anne turned her head away, Sara asked, \u201cAre you giving us the silent treatment now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a blessing?\u201d Carrie scoffed.</p><p>Sara leaned back in her chair, adjusted her silk robe to cover her gown, and said, \u201cYou know, Anne, if you didn\u2019t get a letter . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Anne snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen you could be an innocent bystander who just got caught up in our . . . dilemma.\u201d</p><p>Dilemma? Carrie was about to take issue with Sara\u2019s poor choice of words. For God\u2019s sake, they were sitting inside a bomb. But then she caught Sara\u2019s eye and decided to keep quiet when the older woman gave a quick shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Anne,\u201d she continued in a calm tone. \u201cAs a judge, I put away a good number of hardened criminals over the years. I had a reputation for giving harsh sentences, but in all of those cases, the men and women who came before me were career criminals. I don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d</p><p>Anne finally looked at Sara with icy disdain. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s important. Over the years there have been numerous threats against my life, but I\u2019ve never given any of them a second thought.\u201d</p><p>She went into the living room to get the letters she and Carrie had received. She returned to her seat at the table and read her letter to Anne. When she was finished, she held the paper up in front of Anne\u2019s eyes so she could see she was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think one of those criminals is making good on his threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I think. Either there\u2019s an ex-con behind this, or someone still in jail has gotten outside help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would an ex-con or a prisoner get the money to hire a killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares where he got the money,\u201d Carrie interjected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you, bitch,\u201d Anne hissed.</p><p>Sara raised her hand for silence. She didn\u2019t want Carrie\u2019s temper to trigger another tantrum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a valid question,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he got the money. Perhaps a relative came into an inheritance or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you put away an innocent man, and those relatives know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that might be how it happened.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was gritting her teeth to keep from interrupting. She wanted to tell both women that right now they needed to find a way to get out of the house, and then, once they were safe, they could speculate on the who, how, and why until the cows came home.</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s letter wasn\u2019t like mine,\u201d Sara said. \u201cHers was signed.\u201d</p><p>Anne looked intrigued. \u201cSo he wanted you to know how much he hated you before you died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018he,\u2019 \u201d Sara corrected. \u201cShe.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. Anne still wouldn\u2019t look at her, but Carrie didn\u2019t care about that. \u201cMy letter was written by my sister, Jilly.\u201d</p><p>The announcement so shocked Anne she couldn\u2019t continue her stony silence with Carrie any longer. \u201cYour own flesh and blood wants you dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Appalled, she asked, \u201cWhat kind of a family do you come from?\u201d</p><p>Carrie held her temper. \u201cDysfunctional, Anne. I come from a very dysfunctional family. My sister\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Anne said. \u201cWait a minute. Are you lying? I mean, if your sister is really crazy, why hasn\u2019t she been locked away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told years ago that Jilly died in a car accident. The funeral home wanted to send me her ashes. Jilly, it turns out, was much smarter than I thought. She\u2019s waited and planned all these years to get even with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I stole her child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jilly abandoned her when she was a baby. My mother and I raised her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your sister never came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, when Avery was five, Jilly came back with a sleazebag of a boyfriend named Dale Skarrett. She thought she could just waltz in and take Avery away. She\u2019d already used extortion to get money out of my mother. That\u2019s true,\u201d she said when Anne looked so appalled. \u201cMy mother had to pay to keep Avery. I was home when they came, and while I physically tried to shove Jilly out of the house, my mother called the police. When Dale Skarrett heard the sirens, he grabbed Jilly and took off. I moved to California the following morning. While I was off building a career, Avery stayed with my mother. Then, when Avery was eleven, Jilly sent Skarrett to the house to kidnap her. Avery wasn\u2019t going to go quietly. She fought him tooth and nail, and he used his belt to beat her within an inch of her life. She was so young . . . and helpless. I guess I sort of thought of myself as her mother, but when it mattered, really mattered, I wasn\u2019t there to protect her the way a mother should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother? Didn\u2019t she do anything?\u201d</p><p>Carrie looked down as she continued. \u201cThe police chief was a friend, and he had given mother a gun, taught her how to use it too. She was in the backyard and didn\u2019t hear the screaming until she came into the house. My mother had become hard-of-hearing,\u201d she added. \u201cFrom what the police were able to ascertain, mother tried to shoot Skarrett. She must have given him warning because he grabbed Avery just as she fired. The bullet struck my niece.\u201d</p><p>The words came out in a monotone, but there were tears in her eyes. \u201cI left an old woman to take care of my niece, knowing that Jilly was out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you couldn\u2019t have anticipated . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I did know what Jilly was capable of,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mother?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cShe suffered a massive heart attack. She was dead by the time the police got to the house, and Avery was hanging on by a thread. I caught a flight from L.A. to Jacksonville. By the time I got there, Avery had already had surgery and was in ICU. The first thing the doctor told me was that Avery would recover, but he didn\u2019t give me time to rejoice because he said she wouldn\u2019t be able to have children. A hysterectomy at age eleven. That has to be some kind of record,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>Sara looked startled, and Carrie assumed she was reacting to her morbid account of that awful day.</p><p>\u201cThat poor child,\u201d Anne said. She sounded genuinely compassionate.</p><p>\u201cI remember her,\u201d Sara whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carrie all but shouted.</p><p>Sara nodded. \u201cThe names . . . there were so many over the years; it isn\u2019t possible to remember all of them. And I didn\u2019t remember Avery until you mentioned the hysterectomy at age eleven. I\u2019ll never forget reading the transcripts of the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cWhy would you read the transcripts? Judge Hamilton was the judge at the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Hamilton died before the sentencing date. He had a massive stroke, and the case was given to me. I\u2019m the judge who sentenced Skarrett, and he has every reason to want me dead. I gave him the maximum.\u201d</p><p>Astounded, Carrie sat back. \u201cSo there\u2019s the connection between the two of us. Dale Skarrett . . . and Jilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJilly was never charged with any of it, was she?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proof to go after her. Besides, she had vanished,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was Avery\u2019s sole testimony that got Skarrett convicted of second-degree murder. A few weeks after his sentencing, I got a call from a funeral home in Key West asking me what I wanted done with Jilly\u2019s ashes. That\u2019s how I found out she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept she isn\u2019t dead,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she definitely isn\u2019t. I saw her in living color last night,\u201d Carrie said emphatically. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t aged much at all. She\u2019s still beautiful . . . and still frickin\u2019 nuts.\u201d</p><p>Sara went to the kitchen cabinet and took down a cup and saucer.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to have a daughter, but my husband didn\u2019t want children. He convinced me that it would cramp our lifestyle,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your lifestyle?\u201d Sara asked as she poured the hot coffee.</p><p>\u201cWork. Just work. I felt guilty about that,\u201d she confessed. \u201cAnd so I gave in to my husband on all the little things.\u201d</p><p>Anne considered having children a little thing? \u201cI see,\u201d Carrie remarked.</p><p>\u201cEric is ten years younger than I am,\u201d Anne continued. \u201cBut age never mattered to him. He loves me very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken over operations. You know, the mundane office managerial tasks, and he\u2019s so clever. He found a new health insurance carrier with a group rate that was less than half of what we had been paying.\u201d</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t understand why Anne wanted to talk about this now. Sara untied Anne\u2019s left hand and placed the cup of coffee in front of her. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any milk,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found some sugar if you want it sweetened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t put up with the nonsense a second longer. The two were acting as if they were at a tea party. \u201cWhat the hell are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a way to get out,\u201d Sara said. \u201cWe\u2019re three smart women. We should be able to think of something.\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t seem at all interested in that topic. \u201cSara? What did you mean when you said I could have been an innocent bystander?\u201d</p><p>Sara refilled her cup and sat down. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a letter on your nightstand . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Anne rushed to assure her.</p><p>\u201cThen I think I know what happened. Your plane landed just a few minutes before mine did, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t you tell us that you were irritated because the driver from the spa was waiting for me at my gate, but there wasn\u2019t anyone waiting for you? In the car you said that, if you hadn\u2019t seen the man holding up the sign for Utopia, you would have had to carry your own luggage and get a taxi.\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded. \u201cYes, I certainly do remember, and I was extremely put out. I\u2019m still going to register a complaint with the manager. There should have been a driver waiting for me at my gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherefore,\u201d Sara continued as though Anne hadn\u2019t gotten sidetracked, \u201cperhaps you weren\u2019t meant to be part of this. However,\u201d she hastened to add before Anne could interrupt, \u201cthe fact remains that you are going to die when this house blows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we did?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>Anne shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d Carrie demanded. \u201cDo you honestly think we deserve to die like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Anne said. \u201cYou must have done something pretty awful to make your sister so mad, and, Sara, you might have sent an innocent man to prison.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had thought that Anne was going to be sensible, but her comments indicated she was still in Lala Land.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why he brought me here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you saw his face,\u201d Carrie muttered. \u201cHow could you have run a business? You ask such stupid questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d Anne took a dainty sip of her coffee after making the childish remark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you like me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, this isn\u2019t getting us anywhere,\u201d Sara interjected. \u201cAnne, the killer couldn\u2019t leave you behind. You had also met me, and if you had gone to the spa, you would have complained to the management, and that would have signaled an alarm . . . since they obviously didn\u2019t send a driver to the airport.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou also could have given a description of the man to the police. It was much too risky for him to leave you behind,\u201d Carrie explained. \u201cAnd you could have told the police where he was taking us,\u201d Sara added.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he lied about where we were going. He lied about everything else, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Sara asked. She suddenly looked weary, and her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t lie about that.\u201d</p><p>Both Sara and Carrie frowned at Anne. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Carrie asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I saw the sign. It was a tarnished brass plaque in the center of the iron gate. The driver pushed the button on that remote control gadget, and I read the sign as the gate was swinging open. Land Between the Lakes. So he didn\u2019t lie about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very observant of you,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cFor all the good that does us,\u201d Anne said. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cOh, my God, I did tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Sara asked.</p> <p>\u201cI called my niece from the airport. I was in the ladies\u2019 room, and I remembered I had my cell phone in the pocket of my blazer, so I called her. Her voice mail picked up and I left a message telling her where we were going to be spending the night. What a fool I am. I went on and on about the famous guests who had stayed here before. Monk\u2014if that is his real name\u2014must have done his research.\u201d Tears flooded her eyes as she whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s why he was telling those stupid stories about movie stars. He knew I\u2019d be impressed. I\u2019m such a shallow fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe played all of us,\u201d Sara said. \u201cDid you tell your niece the name of the property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carrie answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she got the message because she might have already left for the airport. What if he was there waiting for her?\u201d Her voice broke on a sob.</p><p>Sara reached across the table and patted Carrie\u2019s hand. \u201cIf he had been waiting for her, wouldn\u2019t he have driven her here? Maybe that\u2019s what they\u2019re waiting for,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t what?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cKilled us,\u201d Sara said bluntly.</p> <p>\u201cBut you said they left us food in the pantry and in the freezer, so they obviously want to keep us alive a little while longer,\u201d Anne argued.</p><p>Sara disagreed. \u201cThe food . . . that\u2019s what\u2019s so alarming. Doesn\u2019t it seem more frightening to you that they didn\u2019t empty the cabinets?\u201d</p><p>Carrie hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but now she agreed with Sara. \u201cI think that means they\u2019re going to blow the house soon. They\u2019re not going to let us sit in here until it\u2019s all gone. They left the water on too,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201d She buried her face in her hands and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to Avery. If that monster has her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on finding a way out, Carrie, so that you can help your niece.\u201d</p><p>Anne straightened in her chair and nodded. \u201cAs long as you both agree I\u2019m innocent, I\u2019ll help and I won\u2019t do anything crazy, like opening a door. I promise, but you have to say it.\u201d</p><p>Carrie lifted her head. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>Anne straightened in her chair. \u201cThat I\u2019m innocent.\u201d</p><p>She was, of course, implying Sara and Carrie weren\u2019t. It was infuriating, her holier-than-thou attitude, but Carrie caught Sara\u2019s nod and decided she had to get along with Anne if she wanted her cooperation. \u201cYes, you are innocent,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After Sara concurred, Anne turned to Carrie. \u201cYou should try to make amends with your sister, fix the wrong you did.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how Carrie hated the woman. She held her tongue as Anne preached on. \u201cFamily is the most important thing of all. I recently learned that truth. Being able to lean on someone . . . like my husband when times get difficult . . . that\u2019s very important. I\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy husband adores me.\u201d</p><p>She was excited when she turned to Sara. \u201cHe\u2019ll sound the alarm. My husband calls every single day. He\u2019s never missed. I told him not to bother while I was at the spa because I\u2019d be doing all those treatments, and it would be difficult for him to get hold of me, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. He said he couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night unless he talked to me. So don\u2019t you see? If we can just wait it out, my husband will have the police tearing Colorado apart looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t wait,\u201d Carrie objected.</p><p>Sara shook her head at her for losing her cool. \u201cYou sound like you have a wonderful marriage,\u201d she told Anne.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. We\u2019re blissfully happy.\u201d There was a note of defiance. \u201cAnd he will search for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Sara placated. \u201cBut we might not have time to wait for the police to find us. Colorado\u2019s a big state.\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. We have to help ourselves. All right,\u201d she said as she untied the cord around her right arm. \u201cWhat can I do? I don\u2019t know that I can be much help because I\u2019m just getting over a long bout of illness. I\u2019ve lost weight, and I don\u2019t have my strength back yet. I\u2019m an excellent cook, though. I could fix us something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d Sara said. \u201cThank you, Anne.\u201d</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t as trusting. Maybe Anne had come to her senses. Then again, maybe she was simply playing them. The stakes were too high to trust her. Carrie decided that either she or Sara had to keep an eye on the woman at all times.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone hungry now?\u201d Anne asked as she stood.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t seize the opportunity to make a sarcastic remark about Sara\u2019s weight this time. In fact, she apologized for what she had said earlier, and damn if she didn\u2019t sound sincere.</p><p>\u201cI never should have called you a fat pig. I was overwrought, but that is a poor excuse for hurting your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara, why don\u2019t you stay here and keep Anne company while I search the house again,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI\u2019ll start at the top and work my way down. I\u2019ve got to be missing something.\u201d</p><p>She was actually beginning to feel a little optimistic as she ran up the stairs. She hurriedly dressed in her designer sweats and then methodically rechecked each opening. There was a tiny window high up in the corner of her bedroom. It took her a long time to move the bureau over to the wall and then climb up, but she still wasn\u2019t tall enough. She ran downstairs to get one of the dining room chairs. She noticed Sara was standing on a chair in front of the double-pane living room windows. She had a lipstick and was printing the word \u201chelp\u201d across the glass.</p><p>Carrie stopped her. \u201cIf Monk, or whatever the hell the bastard\u2019s name is, has put a triggering device outside . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t have to finish her thought.</p><p>\u201cThe house will blow when help arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Carrie said as she lifted the chair and started back up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d Sara said. She got off the chair and went to get a towel to wipe off the letters she\u2019d just written.</p><p>\u201cWhat about trying to cut through the glass?\u201d Carrie heard Anne ask as she continued on up the spiral staircase.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s arms ached from the exertion of lifting the chair on top of the bureau. It took her three tries, and she was panting because she was so terribly out of shape. She fell trying to climb to the top, but fortunately, she landed on the bed. She propped the chair against the wall and tried again. When she was finally able to reach the window, she burst into tears. The son of a bitch had wired that tiny little egress too.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t give up, no matter how hopeless their situation was. Maybe Anne\u2019s suggestion would work. Maybe they could cut through the glass without disturbing the wires. Wiping the tears from her eyes, she gingerly scraped her diamond ring against the sliding glass door. Fifteen minutes later she stopped. All she had managed to do in that time was make a small scratch on the glass.</p><p>Carrie walked down a flight to the next level and proceeded to examine Anne\u2019s room and then Sara\u2019s. She spent hours trying one thing and then another before she finally gave up. She\u2019d wasted the afternoon and part of the evening on the impossible.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>JILLY WALKED AROUND THE STONE BENCH NESTLED IN THE grotto facing the serenity pool. She paused to watch an instructor dressed in white tai chi clothing lead his students in an ancient exercise. The teacher was quite graceful, but his students were obviously novices, and their movements were stiff and awkward.</p><p>She continued on to where Monk had parked the all-terrain Mercedes. Flowers were in full bloom wherever she looked. There were even large patches of flowers along the back parking lot. Utopia was enchanting, and perhaps when this business was concluded, she could come back here for a full week of pampering.</p><p>Her phone rang just as she slid behind the wheel of the new car. She had been waiting for Monk to call from his satellite phone, and she answered before the first ring ended.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling.\u201d</p><p>Monk smiled. He loved the sound of her throaty voice and the way she whispered the endearment. \u201cHas she arrived yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve just sent her on her way, and I\u2019m leaving now. I\u2019ll take the shortcut you found for me, and I\u2019ll be there a good forty minutes ahead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy talking to your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was lovely,\u201d she gushed. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid. Thank you, darling, for letting me do this. There is one little worry, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cWho was with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man,\u201d she answered. Adjusting her phone against her ear, she started the car and pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cHer lover, no doubt,\u201d she speculated. \u201cI had to include him because he knows that Carrie is missing. He went into the manager\u2019s office with Avery. Did I do the right thing? Did I?\u201d</p><p>He knew she needed reassurance. \u201cYes, of course you did the right thing. Did you happen to get his name? Do you know anything about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI thought about asking the clerk or the manager, but then I decided to wait and talk to you first. Do you want me to go back and find out who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d only draw attention to yourself. You\u2019re so beautiful, people will remember you . . . and you do look like Avery. I\u2019ll find out who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. Are you ready for both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe river store is open, and business, I\u2019m afraid, is booming. It\u2019s been busier than a 7-Eleven since early morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou checked. The owner was mauled by a bear and won\u2019t get out of the hospital for at least another week. You checked,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>She was becoming upset. He hurriedly tried to quiet her fears. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cBut how can the store be open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner\u2019s cousin from Arkansas opened the store this morning. The owner must have called him. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWe\u2019re simply going to plan B. You remember, I told you I always have a contingency plan in mind whenever I take on a new assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she said, relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re so clever, darling.\u201d</p><p>The least little praise made him want to please her all the more.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cThe package with Carrie\u2019s red scarf. Is it still there on the counter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d he said. He had already thought the matter through. The original plan had been to lure Avery into the store by placing a large manila envelope with her name on it on the counter by the window so she would see it when she looked inside. She would be desperate and break in. Monk would be waiting for her, and after he had killed her, he would bury her in the forest about a hundred yards behind the store. He\u2019d already gone to the trouble of digging her grave. The hole was deep enough to accommodate her lover as well, he supposed, but now that the store was open and there was a steady stream of customers coming and going, Monk knew he couldn\u2019t kill them there.</p><p>\u201cDo you have Carrie\u2019s wallet with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s in my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he praised. \u201cWe\u2019ll use it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get to help? You promised me,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>How could he deny her? It would have been so much easier if she\u2019d agreed to stay at the spa and let him do his job. Jilly complicated his life, made him scramble to get everything done the way she wanted it done, but she was such a joy to be with, he didn\u2019t mind. He had tried to talk her into blowing up the house before they left it last night, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. She wanted her sister to wake up and know who was killing her and why.</p><p>Monk didn\u2019t like leaving the women, but he couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and Avery\u2019s unexpected arrival had thrown him a curve. He hadn\u2019t let Jilly know how unsettling and worrisome those last-minute changes were, but now that he\u2019d worked it all out in his mind, he was feeling in control again. He wished he had more time to go over the plan, but that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>\u201cDarling, did you hear me? I get to help, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his concerns aside.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you can help. How would you like to talk to Avery again?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, I\u2019d love to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hurrying to you. I\u2019m already turning onto that little road you found. I won\u2019t be long. When I get there, you have to tell me exactly what you want me to say to her. I don\u2019t want to mess up again like I did in Virginia when I took that old woman\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now. Don\u2019t fret about that. It\u2019s water under the bridge. Besides, you\u2019re a rookie,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cYou were bound to make a few mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to please you, and I thought that, if I could immobilize her, I would make your job so much easier for you. You could have broken into her apartment and killed her there. I thought you could make it look like a robbery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had been over this topic at least ten times, and each time he tried to reassure her that he had forgiven her misjudgment. She never should have gone after Avery with that car, not only because of the danger to herself, but also because she very well might have killed her. Jilly had been so proud of her careful research. She\u2019d done her own surveillance, discovered the dusty old Cadillac was owned by a woman who never drove it, and had been so clever in the way she\u2019d gotten into the apartment and stolen the keys. She\u2019d had fun too, dressing up as a policewoman collecting for the widows\u2019 fund.</p><p>Still, Jilly hadn\u2019t thought the plan through. When he gently pointed out that if she had killed Avery, Carrie certainly would have canceled her vacation plans, Jilly was mortified. Now she always checked with him first so that she wouldn\u2019t do anything rash. He liked the way she looked up to him, trusted him to know what was best.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at our designated spot. Now, here\u2019s what I want you to do,\u201d he began.</p><p>She listened, growing more excited as he explained the details. When he was finished, she giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, darling. Absolutely perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>HIS NAME IS DALE SKARRETT,\u201d AVERY SAID, \u201cAND HE\u2019S IN prison now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cFlorida,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe came up for parole a couple of years ago, and Carrie and I went to the hearing. We each spoke to the board, and they listened to what we had to say. We\u2019re the reason he didn\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he has a real good reason for wanting both of you dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>She hated bringing those memories back to the surface. It made the wounds fester again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d she said, buying herself time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d he calmly repeated.</p><p>She turned away from him to stare out the window. \u201cHe murdered my grandmother,\u201d she answered. She anxiously looked at the watch. \u201cWe have twenty-three minutes left to get to God only knows where. What should we be looking for?\u201d</p> <p>He knew she was trying to make him focus on the problem at hand so that he wouldn\u2019t ask her any more questions. Eventually she would tell him what he wanted and needed to know if they were going to get through this alive, but he didn\u2019t press her now for the grim details. Like she said, they had only twenty-three minutes to go.</p><p>\u201cWe look for anything that doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>They were still climbing higher and higher as they wound around the mountain. Avery had lost her sense of direction, but thankfully, John Paul hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Sunlight was streaming in through the branches again, and the area wasn\u2019t quite as thick with evergreens. She thought they were getting closer to an open area or a summit. Would they be sitting ducks?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get nosebleeds if we keep climbing. Are you cold?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was. He\u2019d noticed her rubbing her arms a minute ago. He reached over and flipped on the heater. Avery immediately adjusted the vents so the hot air would blow on her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she meant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the woman said \u2018boom.\u2019 I keep picturing those women tied to chairs with explosives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re inside something that\u2019s wired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are caves and old shafts around here, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hundreds of them.\u201d</p><p>She checked the time again. \u201cTwenty-one minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of the time,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go any faster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. She realized her frustration and fear were misdirected. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to criticize. I know you\u2019re doing the best you can.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to her then that she didn\u2019t know much about the man she had so eagerly jumped into the car with. No, that wasn\u2019t true. She knew enough to trust his ability. He had proven himself capable when he was in the military. Hopefully, the skills he\u2019d learned would come in handy, if he still remembered them.</p><p>She decided to find out. \u201cWere you any good at what you used to do before you took a leave of absence?\u201d</p><p>The question jarred him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in the military.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sharp look. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a friend look you up in the computer where she works.\u201d</p><p>She waited for a reaction. She was ready with a good reason for invading his private life if he asked. He didn\u2019t, though. In fact he didn\u2019t say anything for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook you up? When I was in the manager\u2019s office at the spa. You had left to go find Cannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a background check on me.\u201d He seemed to be having trouble believing her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>The glare he cast her should have scalded her face. \u201cWhere does this friend of yours work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuantico.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. He didn\u2019t take the news well at all.</p><p>\u201cSon of a . . .\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Marine,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>She watched him take a breath and knew he was trying to keep his temper under control. Oh, yes, he was angry; his neck had turned pink. It didn\u2019t matter to her, though. She had done what she had to do, and he was going to have to deal with it.</p><p>The muscle in his jaw flinched. Lord, he was good-looking. The thought came out of nowhere. Jeez, Avery, get a grip. For all she knew, the man could be paying alimony to eight ex-wives. She quickly discounted the Henry VIII notion right away. There couldn\u2019t possibly be eight women in the United States willing to marry him. No way.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Marine,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She had to grab hold again when he swerved to avoid a tree trunk. There were deep ruts in the dirt from other cars or trucks that had ventured up this road, but it was so isolated, so . . . quiet she was a little unnerved. She felt completely out of her element. She was a big-city girl who fell asleep to the music of car horns and police sirens. The silence now seemed almost deafening.</p><p>Swarms of gnats scattered as they hit the windshield. Avery picked up the watch and checked the time again. Seventeen minutes left.</p><p>John Paul kept glancing over at her. She thought he expected her to finish what she\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cSo that was good to know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarines are trained in combat, and that could be helpful.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond to her observation. \u201cI also found out you were recruited by covert\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cLook, I know what I was. You don\u2019t have to go into it.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She had been hoping he would finish for her and tell her what she didn\u2019t know. Had he been in special ops or covert operations? And what exactly had his expertise been?</p><p>She looked at the map while she gathered her gumption. She couldn\u2019t find out unless she asked, could she?</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour file was classified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would bet so.\u201d</p><p>There it was, that snide tone of voice again. \u201cDid they teach you to be obnoxious, or were you born that way? You\u2019ve got that alienation thing down pat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he looked over at her again. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in spite of his bad mood. Maybe he didn\u2019t scare her. Interesting, he thought. And different.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the two of them are together? Monk and the woman who called me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If the missing women are still alive and if he\u2019s tied them up or hidden them somewhere that\u2019s really isolated, then he could be with her. He\u2019s got a lot going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the women are still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to keep his eye on them. And he has to follow us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s following us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s tracking us, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked. He already knew the answer, but he was curious to know if she had figured it out.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of device inside the watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows exactly where we are.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. The killer was monitoring their progress. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get rid of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that. I think we should use it to our advantage. Let\u2019s wait and see what happens when we get near the X.\u201d</p><p>Avery picked up the watch and looked at it carefully. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single scratch or mark on it to indicate someone\u2019s tampered with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk\u2019s a professional. He wouldn\u2019t leave any marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he knows all about transmitters? He understands that technology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read his file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI file?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cIf you\u2019re on leave, that\u2019s got to be illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, you could get into serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>She sounded worried about him. She was just chock full of surprises, and what a piece of work she was turning out to be. If he didn\u2019t watch out, he would start to like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got connections who could bail me out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike your brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know about Theo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen my friend pulled up your file for me, she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a relative working in the Justice Department comes in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like your brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>What an odd question. \u201cSure I do. My sister loves him, and they\u2019re happy together. Why would you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sneered the words \u2018Justice Department.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He smiled. She was a quick study. \u201cI didn\u2019t sneer.\u201d</p><p>She decided not to argue with him. \u201cDo you think the woman who called me hired Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think so. From what you said about her, he\u2019s letting her call the shots. I think she might be more like a partner. It\u2019s so damn odd. Monk never played games before. So why the treasure hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might catch a break if the woman is making some decisions. Maybe she isn\u2019t quite the perfectionist he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s someone who knows Carrie and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way she talked. Her tone was mocking when she said Carrie\u2019s name. She doesn\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means she\u2019s interacted with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called me stupid. I\u2019ve got to assume she doesn\u2019t like me either,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just that Skarrett has told her about us. But the way she talked . . . it sure sounded like this was personal to her.\u201d</p><p>Avery picked up the Swatch watch again and then gingerly placed it back in the cup holder. She could almost visualize a red light inside, pulsating like a heart. The image creeped her out.</p><p>John Paul was a good driver. She decided to let him worry about getting stuck in the mud and nicking a tire on a rock. Closing her eyes, she leaned back and let her mind move from one possibility to another. What was she missing? She felt as though she had the answer to this crazy puzzle in the back of her mind, but she couldn\u2019t quite reach it.</p><p>\u201cHow much time\u2019s left?\u201d As soon as she told him, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to barrel into, so listen up. You do whatever I tell you. If I tell you to get down, don\u2019t argue. Just do it. Once I figure out where the X is, I\u2019m gonna try to bypass it some way and then circle around. You\u2019ll stay in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? Of course I have to,\u201d she argued. \u201cThe woman said they would kill Carrie and the others if we\u2019re late. If I don\u2019t show my face . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid this woman offer you any proof that they\u2019re still alive? Did you ask for any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have, but I didn\u2019t. The conversation was short, and she wouldn\u2019t let me ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should have said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I wouldn\u2019t play her game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would have done.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. But, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t ask for proof. I should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have, could have . . . it\u2019s too late now. I figure we\u2019ve got a ninety percent chance of walking into a trap, so I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t have a choice. I have to show. I\u2019m hoping I can figure out a way to placate the madwoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlacate a madwoman? That\u2019s a contradiction, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smart . . .\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cSmart ass? Is that what you were going to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>She became defensive. \u201cLook, if you want to bail, that\u2019s fine with me. Just get me to the X and take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she replied, irritated she\u2019d sounded so relieved. \u201cI know there\u2019s a good chance Monk has already dug our graves, but if you think I\u2019m going to hide in the woods and hope for the best, then you\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to say is that, if I\u2019m lucky, maybe I\u2019ll spot him and be able to get close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to worry about me. You want blind obedience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo heads are better than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much survival training have you had?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Point taken. \u201cNone, but I could still help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of the attitude, John Paul. I can help. I have a few moves of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>She was doing a slow burn. Out of all the people in the world, she had to get stuck with the most obnoxious one. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve got me all figured out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Avery concentrated on the road. Thankfully, Jungle Boy didn\u2019t have any other sarcastic remarks to make. His scowl could have been chiseled in stone.</p> <p>She thought she heard something, quickly rolled her window down, and strained to listen. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>John Paul flipped off the heater blower, rolled his window down, and then nodded. The sound of running water was faint, but there. \u201cWe went farther than I thought if we\u2019re close to the river. Maybe it\u2019s a tributary. It sounds like a waterfall.\u201d</p><p>They came to yet another crossroad. This one was traveled more than the last. And there was a sign nailed to a tree: Last Chance Country Store. Beer and Raft Rentals. Below the sign was an arrow pointing to the west.</p><p>The road curved downward. They hit a deep rut and lurched forward as they once again broke through the trees.</p><p>\u201cThe store\u2019s got to be around the bend down there,\u201d he said as he shot across the road and up into the trees on the other side. There was just enough room to turn the car around. Satisfied that they were concealed from the road, he put it in park and turned the motor off.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have left?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwelve minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think that\u2019s the spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be the place. It sticks out, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He was right. Please, God, let him be right. She could just make out a small rustic building through the trees. It sat on the bank of a river and was a place where river travelers could stop for supplies.</p><p>He unhooked his seat belt, reached under the seat, and pulled out a SIG Sauer. When she saw the gun, her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving the keys,\u201d he said, ignoring her reaction to the gun. \u201cIf you hear gunshots, you get the hell out of here. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to leave him, but she thought he\u2019d want to argue if she told him the truth, and so she simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs it loaded?\u201d she asked as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Stupid question, she thought. Of course it was loaded. \u201cBe careful.\u201d She moved into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cHand me the watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to leave it here with you and let Monk know exactly where you are? Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo hunting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>TIME HAD RUN OUT. AVERY HAD JUST DECIDED TO GO AFTER John Paul when he opened her door. She never heard him coming. \u201cMonk isn\u2019t close. He could be on his way, but he isn\u2019t here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we driving down or walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled back into the passenger seat, bumping her knee on the dashboard. He slid in and started the engine.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he isn\u2019t hiding behind a tree or a bush somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I looked. There weren\u2019t any signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have seen them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I would have seen them.\u201d</p><p>She was reassured by his arrogance. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a trailer behind the store about thirty yards to the south, and next to it is an old beat-up truck. No one was inside the trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went in?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThere\u2019s a man and a woman inside the store. The woman\u2019s in the back office using the phone, and the man\u2019s in front, working the counter. He keeps looking out the window like he\u2019s expecting company. While I was there, a milk truck pulled out and another guy was unloading cases of beer. There are three or four customers.\u201d</p><p>He drove onto the road and continued down the slope. His gun was in his lap.</p><p>\u201cDo you see that man looking at us?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe\u2019s on the right by the door.\u201d</p><p>They watched a young couple herd their two little boys out the front door, then saw the man inside slam the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d John Paul muttered when the man turned the sign over in the window. \u201cClosed, my ass.\u201d</p><p>He parked close to the side of the building so that she would be protected when she stepped out. He turned the motor off, slipped the keys into his jeans, and as he sprinted around the hood of the car, she saw him tuck the gun into his waistband.</p><p>They heard rap music blaring as a car pulled into the parking lot. John Paul went to the corner of the building and looked out front. Four young men in their late teens piled out and stood laughing and guzzling their beers. On top of the old Chevy were two kayaks roped to the roof.</p><p>John Paul motioned to Avery to stay put, retraced his steps, and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna check out the back again.\u201d</p><p>He let the man at the window watch him walk into the woods, then circled around, swung over the railing at the back door and looked inside. The woman was hunched over the desk, still talking on the phone.</p><p>Even though she was much too young, she reminded him of Ma Kettle from the old movies he used to watch on television when he was a kid. Dressed in dirty overalls and a muted plaid flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up, she was rattling off numbers into the phone as she turned the pages of a Sharper Image catalog. She didn\u2019t notice him watching her. He stepped back as the swinging door opened. A man poked his head in the room and braced the door with his hand to keep it from hitting him.</p><p>\u201cChrystal, we got us a problem,\u201d he said in a thick hillbilly accent. \u201cThere\u2019s two cars out front now. Four drunks just got out of one car. They\u2019re most likely stoppin\u2019 to stock up on more beer, I expect, but I\u2019m most worried about that gal in the other car. She\u2019s gonna be knockin\u2019 on the front door any second now. I think maybe she spotted me peekin\u2019 out the window at her \u2019cause that car she was in is parked on the side of the building now. Think she\u2019s the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hang on a minute, hon?\u201d Chrystal said into the phone. She turned in the swivel chair and frowned at the dark-haired man. \u201cMost likely she is, but I\u2019m not finished with this catalog yet, and you promised me I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cMaybe she ain\u2019t the one. Maybe she just needs to use the facilities. There was a big fella with her, but he went off into the woods to find his own facilities, I expect, like those four drunken boys. One of them is peein\u2019 on the petunias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy here, Kenny? If that gal wants to use our facilities, you make her buy something first, and don\u2019t let her wander back here. I\u2019ve still got a good ten pages to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t think about doin\u2019 that earlier. Had to wait till the last minute, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>John Paul went back to the entrance and was on the porch by the time Kenny unbolted the door.</p><p>Avery slipped around the corner of the building and ran to stand next to him. He pushed her behind him. He was being protective, and she didn\u2019t mind. She was so worried that they might not be in the right place, she couldn\u2019t think about anything else.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you read the sign? We\u2019re closed,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Avery stepped to John Paul\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cThen you got to buy something first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You got to buy something, and after you pay, I\u2019ll let you use the facilities.\u201d</p><p>Kenny was snarling at her like an attack dog. He was a thoroughly unpleasant looking man with blue-black dyed hair and bushy brown eyebrows. He wore a dark plaid shirt tucked into his faded black jeans. His gut hung down over his belt.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d he asked when she didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna budge until you agree.\u201d</p><p>He changed his mind when John Paul stepped forward. If Kenny hadn\u2019t gotten out of the way, he was sure the big man would have walked right over him.</p><p>Up close, Kenny was much younger than John Paul had estimated. He couldn\u2019t have been more than thirty-five or forty years old. He was also agile. He warily kept his eye on John Paul and hurried around the counter as though the barrier would protect him.</p><p>Planting his big hands on the counter, he leaned toward Avery and smiled. One of his eyeteeth had a gold cap that gleamed in the sunlight streaming in through the dirty window. \u201cAll right, little lady. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m gonna do. Since you\u2019re so pretty, I\u2019m gonna break the rules for you. You don\u2019t have to buy nothin\u2019. Nothin\u2019 at all. The bathroom\u2019s right over there,\u201d he said, pointing to the door in the far corner.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy name\u2019s Avery Delaney, and this is John Paul Renard. Has anyone come in here asking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, a little too quickly.</p><p>He was lying. All the telltale signs were there. He couldn\u2019t look her in the eye, and he was becoming more and more agitated by the second. Hostile too. He kept glancing up at John Paul as he shifted his weight from foot to foot.</p><p>The door crashed into the wall when it was thrown open. Avery and Kenny turned to see who was coming inside, but John Paul kept his attention on Kenny. He wasn\u2019t going to trust the bastard for as much as a second.</p><p>Three of the four boys sauntered in and staggered to a stop when they spotted Avery. She could hear the fourth boy. He was leaning over the porch railing throwing up.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d one of them called out. Another tried to whistle, but he couldn\u2019t get his lips to work. Spit sprayed out of his mouth instead.</p><p>Two of the boys were obviously brothers, for they looked alike and sported identical eagle tattoos on their forearms. The oldest-looking one of the group had a scraggly goatee and a pierced eyebrow with a silver ring.</p><p>\u201cThe store\u2019s closed,\u201d Kenny shouted.</p><p>\u201cNo, it ain\u2019t,\u201d Goatee said. \u201cYou let them in,\u201d he added, pointing to Avery and John Paul. \u201cWe only want some beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, beer,\u201d one of the brothers parroted.</p><p>They staggered toward the cooler against the back wall. One of them tripped into a display of cans and sent them careening everywhere. Goatee thought that was hilarious.</p><p>Kenny wasn\u2019t amused. He looked as if he wanted to kill someone. \u201cYou pick up every damned one of them cans and put them back like I had them. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>A brother snickered while Goatee gave Kenny the finger.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my store,\u201d Kenny bellowed. He turned his wrath on Avery next. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t gonna use my facilities, and you ain\u2019t gonna buy nothin\u2019, then maybe you folks ought to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about phone calls?\u201d she asked, sounding as desperate as she was feeling. \u201cHave you gotten any calls for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>One of the brothers was standing about three feet away from Avery and was fixated on her as he swayed on his feet. His stare was unnerving.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned stupidly at her, then lunged with both arms outstretched with the obvious intent of hugging her.</p><p>John Paul was about to pull Avery into his side, but she was already moving. She lashed out at the drunk with a kick that was quick and effortless. Her foot struck him square in the stomach and sent him flying into the wall. He hit with a loud thud, slid down, and landed on his butt.</p><p>She pointed a finger at him. \u201cYou stay there.\u201d</p><p>And still the stupid grin remained on the drunk\u2019s face. He was too far gone to feel any pain.</p><p>She turned her attention to Kenny again. \u201cMay I use your phone?\u201d Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Goatee and the other brother coming around the corner. Each of them had two six-packs of beer and a bag of ice. She didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cOver there, both of you. Sit down next to your friend and be quiet until I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>Goatee shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do, sweet cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a phone,\u201d Kenny muttered at the very same time.</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d John Paul asserted as he stepped toward Kenny.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Mark?\u201d the other brother asked.</p><p>Goatee strode forward, thinking he could elbow his way between Avery and John Paul.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d John Paul drawled a scant second before he sent Goatee sailing headfirst into the wall. He dropped the beer and the ice on top of Mark, then fell down next to him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to tell the third drunk to join his friends. He staggered over, put the beer down, and sat. Leaning back, he opened one can and took a long swallow.</p><p>Kenny realized John Paul was looking at the phone on the counter. \u201cWhat I meant to say is that we got a phone. Of course we do, but it ain\u2019t workin\u2019. Line\u2019s down and it takes weeks and weeks to get a repairman to come all this way. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re sittin\u2019 out in the middle of nowhere.\u201d He was talking so fast the words were tripping over each other.</p><p>Kenny could see John Paul wasn\u2019t buying it, and so he turned to Avery. The phony smile was back. \u201cYour mister have a problem?\u201d As he continued to smile at Avery, he slowly reached underneath the counter.</p><p>He looked down and too late realized he never should have taken his eyes off John Paul. He heard a click and jerked up to find the barrel of John Paul\u2019s gun pointed at his forehead.</p><p>\u201cNow hold on. No need for that,\u201d Kenny stammered.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, we need this man\u2019s cooperation,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is how we get it,\u201d he replied. \u201cKenny, turn around and put your hands on the wall behind you. Avery, get his gun from under the counter.\u201d</p><p>She walked around the counter and immediately spotted the Magnum on the shelf underneath. She slowly picked it up and then checked it. The weapon was loaded and ready. She engaged the safety, noticed a box of cartridges, and grabbed that too. She put both in a plastic sack with a picture of a squirrel on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with a Magnum? Do you have a permit?\u201d she asked Kenny.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your damn, nosy business.\u201d</p><p>The good-old-boy fa\u00e7ade was gone now. True colors were finally spewing out. Kenny\u2019s face twisted with rage as he snarled, \u201cI can refuse service to anybody I want to, and if I want to keep a loaded gun on the premises, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. Can I turn around now? I\u2019m getting a crick in my neck. You can use the phone. I was just . . . worried you was gonna make a long-distance call, and my cousin George, he\u2019s the man who owns this place, well, he would see the bill and then he\u2019d say to me, \u2018Kenny, you\u2019re gonna pay for this.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere is George?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>\u201cHe got hisself attacked by an old brown bear. He didn\u2019t know she was there until he saw one of her cubs,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cCan I turn around now and put my hands down? You can see I\u2019m cooperatin\u2019 and you got hold of my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>Avery was heading for the phone when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a lady\u2019s billfold sticking out between two sales slips in the trash can next to the cash register. She leaned down to pick it up. Then she caught her breath. It was a new, black Prada billfold. Carrie owned everything Prada made.</p> <p>Kenny was watching John Paul. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna rob me, you might as well know I don\u2019t have much cash. Maybe two one-hundred-dollar bills and forty some in change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the hundred-dollar bills?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cA customer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to rob you,\u201d Avery said. She opened the billfold, saw that it was empty, and held it up for John Paul to see. \u201cI think this belongs to my aunt.\u201d</p><p>Kenny grabbed her from behind. He wrapped his big arms around her in a bear hug and lifted her up so he could use her as a shield. His arms were like bands of steel, but his chest was soft, almost mushy.</p> <p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>Kenny was trying to duck down behind her so John Paul couldn\u2019t get a clear shot. \u201cNot till your mister puts that gun down.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was surprised Avery wasn\u2019t frightened. If anything, he thought she looked put out. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAvery, you\u2019ll have to change your clothes.\u201d</p><p>That remark got her full attention. She stopped squirming and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m gonna get blood all over you when I blow this mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cKenny, I know this billfold belongs to my aunt, and I don\u2019t care that you took the money. But you\u2019re going to have to tell me where you got it. Now let go of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he snarled close to her ear and tightened his hold.</p><p>His fingers were interlocked around her waist. She took hold of one of his little fingers and jerked it back hard. At the same instant, she lowered her chin, then slammed the back of her head into his face. She heard a crunch as he gasped in pain and let go.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she whispered. Damn it, that hurt. She stepped away from Kenny and rubbed the back of her head as she walked over to John Paul. Not as simple as it looked in the movies, she thought. Lesson learned.</p><p>She noticed the incredulous look on John Paul\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His smile was slow and easy. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes in exasperation and looked at Kenny, who was leaning into the counter. \u201cI need to know where you got that billfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belonged to my wife, Chrystal. She got tired of it and tossed it in the trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop lying. This is a matter of life or death,\u201d she said, her voice hostile now. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if you took any money out of the billfold,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut I need to know where you got it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just told you . . .\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to admit anthing. Avery\u2019s initial panic had dissipated as soon as she\u2019d spotted the billfold because now she knew she was in the right place. The tightness was still in her chest, however, and she was becoming infuriated over the man\u2019s uncooperative attitude.</p><p>Kenny\u2019s nose was bleeding. He held a Kleenex against his nostril and squinted at her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sue you, bitch. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, I think you\u2019re going to have to shoot him after all,\u201d she said.</p><p>Kenny didn\u2019t seem worried until John Paul asked Avery, \u201cHow about the kneecap?\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, Kenny had become a true believer. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we opened up this morning, me and Chrystal found a package with her name on it.\u201d He pointed to Avery. \u201cIt was just sittin\u2019 there on the counter, so Chrystal decided to have a look inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Avery prodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd it was just a red scarf. It had a perfume smell to it Chrystal didn\u2019t care for, so she stuffed it back in the envelope and tossed it in the trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the billfold?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was gettin\u2019 to that,\u201d he said, resentment brimming in his words. \u201cA woman came in just a little bit ago. She held up a brand-new hundred-dollar bill in exchange for that package with the scarf, and we took it, of course. Then she grabbed another manila envelope from our shelf. Just helped herself to it. She turned around so we wouldn\u2019t see what she was doin\u2019 and put that billfold inside. After she sealed it, she wrote your name on it and told us she\u2019d give us another hundred if we\u2019d promise to tell you that she was gonna call and for you to stay here until she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you opened the envelope as soon as she left?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not that second. It nagged at Chrystal, though. She just had to have herself a peek inside, and when she saw the billfold filled with money, she helped herself. Anybody would\u2019ve done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t waste time arguing ethics with him. \u201cWhat exactly did the woman with the hundred-dollar bills say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you what she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her again,\u201d John Paul ordered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna call you. That\u2019s what she said. She told me she knew just about the time you folks would be coming into the store and said you was supposed to wait until she called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t going to tell us any of that, were you?\u201d John Paul said. \u201cYou were going to send us on our way and never mention the billfold or the woman.\u201d</p><p>Kenny didn\u2019t answer. He shrugged and then said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much money in the wallet. Just a bunch of twenty-dollar bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly worth getting your nose broken?\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I should have told you, and now I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cWhen my wife gets off the phone, I\u2019m sure that lady will call. You\u2019re just gonna have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your wife?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>John Paul answered. \u201cIn the back office.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm when she started in that direction. \u201cDo you know how to use a gun?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him and hurried to the back of the store. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot anyone, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She took the warning to heart. When she reached the swinging door, she slowly pushed it open and looked inside. A woman was sitting with her back to the door. She was bent over with the receiver to her ear as Avery quietly walked forward. She heard the woman say, \u201cNo, I want five of them. That\u2019s right. Five. Now the last item is number A3491. The silver stereo with all them CD holders. I want eight of them. No, make it ten. That\u2019s it, hon. Are you ready for my credit card number? What? Oh, my name\u2019s Salvetti. Carolyn Salvetti. I\u2019ll be using my American Express card to pay for all this merchandise, but I want them shipped to my Arkansas home.\u201d</p><p>Avery was furious. She came up behind the woman and snatched the phone from her hand. Chrystal lurched out of her chair, sending it crashing into the wall. \u201cWho do you . . .\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>Keeping her eye on Chrystal, Avery spoke into the phone. \u201cCancel the order. She\u2019s using a stolen credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chrystal shouted as Avery hung up the phone. \u201cYou got no right to come barging in here. No right at all. This is my private office. Now give me that phone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Kenny are going to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on there a minute. We didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 wrong.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal\u2019s eyes were set a little too close together and her moon-shaped face was twisted in anger. Not pretty, Avery thought as she watched her step forward threateningly. Her brown eyes darted back and forth like a cornered rat\u2019s as she considered her options. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to call the police.\u201d</p><p>The woman towered over Avery and outweighed her by a good sixty pounds. When a sudden gleam came into her eyes, Avery knew what she was thinking, that her size gave her the advantage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>\u201cThis is private property,\u201d Chrystal half shouted. And then she lunged.</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t need to defend herself. She simply stepped to the left and watched as the large woman fell on top of the desk. Her precious catalog ripped open and flew to the floor.</p><p>What a klutz. \u201cBehave yourself,\u201d Avery scolded like a teacher disciplining a child with a harsh warning. \u201cNow get up and go into the store. Move it,\u201d she shouted when Chrystal didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s driver\u2019s license and all of her credit cards were on the desk, except the American Express card. She saw Chrystal slip the card into her pocket. \u201cYou just don\u2019t give up, do you? Give me the damn card.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal threw it at her. Avery caught it in midair and then nodded toward the swinging door again.</p><p>Chrystal shoved the door open and hurried ahead. She tried to push the door back in Avery\u2019s face, but Avery used her foot to block it.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Chrystal growled. Then she saw Kenny and took her wrath out on him. \u201cI told you we\u2019d get into trouble, but you wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>John Paul slipped his gun into the back of his jeans and then looked at Avery, waiting for an explanation. She took a step closer to him as she said, \u201cChrystal was doing a little early Christmas shopping with my aunt\u2019s American Express card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they a pair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another good reason I\u2019m never going to get married,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any need to get the police involved,\u201d Chrystal muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about the police, Chrystal?\u201d Kenny demanded. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to go and bring them into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, you old goat. Blondie did,\u201d she added, pointing at Avery. \u201cAnd all this is your fault, Kenny. If anyone\u2019s gonna go back to jail, it\u2019s gonna be you. I already got one strike against me. Didn\u2019t I tell you you shouldn\u2019t let me open that package? Didn\u2019t I?\u201d she screeched like an irate hen. \u201cYou made me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your trap,\u201d Kenny told her.</p><p>Chrystal finally noticed her husband\u2019s condition. He was sitting on the counter, swinging his legs back and forth while he held a torn Kleenex to his nose. She gave John Paul the once-over too. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d she demanded. \u201cAnd why are you pickin\u2019 at your nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t pickin\u2019 nothin\u2019. That gal behind you broke my fuckin\u2019 nose. I\u2019m gonna get me a lawyer and sue her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom jail?\u201d Chrystal bellowed. \u201cYou moron. You aren\u2019t gonna sue nobody.\u201d</p><p>John Paul had about had it with the happy couple. He went to the front door and stood to the side looking out. The teenager who had been throwing up was now curled up on the porch sound asleep.</p><p>\u201cStop arguing,\u201d Avery demanded. She was a little surprised that Kenny and Chrystal actually obeyed her.</p><p>\u201cNo reason to scream at us, missy. You can see we\u2019re cooperatin\u2019,\u201d Chrystal said.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re cooperating. Where\u2019s the envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the one the billfold was in?\u201d Chrystal asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw it in the trash by the facilities,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was just the billfold, but I\u2019ll get it for you so you can see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She took her sweet time crossing the store and returned a minute later with the yellow envelope. Thrusting it at Avery, she said, \u201cSee. It\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>Kenny\u2019s nose had stopped bleeding, and he tossed the Kleenex toward the wastebasket behind him but missed. \u201cI told you everything that gal said to me, but she was pretty chatty with Chrystal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She sure was chatty. She told me you folks were goin\u2019 on a treasure hunt. Kinda\u2019 old to be playin\u2019 games like that, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>Avery was close to pulling her hair out in frustration. These people were driving her crazy. \u201cWhen she came in, did you see her car? Was there anyone waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a nice new Mercedes,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t nobody inside it. Just the gal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you where she was sending us?\u201d</p><p>Her obvious anxiety gave Chrystal a surge of power. She said snidely, \u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>Chrystal rubbed her fingers together, the universal sign for money. Avery didn\u2019t have the patience to negotiate.</p><p>\u201cThe woman left instructions too, but Kenny and me aren\u2019t sayin\u2019 another word until you make it worth our while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, John Paul. We\u2019re back to doing it your way. You may shoot one of them. That should get the other one talking.\u201d</p><p>He liked the way she thought. The gun was out, the safety off less than two seconds later.</p><p>\u201cGot a preference?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Chrystal put her hands up. \u201cHold on there. No need for violence. Kenny and me is peace-lovin\u2019 folks, aren\u2019t we, Kenny? We\u2019ll tell you what you want to know. The woman said a gal would be comin\u2019 in. Said the gal\u2019s name was Avery.\u201d Turning to her, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re her, aren\u2019t ya? You got to be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What else did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019d be callin\u2019 and that you\u2019d be leavin\u2019 in a hurry, but she was sure wrong about that, wasn\u2019t she? I mean, you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Kenny snorted. \u201cThey can\u2019t be leavin\u2019 in a hurry until after she calls, you twit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, I really want to shoot these people. Put them out of their misery,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>She understood how he felt. \u201cPut the gun away, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>The second he lowered the gun, Chrystal cheered up and managed a smile. \u201cKenny, they\u2019ll need supplies for where they\u2019re headed. You carry what they want out to their car while I total it up in my head.\u201d Turning to Avery she asked, \u201cYou got cash on you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need supplies,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou want directions to where she\u2019s sendin\u2019 you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avery understood. In other words, buy the damn supplies. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be givin\u2019 them no discounts, Chrystal. And no credit cards. These folks ain\u2019t gonna live long enough for the receipt to go through.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal nodded. \u201cThe woman\u2019s sending you to a fiver.\u201d</p><p>What in God\u2019s name were they talking about? Then Kenny said, \u201cDon\u2019t know how you think you\u2019re gonna do the river. Since all the rain we\u2019ve been having, only fools would try to raft it. You\u2019re gonna drown before you make it over the first rapids.\u201d The possibility so tickled him he chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t matter how experienced you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, hon,\u201d Chrystal said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get yourself drowned, all right. Now, that gal said you\u2019d see a sign with writing on it and you\u2019d find what you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for right by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you what\u2019s on the sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward\u2019s Crossing. All the locals use that name too, for that little area where you can look down at the river if you\u2019re too afraid to go in. Years ago, there used to be a rope bridge, which is why they called it a crossing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to hike to get there,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cI know the lay of the land \u2019cause I\u2019ve been comin\u2019 up here ever since I was a boy, and there ain\u2019t no path up there.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal didn\u2019t agree and began to argue with her husband.</p> <p>Avery reached for the phone and then stopped. One quick call to Margo, she thought, to tell her where she was and what was going on. Should she chance it?</p><p>Kenny finally won the shouting match, and while Chrystal sulked, he gave Avery detailed instructions on getting to Coward\u2019s Crossing. She pulled the map from her pocket and asked Kenny to mark the area.</p><p>John Paul had two plastic sacks full of bottled water and food. He grabbed two more protein bars, shoved them into the smaller sack, and headed to the car. Kenny hopped off the counter to chase after him just to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to try to drive away without paying.</p><p>Avery grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down Margo\u2019s number. \u201cChrystal, I want you to drive to another phone and call this number. Tell whoever answers that I was here and where I\u2019m headed. There\u2019s a lot of money in it if you make the call,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut don\u2019t use this phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive thousand dollars.\u201d She said the first figure that popped into her head. \u201cAnd when we capture the man we\u2019re after, there will be twice that amount, and you\u2019ll get all of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow much exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen thousand.\u201d The lies were getting easier.</p><p>Chrystal looked suspicious. \u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t gonna help yourself to that money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m FBI,\u201d she said. \u201cMy ID is in the car. Would you like me to go get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have guessed it,\u201d she snorted. \u201cYou bein\u2019 so bossy and all. You don\u2019t have to show me your badge. I believe you. You got that FBI look about you, and that fancy karate move you did on me in the office got my suspicions up. I should have paid attention to the warnin\u2019 bells goin\u2019 off in my head.\u201d</p><p>What fancy move was she prattling about? All Avery remembered doing was stepping out of the woman\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very astute of you,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me again about that money. Would it be fifteen thousand in all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal squinted at Avery. \u201cAnd you\u2019re saying all I got to do is make that call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and will you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chrystal cut her off. She\u2019d glanced at the number on the paper and blurted, \u201cWait a minute. This here is a long-distance call. Can I reverse the charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it, but I got to tell you, I still don\u2019t get it. You could use the phone right there,\u201d she said, pointing to the counter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t waste time telling Chrystal she couldn\u2019t take the chance the line might be tapped. \u201cYou just can\u2019t use this phone. Wait about twenty minutes, then get in your pickup and drive to the nearest phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you pay for the gas?\u201d</p><p>Avery felt like screaming. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>John Paul had just walked back inside the store when the phone rang. Avery flinched at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably her,\u201d Chrystal said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten a single call since we reopened the store this morning, so that\u2019s got to be her. Want me to answer it?\u201d</p><p>Avery grabbed the phone and answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cYou were late,\u201d the caller said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t. We were right on time. The woman you left the package with was using the phone when we arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was.\u201d</p><p>Avery then knew she had been monitoring the line. Thank God she hadn\u2019t tried to call Margo.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the directions to where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want to talk to Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do I know she\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie is alive . . . for now anyway. It\u2019s up to you to keep her and her friends that way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more questions,\u201d she hissed. \u201cOr I\u2019ll hang up the phone right now. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a lovely treasure hunt, and you\u2019re winning points as you move along. The prize is Carrie. You do want to see her again, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so eager to please. You\u2019d better hurry, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry now.\u201d</p><p>The woman disconnected the call. Avery\u2019s heart was pounding. She put the phone down as Chrystal asked, \u201cWas it her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cChrystal, describe her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you want to know what she looked like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was older than you, but not as old as me, and not as heavy as me. Kenny?\u201d she shouted, \u201cHow old would you say that woman was?\u201d</p><p>Kenny walked inside. He scratched his stubbly jaw while he considered his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Never could judge a person\u2019s age real good. She sure was a looker, though.\u201d</p><p>Chrystal nodded. \u201cHad yellow-colored hair, and it\u2019s kind of funny really, you askin\u2019 me what she looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . \u2019cause . . .\u201d Chrystal shrugged. \u201cShe kinda looked like you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>CHRYSTAL TOLD KENNY THEY WOULD RECEIVE A BIG REWARD if he drove to town and made a call for Avery. Kenny didn\u2019t believe his wife, and he didn\u2019t want to do it. Avery thought it might be because his nose had started bleeding again.</p><p>Unlike Avery, John Paul wasn\u2019t interested in trying to coax them into cooperating, because he understood how their twisted pea-sized brains worked. He had had enough of the Bonnie-and-Clod pair. He shoved Kenny into the wall and calmly told him that he would hunt him down and skin him alive if he didn\u2019t do what Avery asked. Simple as that. Kenny believed him, and so did Chrystal. The look in John Paul\u2019s eyes indicated he wasn\u2019t the type of man to make idle threats.</p><p>Chrystal jumped back when John Paul walked past. She knocked the phone off the counter and quickly picked it up. Instinctively putting the receiver to her ear to make sure no one else was on the line, she hung up and said to Kenny, \u201cThe phone isn\u2019t workin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sayin\u2019 the line\u2019s dead?\u201d Kenny gasped the question, still trying to recover his breath.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I just say it was broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did it,\u201d Kenny decided, glaring at Avery. \u201cShe must have broke it after she finished talkin\u2019 to that woman and hung up. You saw her slam it down, didn\u2019t you, Chrystal? You\u2019re gonna have to pay for repairs,\u201d he told Avery.</p><p>Avery picked up the phone to see if Chrystal was telling the truth. The line was dead. That was quick, she thought. They must have been ready.</p><p>John Paul stood by the door waiting to get Avery\u2019s attention. \u201cAvery . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d She walked over to the teenagers sprawled out on the floor. Two of them were curled up like cats, sound asleep, but the droopy-eyed boy named Mark was still sitting upright and watching her every move with the stupid grin still plastered on his freckled face.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>She nudged his foot. \u201cWho\u2019s driving the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the car keys.\u201d</p><p>The grin didn\u2019t falter. \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d he slurred even as he dug into his pocket and pulled out his key ring. He dangled the keys in front of his face. Then he giggled.</p><p>She snatched the keys out of his hand and tossed them on the counter. \u201cChrystal, you make sure those boys don\u2019t get into that car. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be a baby-sitter. You expect me to stand here and watch them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them sleep outside, but don\u2019t give them the keys.\u201d She turned to leave, but John Paul raised his hand for her to stop.</p><p>\u201cMore customers,\u201d he said. He glanced out the window and watched two older women, dressed in hiking clothes, get out of a Ford. He pushed Avery\u2019s hand away from the doorknob. \u201cYou\u2019re not going with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I am,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou go back to town with those women and get to a police station. Keep the gun just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you go ahead to Coward\u2019s Crossing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If I can get there quick, I might be able to find a good spot to ambush him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf you kill him, we won\u2019t be able to find Carrie and the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman knows where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll disappear, and you know it. It\u2019s too risky. Besides, if Monk or the woman finds out I\u2019m not with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to take me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s too dangerous for you, and you\u2019ll slow me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to follow you. Kenny gave both of us the directions. I can find Coward\u2019s Crossing. I\u2019ll take the teenagers\u2019 car. Simple as that, John Paul.\u201d She poked him in his chest. \u201cYou need me to get him. Now get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to waste any more time arguing. He decided he\u2019d have to find a place to dump her on the way. Someplace safe. Yeah, that\u2019s what he would do.</p><p>He opened the door. \u201cYou stay close,\u201d he whispered as he stepped back so the gray-haired women could come inside.</p><p>The ladies walked right past the teenagers and didn\u2019t seem to notice them when they headed for the facilities, as Kenny so quaintly called the bathroom.</p><p>Avery turned back to Chrystal, who, at this point, was the more agreeable of the two. \u201cHow long do you think it will take to get to Coward\u2019s Crossing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna make it before nightfall,\u201d Chrystal answered. \u201cWhat with all the rain, those little roads got all washed out.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was opening the door but paused when Kenny shouted, \u201cHey, wait a minute. You ain\u2019t gonna take my gun, are you? I\u2019ve got to have something for protection, being out here with just the missus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Kenny,\u201d Chrystal said. \u201cGeorge never got a permit for that thing.\u201d</p><p>Kenny\u2019s face turned red. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to open your big mouth and bring that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have wanted to see it,\u201d Chrystal argued. \u201cThey always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018they\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI.\u201d She pronounced each letter as though it were a profanity.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kenny screeched. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that gal\u2019s FBI?\u201d His eyes bulged at the news.</p><p>Mark groaned. \u201cAh, man, we\u2019re gonna get busted.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the drunk, John Paul closed the door in Avery\u2019s face and asked softly, \u201cYou\u2019re an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. One quick glance at his expression, and she inwardly cringed. He looked so offended that she didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to explain it all to him now. Maybe later, she thought, when he was asleep.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre you an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to budge until she responded. She swallowed, then whispered, \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Then Chrystal, who, Avery decided, really did have a big mouth, said, \u201cShe told me she left her ID in the car, but she\u2019d go get it if I wanted to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Avery announced. She used every ounce of strength she possessed to push John Paul out of her way so she could get out the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move an inch. \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about this later.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he stepped back, then brushed past him. Childishly wanting to have the last word, she muttered, \u201cNo, we won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The SUV fantailed out of the lot onto the dirt road when John Paul floored it, the tires spitting up pebbles and dirt clumps. He headed toward the river and was driving like a lunatic.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>He eased up on the pedal while Avery went over the directions. \u201cI should have asked Chrystal to give me a guess as to how many miles Coward\u2019s Crossing was from the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be hiking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep up with whatever pace you set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Tell me, what did the woman on the phone say?\u201d</p><p>She repeated the conversation and added, \u201cI demanded to talk to Carrie, but she said that wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAnd yet you still believe your aunt\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I think the woman wants to keep Carrie around . . . for a little longer anyway.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a valid reason for why she felt that way. Maybe it was just desperate hope on her part. \u201cYou know what I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they going to so much trouble if they want to kill me? Why make it complicated? There was ample opportunity to ambush me on the way to the spa, before you were even involved. It would have been so much simpler.\u201d She slapped her forehead. \u201cOf course. They didn\u2019t know I was going to drive to the spa. When I missed my flight, they had to improvise. You were another complication. You were hanging around the spa asking questions. Now it makes sense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. She must be tired. It took so long for her to figure it out. She closed her eyes for a moment and thought about the phone call again.</p><p>\u201cThe woman . . . she\u2019s having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hear it in her voice. She was excited, even when she was hissing at me and calling me stupid. She doesn\u2019t want this to be over too soon. She wants to drag it out.\u201d She thought it over for a long minute and then said, \u201cShe likes giving orders, and as long as we play her little game, or treasure hunt, as she called it, she might prolong it even more.\u201d</p> <p>He drove as fast as the dirt roads would allow while she gave him directions. Avery kept replaying the conversation in her mind, analyzing what little data she had. It was so frustrating.</p><p>John Paul interrupted her. \u201cOkay, Avery. It\u2019s later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s later, and we\u2019re going to talk about it now. Why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me you were an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it very apparent you didn\u2019t particularly like the Bureau.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? When did I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were in the manager\u2019s office at Utopia, you called your friend Noah. I heard you tell him to bring in the troops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you told me they\u2019d mess up the investigation. When I pressed you on your attitude, you became quite hostile. Besides . . .\u201d She could feel herself blushing. \u201cI\u2019m not really an agent, not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>He slowed the car. \u201cYeah? Then why are you telling people you are?\u201d He shook his head and said, \u201cWho in his right mind would want to impersonate an FBI agent?\u201d</p><p>Avery hated being put on the defensive. God, he was such an obstinate, opinionated jerk. \u201cI don\u2019t usually tell people I\u2019m an agent. I just told Chrystal, in hopes of gaining her cooperation. Unlike you,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t use coercion and brute force to get what I want.\u201d</p> <p>John Paul ignored the criticism of his tactics. Why fix what wasn\u2019t broken? Brute force had always worked. \u201cI do what I\u2019m good at doing. That\u2019s my motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d she warned as he turned the corner and nearly ran into a deer. John Paul hit the brakes and swerved off the road, narrowly avoiding the animal. The car rocked and bounced but held the ground.</p><p>It was too dangerous to try to maintain a high speed. He slowed the car and said, \u201cChrystal\u2019s right. We aren\u2019t going to make it before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He sounded genuinely perplexed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get a decent road soon,\u201d she said.</p><p>They drove around another sharp curve. Down below to the west was a road that looked well traveled. He decided to go for it.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he said as they started down the hill. The slope was steep, and he had to be mindful of jagged rocks.</p> <p>Avery flattened her hands against the seat as they bounced along.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cwere you lying about having a badge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have credentials in my backpack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not an agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you doing with credentials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do work for the Bureau. I\u2019m just not a field agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you hate the Bureau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you\u2019re not any good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know what I\u2019m good at?\u201d she said. Lord, he was irritating. Every time he opened his mouth, he said something that rubbed her the wrong way. No man had ever been able to get under her skin the way John Paul did.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the instincts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd before you get all hot and bothered and argue, answer a question for me, and be honest.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and frowned at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you anticipate that Kenny might have a loaded weapon under that counter? Did you even for a split second consider the possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been trained to be a field agent. I didn\u2019t go through the academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse. You\u2019ve either got it, or you don\u2019t. You\u2019ve got some good moves,\u201d he added. \u201cThe way you kick-boxed that kid was impressive. But you\u2019d still make a lousy field agent.\u201d</p><p>She refused to comment on his assessment.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you do for the Bureau?\u201d he asked.</p><p>John Paul could see the blush was coming back. She was either embarrassed or so mad at him her face was turning a fire red. She sure was pretty. Ah, hell, where had that come from? He had no business thinking about such things, especially now that he knew she represented everything he detested.</p><p>\u201cI type,\u201d she said. She heard how defensive she sounded and quickly added, \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with being a typist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say there was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m part of a very important team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, jeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought it all, didn\u2019t you? A team player. You\u2019re probably a damn liberal too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I am,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not ashamed of being a typist . . . it\u2019s an honorable job, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit being so condescending. I wasn\u2019t hired to be a typist, but that\u2019s what I pretty much do anyway, all day, every day. I transfer information into the database. Now, can we let the matter drop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>He seemed preoccupied now. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good road. Maybe we will get close to Coward\u2019s Crossing before it gets dark. We\u2019ll hike a couple of miles, find a secluded spot for you to hide, and then I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was as far as she\u2019d let him get. \u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. You drop me off, find another good road, and with any luck, you can make it back to Aspen before dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I want to drive back to Aspen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the insult. \u201cI think you should get out while you still can. You can tell the FBI where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Right?\u201d</p><p>She began to fold and unfold her hands. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. What can they do if you leave? Nothing,\u201d she said, answering her own question. \u201cFrankly, you don\u2019t need to be involved. You said it yourself. They want me, not you. Besides, you called Noah, and he\u2019s FBI. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s alerted the local team, and they\u2019re most certainly on their way. When you get to a phone, you can call him again, and tell him exactly where I\u2019m headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an opportunity to get Monk, and you think I\u2019m gonna . . .\u201d He was so angry he was sputtering. He shook his head. \u201cLet me get this straight. You really believe I\u2019ll drop you off in the middle of nowhere and take off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d he argued. \u201cI was going to find a safe place for you to hide until I got back, someplace Monk would never find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019ll drop me off in the middle of nowhere and take off.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to think about it. \u201cYou\u2019re not dropping me off anywhere, unless you plan to go back to Aspen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts, you know that? You\u2019re just plain nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather that\u2019s a no?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond to her sarcasm.</p><p>She brushed her hair away from her face with her fingers and laid her hands on top of her head. \u201cI wish we could get out of this car. I need a quiet place to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think in a car?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t understand. When she was in her cubicle at work, she felt the same way she felt when she was doing yoga. She\u2019d perfected the technique of clearing her mind and then slowly entering data one clue at a time while her hands worked the keyboard. No, he couldn\u2019t possibly understand, and she couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>\u201cSo who looks like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at the store,\u201d he said. \u201cChrystal said the woman looked like you. So I\u2019ve gotta ask if you happen to have any crazy relatives trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s only my aunt Carrie and her husband, Tony. No other relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParents dead?\u201d</p><p>She turned in her seat and stared at his profile when she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know who my father was. I don\u2019t think the woman who had me knew who he was either,\u201d she said.</p><p>She watched him closely to see if she had shocked him. His expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cShe died in a car crash quite a few years ago. There isn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrystal said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard what she said, John Paul. Do you know how many women her description fits?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and asked, \u201cSo is it real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair. Is it real?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cAre you asking me if I wear a wig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m asking about the color. Are you a real blonde, or did you get that from a bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care about the color of my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, growing irritated now. \u201cBut the woman looked like you, so I gotta wonder if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t color my hair.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised and didn\u2019t hide his reaction. \u201cYeah? What about your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColored contacts?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you deliberately trying to be a jerk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just trying to put it together, okay? Kenny said the woman was beautiful. A real knockout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHave you looked at yourself lately? You\u2019ve got to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d she pressed when he didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cHell, woman. You\u2019re pretty, damn it.\u201d</p><p>It was the most hostile, backhanded compliment she\u2019d ever received, and the odd thing was, it didn\u2019t upset her. For the first time ever, she didn\u2019t feel the need to launch into her favorite lecture about how appearances weren\u2019t the least bit important.</p><p>She forced herself to consider the problem at hand. \u201cThe data isn\u2019t sufficient to form a conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, you sound like a computer. A lot of things aren\u2019t adding up.\u201d</p><p>She agreed with a nod. Her stomach was hurting. She felt as though she had a hot coal lodged in her esophagus. She picked up her backpack, found her antacid, a bottle of water, and two energy bars. She opened the bottle, popped the pills, and swallowed. Then she handed the bottle to John Paul and opened one of the energy bars for him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said after he took a long swallow of the water. He took a bite of the bar and washed it down with another gulp. \u201cIt tastes like cardboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>His smile lasted for half a second, but she still saw it and reacted. She surprised herself. She couldn\u2019t stand the man an hour ago, but now she didn\u2019t think he was so awful. He had a beautiful profile . . . and was sexy as hell. No reason for her to pretend she didn\u2019t notice, even though she wasn\u2019t going to do anything about it.</p><p>He was also protective. The way he tried to boss her around in the store when she went running to the back office. He acted . . . worried. Worried about her safety. Nice, she thought. He wasn\u2019t such a cold duck after all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna rain,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cRain will slow us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still coming. The sun\u2019s going to be setting soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to plant the watch about a mile or two from here. Then we\u2019ll go on for as long as we can.\u201d</p><p>He parked the car and picked up the watch. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do with that gun we took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the sack on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it out and keep it on your lap. Have you done any target practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a disgruntled sigh. \u201cKeep the safety on.\u201d He got the gun for her. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared before she could tell him to be careful. A fine drizzle began to fall, covering the windshield. It seemed an hour had passed before he came sprinting down the hill toward the car. When he opened the door, a blast of cold air filled the interior.</p><p>The second he turned the motor on, she flipped on the heater. \u201cWhere did you leave the watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hooked it to a tree branch by a crossroad to the west. If he\u2019s tracking us now, I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll think we took the other road.\u201d</p><p>He drove on, thanking God he had a four-wheel drive. He zigzagged up the side of the mountain, slowly weaving in and out of the trees. When the terrain became too dense to go any farther, he maneuvered the car into a cluster of thick pines, turned it around, and then backed in until he was assured the car couldn\u2019t be seen from the road below.</p><p>Night rushed in on them, closing them in together. The drizzle had turned into rain. A booming clap of thunder sounded. She flinched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a weapon just in case, food and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019ve got food and water? You think you\u2019re going to leave me here?\u201d</p><p>He reached for the door.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>BY THE TIME CARRIE PLOPPED DOWN ON THE LIVING ROOM sofa, she felt doomed. Jilly and Monk had thought of every possible way out. Oh, yes, they\u2019d wired every window . . . except, perhaps, one. She looked up at the skylight that loomed over the spiral staircase. The bubbled rectangle was over thirty feet above them. She shook her head. Even if they stacked table upon table upon wardrobes, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to hack their way through.</p><p>Anne had prepared a dinner from the contents of the pantry, and the three women ate in dejected silence. The sun had gone down and the house was dimly lit by the candles Anne had found. None of them wanted to turn on the lights, fearing Jilly and Monk were watching, and there weren\u2019t any drapes to cover the massive windows. Sara had brought up the possibility that Monk had hooked up a video camera to observe them. That so freaked out Carrie, she once again scoured the house, this time looking for a camera. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne was reclining on the sofa, and Sara sat in an easy chair waiting for her when she came back downstairs.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI looked everywhere. I even searched the light sockets, the ones I could reach,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make if they can see or hear us?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>Carrie thought the question was stupid but didn\u2019t say so. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re digging our way out of the basement and they can see us, they\u2019ll push the button and kill us right then and there.\u201d</p> <p>Digging through the basement was, of course, out of the question. The door to it was locked, and there was a big sign taped to it. One word, but quite enough to keep the three women from trying to break the lock. \u201cBoom.\u201d</p><p>Exhausted and frightened, Sara and Carrie sat in silence as they stared out the windows at the deepening shadows on the beautiful landscape.</p><p>Anne struggled to sit up. Carrie noticed a stack of papers on the sofa next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNewspaper clippings I found in the chest in the foyer. One of the owners of the house must have saved them. Here they are,\u201d she said, handing Carrie a picture of a bride and groom on their wedding day.</p> <p>\u201cThey look happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they were,\u201d Anne said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re getting divorced and fighting over this house. Here, take all of the articles,\u201d she said, thrusting them at Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sordid. Is anyone ready for dessert?\u201d</p><p>She sounded like a hostess of a party. Carrie found the question hilarious and laughed until tears came into her eyes. Sara was also tickled. She began to giggle.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if I have room for dessert,\u201d Sara said. \u201cAfter that gourmet dinner of baked beans and canned beets, I\u2019m quite full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the creamed corn,\u201d Anne reminded. \u201cI worked hard to get just the right amount of pepper mixed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very tasty,\u201d Sara said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken inventory of the pantry,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI thought we could have canned peaches for dessert. Shall we eat in the kitchen by candlelight? I\u2019ve closed the blinds so no one can see in from the driveway.\u201d</p><p>Anne was sounding so chipper that Carrie became alarmed. Her own burst of laughter had been due to near hysteria, but Anne wasn\u2019t hysterical. She was acting as though she were having a lovely time getting together with old friends.</p><p>\u201cAfter dessert, I have a surprise for you,\u201d Anne said. Her wry smile reminded Carrie of the cat who\u2019d just eaten the canary.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to try to open the door to the garage, are you? That one is wired too,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI checked it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you read the sign on the door?\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Sara answered sheepishly.</p><p>Carrie put her hand out and helped pull Sara up from the easy chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little stiff,\u201d Sara said.</p> <p>Anne had already gone into the kitchen. They could hear her singing. Carrie, picturing Anne climbing up on the granite counter to open the window above the sink, rushed ahead of Sara. Blessedly, the image wasn\u2019t real. Anne was opening the can of peaches.</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t stop worrying. The woman had yet to grasp the futility of their situation. \u201cAnne, you\u2019re not getting loopy on us again, are you?\u201d</p><p>Anne laughed. It was a high-pitched noise, like china breaking. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Now sit down and relax.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Carrie knew she would have done anything Anne or Sara told her to do. She was feeling so beaten down. She was sick with worry for Avery, and though she was loath to admit it, she missed Tony.</p><p>\u201cI miss my husband.\u201d She was surprised she\u2019d said the thought out loud. \u201cI guess I do love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Anne asked. She placed the fluted ice cream bowls on the table and scooped peaches into each one.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was cheating on me. He said he wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t believe him. Some woman was calling at all hours of the night. The phone\u2019s on my side of the bed, and I always answered. She\u2019d ask for Tony, but when he\u2019d take the phone, he told me she hung up. What if it was Jilly calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t trust your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The three women ate in silence while Carrie continued to wallow in self-pity. \u201cYou know what I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen it happens, I hope we\u2019re all sound asleep so we don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s grim,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cWill the sound of the explosion wake us up before the pain of being incinerated\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Carrie,\u201d Sara demanded. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for such negative thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, please,\u201d Anne interrupted. \u201cAre you ready for my surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are loopy,\u201d Carrie muttered. \u201cYou found some Froot Loops?\u201d</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t acknowledge her ridicule. \u201cI\u2019ve built two houses in the last ten years. The second one was over three thousand square feet. Cedar siding,\u201d she added. She nervously laughed as she qualified. \u201cI hired a contractor, of course, but I was there every single day making sure everything was done the way I wanted it done. I drove the builder crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you did,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling us this?\u201d Sara wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI was leading up to my surprise,\u201d Anne said. She took a breath and then whispered, \u201cI found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound what?\u201d Carrie demanded.</p><p>Anne beamed with self-satisfaction. \u201cA way out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>YOU\u2019LL BE OKAY HERE,\u201d JOHN PAUL TOLD AVERY.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019ll be okay? You\u2019re thinking about hiking to Coward\u2019s Crossing now? In the dark . . . in a rainstorm? Are you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery,\u201d he began.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cOkay, if your mind\u2019s made up, I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>She knew he\u2019d argue, and he did exactly that. He was almost civil as he told her she would slow him down, and he didn\u2019t want or need to have to worry about her out there. When that didn\u2019t work, he tried intimidation, even going so far as to threaten to tie her to the steering wheel.</p><p>She let him go on and on as she climbed into the backseat, found her black jogging jacket, and put it on, and then dug through her bag until she located her baseball cap.</p><p>Scooping her hair up under the black-and-orange Orioles cap, she adjusted the brim, sat back, and kicked off her tennis shoes. Her goal was to try to blend in with the night, and white tennis shoes would be seen.</p><p>Thank God she\u2019d decided to bring her hiking shoes. She knew he was watching her every move as she carefully repacked her duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to hike in the dark . . . only an idiot would try it, but if that\u2019s what you want to do, then I\u2019m right behind you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here,\u201d he said between gritted teeth.</p><p>She pretended she hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cWe won\u2019t get far, and one of us might break an ankle or something walking into a hole we can\u2019t see. If I were making the decisions,\u201d she added as she carefully placed her tennis shoes, soles up, on top of her clothes and rezipped the bag, \u201cI\u2019d say we should stay in the car until dawn. Then we hike at a fast clip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re not making the decisions. I am.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the duffel bag to the floor, stacked her hands on the headrest, and leaned forward until she was just inches from his face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold on to his glare or his bad mood when she smiled. Hell, she even batted those big baby blue eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cAre all the typists at the Bureau smart-asses like you?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to put her on the defensive so she\u2019d stop arguing with him and let him do what he was trained to do. It was a great plan, he thought, but unfortunately she was having none of it.</p><p>\u201cAre all burnouts as obnoxious and stubborn as you are?\u201d</p><p>He caught himself before he smiled. \u201cProbably,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>\u201cAre we going or not? Time\u2019s a-wasting, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until dawn,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that smug look, sugar. I had already decided to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He was smart enough to know it was time to stop arguing. Honest to God, she was more stubborn than he was, and in truth, that impressed the socks off him. She wasn\u2019t going to let him win this round, but he already had another plan in mind. He\u2019d sneak away a little before dawn. When she woke up, she\u2019d have to stay in the car and wait for him to come back.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t make it back . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave the keys in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the front seat so I can fold down the back. I\u2019ve got a sleeping bag,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t get any fancy ideas, Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancy?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Avery had already found the latches and unhooked the seat backs. When they were flat, she spread out the sleeping bag. She tucked her hiking shoes under the seat, removed her jacket, and tossed it on the floor. John Paul stretched out on his back with his feet against the dashboard. He looked comfortable, his hands stacked on his chest, his eyes closed.</p><p>Shivering from the cold, she had to climb over his legs to get to the other side. Her teeth were chattering as she stretched out beside him. She couldn\u2019t reach her jacket. It was under the seat below him. A gentleman would have put his arms around her to warm the shivers away. He wasn\u2019t a gentleman, she decided, when he completely ignored her.</p><p>It had always been a point of pride with her never to complain. She was usually quite good at suffering minor and major ailments in silence. But John Paul brought out the worst in her. She really wanted to whine now, and she was more disgusted with herself than with him. He couldn\u2019t help being a jerk. She could.</p><p>Suck it up, she told herself. Then a minute later, when she was sure her toes were frostbitten, she whispered, \u201cScrew this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it was cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn I heard you say, \u2018Screw this.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He really liked being rude, she supposed, and no wonder, he was so very good at it. She smiled in spite of her misery. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his answer, she said, \u201cWe should share our body heat.\u201d He didn\u2019t move a muscle. \u201cPut your damn arms around me, Renard. I\u2019m freezing. For God\u2019s sake, be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t move. She was half on top of him now, trying to steal some of the warmth his body generated. The man was like an electric blanket.</p><p>\u201cMove it.\u201d She grimaced after giving the order. She sounded like a drill sergeant.</p><p>He was trying hard not to laugh at her. \u201cIf I put my arms around you, sugar, I might not remain a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Oh, brother. \u201cI\u2019ll take my chances, sugar,\u201d she drawled back.</p><p>She leaned up so he could put his arm out, and the second he did, she cuddled up against his side. John Paul rolled over and enveloped her with his arms.</p><p>He felt as if he were hugging an ice cube. The bottom of his chin rubbed the top of her head. Damn, she smelled good. Like peppermint, maybe, he thought as he began to rub her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one big goose bump.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the energy to talk. His warmth was so comforting, she closed her eyes and let him caress her. Her T-shirt had ridden up above her navel, and too late, she felt his hands slip under the fabric. His fingers splayed wide across her back.</p><p>She lurched upward at the same instant he felt the scar tissue, her head slamming into his chin.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered as he dropped back. \u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d he asked, rubbing his jaw.</p><p>Avery frantically pulled her shirt down and rolled away from him. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d closed up on him quicker than he could snap his fingers. He rolled onto his back and closed his eyes. What in God\u2019s name had happened to her back? He knew what he\u2019d touched was scar tissue. Who had done that to her?</p><p>\u201cLeave me the hell alone,\u201d Avery whispered.</p><p>She was coiled for a fight. She waited tensely for the questions to start, holding her breath. She expelled it loudly. Why was he silent? Why wasn\u2019t he asking questions?</p><p>She told herself she had nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about, but very few men had ever seen or touched her back, and she had memorized their reactions. The look of shock, and in one instance, disgust. Mostly she remembered how one man she had actually believed wasn\u2019t superficial had visibly shuddered. Then, of course, the sympathy and the questions came . . . the hundreds of questions.</p><p>John Paul wasn\u2019t talking, though. She couldn\u2019t stand his silence long. She rolled toward him, propped herself up with her elbow, and glared down at him. The jerk\u2019s eyes were closed, and he looked as if he were sleeping. She knew better.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s John Paul, not Damn It.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was the matter with him? Why wasn\u2019t he asking her questions . . . or flinching? She knew he\u2019d felt the knotted scars. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>She was getting angrier and angrier by the second. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, sugar, you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I do. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d she demanded. \u201cI want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m thinking that you\u2019re a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I said you\u2019re a real pain in the ass. You damn near broke my jaw when you jerked up. One second you\u2019re letting me warm you, and the next you\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his jaw. \u201cI could have chipped a tooth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, brother. \u201cLook . . . I\u2019m sorry, okay? I was just startled, and I . . . Wait a minute. Why am I apologizing?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a devilish grin. Her heartbeat immediately quickened. \u201c\u2019Cause you should,\u201d he drawled in his seductive southern accent.</p><p>The big jerk was so aloof and impassive, so why were her senses going berserk now? With the bursts of lightning, she could see his face clearly. The day\u2019s growth of whiskers should have made him look scruffy, but it didn\u2019t. She had to resist the urge to touch his cheek. His wonderful scent was driving her to distraction too. He smelled like wintergreen and musk and fresh wood shavings. And when he had held her in his arms to warm her, his body had felt like a smooth block of sculptor\u2019s marble. Everything about him was sexy, damn it. He was so masculine, so . . . Get a grip, she told herself. Remember, you\u2019re in charge.</p><p>Yeah, right. She put her forefinger and her thumb up in front of his eyes about a half-inch apart and said, \u201cI\u2019m this close to really hating you.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d used just the right amount of anger in her voice. She nodded too, just to let him know she meant every word.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t impressed or intimidated. He simply closed his eyes and lazily said, \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>WE GO THROUGH THE WALL.\u201d ANNE MADE THE announcement and then waited for the women\u2019s reaction to her suggestion. Sara looked incredulous; Carrie looked irritated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Carrie muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll use my superhuman karate kicks and my X-ray vision . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, Carrie, let\u2019s hear what Anne has to say,\u201d Sara chided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it could work. When I got out of the car, I walked over to the stone wall and looked down. The mountain slopes on this side of the house. It\u2019s not a sheer drop like it is outside the living room windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Sara urged.</p><p>\u201cI also noticed the sides of the house are cedar boards, not stone like the front,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an outside wall in the pantry that\u2019s just on the other side of the stone wall. I suggest we punch a big hole in the Sheetrock near the floor, so that when we do kick the cedar boards out, we won\u2019t be seen from the front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Anne, there\u2019s more than just Sheetrock and cedar boards,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what\u2019s between those walls,\u201d she boasted. \u201cThere\u2019s insulation, but that won\u2019t be difficult to tear out, and maybe wiring too, which we could work around, and a layer of sheathing . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what else?\u201d Sara asked. She leaned forward while she considered Anne\u2019s idea.</p><p>\u201cTwo-by-fours,\u201d Anne said. \u201cStuds are usually about sixteen inches apart. We should all be able to squeeze through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we make a hole in the Sheetrock? With our fists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe use the poker from the fireplace,\u201d Anne said. \u201cAnd knives to widen the hole. I took inventory, and the kitchen knives are still in the drawers. If we started now, who knows? We might be out of here by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s running out,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI say we try to break a window and hope we don\u2019t . . .\u201d She stopped when Sara shook her head.</p><p>\u201cToo risky,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI say we go with Anne\u2019s plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cedar boards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be as difficult as you think,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThey\u2019re nailed in, but if we hit them hard enough or kick them, they\u2019ll eventually pop right out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy goodness, we\u2019ve got a plan,\u201d Sara said. She slapped her hand on the table and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure we won\u2019t be able to find any rope to use to climb down, but wouldn\u2019t sheets work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the movies, they always use sheets to get out,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cYou honestly don\u2019t watch television, do you?\u201d</p><p>Anne shook her head. \u201cI could work on the sheets. Maybe instead of tying knots, I could figure out a way to braid them together . . . or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Sara said. \u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that, Carrie and I will work on the wall. Anne, you\u2019re brilliant. I never would have thought to go out through a wall. I think this is doable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave during the night,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI don\u2019t relish the idea of tromping through the wilderness in the dark, but if we make our way downhill until we estimate we\u2019re past the fence, then we could get to the road and follow it back to town.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d made it all sound easy. Was she being naive, or could it be that simple?</p><p>\u201cWe should probably take a couple of sharp knives with us,\u201d Sara suggested. \u201cJust in case we run into any wild animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Monk,\u201d Carrie said. She shivered then. \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer fighting off a wild animal than running into him. Do you know . . .\u201d She suddenly stopped, embarrassed at what she had almost confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m gross, but I thought he was handsome.\u201d</p><p>Sara snorted with laughter. \u201cI did too. I loved his accent. Do you think it was real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI thought he was sexy.\u201d</p><p>Anne had been listening quietly to the conversation until Carrie made that comment. She couldn\u2019t keep silent any longer; her disapproval was evident. \u201cShame on you, Carrie. You\u2019re a married woman.\u201d</p><p>Carrie defended herself. \u201cI\u2019m married, yes, but I\u2019m not blind, and there isn\u2019t anything wrong with appreciating a great-looking man. Surely you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anne cut her off. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI would never insult my Eric by lusting after another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say I lusted after him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop bickering,\u201d Sara begged. \u201cYou make me want to open a door.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>JOHN PAUL RETRIEVED THE WATCH THEN HIKED OVER TWELVE miles. He made a wide circle around the perimeter of the location marked on the map looking for signs\u2014anything out of the ordinary, like a sniper hunkered down in the scrub. When he was satisfied he was alone, he planted the watch and backtracked four miles to Coward\u2019s Crossing.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any doubt about being in the right place. There was a crude hand-painted sign nailed to a stake that had recently been pounded into the ground. The white paint with the words \u201cCoward\u2019s Crossing\u201d wasn\u2019t weathered and, therefore, couldn\u2019t have been more than a couple of days old. The arrow on top of the sign pointed to a boarded-up, abandoned mine shaft. There was a woman\u2019s bright red silk scarf nailed to another board above the entrance.</p><p>Dawn had arrived, and the mist was being burned by the rising sun. John Paul was safely concealed by the trees and bushes. From where he was positioned, he could see the entrance to the shaft. He didn\u2019t relish the idea of climbing down inside. Were the women there? Doubtful, he thought. Monk wouldn\u2019t have kidnapped them and then given Avery a map showing their location. No, Monk was isolating his prey. No doubt about that.</p><p>When would he take his shot? Maybe he thought they would want to go into the shaft. How had Monk planned to kill them? Explosives, he guessed. Yeah, that\u2019s what Monk would do. Clean and neat, an underground explosion no one would hear, and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about burying what was left of their bodies.</p><p>Come on, John Paul urged. Show yourself. There was a good thirty yards of open space between the cover of the trees and the shaft. Check it out, Monk. Let me get one clear shot. He would try to immobilize him so he could question him and, hopefully, find out where the women were.</p><p>Someone was out there. The silence in the woods confirmed it. No birds singing, no squirrels scurrying about as they foraged for food. Nothing but the wind whistling a forlorn melody through the branches and an occasional rumble of thunder in the distance.</p><p>John Paul was patient. He could wait it out for as long as he needed. But what about Avery? How long would she sleep? And when she woke up and found him gone, would she try to come after him? The possibility sent chills down his back. He pictured her walking into a trap and had to force himself to block the image of her being gunned down.</p><p>He thought he heard something and tilted his head, straining to listen. The sound didn\u2019t come again.</p><p>What was Avery doing now? Was she still asleep? He\u2019d left her snug as a bug in his sleeping bag with the gun next to her.</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d hated leaving her. Knock it off, he told himself. She\u2019s fine. The car\u2019s well hidden and over ten miles away. Yeah, she was okay. Ah, hell, try as he did, he couldn\u2019t convince himself.</p><p>How in God\u2019s name had she worked her way under his skin so quickly? And what the hell was the matter with him to be attracted to her? She was a damn liberal, he reminded himself, one of those \u201cLet\u2019s save the world\u201d types. Worse, she was a team player, and the team she obviously loved playing for was the Bureau.</p><p>They were completely, thoroughly, absolutely unsuitable for each other. And yet here he was, worrying himself sick about her.</p><p>Monk could have tracked them . . . a twig snapped behind him. Without making a sound, he turned, trying to pinpoint the location. He thought it was maybe thirty or forty feet away, but with the rising wind it was impossible to be accurate.</p><p>For over five minutes he didn\u2019t move a muscle. Then he heard another sound, a faint rustling of leaves. Ever so slowly, he eased back on his haunches, zeroed in on the exact spot where the noise had come from, and took aim.</p><p>Then he saw those blue eyes staring at him between two little branches she had so painstakingly parted.</p><p>He was suddenly livid. He had damn near killed the woman. What could she have been thinking to sneak up on him like that? If she hadn\u2019t stayed perfectly still and let him see her face, if she had made one more little sound, he might have blown her away. Son of a bitch, he silently cursed as he eased up on the trigger. Son of a bitch.</p><p>Thank God he hadn\u2019t hurt her. An odd thought, given the fact that he was now contemplating wringing her neck.</p><p>He strained from the effort he exerted not to shout at her. He held up one hand, motioning for her to stay put. She slowly shook her head and held up one finger. Then she pointed behind her.</p><p>He moved through the brush toward her.</p><p>Avery knew he was furious. His jaw was clenched so tight she thought it might shatter. She slowly got up on her knees, leaned into him until her mouth was touching his ear. Then she whispered, \u201cHe found the car.\u201d</p><p>John Paul heard movement and saw the glint of steel through the trees about fifty feet away. Like a lion, he sprang.</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t have time to react. One second she was whispering into his ear, and the next she was flat on her stomach on the ground, her face smashed into dead leaves with John Paul covering her as he fired. The dirt around her head was spitting up into her hair.</p><p>He rolled, fired again and again as he jerked her to her knees. \u201cMove it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>After the first shot, he knew Monk had a high-powered rifle. Probably with one of those fancy nightscopes too. All the bastard needed was one clear shot. No, make that two.</p><p>He figured Monk was trying to get them to run into the clearing by shooting at their only other way out.</p><p>Avery inadvertently cooperated. She veered to the right, away from the hail of bullets, but John Paul threw his arm around her and lifted her off the ground as he pushed her in front of him, using his body as a shield against the bullets flying around them.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go,\u201d he whispered, urging her on.</p><p>A branch came flying at her face. He blocked it like a football player with his forearm and shoved her ahead. She stumbled back against him, righted herself before he could try to jerk her arm out of its socket again, and kept going. They were running uphill now through a maze of trees. She heard a roaring in her ears, thought it was her heart pounding.</p><p>She was wrong about that. She reached a boulder. The surface was wet and slick. She scrambled up on her hands and knees, and then came to a hard stop. Good God, there was a sheer drop of at least fifty feet, and at the bottom was white, foaming water.</p><p>The hell with that. In her mind, they were out of options. The rapids were below them, but the killer was behind them and rushing toward them. As Avery peered over at the white water, she thought they had a better chance of surviving if they faced Monk head-on.</p><p>She unzipped her windbreaker pocket and pulled out the gun. John Paul emptied his gun, released the clip, and snapped another in. Then he flipped the safety on, glanced over the boulder to see what was below, and shoved his gun into Avery\u2019s pocket. After he zipped it up, he took her gun, put it in her other pocket, and zipped it closed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like where this was leading. \u201cWe stay and fight,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head. She frantically nodded. They could both hear Monk crashing through the brush. He was firing wild now, but nonstop. John Paul wrapped his arms around Avery\u2019s waist, holding her tightly in a bear hug. As he leapt from the rock ledge, he asked, \u201cCan you swim?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>COULD SHE SWIM? HE HAD THE GALL TO ASK HER THAT question after he\u2019d lunged off the ledge with her locked in his arms. Avery didn\u2019t scream. Her life didn\u2019t pass before her eyes either on that endless flight down into the water below. She was too busy trying to punch him so he\u2019d let go of her. And too scared to make a sound. Oh, Lord, don\u2019t let us drown.</p><p>They hit hard, plunging feetfirst into the icy water. It felt as if a thousand needles sliced through her feet and traveled at the speed of light all the way up into her brain. The impact was paralyzing.</p><p>He never let go of her. Not when they were sucked under by the raging water, and not during their frantic search for the surface as they were plummeting down the roaring rapids. Just when she was certain her lungs were going to burst, they finally clawed their way to air, but they had only enough time to fill their lungs before they were pulled under by the current.</p><p>She saw a brown bear watching them from the bank. She could have sworn he was grinning at them and didn\u2019t want that image to be her last before she died. She wanted to survive so she could give John Paul hell for trying to drown her. As if something had hold of her ankles and was tugging her down, she sank again. She would damn well have to fight harder to make it. She\u2019d grown up swimming in the ocean, first in Florida and then in California, and was a stronger swimmer than most, but this wasn\u2019t swimming. They were bobbing like corks.</p><p>They reached the surface again. Gasping to take in as much air as possible, she spotted a big old gnarled tree branch bouncing from one white-water crest to another. With both hands, she grabbed hold when it came roaring past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The river zigged and zagged, but they were getting closer to the bank. She started kicking with all her might. John Paul hooked one arm over the branch and steered their lifeline in the same direction. When they finally reached shallow water, he stood and pulled her to the bank.</p><p>Sprawled out side by side on the grassy slope, they were both too exhausted to move. Avery was gulping in air and shivering so much her teeth were chattering.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, sugar?\u201d he panted.</p><p>She suddenly bolted upright and gagged. She thought she might have swallowed half the river.</p> <p>\u201cCan you swim?\u201d she said between gasps. \u201cIs that what you asked me after you shoved me off that ledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you heard me, huh?\u201d He reached over and gently pushed her dripping hair out of her eyes.</p><p>She looked back at the raging river. God surely had a hand in their survival, she thought. There simply wasn\u2019t any other explanation possible.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so now we know what a fiver is,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sat up. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThey obviously rate the rapids,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis one was the big mother. A fiver.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. They had just been through hell together, and all she wanted to do was tell him how they rate rapids?</p><p>\u201cDid you hit your head or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just figured out the rating system. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d she said. Squinting up at the cliffs above them, she said, \u201cI think we lost him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. Reluctant as he was to move, he forced himself to get up. He shook himself like a dog who\u2019d just had a bath, then offered her his hand.</p><p>She made the mistake of clasping hold. He yanked her to her feet, pulling on her socket again. The man didn\u2019t know his own strength. Now what was he doing? He\u2019d turned and was surveying the area they\u2019d just vacated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab some brush and throw it over our imprints. No, never mind. You\u2019ll only make it worse. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the protection of the trees and watched him pull several small branches over the soft earth. \u201cWhy is it that you automatically assume I\u2019m incompetent? Is it just me you have a problem with, or are you that way with every woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>She saw him grin before he turned away. He got a kick out of irritating her, she decided, but she was too weary from near heart failure in the rapids to rise to his bait.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where we are?\u201d she asked. Her words sounded slurred, and she was shaking almost violently now.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the answer she was hoping for. \u201cSo I guess you weren\u2019t a Boy Scout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get us where we need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It would take too long trying to find a place to cross over the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to a phone.\u201d And a hot shower and dry clothes, she silently added.</p><p>He finished covering their footprints, stepped back to survey his handiwork, and nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cA phone\u2019s a given,\u201d he said as he walked closer to her. \u201cDamn, babe, you\u2019re freezing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d she asked as he took her into his embrace and began to vigorously rub her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve got ice water in my veins, or so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would say such a thing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Then, \u201cShe ought to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any strength left?\u201d He was unzipping her windbreaker so he could get to his gun. His weapon was just a little damp. He shoved it into the back of his jeans and zipped her pocket closed again.</p><p>\u201cI have as much strength as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen start jogging. You\u2019ll get warm in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go up before we can go down.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the mountains surrounding them. \u201cIt would be easier to follow the river, but Monk would anticipate.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and started jogging at a fast clip through the woods. Water sloshed between her toes as she ran. The sensation of ice cubes melting around her feet wasn\u2019t pleasant.</p><p>John Paul kept pace with her for over an hour. They neither stopped nor spoke to each other.</p><p>He was impressed with her stamina. Once she had established the rhythm, she didn\u2019t slow down. She didn\u2019t complain either, and she wasn\u2019t clutching her side. He already knew she was in shape. One look at her body and he could tell she worked out. Still, the way she kept moving, so steady and sure, was proof that she did more than take a one-hour aerobics class once a week at some little spa back home.</p><p>He spotted the clear-water creek ahead and thought they should stop to catch their breath.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, thank God. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to keep going?\u201d</p><p>If he had said yes, she thought she would either burst into tears or keel over from exhaustion. The stitch in her side felt like someone was holding a hot coal against her ribs, and it had taken all she had not to grab hold and double over.</p><p>She noticed he didn\u2019t appear to be the least winded. Avery stretched her legs so they wouldn\u2019t cramp on her before she collapsed to the ground. Scooping up water with cupped hands, she greedily drank.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s tracking us?\u201d she asked a minute later.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut he\u2019ll have to find a place to cross over those rapids, so we have some time. Tell me what happened at the car.\u201d He had been silently cursing himself for leaving her.</p><p>She sat down in the grass and leaned back against the tree. \u201cI woke up and you were gone,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I decided to follow you.\u201d</p><p>His shoulder rubbed against hers as he sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get far,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI had just started up the hill when I saw the headlights through the mist. Honest to Pete, I almost ran out to flag it down, but thankfully, I came to my senses and decided to wait until the car came closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, man,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou could have walked right up to him before you . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t go on. The thought of what could have happened to her made him sick.</p><p>\u201cHe parked his car down below, then got out. He had a flashlight and a rifle tucked under his arm as he climbed the hill to where your car was hidden. He must have pinpointed the location before you moved the watch. I knew it was Monk, of course, so I stayed hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe checked out the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I could have if I\u2019d moved, but I was afraid I\u2019d make a noise, and he\u2019d know I was there, watching. He opened the hood of your car, pulled something out, and threw it into that gully on the side of the hill. I could find it if we go back. He had the hood of his windbreaker up, so I couldn\u2019t see his face or the color of his hair, but he was at least six feet. He wasn\u2019t thin, though. He was quite muscular, not heavyset. He reminded me of a bodybuilder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good with disguises,\u201d he said. \u201cNoah\u2019s description is what the FBI is using, but he didn\u2019t get a clear look at him either. From what I\u2019ve heard about Monk, he could be in the same room with Noah today, and I doubt he would be recognized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was alone or not. He was driving a Land Rover, but when he opened the door and got out, the light didn\u2019t go on, and he parked it a good distance away. I couldn\u2019t see inside. Do you think the woman was with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good at what he does, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She sounded disheartened.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe stood there a long time, maybe five minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t move a muscle. It was creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was probably listening to the sound of the forest, hoping to hear something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He put his arm around her and pulled her close. \u201cThank God you didn\u2019t try to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about trying to get my gun out of my pocket, but I was so close to him I worried he\u2019d hear the sound of the zipper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had been asleep, Monk . . .\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish his bleak thought, she interrupted. \u201cHe\u2019d shoot me? I\u2019ll tell you what, John Paul. If you ever leave me behind again, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>Since she was all but clinging to him so that she could borrow some of his warmth, the threat didn\u2019t carry much weight.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you again,\u201d he promised in a gruff whisper. \u201cI never should have left you. Hell, I guess I\u2019ve been away from it too long. My instincts are all screwed up.\u201d</p><p>She homed in on what he\u2019d just said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away from it too long? What exactly is it, John Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, sugar. We should get moving. Time\u2019s a-wasting.\u201d</p><p>In other words, leave it alone. She decided to accommodate him now and try again later. She was stiff and sore when she stood. Groaning, she rubbed her backside, not caring that she appeared less than ladylike.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood, dry clothes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I also need is to get into my yoga position, relax, and do my free-association exercises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d He was sure he hadn\u2019t heard correctly.</p><p>She repeated. \u201cYou let the fragments drift in your mind; then when you\u2019re completely relaxed, you take hold of one at a time and you analyze it. You can\u2019t do it, though, until you reach total relaxation.\u201d</p><p>John Paul watched her stretch her long legs. \u201cSo how do you reach total relaxation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVisualization,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to a place where I feel completely safe and free, like a real home. You know, I go to my . . . happy place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou do know you sound insane, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t joking when she answered. \u201cIt runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands behind her back and twisted her torso, then shook her arms and legs to loosen them and started running again, her pace slower this time, but just as determined. Once again, he fell in right behind her and stayed there until she was panting for breath. They\u2019d been climbing steadily since they\u2019d left the river, and so far they hadn\u2019t seen a single sign of civilization. Where in thunder were they? Were they even still in Colorado?</p><p>She suddenly stopped, doubled over, and took a couple of deep, gulping breaths. Then she put her hands on her h*ps and slowly straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he winded? He was human, wasn\u2019t he? She made up her mind that, no matter what, she wouldn\u2019t utter one word of complaint. Not one frickin\u2019 word.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t see the forest for the trees.\u201d She tried to sound flip. Cheerful was simply too much to ask for.</p><p>John Paul was sympathetic. \u201cDo you want to rest?\u201d</p><p>Is the Pope Catholic? Does it always rain on picnics? Hell, yes, she wanted to rest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said weakly. Then, more forcefully, \u201cI\u2019m good to go . . . unless you want to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we still heading north?\u201d she asked, stalling for another minute to catch her breath. The air was so thin, she felt light-headed. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to get my bearings. If the sun were out . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going northeast.\u201d</p><p>One foot in front of the other, she told herself. Steady as you go. Come on, Delaney, pick up the pace. Time\u2019s a-wasting. Suck it up.</p><p>She kept up the steady barrage of psychological nagging as she ran through the forest. She tried not to think about her soggy underwear sticking to her skin or the fact that she was lugging around at least a pound of mud on each of her hiking boots.</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite clear the dead branch she tried to jump over, tripped, and would have gone headfirst into a tree trunk if John Paul hadn\u2019t grabbed her. The terrain was getting steeper, more treacherous. As she raced along, the muscles of her calves began to burn, and she was finally forced to slow down when they broke through the trees.</p><p>She suddenly stopped. They had reached a shelf of rock that hung out over the side of the mountain. Spread out before them was a panoramic view of the lower hills. Lush green meadows were tucked in between towering peaks with hundreds and hundreds of trees, their branches stretching toward heaven. Everything was so green, so alive. And not a soul was around. People surely flocked to this paradise, didn\u2019t they? So where were they all hiding?</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it picturesque?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s picturesque,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Desperately trying to stay positive, she said, \u201cIs your cup always half empty? Can\u2019t you appreciate\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cHave you noticed where we are? It\u2019s going to take us a couple of days to get back to civilization.\u201d He studied the lay of the land below looking for roads, but he wasn\u2019t having any luck. He had, at least, gotten his bearings back.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much time,\u201d she said. Her shoulders slumped, and as she looked around her, the beauty suddenly turned menacing, and the realization of their predicament sank in. Could it get any more bleak? She wanted to cry, but she didn\u2019t give in to the urge. Suck it up, she told herself. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she asserted.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What makes you think so?\u201d</p><p>She had to think about it for a minute before she could come up with anything. \u201cBecause we\u2019re due for a break.\u201d</p><p>And that was when it started raining again.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>ANNE WAS ONE OF THE MOST UPTIGHT, RIGID WOMEN Carrie had ever met. She was certain the woman wouldn\u2019t be at all helpful, but she was proven wrong. Anne more than held her own. After she finished tying together the sheets, she helped them with the wall. She was a hard worker, with surprising stamina. She didn\u2019t have any sense of humor, but then, there really wasn\u2019t anything to laugh about, was there? As long as Anne\u2019s sacred marriage wasn\u2019t discussed, she was almost pleasant to be around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was also the woman in charge, giving them orders as they worked side by side. Punching a large hole through the Sheetrock with a fireplace poker didn\u2019t take any time at all. The insulation was messy but not difficult to remove. They filled a leaf bag with the stuffing. Luckily, there weren\u2019t any wires or pipes in the area they uncovered. Next, they sliced through the sheathing with kitchen knives.</p><p>Then they got to work on the boards. That was a bitch. Carrie had to take a break when her thumb started bleeding. While Anne removed the splinter with her tweezers and bandaged the cut, Sara took over.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock in the morning, they were all worn-out.</p><p>Sara and Carrie had Band-Aids on every finger. Anne still looked like a fashion plate. Her nails weren\u2019t even chipped.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the sheet rope coming?\u201d Sara asked. She pushed the sleeves of her striped blouse up to her elbows and fell into the chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ready to use,\u201d Anne said. She placed a bowl of tomato soup in front of Sara and then went back to the stove to fill Carrie\u2019s bowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too tired to eat,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to keep up your strength,\u201d Anne told her as she placed her bowl on the table.</p><p>Sara noticed Anne take two pills out of her pocket. She turned her back on them when she put them in her mouth and drank a glass of water.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you just take?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d Anne answered as she took her seat across from Carrie.</p><p>\u201cAspirin?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Anne said just as Sara shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot aspirin. They were pink capsules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very observant,\u201d Anne remarked. \u201cThey\u2019re prescription medication for nausea. I\u2019m just getting over a bout of illness.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie was barely listening. She had one elbow propped on the table, resting her head in her hand. She was too beat to care about table etiquette.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of illness?\u201d Sara asked. She was swirling the soup with her spoon.</p><p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI found this tiny little bump about eighteen months ago, and I told Eric about it. He went with me to the doctor,\u201d she explained. \u201cAs it turned out, it was no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>Sara was watching Anne\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhere did you find this little bump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my right breast,\u201d she said. \u201cI had the biopsy and then got on with my life. Like I said, it was no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t malignant,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>Carrie wondered why she was persisting with the subject. Hadn\u2019t Anne just told them everything was all right? She thought Sara was being nosy.</p> <p>\u201cShe just said . . .\u201d Carrie began.</p><p>Sara didn\u2019t look at Carrie as she nudged her under the table. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t malignant?\u201d She repeated the question.</p><p>Anne looked at her soup when she answered. \u201cJust a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Carrie straightened. \u201cIs that what the doctors said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know how doctors are,\u201d Anne said. She waved her hand as she added, \u201cThey\u2019re all alarmists. Eric said they only make money if they can do a lot of procedures . . . and surgeries . . . when it isn\u2019t at all necessary.\u201d</p><p>Carrie glanced at Sara before she asked, \u201cDid they recommend surgery, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but Eric said they would, and of course he was right. They thought they could talk me into having my breast removed. Can you imagine what that would have done to our insurance premiums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what would it have done?\u201d Sara asked.</p><p>\u201cThe rate would have gone sky high. Besides, the insurance company wouldn\u2019t have paid for the little procedure anyway.\u201d</p><p>Removing a breast was a little procedure? Carrie was too stunned to speak. She picked up her spoon and pretended to eat.</p><p>\u201cEric had made some wonderful investments with our cash surplus. He\u2019s so clever,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were good, sound investments that I, of course, approved when he told me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter he made the investments?\u201d Sara asked. \u201cHe told you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has carte blanche. I mean, he is an equal partner in the business.\u201d</p><p>Carrie and Sara could see Anne\u2019s spine stiffening. She was becoming defensive. Sara took a taste of the soup and then said, \u201cGood choice for dinner, Anne. I love tomato soup.\u201d</p><p>Anne smiled. \u201cI do too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you think the insurance company wouldn\u2019t pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreexisting condition,\u201d Anne explained. \u201cThe old insurance policy had lapsed, and the new one Eric found that had a much more reasonable premium didn\u2019t begin for thirty days. I had the biopsy during that period where they could say it was preexisting. Eric told me to wait, but I was foolishly anxious. We had the money to pay for the procedure,\u201d she hastily added, \u201cif we had believed it was necessary. He did a lot of research on the Internet, and we decided to explore alternative methods. Your soup is getting cold, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout this\u2014\u201d Carrie began. Sara kicked her under the table.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Anne asked. That guarded look was back in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre there any crackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very lucky to have Eric,\u201d Sara said.</p><p>Carrie choked on her soup. \u201cYes, you are,\u201d she lied. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he couldn\u2019t go to the spa with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk him into it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me the week\u2019s stay as a surprise for my birthday. He wanted me to rest and relax, and when I got back home, we were going to go back to the doctors and see what needed to be done. I was worried about what all this would cost, but Eric wouldn\u2019t listen. He said that if we had to spend every penny to get me well, then that\u2019s what we would do.\u201d</p><p>That son of a bitch, Carrie thought to herself. He was getting rid of her, but Anne, perhaps still in shock, couldn\u2019t accept the truth, and so she painted this lovely picture of her adoring husband. Had he left her a letter, or did he want her to die without knowing he was responsible?</p><p>\u201cWe should be on our way before dawn,\u201d Sara said, interrupting Carrie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMy hands are raw, and so are yours. Getting down that rope . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can manage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne, did you bring any workout clothes?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t go tromping down the mountain in high heels or the slippers you\u2019re wearing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween Sara and me, we\u2019ll be able to outfit you properly,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>Her whole attitude toward Anne had undergone a radical change. She found herself feeling protective and hoping that Anne stayed in denial until they reached civilization.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pack us some food to take along,\u201d Carrie suggested to Anne. \u201cAnd a first-aid kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could use my fanny pack,\u201d Sara said. \u201cIt\u2019s on my dresser, but I don\u2019t have the energy to go upstairs to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll get it. I love being useful. Don\u2019t touch those dishes,\u201d Anne ordered as she hurried out of the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll wash them later.\u201d</p><p>The second Anne was out of earshot, Sara whispered, \u201cThat bastard.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got another reason for wanting to get out of this alive. I\u2019m going to kill that son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Sara nodded. \u201cYou hold the gun, and I\u2019ll pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>SOMETHING WAS GROWLING, AND IT DEFINITELY WASN\u2019T human. Avery scooted closer to John Paul. Promising her she could have twenty minutes to rest, he had found shelter for them under a jutting rock. The ground was dry, and the area was wide and deep enough for him to stretch his legs.</p><p>Avery had lobbied for finding a cave. John Paul had vetoed that idea because he didn\u2019t want any unexpected company, like mountain lions or bears, sharing the space.</p><p>She suggested a fire, but he vetoed that idea too. The smoke could be seen from miles away.</p><p>She heard the growl again. It seemed closer. She nudged John Paul and whispered, \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He sounded half asleep. He was sitting up with his back against the rock, his long muscular legs stretched in front of him, one ankle crossed over the other. He put his arm around her and told her to relax.</p><p>Her head was down on his shoulder, and every now and then his chin would rub against the top of her head. She couldn\u2019t decide if he was being affectionate or if the day\u2019s growth of whiskers made his skin itch.</p><p>Another rustling noise came from below them. She tensed in reaction. Then she thought she heard something growl again. What in heaven\u2019s name was it? A bear? A mountain lion? What?</p><p>John Paul had his gun on the ground next to him, and his hand rested on the handle.</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried not to think about how uncomfortable she was. Think positive, she told herself. Keep that cup full. Be an optimist.</p><p>Oh, God, we\u2019re gonna die out here. She sighed then. So much for being an optimist. He must have felt her shivering because he began to rub her arm. She thought that was sweet. She really did try to relax, but anxiety was keeping her mind revved up. Could a body be too exhausted to rest? When she\u2019d sat down, she had been close to collapsing, and she knew she had to rest if she wanted to be able to run again.</p><p>What would the woman do about Carrie and the others now? Was John Paul right? Were they already dead?</p><p>She forced the thought aside and once again tried to get comfortable. Every muscle in her body ached, and her toes throbbed. She tried to take her boots off, but John Paul stopped her. Her feet needed to acclimate to the wet boots, and all she had to do was walk off the cramps. He acted like an authority, and since she knew he\u2019d had survival training while in the Marines, she acquiesced. Besides, she\u2019d been too weary to argue.</p><p>Avery was determined that, no matter what, she wouldn\u2019t turn into a cynic like her aunt and John Paul. When the rain had begun and John Paul had teased her because she\u2019d boasted that they were due for a break, she pointed out that the rain was a lovely, soft drizzle that brought with it a hazy fog, which, she insisted, was enchanting. Yep, that\u2019s what she\u2019d said. She\u2019d smiled too. Then the drizzle turned to a deluge. And still she tried to maintain her positive attitude. What more could happen? she reasoned. They were already wet.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the deluge turned into hail the size of golf balls, pelting their bodies as they ran into the protection of the trees.</p><p>More rustling noises pulled her back to the present. Had he heard the sound? She lifted her head from his shoulder and strained to hear. Fingers of gray light curled down through the branches as the rain continued.</p><p>His eyes were closed, but as she stared at him, they slowly opened. His gaze locked on hers. She was so thankful that he was there with her. She felt safe with him. She wasn\u2019t having to go through this nightmare alone, and his strength comforted her and gave her hope.</p><p>\u201cI want . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t get the rest of the words out, couldn\u2019t tell him how much she appreciated his help. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do too.\u201d</p><p>Later, she wasn\u2019t so certain who initiated the kiss. She knew she\u2019d leaned into him, and then his head had tilted down toward hers. Or had she pulled him close and had he merely accommodated her? She couldn\u2019t remember. Their mouths had just . . . merged.</p><p>And, oh, it felt wonderful. His mouth was so warm against hers, and, Lord, did he know how to get rid of a woman\u2019s defenses. He made her want much, much more. He was gentle and giving, yet rough and demanding at the same time. His hand cupped her chin, and he pressed it gently to let her know he wanted her to open her mouth for him.</p><p>She scooted up on his lap and wrapped her arms around his neck. When he began to caress her, she let go of her inhibitions, and her bones felt like Jell-O. She got quivers in her stomach. His tongue was driving her wild, making her want to be bolder.</p><p>The warmth of his touch radiated through her body. When he ended the kiss, she realized his hands were under her T-shirt. She knew he was as affected by the kiss as she was, for she could feel his heart beating rapidly under her fingertips.</p><p>She tried to get off his lap then, to retreat, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. He held her tightly against him, then gently pushed her head down on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know what would be real nice now?\u201d he whispered in that gruff, sexy tone of voice.</p><p>She was still trying to catch her breath. The taste of him lingered on her lips, and she was replaying every second of that powerful kiss in her mind.</p><p>The question suddenly penetrated. \u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou want sex.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word for a long minute, acting as though he was taking his time to think it over. \u201cWell, yeah. That would be nice too, I guess. Sugar, if you\u2019re offering, I\u2019m not gonna turn you down.\u201d She wasn\u2019t looking at him, so he knew it was safe to smile. \u201cBut what I really want is a cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. He got his chin out of her way in the nick of time. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking a cheeseburger would be nice about now. And french fries and a cold beer,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThe shrubs weren\u2019t enough for you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThey weren\u2019t shrubs. Those were edible leaves and berries I made you eat. They\u2019ll give us energy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I still want a cheeseburger. My brother-in-law got me hooked on junk food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were really thinking about food?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYeah, I was, but if you\u2019re desperate to have sex, I guess I could accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want to have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you did.\u201d</p><p>He was exasperating. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you kissed me,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cSo I just assumed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you can\u2019t keep your hands off me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>No wonder love and hate were so closely linked. Right now, she wanted to strangle him. He enjoyed making her squirm, seemed to be getting a real kick out of it.</p><p>She really wanted to have the last word. \u201cIt was just a meaningless kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how come you got all hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Only he could make the insult sound like a caress. \u201cDid you get all hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNow who\u2019s lying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first rule in any operation is to tell as few lies as possible. Now try to rest. Ten more minutes and we\u2019re moving.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t rest, not until she relaxed, and there was only one way to do that. She moved away from John Paul, assumed the lotus position she\u2019d learned from her yoga instructor, put her hands on her knees, palms up, straightened her back, and closed her eyes. She concentrated on her breathing, deep cleansing breaths, forcing herself to block the noises of the forest and the thoughts rushing through her mind. It took a good five minutes before she could feel her muscles easing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His question pulled her back. \u201cI\u2019m doing my relaxation exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoga?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSort of. I clear my mind, then I go . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Home, she thought, I go to my imaginary perfect home. She answered, \u201cI go to my happy place. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cYeah? So you were serious about that? I thought you were joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picture a place that makes me feel good. It\u2019s a porch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I see myself sitting on this swing. I can smell lilacs, and I can hear water in the background. It\u2019s . . . soothing, and it frees my mind. Then I start filtering through the data I\u2019ve collected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever works,\u201d he drawled.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t understand, but then she didn\u2019t expect him to. She closed her eyes again, ignoring him now, and once again concentrated on her breathing.</p><p>Another couple of minutes passed, and she began to let the bits and pieces of the puzzle come together. Ironically, it was something that John Paul had said that got her mind racing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She stretched her legs and then turned to him. \u201cThe first rule of an operation is not to lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said tell as few lies as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I meant. Why is that a rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies can come back to bite you . . . trip you up. So . . .\u201d</p> <p>She took it from there. \u201cSo, if you stick to the truth on all the little things that don\u2019t matter, you won\u2019t get tripped up. Oh, my God, of course.\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly as excited as a kid in a toy store. She unzipped her jacket pocket and pulled out a soggy map.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. Monk could have read about the property in the paper, and when Carrie asked him where he was taking her, he came up with that name. I assumed he was lying. Why wouldn\u2019t I assume that? He\u2019d lied about everything else, but John Paul, what if he was telling her the truth?\u201d</p><p>Her babbling worried him. \u201cAre you getting punchy?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it still all makes sense anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know where Carrie and those other women are.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement gained his full attention. \u201cYou think you know? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie told me where Monk was taking her.\u201d</p><p>One eyelid dropped. \u201cAnd you\u2019re only now mentioning that fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought he\u2019d lied to her. I told you my aunt left me a message on my machine, and I erased it, and you heard my question to Cannon, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you ask him if there was a water problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cannon said, no, not at Utopia. I also asked him if the spa owned a house in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>John Paul nodded. \u201cI remember his answer was no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he said no, I didn\u2019t ask any other questions about the house. Carrie called it a retreat. I assumed that everything Monk told her was a lie. But what if it wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think he was telling the truth about their destination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you said. Why lie when you don\u2019t have to? Lies have a way of coming back to bite you.\u201d She repeated his very words. \u201cMonk already had grabbed her, right? And he\u2019d already told her his name. She was meekly going along, probably without a care in the world. But she called me on her cell phone from the ladies\u2019 room. And I doubt she would have told Monk she\u2019d made the call. There wouldn\u2019t have been any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Monk had told her where he was really taking her, he wouldn\u2019t have let her out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t go with her into the ladies\u2019 room,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd he might not have known she had one of her cell phones with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of her cell phones?\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cShe carries two at all times. Carrie\u2019s a workaholic, and it makes her crazy if the battery runs down. Besides, she uses one for personal and the other for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could just carry an extra battery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she does,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth? I think you\u2019re reaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m analyzing the data, and I think we have at least a fifty percent chance I\u2019m right. We have to check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where this house is?\u201d</p><p>While he opened the map, she told him about the old gentleman who sat with her in McDonald\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see the circle he made.\u201d</p><p>Avery then told him about the couple who were fighting over ownership. \u201cThe judge is supposed to decide soon which one of the thoroughly unpleasant couple gets the house. He also told me the place has been vacant for weeks.\u201d</p><p>John Paul slowly nodded. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s worth a look. Break\u2019s over. Time to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to a phone. That\u2019s the first order of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe first order of business is staying alive so we can get to a phone.\u201d</p><p>And that, he knew, was easier said than done.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>NOW THAT THE THREE WOMEN WERE FINALLY READY TO leave, they were immobilized with fear.</p><p>It was four o\u2019clock in the morning, and they estimated that they had approximately two hours before dawn. They huddled together at the kitchen table, dressed for the forest in layers of clothes, sipping hot tea to fortify them against the night air. A frigid breeze poured into the kitchen from the hole in the pantry wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Monk put down trip wires or something?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cWhat do we do then? We won\u2019t see them in the dark.\u201d</p><p>They all worried about the possibility, and then Sara said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d take the time to climb up the side of the mountain. I\u2019m sure he thinks he\u2019s got us locked in tight.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was so scared, she was trembling. \u201cListen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. We\u2019re all going to make it,\u201d Sara said, but her voice lacked conviction.</p><p>\u201cLet me say this,\u201d Carrie insisted. \u201cIf I die, I want you two to promise me you\u2019ll make the police find Avery and protect her. Call my husband,\u201d she added. \u201cTony will want to help keep Avery . . .\u201d Her voice caught on a sob, and she couldn\u2019t go on.</p><p>\u201cFocus on one worry at a time,\u201d Sara suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Anne said. \u201cConcentrate on climbing down the rope.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cYes, all right.\u201d She pushed her teacup away and stood. \u201cWe should go now. No more stalling.\u201d</p><p>Anne grabbed Carrie\u2019s hand. \u201cEverything is going to be fine. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Carrie squeezed her hand. Uh-oh. Anne\u2019s eyes were getting that glassy look. She had probably taken one of her pain pills. When Carrie had searched the upstairs for a way out, she\u2019d noticed the bottles of medications lined up on Anne\u2019s vanity. There were enough to start a small pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cDid you remember to put your medicines in your jacket?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could put some of the bottles in my jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Anne assured her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the letters,\u201d Sara asked Carrie. \u201cDid you zip them in your pocket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Sara said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>They had already decided that Sara should go first. One end of the sheeted rope was anchored to the kitchen table, which couldn\u2019t be pulled through the doorway, but Carrie and Anne were still going to hold the rope while Sara lowered herself to the ground. Anne had tied big knots twelve inches apart so they would have something to grab.</p><p>Carrie was the second one to go because Anne had argued that since she weighed the least of the three, she stood the best chance of getting down on her own if the rope came loose from the table.</p><p>Carrie had wanted to go last, but Anne wouldn\u2019t hear of it. \u201cIf the rope doesn\u2019t hold or I fall, you and Sara could maybe catch me, but I couldn\u2019t help catch you or Sara. I have to go last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, don\u2019t think about falling. You made a good, strong rope, Anne. It\u2019s going to hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll all be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Anne sounded obscenely cheerful. Was she getting nuts again, or was the pain pill responsible?</p><p>Sara led the way into the pantry. Carrie and Anne watched as she picked up the end of the rope and tied it around her waist. \u201cI hope this is long enough.\u201d</p><p>Sara got down on her knees, then scooted to the opening. \u201cGet down on your stomach,\u201d Carrie whispered. \u201cAnd go out slowly, feetfirst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put the penlight in your pocket?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Carrie sat on the floor and braced herself with her feet against the two-by-fours. Anne got behind her to help hold the rope. Just when Carrie thought Sara was never going to reach the ground, the sheet went limp. Carrie fell back against Anne. Recovering her balance, she took a deep breath and said, \u201cGuess it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>She rolled onto her stomach and scooted to the edge.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anne whispered. She grabbed Carrie\u2019s jacket, shoved a thick envelope in the pocket, and zipped it closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the strongest of the three of us, so if Sara and I don\u2019t make it, you make sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Carrie prodded. \u201cCome on. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make sure. Now go.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t waste time arguing. She would find out what Anne meant after they\u2019d gotten away from the house.</p><p>Her hands were bleeding and raw, and she was too frightened to cry. She slowly lowered herself down. Anne tried to help, but when she tried to pull up on the rope so she could get a better grip, she almost went out the opening headfirst.</p><p>Carrie made it to the ground.</p><p>The rope went slack and Anne fell back. Quickly straightening, she looked down, trying to see the two women. She stayed on her hands and knees for a moment and listened to the soft calls from below.</p><p>Then she pulled the rope up. She backed away from the opening. \u201cThree blind mice, three blind mice,\u201d she sang. \u201cSee how they run, See how they run . . .\u201d</p><p>She stood up, brushed the dirt off her borrowed sweatpants, and walked into the kitchen. \u201cSee how they run,\u201d she sang. Odd, that that particular melody had popped into her head and wouldn\u2019t let go. She and Eric had decided never to have children, yet now she was singing a silly nursery rhyme. Her father used to sing that song to her. How did the rest of it go? Was it, \u201cThey all ran after the farmer\u2019s wife, she cut off their heads with a carving knife\u201d? Or was it, \u201cThey all ran away from the farmer\u2019s wife\u201d? And why couldn\u2019t she remember the rest of the song?</p><p>\u201cThree blind mice,\u201d she sang softly as she knelt down and tried to get the knots out of the sheet. Realizing she could break a nail, she got up, went to the counter to get the scissors Carrie had brought down, and cut the rope from the table leg.</p><p>\u201cThree blind mice.\u201d She stood again, paused to take a drink of her lukewarm tea, and then, because she knew that Carrie and Sara were anxiously waiting for her, she walked to the opening in the pantry and dropped the sheets down. They surely couldn\u2019t misinterpret what that meant, for she\u2019d tossed away her only lifeline. She heard one of them cry out, thought it must be Sara, for, of the two women, Sara seemed a tad more tenderhearted.</p><p>\u201cThree blind mice. My goodness, I can\u2019t get that silly tune out of my head,\u201d she said as she shut the pantry door. Noticing the messy kitchen, she went to the sink, filled it with soapy, hot water, and did the dishes. When she was finished, she straightened the table and chairs, put fresh place mats in front of each chair, then blew out the candles and headed for the stairs.</p><p>She was feeling so tired and old and haggard. A good long nap would fix that, she thought. But first things first. She simply had to do something about her sorry appearance. She couldn\u2019t understand how fashion-minded women with money, like Carrie and Sara, could ever wear sweatpants. Why, even the name was offensive. Ladies shouldn\u2019t sweat. They shouldn\u2019t even perspire. Only common, coarse women did such disgusting things as sweating and belching and body piercing . . . or letting others, like doctors, mutilate their bodies for them. Hadn\u2019t her loving Eric told her that was how he felt? He adored her body and couldn\u2019t stand what the surgeon wanted to do.</p><p>Feeling a bit light-headed, Anne gripped the banister as she slowly made her way upstairs. After she took a long, hot shower, she curled her hair with her curling iron, then brushed it and lacquered it in place with hairspray. It seemed to take an hour to decide which of her new St. John knit suits to wear. The mint green with the adorable silver clasps won because she thought it was both elegant and chic. Slipping into her silver pearlized high heels, she picked up her favorite platinum-rimmed diamond earrings and put them on. The diamonds were a gift from Eric on their last anniversary.</p><p>She\u2019d walked all the way down the hallway before she remembered she hadn\u2019t put on any perfume. Retracing her steps, she squirted a dab on each wrist. Sighing with contentment, she hurried downstairs but stopped on the bottom step. The rising sun had turned the living room into a golden temple. The color took her breath away. Eric should be here to see this, she thought. Yes, he should.</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t know how long she stood there. Ten minutes might have passed, or twenty, maybe more. The effects of the second prescription pain pill had finally caught up with her, and she zigzagged across the living room, giggling because she found it so amusing that she couldn\u2019t walk in a straight line. Was this what it felt like to be stoned? Was she stoned? Trying to focus, she reached the sofa and plopped down. She fell asleep seconds later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although she hadn\u2019t realized such a thing was possible, she knew she had wept while she slept because, when she awakened, her face was wet with tears. She struggled to sit up and wiped the dampness away with her fingertips. Noticing the makeup on her hands, she\u2019d decided to go back upstairs to powder her face again when she thought she heard the sound of a car coming up the drive. Still somewhat disoriented, she staggered to her feet, adjusted the lapels of her jacket, and walked into the dining room to look out the window at the circle drive. Her gate was stiff and unsteady.</p><p>A silver Cadillac DeVille came screeching around the curve. \u201cNow, who could that be calling at such an early hour?\u201d Anne asked. She checked the time on her Bulgari watch\u2014another gift from her beloved Eric\u2014and was astonished to see that it was after nine in the morning.</p><p>Anne stepped back into the shadows as the car came to a rocking stop. The door opened and a woman with the most frightful look on her face leapt out. She slammed the door shut, then opened the back door.</p><p>The woman looked vaguely familiar, but Anne couldn\u2019t remember where she might have seen her before. Her face was contorted with rage, and though Anne couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying, she knew she was talking because her lips were moving.</p> <p>Was she Jilly? The stranger did have blond hair, and she was tall and shapely, as Carrie had described, but she certainly wasn\u2019t what Anne would consider beautiful by any means. Perhaps, if her expression weren\u2019t so hostile and if she were smiling instead, she might be pretty. But not beautiful.</p><p>Her complexion was lovely. She\u2019d give her that. From a distance it looked almost flawless, and Anne decided she really must find out what kind of facial cleanser the woman used to get such perfect skin. Or was it heavy makeup? Anne made a mental note to find out.</p><p>Her haircut was a little too short and spiky, but the color was wonderful. Highlights, Anne thought, and she wondered if the unpleasant woman would give her the name of her stylist. Why, she\u2019d kill to have highlights like that. Suddenly feeling self-conscious about her own appearance, she patted her hair down, certain she\u2019d gotten it mussed during her little nap.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Anne whispered when she saw what the woman was carrying. She had a red gasoline can in one hand and an ax in the other. \u201cWhat does she think she\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s head was down, and she hadn\u2019t spotted Anne yet, but as she strode to the steps, Anne remembered where she\u2019d seen her before. She was pictured in one of the clippings she\u2019d found in the chest. Oh, yes, she remembered now. The woman and her ex were fighting over ownership of this house.</p> <p>Anne rushed to the foyer and stood in front of the elongated beveled glass panes that framed the door. She could hear what the woman was saying now. She was spewing filth. Anne\u2019s hand went to her throat. She was appalled by the vulgarity. The woman must have said the \u201cF\u201d word a good ten times, enraged at a judge for giving her house away.</p><p>Ah . . . now Anne understood. The house had been awarded to the husband. Anne didn\u2019t have any sympathy for the crude woman. She obviously hadn\u2019t been a good wife. Shouldn\u2019t the husband make all the important decisions? He\u2019d paid for the house. He should keep it.</p><p>The woman rushed up the porch steps, screaming now. \u201cThat son of a bitch thinks he\u2019s going to take my house and leave me penniless? Screw the prenup. He thinks I\u2019m bluffing. I told him he\u2019d never live here. Surprise, surprise, bastard. When I\u2019m finished redecorating . . .\u201d She spotted Anne and came to a dead stop. Then she roared, \u201cWho the hell are you, and what are you doing in my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello there,\u201d Anne called out. \u201cWhat are you doing with that ax and that can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your fu**ing business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really would appreciate it if you wouldn\u2019t use obscenities in my presence. It offends me.\u201d</p> <p>The woman put the can of gasoline down, dropped the ax, and reached into her pocket to get her key out.</p><p>\u201cDid the bastard hire a housekeeper?\u201d she yelled loudly enough so that Anne could hear through the door.</p><p>\u201cI assure you I\u2019m not a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the fu**ing door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>The woman shoved the key in the lock and tried to turn it. When she realized it wouldn\u2019t work, she screamed, \u201cDamn him to hell. How dare he change the lock. How dare he. He knew . . . He had that judge in his pocket. Well, f*ck him.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the key out of the lock, threw it down and glared at Anne. \u201cIf you don\u2019t open this door, I\u2019m going to use this ax. You don\u2019t want to mess with me, bitch. Not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOpen the damned door.\u201d</p><p>The sneer was the last straw. Tears flooded into Anne\u2019s eyes as she swung the door open and forced a smile. \u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>There was a second\u2019s delay, long enough for the woman to shove Anne back and step over the threshold.</p><p>The explosion blew half the mountain away.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>KEEPING UP WITH JILLY WAS A FULL-TIME JOB, BUT MONK found it thoroughly exhilarating. He hadn\u2019t felt this alive in years. He was the cautious one, of course, while she, with the enthusiasm of a novice, planned her grand schemes, never worrying about the little mundane things, like the FBI tracking one of the credit cards she\u2019d used.</p><p>Monk couldn\u2019t fault her for making that mistake. He blamed himself because he should have destroyed the cards after he\u2019d used them. He kept all of his credit cards under various names and addresses in his attach\u00e9 case, and Jilly had simply helped herself to the first ones her hand touched.</p><p>The result hadn\u2019t been as bad as it could have been, though. John Paul Renard was now involved, and Monk was absolutely delighted about that turn of events. He\u2019d known that Renard was trying to track his movements for over a year. He\u2019d intercepted several inquiries Renard had made to various law enforcement agencies in Europe. Now Monk had the opportunity to get rid of the pest before he caused real trouble, and Monk could humor Jilly at the same time.</p><p>Before they\u2019d settled on using Utopia to bring the women to Aspen, his beautiful fianc\u00e9e had had the time of her life, sitting at the table hour upon hour, poring over her notes. Oh, how she loved the intrigue, the excitement, and most of all, the danger, and she was trying to teach Monk how to have fun too. Whenever he did anything to please her, such as agreeing to last-minute changes in her complicated plans, she aptly rewarded him in creative ways. All of them of a sexual nature. Just thinking about some of the things she\u2019d done to him and allowed him to do to her made him blush like a teenager.</p><p>She was turning him into a true romantic, but he didn\u2019t view that as a weakness, for his obsession was with Jilly and no other. He believed with all his heart that, if the erotic games they played in bed didn\u2019t kill him, they would grow old together.</p><p>Oh, yes, she was an obsession. His every waking minute was spent thinking about her, protecting her from harm. As long as he maintained his vigilance and cleaned up her mistakes, they would be safe.</p><p>Monk had had to talk Jilly out of one scheme. She had briefly toyed with the idea of kidnapping Avery and sitting down with her to tell her the truth about Carrie. Jilly was such an innocent. She believed she could convert her daughter. Monk gently explained that, after all the years of brainwashing by Carrie, Jilly would never be able to convince her daughter that she was, in reality, a loving mother.</p><p>Jilly wasn\u2019t perfect by any means. She had a twisted view of motherhood, for she believed that because she had brought Avery into this world, she owned her. She spoke of Avery as her possession, not a person, and Carrie had taken that precious treasure away from her. For years her anger at her sister had festered, but Jilly was patient when it came to vengeance. No matter how long it took, she would get even.</p><p>She insisted on being the one to push the button that would blow the house apart. She promised Monk she wouldn\u2019t shed a tear over her sister\u2019s death. Carrie had brought this on herself. She was the reason Jilly hadn\u2019t succeeded in life; she was the reason Avery hated her. She was the reason for every one of Jilly\u2019s failures. And so it was only fair that Jilly get to watch her sister die.</p><p>Monk wasn\u2019t put off by Jilly\u2019s brutal honesty. How could he cast the first stone? She had accepted him with all his sins, and he could do no less for her.</p><p>Now he was trying to clean up the mistakes at the abandoned mine. Jilly had been sure they would climb down into the shaft to find the next clue as to Carrie\u2019s whereabouts, and then Monk could have dropped a couple of explosives into the hole, sealed it, and followed Jilly back to the retreat.</p><p>Monk hadn\u2019t believed Renard would go into the shaft, and he had been proven right. He had thought, however, that he could get a clear shot at the two and toss the bodies down the hole, but he missed his chance when they scrambled up the rocks and leapt into the river.</p><p>He was methodically tracking them now. He\u2019d lost precious time backtracking to his vehicle and crossing the river, but with his car he\u2019d been able to make up some time by speeding down the mountain road and cutting back to where he anticipated they\u2019d be heading.</p><p>Renard hadn\u2019t left any tracks, but then Monk knew all about the ex-Marine and hadn\u2019t expected less. When he\u2019d done his research on his stalker, he\u2019d read his history, and he\u2019d been impressed. He believed that under different circumstances they could have become friends. They were, after all, very much alike. They were both professional killers. Monk had murdered for money, while Renard killed for honor. That didn\u2019t make him superior, however. If anything, Monk believed it made him a fool.</p><p>Still, he would have liked to have had the opportunity to sit down with him, share some cold beers and talk about their past exploits. But Renard would never go for that. The man was too honorable for his own good. According to his sealed file, which Monk had gotten unsealed, Renard was suffering from burnout. Monk didn\u2019t believe such nonsense. He thought Renard had left the job when he realized he was beginning to enjoy the power he felt every time he pulled the trigger. Honor be damned.</p><p>Was Renard as curious about him? Did he fantasize about sitting down to discuss the thrill of the hunt, the exhilaration of the kill? Monk wished he could find out. Maybe if he was able to wound him, paralyze him, then Monk could sit down beside him and chat it up like old friends until Renard bled out. Wouldn\u2019t that be something, to talk to an equal, to commiserate, to boast?</p><p>Monk chuckled. Now who was fantasizing? He checked the time and then shook his head. If he didn\u2019t spot the couple soon, he would have to get to his car and drive to where Jilly waited. She was anxious to get back to the little mountain retreat to see how her sister was holding up. By now, the three women had probably turned on one another like polecats, each one slowly going out of her mind with terror. That was what Jilly hoped anyway.</p><p>Stop daydreaming and get back to business, he told himself. He lifted his high-powered binoculars and scanned the terrain once again. He was turning toward the north when he saw the observation tower in the distance, maybe a mile away. Climbing down was a forest ranger. Monk watched until the man was standing on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d he whispered as he calculated. \u201cJust my size.\u201d</p><p>Exactly one hour later he was leaning over the rail at the top of the tower, scanning the hills. Looking down at the bushes below he saw the white T-shirt of the forest ranger he\u2019d shot in the temple and then stripped.</p><p>He was just about ready to give up the chase when he suddenly spotted the couple. Avery\u2019s blond hair, so like her mother\u2019s, shimmered gold in the sunlight. Monk couldn\u2019t believe his good fortune. There they were, all right, walking down the mountain as pretty as you please, looking as ragged and worn-out as any two people he\u2019d ever seen. His burst of laughter echoed around him. Wait until he told Jilly. He knew what she would say. She\u2019d tell him he was an exceedingly lucky man.</p><p>He\u2019d agree, of course, even though he knew luck had very little to do with finding his prey. After poring over his map, he\u2019d anticipated that if they survived the white water, they would get out before that tremendous drop below Coward\u2019s Crossing.</p><p>Monk decided to meet them head-on. He climbed down the ladder and walked around to the path, his head down, the bill of his cap concealing his face.</p><p>When he reached the wide-open space between the trees, he ever so slowly turned and pretended to notice them near the peak. He raised his hand to wave.</p><p>Avery heard John Paul behind her. \u201cFall down, Avery. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. Pretending to stumble, she went down on one knee. John Paul caught up with her and dropped to put his arm around her shoulders to steady her.</p><p>\u201cAct like you hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Rolling to her side, she clutched her ankle and gave an exaggerated grimace. She wanted to cry from disappointment. \u201cHe\u2019s not a forest ranger, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She kept rubbing her ankle. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw his rifle. Forest rangers don\u2019t have scopes on their rifles.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYou saw the scope from this far away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun caught it just right,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s him. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s Monk, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking he might be is enough for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna help you stand. You lean against me, and we start down the hill again, but we\u2019ll angle toward the west. When we reach the trees, we run like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to answer, but hauled her up, lightly bracing her against his side.</p><p>\u201cLimp,\u201d he ordered gruffly as they once again started down the hill. They were walking like two drunks, staggering toward the west as they moved along.</p><p>He was deliberately keeping them out of Monk\u2019s range. He was sure now that the man dressed as a forest ranger was the killer because he hadn\u2019t moved from his spot at the base of the trail. Rangers were helpful, weren\u2019t they?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for us to get within firing range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh . . .\u201d</p><p>Her response made him smile. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, sugar. Start running.\u201d</p><p>She immediately bolted toward the safety of the trees. John Paul was right behind her, but he dared a quick look down below and saw Monk running toward them. They had a good head start. Avery led the way steadily downhill, hoping to intercept the road below Monk, all the way praying there would be campers or real forest rangers around who could help them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her ears were ringing. What was that sound? The wind whistling through the trees? Or was it the sound of gunfire sizzling? No, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>The noise stopped as suddenly as it had begun; then it started up again, but it was louder, shriller this time. It sounded like a whistle.</p><p>\u201cHear . . . that . . . ?\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>Then she heard a trumpet. Was she losing it? She kept running, her feet pounding into the soft earth as she raced along, still panting from her exertion.</p><p>The muscles in her legs were burning. Suddenly she lost her footing. She would have hurled headfirst into a gulley if John Paul hadn\u2019t reacted instinctively, lifting her off her feet as he kept stride.</p><p>He slowed as he let go of her, then kept pace just in case she went down again. All at once, they broke through the trees, crossed the road . . . and ran into the middle of Boy Scout Troop 183. Before he could stop, John Paul bowled over one pup tent and mowed down the troop master, who got the wind knocked out of him. The trumpet he was holding went flying into another tent.</p><p>\u201cCell phone,\u201d Avery shouted at the man sprawled on his back. \u201cWe need your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo signal up here,\u201d he answered as he came up on his elbows. His face was red with anger. \u201cWho in thunder do you people think . . .\u201d</p> <p>John Paul was frantically searching the road ahead of them. Monk wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about taking a couple of kids out as long as he could get his primary targets. One of the boys shouted when he saw the gun tucked into the back of John Paul\u2019s jeans. One blistering look from John Paul shut the boy up.</p><p>Avery dropped down on her knees next to the leader. \u201cListen to me. We need help. There\u2019s a killer coming this way. Where\u2019s your transportation? Answer me, please,\u201d she begged.</p><p>Her terror got through to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a camper here, but my Ford four-wheeler is parked about half a mile down the road. The keys are in my jacket in that tent over there, the one with the troop numbers painted on it.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was lifting Avery to her feet. \u201cGet in that camper and get your boys out of here,\u201d he yelled back at the man as he pulled Avery toward the next slope, staying well hidden in the trees.</p><p>\u201cGet to a phone and call for help,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Her legs were trembling, and she didn\u2019t think she had it in her to run much longer. Concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other, her heart feeling as though it were lodged in her throat, she suddenly remembered they hadn\u2019t gotten the keys.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to go back . . . the car keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow move it, sugar. You\u2019re starting to drag.\u201d</p><p>She fantasized about hiding somewhere and waiting for John Paul to come back with the car. She could find a spot where Monk wouldn\u2019t find her, couldn\u2019t she?</p><p>Suck it up. Damn it, I don\u2019t want to. I can do it. I can do it. She kept up the drill until the pain in her side became excruciating. She wondered if she could die upright. Sure she could.</p><p>Tears came into her eyes then, for she saw the old SUV parked in the gravel near the curve in the road. John Paul raced ahead of her. He broke the back window, reached in, and unlocked the front door.</p><p>Avery ran around to the other side as he unlocked the door for her. It took less than forty-five seconds for him to hot-wire the car, throw it into gear, and take off.</p><p>She was impressed. \u201cWere you a juvenile delinquent growing up?\u201d</p><p>The second they rounded the curve, she fell back against the seat and allowed herself to fall apart. A sob caught in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure sounded like you were.\u201d He gave her a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joyful.\u201d She hastily wiped the tears of relief from her cheeks.</p><p>He grinned. He had the very same feeling, but it didn\u2019t last long. \u201cHell,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe road\u2019s winding back around . . . he might be coming down, getting into position . . . ah, hell, that\u2019s what he\u2019s gonna do, and there isn\u2019t any way we can go off-road here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, pulled his gun out, and dropped it into his lap. He rolled down his window, then picked up the gun.</p><p>She frantically got her weapon out and then rolled down her window. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGetting ready just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get down and stay down. If he\u2019s coming at us, you\u2019ll be on his side.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his order. \u201cJust tell me when to start shooting. We\u2019ll keep him down until we get past.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like a great plan, and she\u2019d said it with gusto, but that was only because she didn\u2019t believe Monk could have gotten down the hills that quickly.</p><p>She was wrong about that. She spotted him before John Paul did.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell down,\u201d John Paul shouted.</p><p>Her response was to flip the safety off. Leaning against the door, she put her arm out the window, steadied the barrel of the gun on the side mirror, and waited. She ducked down as much as she could.</p><p>When Monk crouched down and swung the rifle up, John Paul shouted, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>They fired simultaneously, again and again as they sped toward the killer. Monk dove for cover, then scrambled to roll over and get his weapon up. Avery kept firing, pinning him down as they flew past.</p><p>The road suddenly curved up the mountain. There was a dirt road that angled sharply to the south that would have taken them farther down the mountain, but John Paul knew that, at the speed he was going, the SUV would roll if he tried to make the turn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d he said as he emptied the magazine.</p><p>She was turning to look when John Paul grabbed the back of her neck and shoved her down. \u201cGet on the floor,\u201d he ordered as the back window shattered.</p><p>They were still climbing and had reached another sharp curve when Monk blew out the left rear tire.</p><p>The car went into a spin. They careened off the road into the brush, narrowly missing a tree head-on, but finally stopping when they hit a rock.</p><p>\u201cMove it,\u201d he shouted as he leapt out of the car and raced around to the other side. Avery had no sense of where they were, only knew they were once again climbing. Her heartbeat, like the turbulent white water, was roaring in her ears. She raced up the steep slope, then skidded to a stop.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried.</p><p>John Paul stopped beside her. \u201cAh, hell.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to weep as she stared down at the swirling water below. No. Not again. Shaking her head, she said, \u201cI won\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t. You can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely sorry when he grabbed her. \u201cSure I can.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>PICTURESQUE, MY ASS. IF AVERY SAW ANOTHER WHITE-WATER anything, she thought she just might start screaming and never stop. At the moment, she was feeling malevolent toward pine trees too. Hated every one of them. She wasn\u2019t real fond of John Paul either. He had tossed her over the cliff like a discarded candy wrapper, and on the way down she had vowed that, if he survived, she\u2019d kill him, just for the sheer joy of it.</p><p>She knew she was being irrational. She didn\u2019t care. Her bad mood intensified when she cut her leg on a jagged rock. If they\u2019d been in the ocean, the blood pouring from her cut would have sounded the lunch bell for the neighboring sharks. Trying to stay positive as she fought to stay afloat, she told herself to be thankful there weren\u2019t any sharks around. And her leg didn\u2019t hurt all that much compared to the searing charley horse in her calf that nearly caused her to drown. John Paul hauled her onto the bank, half carried her into the trees so they wouldn\u2019t be seen, and then dropped her. She landed with a thud on her backside.</p><p>He dropped beside her. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d taken in more than enough water to fill a backyard swimming pool, she was too waterlogged to answer the absurd question. Shoving her hair out of her eyes, she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as the first jump, was it? I don\u2019t think that drop was more than twenty feet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou pushed me over a cliff.\u201d</p><p>Actually, he hadn\u2019t pushed her. As he recalled, he\u2019d thrown her so she wouldn\u2019t hit the rocks jutting out from the base of the cliff. He didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to mention that now, though. \u201cDid I have any other choice?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to admit that there really hadn\u2019t been any other alternative. Their guns were useless against a high-powered rifle, and Monk was hot on their trail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCup half empty, sugar? Where\u2019s that optimistic attitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the bottom of the river.\u201d</p><p>He stood and offered her his hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she had enough strength to even stand. She was so tired and cold and wet. Suck it up, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said as she grabbed hold. When he jerked her upright, she fell against him. He put his arm around her and held her tight while he made up his mind which direction they should go.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>She looked back toward the river. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll give up now.\u201d</p><p>John Paul shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t gonna happen. He\u2019s a professional. He\u2019s taken the contract, and he won\u2019t stop coming after us until . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe succeeds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until I kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote for the second option.\u201d</p><p>They both heard the sound of children\u2019s laughter. Avery pulled away from him and started running toward the noise. \u201cI hope they have a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt you can get a signal.\u201d</p><p>She actually smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s that negativity I so love. You had me worried, John Paul. For a minute there you were . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I was.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as though she\u2019d just insulted him. She was laughing as she ran toward the sound. The reason for her sudden good humor was either joy or hysteria. A family of five was setting up tents near a little stream.</p><p>After a brief explanation, everyone piled into the father\u2019s minivan and headed toward a town the man remembered he\u2019d driven through on the way up the mountain.</p><p>Thirty minutes later they reached the sleepy little community of Emerson. Downtown consisted of four streets. The father stopped the van in front of a two-story stone building. The second they got out of the van and closed the sliding door, the father sped away.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe you scared him,\u201d Avery remarked.</p><p>\u201cThe faster he can get his family away from us, the safer they\u2019ll all be.\u201d</p><p>There was a police station, which was surprising, considering the size of the town. Sharing the same building, the police station was squeezed in between the volunteer fire department on one end of the building and Bud\u2019s Burgers on the other. There were three doors facing the street with signs above each one. They walked through the middle door into a wide hall. Swinging doors were on both sides. One connected to the restaurant, and the other to the fire department. The police station was directly ahead.</p><p>The aroma of hamburgers and onions and french fries filled the air, but the smell didn\u2019t spur Avery\u2019s appetite. It actually made her nauseous. The lack of food, running for miles and miles, the cold, and the terror had taken their toll. She felt all used up. Getting from the door to the counter was suddenly more challenging than surviving the currents. Her feet felt as though they weighed a hundred pounds, and it took every ounce of stamina she had left to move at all.</p><p>John Paul could tell she was having trouble. She seemed to wilt before his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he put his arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI feel like rigor mortis has set in,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not dead, am I?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re still breathing.\u201d</p><p>He looked through the glass window and saw the police chief sitting behind his desk. There was a stack of papers on the blotter, and he was poring over them. Every couple of seconds he would glance up at a television mounted to the wall behind the counter. Dressed in navy pants and a white shirt with the name Chief Tyler on the pocket, the middle-aged man was frowning as he picked up a sheet of paper.</p><p>A woman in her late sixties stood behind the counter with her back to the door. Her hair was as white as Avery\u2019s face. She seemed mesmerized by the program on the television.</p><p>John Paul could hear her talking as he pushed the door open. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you something bad was going to happen? Didn\u2019t I tell you, Bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Verna. You told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t I tell you he brought this on himself?\u201d she asked. \u201cTearing out all those beautiful trees and digging away at the mountain just to build himself a fancy monument. It looks like Mother Nature decided to get even, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>The chief wasn\u2019t paying much attention. \u201cYes,\u201d he drawled as he continued to scan the sheet of paper in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, he\u2019s the villain. I feel sorry for his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean ex-wife, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He got rid of her so he could move on to a younger model. It\u2019s criminal, if you ask me. Poor thing. He got her used to living the high life, and then he yanks the rug right out from under her.\u201d</p><p>The chief was clearly exasperated. He dropped the paper on the desk and looked at the television. \u201c\u2018Poor thing\u2019? Didn\u2019t you see that interview they did with her last month? They had to bleep out every other word she said. I think he was crazy to ever marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how is she going to get along now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can get a job and work like the rest of us. Nobody put a gun to her head when she signed that prenup,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>John Paul and Avery had been listening from the doorway. They walked inside as Verna was telling the chief it was all a terrible shame. The chief spotted them, did a double take, and stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to listen,\u201d he said.</p><p>Avery pulled away from John Paul and walked over to the counter. Verna gasped, and her brown eyes widened as she approached.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Avery Delaney,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaking wet. What in heaven\u2019s name happened to you? You look like something my cat dragged in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Avery didn\u2019t know where to begin. She saw John Paul shake the policeman\u2019s hand and sit in the chair he offered. She decided she\u2019d let him do the explaining.</p><p>\u201cMay I use your phone?\u201d she asked. \u201cI need to call the FBI.\u201d</p><p>Verna\u2019s eyes now looked as if they were going to pop out of her face as she called over her shoulder, \u201cBud? The lady wants to call the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her use the phone,\u201d the chief said. He was leaning into the desk, listening intently as John Paul explained the situation.</p> <p>Verna placed an old-fashioned black phone on the counter. \u201cThere are showers on the second floor above the fire station and nice clean cots too. While you make your call, I\u2019ll go get a couple of blankets for you folks. Your lips are trembling. You\u2019re gonna get hypothermia if you aren\u2019t warmed up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>Avery picked up the phone and then put it back down. Exhausted, she couldn\u2019t remember the phone number to the pen. She closed her eyes to think about it. Was it three-nine-one or nine-three-one?</p><p>Maybe she could call Carter. What was his private number? Then she heard John Paul ask the chief if he had ever heard of a property called Land Between the Lakes.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in Colorado has heard about that property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow far away is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a distance from here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with all the Lookie-Lous out there, you won\u2019t be able to get close. By now, the police have the area sealed off. The best way to see it is on television.\u201d</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. He glanced at the screen.</p><p>Nine-three-one. That was it. Avery picked up the phone and started dialing. The receiver was halfway to her ear when she happened to look up at the television. She froze, the phone number once again forgotten.</p><p>A local newscaster announced that they had new footage of the disaster from a hiker just outside of Aspen who had captured the explosion with his video camera.</p><p>\u201cThe judge\u2019s decision was announced at eight-fifteen this morning, granting ownership of the mansion to Dennis Parnell. For those of you who just tuned in, we repeat, late this morning, the Parnell mansion known as Land Between the Lakes was ripped apart by an explosion.\u201d</p> <p>The phone crashed on the floor as Avery collapsed.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>NUMB WITH SHOCK AND DESPAIR, AVERY COULDN\u2019T MOVE. Carrie was dead. Carrie, who had given her unconditional love, always, no matter how crazy Avery made her with her career choices.</p><p>And Avery had failed her. Carrie would still be alive if Avery had been faster or more clever. All that time wasted running from point to point for the demented woman on the phone who taunted her with lies that Avery could save Carrie. She should have found a way to rescue Carrie and the other women. Now it was too late.</p><p>John Paul held her in his arms and let her ramble as she told him over and over how she was to blame.</p><p>Verna made soup and all but force-fed Avery, then led her upstairs and stood like a prison guard outside the bathroom while she showered. The old woman, hearing Avery\u2019s sobs, kept whispering, \u201cThe poor dear.\u201d</p><p>When she was finished, Verna handed her one of the chief\u2019s gray T-shirts to put on, then gathered up her clothes to wash.</p><p>She hovered over Avery like an anxious mother hen. She sat Avery down on one of the cots and knelt on the floor with her first-aid kit. The cut on her leg wasn\u2019t deep, but it needed to be cleaned. She applied a liberal amount of iodine and wrapped the wound in gauze.</p> <p>When she was finished, she tucked Avery into bed and headed downstairs to fix a cup of hot tea for her. When she turned back at the doorway to ask her if she wanted a dab of milk in her tea, Avery was already fast asleep.</p><p>John Paul was waiting at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping, and that\u2019s the best thing for her now. She\u2019s all tuckered out.\u201d</p><p>Nodding agreement, John Paul went back into the station. The chief was on the phone verifying that John Paul was who he claimed he was. When he\u2019d gotten the information he needed, his attitude became more open and friendly.</p><p>\u201cThe troops are on their way,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got to be hungry, so I called over to the restaurant, and one of the employees is bringing some food for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cI checked you out,\u201d he said then. \u201cYou were a Marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the army,\u201d he offered. \u201cWent through West Point, then did some duty in Germany. My best friend was a Marine. He died last year, and I sure do miss him. He was a good man.\u201d</p><p>John Paul wasn\u2019t sure why he was telling him his history. \u201cI hear you\u2019re good with a gun,\u201d Tyler continued. \u201cDo you think trouble\u2019s coming this way? Until the FBI gets here, we\u2019re on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Monk knows where we are, then maybe he\u2019ll try to end it here. I don\u2019t think he knows, though, and I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s gone to ground to reorganize. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be taking any chances,\u201d Tyler countered as he stood and crossed to a cabinet on the other side of the room. He pulled a key from his pocket and unlocked the padlock. When he opened the doors, John Paul smiled. Chief Tyler had an arsenal at his disposal.</p><p>\u201cYou like to be prepared for just about anything, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked with approval.</p><p>The chief grinned. \u201cSometimes we get a cranky bear I have to go after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go after them with an M1911?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just a leftover from my army days. Take your pick,\u201d he said. Turning to his assistant, he said, \u201cVerna, you go on home to your daughter and stay there until this is finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave that girl alone upstairs. She needs comfort now. I\u2019m worried she might be going into shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tougher than she looks,\u201d John Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ll com . . . I\u2019ll watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d damned near said he\u2019d comfort the woman, but he\u2019d caught himself in time. What was the matter with him? He didn\u2019t have a clue how he was supposed to make Avery feel better, only knew he didn\u2019t want her crying on anyone else\u2019s shoulder. None of this made any sense to him. She confused him, turned his thinking upside down, and put all sorts of crazy, impossible thoughts into his head. He couldn\u2019t understand how or why she had become so important to him, only knew he was driven to keep her safe from harm . . . at all costs.</p><p>Protect and serve. If he kept thinking like this, he would end up on the side of law and order again. He shuddered at the possibility.</p><p>The chief interrupted his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve got good strong doors with double-bolted locks. There\u2019s a back door out of this area, and that has a glass window, but I put in an alarm because of all the firepower I\u2019ve collected, and the whole town will hear the noise if anyone tries to get in.\u201d</p><p>John Paul checked out the perimeter. Fifteen minutes later he and Tyler were satisfied with the lockdown. He ate, then went upstairs, showered, and put on the sweats and T-shirt Tyler had given him. When he stepped out of the bathroom, Verna was waiting with a plastic trash bag to collect his wet clothes.</p><p>\u201cMy son-in-law will drop these off with Avery\u2019s after they\u2019ve been laundered,\u201d she said as she started down the stairs. \u201cYou take care of her. You hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She left a few minutes later with her daughter.</p><p>Tyler had insisted that he could hold down the fort while John Paul caught some shut-eye.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t argued. He tried not to make any noise as he walked into the dormitory where Avery slept. There were four cots, all with clean bedding, lined up against one wall. The chief had told him that when the building was constructed, the town believed they would have a full-time fire department, but when the town didn\u2019t develop the way the city planners thought it would, the budget couldn\u2019t afford salaried firefighters. It was volunteer now.</p><p>John Paul noticed the window was unlocked. It overlooked the alley behind the building, and there was a fire escape ladder just a couple of feet to the left. He locked the window and then sat down on the cot next to Avery\u2019s.</p><p>She was sleeping on her back. Her face was scrubbed clean; her hair was still damp from washing, and he thought she was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. She looked like an angel, but she had a little vinegar in her disposition, the way she tried to boss him around. He liked the fact that she stood up to him, held her own. He liked her attitude too. She viewed the world the way he used to when he had been naive.</p><p>He was tired, and surely his fatigue was the reason he was thinking such foolish thoughts. When the FBI arrived, he\u2019d leave. Simple as that. Avery was the ultimate team player, he reminded himself, so he\u2019d let her team watch out for her.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered as he rolled onto the cot.</p><p>He got in two full hours of sleep before Tyler woke him. John Paul had heard him coming up the stairs and had the handgun aimed and ready when he opened the door.</p><p>The chief waited until John Paul put the gun down. Then he walked inside. \u201cWe\u2019ve got company,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s here, and the man in charge wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Avery was still out cold. She\u2019d kicked off the sheet, and one leg was hanging off the side of the bed. There was a bandage wrapped above her ankle. Spots of dark blood dotted the gauze. When had she hurt herself? he wondered as he carefully lifted her leg and tucked her back under the sheet. And why hadn\u2019t she told him?</p><p>He knew the answer to that one. She would never think to complain.</p><p>Fighting the urge to kiss her, he went into the bathroom to splash cold water on his face.</p><p>He became angry thinking about the interview he\u2019d have to suffer through with the Feds. If the team leader turned out to be like so many others John Paul remembered, then he\u2019d be an arrogant, opinionated, we-do-it-my-way-or-no-way prick.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d dried his face and hands, he was ready for a fight. Fact was, he was looking forward to it. He found himself hoping the guy did turn out to be a prick because he was suddenly in the mood to kick some ass.</p><p>Unfortunately, Agent Knolte was neither a prick nor a know-it-all. The freckle-faced agent was intelligent, eager, and sincere, and seemed to know what he was talking about as far as strategy went. He\u2019d certainly done his homework on Monk, knew almost as much about him as John Paul did.</p><p>There were only two problems with Agent Knolte. One, he looked like a twelve-year-old. And with a cowlick and braces, no less. What were they doing in the Bureau these days? Recruiting from grade school? The second problem was monumental. Knolte was a by-the-book agent.</p><p>\u201cMr. Renard, it\u2019s an honor to meet you,\u201d Knolte said, extending his hand as four other eager agents crowded around. \u201cWe all heard about the hostage rescue down in South America, and I want you to know we consider it a privilege to be able to work with you.\u201d</p><p>John Paul stared into Knolte\u2019s brown eyes. \u201cI was never in South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I talked to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. If you say so,\u201d Knolte hastily agreed.</p><p>Another agent stepped forward. \u201cSir, we understand the Agency was elated to hear you decided to come back to work after your long leave of absence.\u201d</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t look at the man when he responded. \u201cI didn\u2019t take a leave of absence. I retired and I\u2019m still retired.\u201d Then without missing a beat, he asked, \u201cHow old are you, Agent Knolte?\u201d</p><p>The question didn\u2019t seem to faze the man. \u201cOlder than I look,\u201d he answered. \u201cLet me introduce you to my team.\u201d</p><p>John Paul suddenly found himself surrounded by agents wanting to shake his hand. The attention didn\u2019t sit well. Chief Tyler observed the spectacle from the back hallway. When John Paul caught his eye, the middle-aged man shook his head and muttered something about a damn fan club.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to question Miss Delaney,\u201d an agent named Brock said.</p><p>\u201cNot until she\u2019s had some sleep,\u201d John Paul said. \u201cYou can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>The interview lasted an hour. There were constant interruptions as Knolte kept getting updates from another agent at the explosion site. He told John Paul that they\u2019d brought in the dogs and were searching for bodies. Thus far, two had been found. From the remains of the vehicle near the site, they knew that one of the women was the former wife of Dennis Parnell, the owner of the house.</p><p>The wait for the discovery of the other bodies was grim and tense. Then Knolte got another call and thrust the phone at John Paul. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>A minute later John Paul bounded up the stairs. Knolte could have sworn the brooding man actually smiled for a second there.</p><p>The door to the dormitory banged against the wall when he rushed inside, but the noise didn\u2019t disturb Avery.</p><p>He shook her awake. \u201cSweetheart, open your eyes. Come on, Avery, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She was slow to respond. She felt drugged and disoriented. She finally opened her eyes and struggled to sit up.</p><p>\u201cIs it time to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>She squinted up at him, shaking her head as she tried to comprehend what he was saying. \u201cAlive? How can she be alive? The house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got out before the explosion. I don\u2019t know how she managed it, but she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Avery burst into tears. John Paul sat down next to her and pulled her onto his lap. He held her while she cried all over him.</p><p>When she was finally able to calm down, she asked, \u201cDid everyone get out? Where\u2019s Carrie now? Have they called Uncle Tony? The poor man will be beside himself. First, they tell him she\u2019s dead, and then they tell him she\u2019s alive. I hope to God he has a strong heart.\u201d</p><p>John Paul wasn\u2019t sure which question to answer first. \u201cCarrie\u2019s in a hospital in Aspen.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away from him. \u201cWhy is she in the hospital? You told me she was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut the other woman was hurt. The judge tore up one of her knees when they fell into a deep ravine,\u201d he explained. \u201cCarrie twisted her ankle, and fractured her arm, but she was still able to drag some dead branches over them so they could hide the rest of the night. One of the police dogs found them,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were taken to the hospital, and the judge is in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the other woman? There were three . . . weren\u2019t there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnne Trapp. She stayed inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would she stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask Carrie, or maybe Knolte knows the reason now.\u201d</p><p>Avery stood and nearly tripped over her backpack and duffel bag. \u201cHow did these get here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe chief called a friend. He got my car working and drove it here.\u201d</p><p>Avery was so relieved and jubilant about Carrie, she felt limp and giddy. She wanted to laugh and cry, and kiss John Paul. Oh, she really wanted to kiss him, and a whole lot more. What was wrong with her? Maybe it was the endorphins. Yes, that\u2019s what it was.</p><p>She mentally shook herself. She needed to concentrate on Carrie now. And Uncle Tony. \u201cDid anyone call my uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe\u2019s a happy man right now, but scared too. He wants to get on the next flight to Aspen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded approval. \u201cWho\u2019s downstairs?\u201d she asked as she knelt beside her duffel bag and unzipped it.</p> <p>\u201cFBI,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are five of them downstairs, all talking on their cell phones. They\u2019ve taken over the police station, and Chief Tyler isn\u2019t real happy about that. Tyler\u2019s an okay guy,\u201d he added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t much like the FBI either.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYour prejudice is juvenile, John Paul.\u201d She pulled out a pair of khakis. \u201cI should go down and find out what they have so far. Any word on where Monk might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He was staring at her legs, noticing how long and shapely they were. One thought led to another, and another, and before he could stop himself, he was picturing her legs wrapped around his thighs.</p><p>He looked at the wall behind her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t go downstairs like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? I\u2019m going to put on slacks,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd since when do you care what I look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he answered gruffly. \u201cBut I can see through that threadbare T-shirt.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down, whispered, \u201cOh, God,\u201d and grabbed the sheet from the cot, tugging with all her might to get the end out from under John Paul. She dropped her slacks as she wrapped the sheet around her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something sooner?\u201d She was blushing.</p><p>\u201cNow, why would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>His grin was lecherous. Shaking her head, she said, \u201cI need to go to Carrie as soon as possible. She must be crazed after what she\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>His smile vanished. \u201cNot a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cSit down, Avery. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>His tone of voice indicated it was serious. She sat down beside him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I should go see Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Talk to her on the phone if you need proof she\u2019s okay, but don\u2019t go to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what the FBI wants you to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe agent calling the shots from Aspen told Knolte\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cWho\u2019s Knolte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid agent downstairs running the show here,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe told me the game plan. They want to put you and Carrie and the judge together in protective custody until they get Monk, and that\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, they\u2019re good at what they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, so is Monk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd staying together is gonna make it real easy for him.\u201d</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t say a word. She silently agreed, but she felt it would be disloyal to the Bureau to admit her reservations.</p><p>She tried to get up, but he put his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBracing you so you won\u2019t hit your head if you faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she said. \u201cDownstairs . . . when I lost it . . . that was the first time in my life I ever passed out. I\u2019m not a weakling. I was sleep-deprived and stressed . . . really stressed out. I won\u2019t faint again. Now let go of me. I want to get dressed and go downstairs to talk to Agent Knolte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he promised. He tightened his hold as he said, \u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly at a loss for words. He was searching for the best way to tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it. Just tell me.\u201d She relaxed her shoulders then and said, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie knows who the woman with Monk is.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cShe knows her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cYou know her too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, John Paul. Stop fencing. Just tell me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cJilly. Carrie said her name is Jilly.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s reaction stunned John Paul. She didn\u2019t faint; she didn\u2019t cry; she didn\u2019t argue, and she didn\u2019t go into full-blown denial.</p><p>She roared.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>GET ME A GUN, JOHN PAUL. I WANT A GUN NOW. A BIG ONE.\u201d</p><p>She looked like an avenging angel as she paced around him. She stopped just inches in front of him, poked him in the chest, and made her demand again.</p><p>Chief Tyler stood just inside the doorway of the dormitory, shifting from foot to foot as he waited for one of them to notice him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stay dead when I get finished with her,\u201d Avery railed. \u201cI want a gun.\u201d</p><p>The chief couldn\u2019t stop himself from trying to reason with the distraught woman.</p><p>\u201cNow, Miss Delaney, you shouldn\u2019t be talking crazy. What if someone does shoot your mother? With you making threats, who do you think the police will come looking for? I understand you\u2019re overwrought, but . . .\u201d</p><p>She whirled around to confront the policeman. \u201cJilly is not my mother. She\u2019s the woman who gave birth to me, but she has never been nor will she ever be my mother. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>Tyler hastily nodded. Her wrath was blistering, and he was so surprised by the change that had come over her he didn\u2019t know how to proceed. She\u2019d been such a sweet, appreciative little lady when he\u2019d first met her, but now she was a spitfire.</p><p>The chief turned to John Paul for help. \u201cThis can\u2019t be the same woman I met downstairs. She wouldn\u2019t happen to have a twin, would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no twin,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s just got a temper.\u201d He made that comment sound like a compliment.</p><p>The chief thought it was an understatement. \u201cCan\u2019t you reason with her? She can\u2019t go running out of here with a gun, thinking she can shoot her moth . . .\u201d He stopped himself in time. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what should I call her?\u201d</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cA frickin\u2019 maniac,\u201d she snapped. \u201cA deviant sociopath, a psychopath. Take your pick. Just don\u2019t call her my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Mollified, she clutched the sheet to her neck, picked up her duffel bag, and walked with her head held high toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me a damn gun.\u201d</p><p>The door shut before he could answer.</p><p>Tyler scratched his jaw and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do about her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGet her a gun.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stepped into the room and shut the door behind him. \u201cAre you going to let them take her to Aspen? You heard them talking. They want to put her, her aunt, and that judge in a safe house until they catch the man hired to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, they\u2019re putting all their eggs in one basket, and I figure the reason must have something to do with their budget. Less manpower if they keep them together, but if this professional killer . . . what\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s any good, he\u2019ll find them. All he\u2019d have to do is wait around that hospital and follow the judge. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>John Paul agreed. \u201cI heard Knolte say they were going to keep them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear the rest of their plans because you had already gone upstairs to tell Avery her aunt was alive. Did you know there\u2019s an important trial coming up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The chief lowered his voice as he continued. Even though he could hear the hair dryer humming in the bathroom and doubted Avery would hear them talking, he moved closer to John Paul.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to retry a man named Skarrett. You familiar with him?\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo he\u2019s getting a new trial? When is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt starts three weeks from today,\u201d he said. \u201cKnolte was on the phone arguing with another agent who\u2019s giving them orders. Anyway, when he hung up, he noticed me watching him, and he closed up tight, until I told him I was coming up here to check on the girl.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t come right up. I made a little noise going up a couple of steps, then snuck back down and lingered in the hall so I could hear what he was telling the others.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the bathroom door before continuing. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t nabbed Monk by the time the trial starts, they aren\u2019t going to let Avery or her aunt testify, and from what I could gather, the man in charge didn\u2019t think it would be so bad if Skarrett got off.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was astonished. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hoping that Skarrett will lead them to a big stash he\u2019s got hidden away. It seems Skarrett robbed a jewelry store and stole several million in uncut stones. They\u2019re hoping to get them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re going to make it easy for Skarrett to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery\u2019s a key witness,\u201d Tyler pointed out. \u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t testify . . .\u201d He left the sentence hanging. John Paul was staggered by the endless possibilities of what could and would go wrong. His voice reeked with sarcasm as he said, \u201cNow, that\u2019s a plan guaranteed to get screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Tyler was in full agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it too. Are you going to tell Avery? Once they\u2019ve got her in that safe house, she won\u2019t be able to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Knolte tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cAvery works for the FBI, so she\u2019s a believer in teamwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn idealist, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good. What about you? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll take off,\u201d he said. \u201cNo reason to hang around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this Monk has backed off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not for long. He\u2019s taken the contracts, and when he hears that Carrie and the judge are still alive, he\u2019ll hit again. He has to. His reputation is on the line. He\u2019s going to continue to go after Avery too.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, he\u2019ll strike again and again and again. Until he gets the job done.</p><p>It was as though Tyler had just read his mind. \u201cSo you think it\u2019s okay to let those boys downstairs watch over Avery? You think she\u2019ll be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a smart, tough woman. She can handle herself.\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked disappointed in him. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s the right thing to do, but if you don\u2019t and you decide you might want to do something on your own, I thought I\u2019d mention I\u2019ve got this nice little cabin tucked away in the mountains. I was going to go up there for a couple of weeks, and I just stocked the kitchen. Only needs the refrigerator foods, like milk and eggs, and you\u2019d be all set. If you\u2019re heading toward Denver, it won\u2019t be much out of your way. It would be a good place to hide out until you and Avery decide what to do . . . about the trial and all.\u201d</p><p>John Paul tried to interrupt him, but Tyler rushed on. \u201cThere\u2019s a barn where I keep my car, and I\u2019ll write out directions for you and tell you where the key to the cabin is hidden . . . if you\u2019re interested. You think about it and let me know before you leave. I\u2019ll go down and write those instructions just in case.\u201d</p><p>Having had his say, he turned around and went back downstairs. John Paul didn\u2019t know what the hell he was going to do. He stood there thinking about the situation for several minutes, then muttered an expletive as he picked up his gear and carried it down to the car. The chief\u2019s assistant had dropped off his clean clothes. They were folded next to Avery\u2019s on the bottom step. He shoved his in the bag, ran back up the stairs, and placed hers on one of the cots, and then headed outside.</p><p>The chief\u2019s friend had parked Jean Paul\u2019s car in the alley between the buildings, just below the windows in the dorm. He threw the bags into the back of the SUV and then decided he should say good-bye to Avery. He couldn\u2019t just take off, could he? Saying good-bye and wishing her luck was the decent thing to do.</p><p>If she asks me to stay, then I will, he told himself. But if she doesn\u2019t ask, then I\u2019m out of here. Simple as that. She doesn\u2019t need me. But if she asks . . .</p><p>He walked into the room and stopped cold. He nearly tripped over his own feet when he saw her. She was standing by the window with her arms folded, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you glaring at me?\u201d he asked with a defensive scowl of his own.</p><p>\u201cI saw you putting your bags in the car,\u201d she said, nodding toward the window. \u201cAre you leaving, then?\u201d She took a step toward him but stopped when she noticed his back stiffened. \u201cI would appreciate an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of an answer is that? I\u2019m not in the mood to play games, Avery.\u201d Then, before she could respond, he squinted at her and asked, \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to her cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It just looks . . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI washed it, put on some moisturizer and a little makeup. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakeup? Why would you do that? Do you want to look nice for your FBI buddies?\u201d</p><p>Oh, brother, was he in a mood. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer because he couldn\u2019t possibly put into words what was going on inside his head right now or how he was feeling. Why he was suddenly itching for a fight was beyond him. He only knew he was furious with her and with himself because she had been able to do to him what no other woman had done before. She had tied his stomach into knots. What was worse was that he had let her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was next? His heart? The hell with that.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Agent Knolte yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was waiting for you to come upstairs. Were you going to leave without saying good-bye?\u201d The big jerk. She would not cry, no matter how angry he made her. She took a breath to steady her resolve, walked across the room, and thrust her hand out. \u201cThank you for all you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her hand. \u201cAvery . . . if you want\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She interrupted. \u201cChief Tyler came upstairs looking for you. He wanted to talk to you, said it was important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just talked to him not five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe must have something else to say to you. He\u2019s waiting in the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip home,\u201d she said. She turned around and walked back to the window. \u201cGood-bye, John Paul.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t believe she was blowing him off. He stared at her back for a minute, then abruptly turned and went downstairs. Her cold farewell had been that of a stranger, and he was too pissed off to try to figure out why her attitude had changed.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t get swamped by agents as he walked through the police station. Knolte and a couple of other young hotshots were studying maps and talking on their cell phones. One agent did try to engage him in conversation, but he ignored him, shoved the swinging door open, and crossed over to the restaurant. The front was deserted, but he could hear whistling coming from the kitchen. He walked behind the red Formica counter and spotted the chief at the grill. The aroma of sizzling meat filled the air.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to take off?\u201d the chief asked.</p><p>\u201cJust about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to take a hamburger for the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. Where is everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy restaurant crew? I sent them home a while back. If Knolte and his friends want something to eat, they can fix it themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to see me about something?\u201d</p><p>Tyler frowned. \u201cI already said what I had to say. I went ahead and put that sheet of directions in your car just in case you change your mind and decide to take me up on my offer to use my cabin. You ought to think about it,\u201d he urged. \u201cI can\u2019t get up there for another month, thanks to my wife\u2019s relatives. She informed me last night we have two weddings and a reunion to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for your help, Chief, and for the food and bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could help,\u201d Tyler said. He unlocked the back door and stepped into the alley with John Paul.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said as he opened the car door and slid behind the wheel. He noticed the folded paper the chief had placed on the seat next to him and picked it up with the intent of handing it back.</p><p>\u201cYou sure that little girl\u2019s gonna be all right?\u201d</p> <p>That was the third time the chief had asked him that question. John Paul gave him the same answer. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe that nonsense, not for one second, and he could tell from Tyler\u2019s expression, he didn\u2019t believe it either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you,\u201d Tyler called, raising the spatula he was holding in farewell.</p><p>John Paul put his key in the ignition, dropped the paper on the seat, and then sat there, brooding. His conscience wouldn\u2019t quiet down. Avery had made her choice, he reminded himself. Yeah, she had let him know in no uncertain terms that she didn\u2019t want or need him.</p><p>There was only one problem with her decision. He wanted and needed her.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d gotten rid of his feelings years ago when disillusionment had taken root, but now he realized he\u2019d only been fooling himself with his hate-everyone, don\u2019t-need-anyone attitude and that he was as human and flawed as everyone else. Who would have thought?</p><p>Did he even like Avery? Yeah, he did, he admitted. The woman was a real smart-ass. How could he not like her?</p><p>He shook his head and turned the key in the ignition. The engine purred like a well-fed kitten as he put the gear into drive.</p><p>God knows he tried, but he couldn\u2019t summon up the strength to drive away. Damn it, she was making him nuts. She was just like a chigger, itching and irritating. She wanted him to leave. Right? Hell, yes. She was sure she was going to be fine and dandy with that super-duper team watching out for her safety. . . . God help her.</p><p>Avery was a fighter, and she could certainly handle anything that came her way. But could she control the actions of the agents assigned to protect her? Could she prevent them from screwing things up? And while she was watching them, who would be watching her?</p><p>He put the gear back in park and turned the motor off. What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>Let the FBI worry about her. Damn right. That was definitely what he was going to do. He started the motor again, but this time he didn\u2019t get the gearshift into drive. He sat there like a lump of ice, frozen with indecision, while the car idled.</p><p>What a game player he was turning out to be. He was now desperately trying to convince himself he didn\u2019t care what happened to her.</p><p>She made him laugh. She made him want things he thought he could never have.</p><p>Hell, she humanized him.</p><p>John Paul fought the good fight, but when all was said and done, he lost the battle. He bowed his head in submission as the truth sliced through him. Son of a bitch.</p><p>Face it, Renard. You aren\u2019t going anywhere without her.</p><p>He turned the motor off and reached for the door.</p><p>The voice stopped him. \u201cWill you get going? Move it, Renard. I\u2019m suffocating back here, and your sleeping bag smells like dead leaves.\u201d</p><p>He swung around. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me, John Paul. Put the damn car into drive and get us out of here. Don\u2019t make me tell you again.\u201d</p><p>His smile was slow and easy. The tension eased out of his shoulders, and his stomach stopped aching. The world was suddenly right again. Avery was snarling at him like a mountain cat, definitely giving him attitude.</p><p>He started the engine and changed gears, but he didn\u2019t accelerate. \u201cIf you go with me, sugar, I\u2019m calling the shots, and you\u2019re going to do what I tell you to do. Can you deal with that?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate in answering. \u201cWhen I jumped off the fire escape ladder, I landed on the roof of your car and dented it. You deal with that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he drove down the alley. How could he not be crazy about her?</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>JILLY WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO HEAR THE BODY COUNT. SHE paced around her hotel bungalow while the television, tuned into a local Colorado station, droned on and on, but each time that wonderful film clip showing the explosion of the house came on, she hurriedly sat down on the edge of the bed. Enthusiastically and greedily, she devoured every second of the magnificent footage.</p><p>How fortuitous that a hiker just happened to be filming the landscape at the exact second the house disintegrated. His lens had captured every bit of the back of the house. Had Jilly not been able to watch it on television, she would have been irate. Admittedly, she was still a little irritated because she had been looking forward to pushing the button, but this clip that the station kept showing over and over again was almost as good.</p><p>The phone rang just as the clip ended. She hit the mute button before she answered.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling.\u201d</p><p>A second\u2019s pause followed. \u201cDid you see it on television?\u201d</p><p>He sounded so eager to please, yet nervous at the same time. \u201cYes, of course I saw it. Wasn\u2019t it marvelous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . yes,\u201d he replied. \u201cTwo bodies so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne to go,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sound nervous, darling. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried that, after the fact, you might feel bad. I\u2019m glad to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel bad about Carrie? She ruined my life and stole my daughter from me. I\u2019m overjoyed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice dropped to a throaty whisper. \u201cI know what you want. Are you in the car now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better pull over,\u201d she said. And then in the most erotic detail she told him what she would do to him when they were together. His breathing amused her. The rapid panting of a dog in heat, she thought. The power she had over men excited her.</p><p>\u201cWill you like that?\u201d she asked breathlessly so he would think she was as out of control as he was.</p><p>And then she gave him more until he was whimpering with his need. A sudden silence followed a low groan. She knew what was happening and smiled with satisfaction. She could have had a wonderful career doing phone sex, she thought, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t make the kind of money she wanted. Still, it was nice to know she had options.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling less lonely now, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you soon. I love you, Jilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, darling. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone and began to pace again. Would the police be able to tell who was who from what little was left of the bodies? She knew that skulls and teeth were one way of identifying victims, but what if those had also been blown to smithereens?</p><p>Umm. What would they do then?</p><p>The film came on the television again. Jilly rushed to the bed and sat down to watch. Oh, it was lovely, so lovely.</p><p>When the news bulletin ended, she went to her overnight bag and took out her precious videotape. She carried it with her wherever she went. She popped it into the VCR and knelt in front of the TV to watch. How many times had she seen it? A hundred? A thousand? And yet, she never grew tired of it . . . or the feelings it provoked.</p><p>\u201cNow do you see why you have to die?\u201d she whispered to the screen.</p><p>She happened to notice one of her nails was chipped and rushed into the bathroom to repair it. Checking the time, she realized that Monk would be arriving soon. She needed to get ready to greet him properly. And reward him, of course. Like a dog who\u2019d performed a difficult trick, Monk would be anxious for his treat.</p><p>Virginal white, she decided as she pulled the negligee from her overnight bag. He\u2019d like that. But then he liked everything she did to him, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>She mustn\u2019t forget to put on red lipstick. Oh, how men loved pouting red lips.</p><p>They loved her perfect body. They loved her angelic face.</p><p>They all loved her.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>THE PARAMEDICS TOLD CARRIE SHE WAS IN SHOCK. SHE DIDN\u2019T agree, but she understood how they had reached their diagnosis. Granted, there was something a little peculiar about her behavior. When they\u2019d lifted her out of the ravine, she had been sobbing uncontrollably and incoherently. She knew the words she wanted to say, yet she couldn\u2019t seem to get them out in the right order or at the right time. Still, their conclusion was a bunch of nonsense. They weren\u2019t doctors. What the hell did they know? Her mind was working just fine, thank you very much.</p><p>Camera lights glared in her face as she was carried on the stretcher and placed across from Sara in the waiting ambulance. Carrie struggled to sit up until she realized one of the paramedics had rudely strapped her down. She was able to move one of her arms, though. Reaching across the narrow aisle, she took hold of Sara\u2019s hand.</p><p>Her friend was in terrible pain. Both paramedics were working on her leg. \u201cIs she going to be all right? Is she going to be all right?\u201d The question became a chant she couldn\u2019t stop. Even though both men tried to assure her that yes, yes, she was going to be fine, Carrie felt compelled to keep asking.</p><p>One of them gave Sara an injection, and she closed her eyes seconds later. Her hand went limp in Carrie\u2019s. After they finished immobilizing her leg, one of them checked her blood pressure again while the other worked on Carrie.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill Avery. Make them stop him. Do you hear me? He\u2019s going to . . . going to . . .\u201d</p><p>Carrie passed out. The terror of what she had been through, added to sleep deprivation, had finally caught up with her. Her body simply rebelled and shut down.</p><p>When she next opened her eyes, she was in a hospital bed. And, oh, how she ached. It seemed every muscle in her body throbbed. Had someone taken a stick to her?</p><p>She desperately tried to clear the fog in her mind. Avery. Oh, God, she had to find Avery before it was too late. She saw the call button pinned to the sheet on her left and tried to reach for it. Pain shot up through her elbow and she cried out. Looking down, she saw the cast on her arm and let out a low curse.</p><p>How had that happened?</p><p>The ravine, of course. She\u2019d fallen headfirst into that deep pit, and she remembered putting her arm out to try to brace against the fall. She knew she\u2019d injured her wrist, but she thought she\u2019d just sprained it. It hadn\u2019t hurt all that much at the time, had it? She couldn\u2019t remember. Maybe it had gone numb, as numb as the rest of her at that point. She did remember landing on top of Sara, though. Her friend had been writhing in agony, and Carrie distinctly recalled putting her hand over her mouth to stifle her cries, terrified that Monk was lurking in the dark waiting to catch them.</p><p>Where was Sara? Carrie could hear men\u2019s voices in the hallway, and she couldn\u2019t reach the call button. She was about to shout when the door opened and a young doctor dressed in blue scrubs and a white lab coat came inside. He was holding a chart in his hand.</p><p>His name was Dr. Bridgeport, and he looked as if he hadn\u2019t had any sleep in a week. That can\u2019t be good, she thought. Then she noticed his hands. They were huge, as though he\u2019d had them transplanted from a bigger body, along with the new row of dark hair plugs in his scalp.</p><p>\u201cAre you my doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a neurologist. I\u2019ve reviewed your X rays and CAT scan,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI had those tests?\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou suffered a mild concussion. I\u2019m going to keep you overnight for observation. I didn\u2019t see anything alarming on the scan,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was writing in her chart and, without looking up, said, \u201cYour primary physician will be in to check on you in a little while. Meanwhile, you\u2019ve got quite a few eager law enforcement officers waiting to talk to you. I\u2019m going to allow two in the room . . . if you\u2019re feeling up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts. May I have something for pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a little while,\u201d he promised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew what that meant. When Avery was little and wanted something Carrie didn\u2019t want her to have, she used the very same phrase. It hadn\u2019t worked on Avery then, and it wasn\u2019t working on Carrie now.</p><p>\u201cI want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a concussion, Mrs. Salvetti, and I would rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cOh, never mind. Doctor, a friend of mine rode with me in the ambulance. Her leg was all torn up. Where is she? Do you know?\u201d</p> <p>The doctor nodded. \u201cJudge Collins is in surgery,\u201d he explained.</p><p>There was a hard rap on the door. The doctor closed the chart, smiled at her, and turned to leave. \u201cYou need to rest,\u201d he said as he opened the door and let two men in dark suits rush inside. \u201cTen minutes,\u201d he said to the agents, \u201cthen she needs to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>They moved like soldiers on parade, arms stiff, heads high. They were also dressed alike, except for the choice of tie colors. One wore a gray-and-black-striped tie, and the other had on a muted plaid.</p><p>An agent named Hillman was in charge. There was a sharpness about his eyes she found comforting. She didn\u2019t think he would miss much.</p><p>The other, younger agent pushed the button to elevate her back, poured her a glass of water, and hovered at her side while Hillman questioned her. He led her through the sequence of events, rarely interrupting when she paused to collect her thoughts. She wanted to tell him everything at once, impatient to ask questions of her own, but Hillman was tenacious and made her keep to his agenda.</p> <p>She turned to the more cooperative agent and asked him to find her jacket.</p><p>\u201cThe letters are in the pocket.\u201d</p><p>Hillman found the jacket hanging in the built-in closet. He pulled on a pair of gloves and dropped the envelopes into a Ziploc bag the other agent held out for him.</p><p>\u201cAnne gave a letter to me. I want to read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let the lab dust it for prints,\u201d the sidekick told her.</p><p>She\u2019d thought he was more malleable than Hillman, but now she realized he was just as tenacious.</p> <p>\u201cI want to know what that sick bastard of a husband wrote to her. He hired Monk to kill her, you know. You have to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her demand, Hillman resumed his questions. Carrie had had enough. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn. I want to know where my niece is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re searching for her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind her.\u201d</p><p>Seeing how distraught Carrie was, sidekick offered her a sip of water by holding the straw under her nose. She turned her head.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you know about . . .\u201d Hillman once again tried to get her back on track.</p><p>\u201cI want an update on Judge Collins, and I want it now.\u201d</p><p>The agents exchanged a glance, and then Hillman answered. \u201cShe\u2019s out of surgery and in ICU.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d the other man said.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBean, ma\u2019am. Agent Peter Bean.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he hadn\u2019t introduced himself. Saddled with a name like that, she wouldn\u2019t have told anyone either. Bet they called him string bean in grade school, she thought.</p><p>Hillman started the questions all over again. For an hour he kept it up, grilling her, going over the same facts again and again until she began to feel as if she were the criminal they were trying to get to confess.</p><p>Her head was pounding. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t answer any more questions now.\u201d</p><p>Hillman looked disappointed, but he agreed to let her rest for a little while. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be cordial. She told them not to come back until they had news about Avery. To calm her down\u2014she was shouting now\u2014Hillman let her call her husband. Bean dialed the number for her. The second she heard Tony\u2019s voice over the phone, she burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Tony. You have to come to Aspen.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook with emotion as he replied, \u201cSweetheart, they told me I couldn\u2019t. They said as soon as you\u2019re discharged from the hospital they\u2019re going to move you and the judge to a safe house somewhere. Carrie, love, are you all right? I wish I could be there with you. I wish . . . I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was planning to join you at the spa. One of the agents who came to talk to me told me she missed her flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d he promised. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to her. I promise you. And I\u2019m keeping the line open. She\u2019ll call. I know she\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I didn\u2019t realize . . . I\u2019m so sorry about everything. You can have Star Catcher. You can run it any way you want. I don\u2019t care about any of that anymore. I should have trusted you. I\u2019ve been such a fool.\u201d</p><p>She was sobbing now and angry because the agents were listening to every word.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI do, Tony. I love you very much. Please . . . tell me it isn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it isn\u2019t. I can . . . I love you too,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI\u2019ll get on the next plane. We\u2019ll make our marriage work again. Anything is possible with your love. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>ANY HOPE THAT THE FBI WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THE names of the survivors out of the papers and off the television had been squelched when a news crew filmed Carrie and the judge being carried into the ambulance near the site of the explosion.</p><p>Avery heard about it on the radio as she and John Paul were driving through the mountains. As soon as they\u2019d left the sleepy town, she\u2019d climbed in front, clipping him on the shoulder with her left foot when she fell into the passenger seat. Her shoe fell in his lap. Shaking his head over her awkwardness, he handed her the shoe while she apologized.</p><p>They continued to listen to the broadcast until the signal faded. \u201cDoes everyone in the United States carry video cameras now?\u201d he asked. He sounded disgusted. \u201cSome people just love invading other people\u2019s privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm crews from television stations usually carry cameras,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sarcastic, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. I was simply pointing out a fact. Carrie must have hated having a camera in her face. Someone from the FBI should have grabbed the film. The crime-scene investigators must not have gotten there in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve, could\u2019ve,\u201d he drawled. \u201cThat\u2019s the Bureau\u2019s motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to rile me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to.\u201d</p><p>She rolled the window down and let the cool night air in. \u201cYes, you were,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve finally gotten you all figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhen I first met you, I thought you must have some kind of grudge against the FBI, but now that I know you better, I realize that isn\u2019t true at all. Your phobia is much bigger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t like any government agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we talked about your brother-in-law working for the Justice Department, you sneered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice has too much power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the CIA? I know you worked for them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue or deny. \u201cTheir priorities change on a whim, leaving agents and civilians out there to hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the IRS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone hates the IRS.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d give him that one. She kept on naming government agencies, and he continued to tell her what was wrong with each one of them.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my case. You know what your biggest problem is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re going to enlighten me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like anyone in a position of authority.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t offended by her analysis. \u201cYou know what they say. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI doesn\u2019t have absolute power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherapy. You need intense therapy to help you get rid of your hostility.\u201d</p><p>Before he could tell her he hated therapy too, she changed the subject. \u201cI need to get to a phone and call Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call her from the police station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you would have left without me. I still can\u2019t believe you were going to abandon me. I get mad every time I think about it.\u201d</p><p>Should he tell her the truth or not? He clenched his jaw while he thought about it. She\u2019d sounded so disappointed in him, even hurt.</p><p>\u201cLook . . .\u201d he began, and then stopped.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was going to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d She poked him in his arm. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I was gonna stay. Now it\u2019s your turn to squirm. How come you decided to leave your super team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling them that. I\u2019m sure Agent Knolte and the other agents are quite capable of doing a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then, I repeat, why did you decide to go with me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI thought about what you said, and I agreed. It isn\u2019t smart to put all of us together in the same safe house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? Are you waiting for a compliment?\u201d</p><p>Before he could tell her the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind, she said, \u201cOkay, fine. I think I have a better chance of surviving with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you cross over to the dark side?\u201d he asked, grinning. \u201cDid Knolte say or do something that turned you into a rogue agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an agent. I\u2019m an analyst, and he didn\u2019t say or do anything. I still have complete faith in the Bureau. No one is more loyal than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why\u2019d you leave?\u201d</p><p>She had to think about it for awhile. \u201cI\u2019m taking initiative. We\u2019re taught to do that at the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he scoffed. He nodded toward a sign on the side of the two-lane road. \u201cThere\u2019s a restaurant five miles ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make a call too and get us some help.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Loner was going to ask someone for help? That was a shock.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can call Carrie, but don\u2019t tell her where we\u2019re headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I? I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the folded paper. \u201cChief Tyler has a cabin a couple of hours away. It\u2019s got a barn, and I can hide the car inside. We\u2019ll stay there tonight.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the back window once again to make sure they weren\u2019t being followed. They hadn\u2019t seen another car in a long time, and she realized she was probably being a little paranoid, but she continued to stay on guard. One couldn\u2019t be too cautious, she reasoned.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any guesses where Monk might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably still in Colorado, and by now he\u2019s heard that your aunt and the judge are still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI will be looking for us too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot us, sugar. You. They\u2019ll be looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned the shower on in case one of the agents came upstairs, and I locked the dormitory door, but eventually Knolte will find out I\u2019m gone, and he\u2019ll sound the alarm.\u201d</p><p>And then all hell was going to break loose. When Carter found out about the situation, he\u2019d have her ass on a platter. She already had her argument rehearsed. She\u2019d insist it wasn\u2019t insubordination. Carter was tough, but he was also a reasonable man. Surely he would see the merits of her taking initiative . . . again.</p><p>\u201cWill the chief tell Knolte he offered you the use of his cabin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he know you were going out the window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>John Paul took the exit and pulled into the tarred parking lot adjacent to the restaurant. The neon letters were blinking Open.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me about Jilly?\u201d He had avoided bringing up that subject until now because he had seen how Avery reacted when Tyler called the woman her mother. She didn\u2019t answer him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell me what I\u2019m up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re up against,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell you what I know, but not on an empty stomach. Tomorrow,\u201d she promised, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand as they walked into the diner. The colors inside made both of them squint. The walls were painted a neon purple and orange as a backdrop to the white Formica countertops. A jukebox sat just inside the door. Elvis Presley was singing \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d as they made their way down the narrow aisle.</p><p>John Paul chose a booth against the wall so he could watch the parking lot. He waited until Avery slid into the orange vinyl seat and then sat down across from her.</p><p>The waitress was a teenager, but she shuffled like a ninety-year-old. Her tongue was pierced, which gave her a speech impediment when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I git ya?\u201d</p><p>They ordered turkey sandwiches and iced tea. As soon as the waitress went behind the counter, Avery dug some change out of her billfold and headed for the telephone she had spotted at the end of the aisle, between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s rest rooms.</p><p>The conversation with Carrie was mostly one-sided. Her aunt was in a state. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here? Are you all right? Did you hear? Jilly\u2019s alive. The demon faked her own death. I didn\u2019t think she was that smart. She\u2019s like a cat, Avery. Yeah, that\u2019s what she is. Do you realize, if you had shown up at the spa when you were supposed to, you\u2019d have been inside that house with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, slow down,\u201d Avery said when her aunt finally paused.</p><p>Carrie took a deep breath and then told her some of what had happened from the moment she\u2019d gotten into the car with Monk and the other women. Avery didn\u2019t say a word while she listened to the grisly highlights.</p><p>\u201cWhen I see you, I\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d Carrie promised. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared and worried about you, but you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Avery said, her gaze locked on John Paul. \u201cCarrie, who\u2019s the agent in charge of watching over you?\u201d</p><p>Her aunt spoke at the same time that Avery asked the question. \u201cThey said they\u2019re going to put us in protective custody. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019ll fly us to Florida.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Avery, you didn\u2019t know? That bastard Skarrett has a trial date set. Didn\u2019t anyone notify you? They sure as hell didn\u2019t call me.\u201d</p><p>Avery was stunned by the news. She had known that there was a possibility of a new trial, but she hadn\u2019t thought it would happen this soon.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t notified.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was beside herself. \u201cThey told me this killer Jilly hired won\u2019t stop until we\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until we get him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will, Carrie. Now, please, try to calm down. Have you talked to Tony yet?\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s voice mellowed. Sniffling, she whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s beside himself with worry. He wants you to call him as soon as possible so he can hear your voice. I want to go home, Avery, and I want you to come with me, but they won\u2019t let us. I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll let Tony come stay with me. I\u2019m trying to cooperate\u2014\u201d</p><p>Avery interrupted. \u201cHow is the judge doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, Sara. Her name\u2019s Sara. She\u2019s hanging in there. She trashed her knee and had to go to surgery, but she\u2019s doing okay now. They\u2019re keeping her in ICU for another couple of hours because of her age, but that\u2019s just a precaution. The doctors already let me sit with her and talk to her for a few minutes. Oh, my God, I forgot to tell you. Sara Collins is the judge who sentenced Skarrett.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be right. I remember the judge. His name was Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Judge Hamilton heard the case and convicted Skarrett. We went back to Bel Air once the verdict was in, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Skarrett hadn\u2019t been sentenced yet. Anyway, Hamilton died, and when Skarrett came up for sentencing, Sara was the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the connection,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what about the other woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Trapp wouldn\u2019t go with us. It\u2019s a long story, and I\u2019ll tell you everything as soon as you get here. Are they going to bring you to the hospital, or will I meet you at the airport? If they want us to fly to Florida, I\u2019m not going without you. We\u2019ll have three full weeks to catch up before they decide if they\u2019re going to let us testify or not. If Monk is still on the loose\u2014\u201d</p><p>Avery interrupted. \u201cThree weeks? You\u2019re telling me the new trial will start in just three weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll put us in a safe house near the courthouse so that, if we do get to testify, it will be easier getting us there.\u201d</p> <p>Avery couldn\u2019t compute the information in her head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a possibility we won\u2019t be allowed to testify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, what\u2019s the matter with you? Aren\u2019t you listening? Yes, there is that possibility that we won\u2019t get to testify. Okay? We\u2019d be sitting ducks, and it would be a perfect opportunity for Monk to hurt us.\u201d</p><p>Avery gripped the phone. \u201cNo one is stopping me from testifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want Skarrett to walk?\u201d Her voice shook with her fury.</p><p>\u201cYour safety is more important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting him walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk about the trial,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking me about Jilly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope when they catch her, I get to have five minutes alone with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d annihilate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you, not with all that tai chi and karate stuff you learned.\u201d Carrie sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>Avery felt like laughing. After all the hellacious stories she\u2019d heard about Jilly over the years, she would have to be as crazy as Jilly not to be afraid.</p><p>\u201cDid you see her? Was she inside the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carrie answered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything when I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to promise me that you\u2019ll do whatever the agents tell you to do. Okay, Carrie? Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make their job . . . difficult. You know how you can get when you\u2019re upset or scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared; I\u2019m angry. Very, very angry. Why the hell couldn\u2019t Jilly stay dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never died,\u201d Avery pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThey better not put us in a flea-infested shack while they\u2019re protecting us. The house is in Florida, so I want something on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, that isn\u2019t your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not nice, you can pull some strings for us. I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>Avery braced herself. Her aunt had a very short fuse when things weren\u2019t going her way, and Avery was about to ignite it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be joining you. I\u2019m not going to the safe house with\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was as far as she got. Carrie\u2019s scream made her cringe, and she had to move the phone away from her ear.</p><p>From where John Paul was seated, he could hear the aunt shouting. The color left Avery\u2019s face as she listened. He got up, walked to the phone, and gently took it from her.</p><p>\u201cSay good-bye, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Carrie, and I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d she said. \u201cBye now.\u201d</p><p>She heard Carrie shouting, \u201cAvery Elizabeth, don\u2019t you dare hang up this\u2014\u201d</p><p>John Paul placed the phone back in the cradle. \u201cShe sounds nice,\u201d he managed with a straight face.</p><p>The waitress was watching them as she placed their plates on the table. Avery pulled away from John Paul and went into the ladies\u2019 room to wash her hands. By the time she sat down in the booth, he had already devoured his sandwich and was finishing his iced tea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea about my aunt. Granted, she can be difficult, but I\u2019m sure, once you got to know her, you\u2019d love her as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d</p><p>She took a bite of her turkey sandwich, thought it tasted like pressed sawdust, and picked up her glass of iced tea to wash it down.</p><p>\u201cYou want this?\u201d she asked as she pushed the plate toward him.</p><p>He pushed it back. \u201cYou need to eat that,\u201d he said as he helped himself to one of the limp potato chips.</p><p>She noticed him watching the highway beyond the parking lot. \u201cThey don\u2019t get much business here, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re closing in fifteen minutes. Maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re the only customers. Tell me something, Avery. When you filled out your application to work for the Bureau, was it your goal to become an agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was about to give him her standard answer, but then decided to be completely honest with him. Besides, she was pretty sure he\u2019d cut through the bull and know she wasn\u2019t telling him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should want to be an agent. An FBI agent saved my life, and I think that was when I got it into my head that I wanted to be just like him. You know, save people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were going to save the world. How old were you when you made this momentous decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. I\u2019d just turned twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you didn\u2019t change your mind, that you held on to that goal all through high school and college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you wanted to be when you were young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember how old I was when I decided it would be pretty cool to be an astronaut. Maybe ten or eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat plan didn\u2019t work out?\u201d she asked, teasing.</p><p>\u201cLife got in the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI ended up in engineering at Tulane, graduated, and joined the Marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the Marines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cTell me the real reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could make a difference. I liked the discipline, and I wanted something different than Bowen, Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you live in Bowen now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to go away to realize what I really wanted in life. I actually live outside of Bowen, in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really did drop out of life, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like solitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you don\u2019t get much company in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that too. Where did you go to college?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSanta Clara University,\u201d she answered. \u201cThen Stanford.\u201d She took another bite of her sandwich and could barely get the horrible food down. The bread was soggy; the lettuce was wilted, and the turkey was dry.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us went very far away. We both stayed close to home. Carrie wanted me to go to college in L.A. so I could work part-time for her company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. The instantaneous reaction made him all the more curious.</p><p>\u201cShe was pushing me to do more commercials. I got roped into doing one for her when she was in a bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you have to do in this commercial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up a bar of soap, bat my eyelashes, and sing a silly jingle.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh but he came close. \u201cSing it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI was awful and I hated it. I guess I\u2019m an introvert,\u201d she added with a shrug. \u201cSince I\u2019d had this dream of becoming an agent for so long, Carrie gave in and stopped nagging me. We both gave in actually.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her plate to the side, and John Paul reached over and took a couple more potato chips. \u201cHow did you give in?\u201d</p><p>She folded her paper napkin just so and placed it on the table. \u201cI did a project at a grade school in San Jose for one of my classes, and I really enjoyed working with the children, so much so that I considered becoming a teacher. I was good with them,\u201d she added, a hint of surprise in her voice. \u201cI even went so far as to take a couple of the classes I would need to get a teaching certificate. I thought I could teach history. I didn\u2019t tell Carrie, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? What does she have against teachers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She just didn\u2019t want me to become one.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and stared at her. \u201cAvery, what aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the question, she called out to the waitress to please bring them their bill.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe. Answer me. Why didn\u2019t she want you to teach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pay\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeachers don\u2019t get much respect. You know what they say. Those who can do, and those who can\u2019t teach. Carrie didn\u2019t think there was much . . . status in teaching. My aunt isn\u2019t a shrew,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I\u2019ve made her sound terrible, but she isn\u2019t like that. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was that all? That was your reason for not teaching? There wasn\u2019t enough status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea for me to be around kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let it drop. \u201cShe thought it would be too difficult for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He homed in like a pigeon. \u201cYou can\u2019t have kids, can you?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him. She felt an overwhelming need to tell him everything, to spill her guts, as her uncle Tony would say. She\u2019d never felt this need before, but John Paul wasn\u2019t like any other man. He didn\u2019t give a hoot about silly things like status. He wasn\u2019t a game player, and he didn\u2019t have a hidden agenda. What you saw was what you got. Maybe that was the reason she was so attracted to him. And so comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you made that leap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you weren\u2019t ever going to get married, which I thought was a little odd.\u201d</p><p>She jumped on his comment with a vengeance. \u201cWhy? Because all women should want to get married? You can\u2019t really believe that. Lots of women are very happy living the single life.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand up. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree, but when you told me you weren\u2019t going to get married, you were damned defensive about it. That\u2019s what I thought was odd. Now I understand why. You can\u2019t have children, and that\u2019s the reason Carrie doesn\u2019t want you working with them. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was primed for a fight. She\u2019d let him see her vulnerability, and she knew that if he gave her an ounce of sympathy or was the least bit compassionate, she would lose it. She\u2019d either pull his hair out or her own. Worse, in her estimation, she might cry. She knew her reaction was a defense mechanism, but she didn\u2019t care. Staring into his eyes, she waited, daring him to be nice to her.</p><p>He stared back. \u201cWell?\u201d she finally demanded when he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just damned stupid.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me, sugar. You love working with kids, so that\u2019s what you ought to do. Listening to your aunt and trying to please her is just damned stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m good at my job in the Bureau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? You\u2019ve got more than one talent, don\u2019t you? You can be good doing a lot of different things.\u201d</p><p>He got up to pay the bill and then made a phone call, but all the while, he never took his gaze off the parking lot. Avery looked over at the waitress who blew a bubble twice the size of her face and then leaned on the counter and stared at him.</p><p>Five minutes later he hung up the phone. \u201cCome on. We need to get going.\u201d</p><p>She followed him to the car. He was about to open the door for her when she asked, \u201cWhat are you good at doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLots of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you worked for the CIA. What was your talent then?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cShooting. I was a good shooter. No, that\u2019s not true. I wasn\u2019t just good. I was great. Eyesight of an eagle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else you\u2019re good at doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he drawled. He put his arm around her waist and began to slowly pull her toward him. \u201cI\u2019m real good at a couple of other things too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He drew her closer and put his lips to her ear. \u201cIf things go the way I plan, you\u2019ll get to see firsthand,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d she answered breathlessly.</p><p>Could he feel her goose bumps? Probably, she thought as she sighed and turned to look into his eyes.</p> <p>Smiling gently, he kissed her warm, soft mouth, taking his time coaxing a response. She was becoming impossible to resist. The dazed look in her eyes made him feel arrogantly pleased with himself. \u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here before I get carried away and show you right now.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door for her and then got behind the wheel. They drove out of the lot and once again headed toward Denver. \u201cWe need to put some distance between us and that diner,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe waitress will remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re definitely memorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews flash, sugar,\u201d she drawled, trying to imitate his sexy southern accent. \u201cBubble Gum was staring at you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us at least another hour or more to get to Tyler\u2019s cabin. If I see a store on the way, we\u2019ll stop and get some supplies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt anything will be open this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s important because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you. You\u2019re going to break in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never know I was there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to dissuade him. She was too busy thinking about his earlier remark. What would happen if things went the way he planned?</p><p>Thirty miles down the road, they found a fish-and-tackle/ grocery store. It was dark inside.</p><p>John Paul\u2019s skills seemed endless. He got the door unlocked without making a scratch, charmed the black Doberman guard dog, and shopped to his heart\u2019s content. She helped him carry two gallons of milk and four grocery sacks to the car.</p><p>He calculated the expense as he sacked the items and left four twenty-dollar bills sticking out from under the cash register.</p> <p>\u201cHow long are we going to be staying at Tyler\u2019s place?\u201d she asked when they were once again on their way. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough food for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay at least one night, maybe two,\u201d he answered. \u201cTyler told me there\u2019s a little town about fifteen miles from the cabin. I\u2019ve got Theo checking on a couple of things, and when I find out what is going on, we\u2019ll decide what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to miss that trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. May I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Skarrett the reason you can\u2019t have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cA bullet hit just right, but you know what? I would never have had children anyway. I wouldn\u2019t take the risk that what\u2019s wrong with Jilly is genetic. So, you see, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d he argued. \u201cSkarrett took that choice away from you. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep the anger out of his voice, but she didn\u2019t become upset. What he\u2019d said was true.</p><p>She changed the subject to a less stressful one, talking about silly things that had happened to her when she was growing up. He told her stories about his life and his family, and when he talked about his father, she laughed several times.</p><p>\u201cPeople really call him Big Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they do. You\u2019ll like him,\u201d he predicted.</p><p>He was assuming she would meet his father someday. She\u2019d like that. She wanted to know about his family and his home and his work. She wanted to know everything about him. Before she could continue the conversation, they saw two pairs of headlights coming up the road toward them.</p><p>He swerved onto a side road and turned his lights off.</p><p>They silently waited until the cars passed by.</p><p>\u201cWhen you asked your brother-in-law to help, were you worried he might tell the FBI where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s with Justice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily comes first, sugar. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell, and he will help. I told him what I needed done, and he agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we can trust him.\u201d</p><p>They waited in the dark for a few minutes before he felt it was safe for them to go.</p><p>Avery\u2019s mind wandered and then circled around and around what he\u2019d whispered in her ear. Maybe if she stopped staring at him, she could think about something else. It had been such a long time since she\u2019d been intimate with a man, and she thought she had become an expert at blocking those thoughts and urges.</p><p>She had been an expert anyway, until he came into her life. Now the floodgates were wide open, and all she could think about was touching him. Everywhere.</p><p>For thirty more minutes she battled to think about something other than sex. She mentally balanced her checkbook, then calculated how long she could stay in her apartment without a paycheck coming in. Three months or four? If she got fired.</p><p>She started tapping her foot on the floor. Who was she kidding? Of course she was going to get fired. They couldn\u2019t arrest her for being insubordinate, but would Carter charge her with hindering an investigation?</p><p>John Paul put his hand on her knee. \u201cHow come you\u2019re so jittery?\u201d Then, before she could come up with a good lie, he said, \u201cThere it is.\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto a dirt road. His night vision was better than hers. She hadn\u2019t even noticed the little curve. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>His hand was still on her leg, and she wasn\u2019t inclined to move it. She stared straight ahead, pretending to watch the road as she thought about ripping his clothes off him.</p><p>Was she turning into a slut? She shook her head. No, she was simply having normal urges, like any other woman, but because she hadn\u2019t had those urges in so long, she wasn\u2019t handling herself well.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sex, damn it. I\u2019m thinking about sex. \u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Even his voice was sexy. Threading her fingers through her hair, she realized how tense she was, and how horribly unsure of herself.</p><p>They drove around a bank of trees, and then the road flattened into what she thought might be a field. It was impossible to tell in the dark. She began tapping her foot on the floorboard again. She was nervous about being alone with him in the secluded cabin.</p><p>He pulled up to the steps in front. When he turned the motor and the lights off, it was pitch black. She couldn\u2019t even see her hand in front of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou stay put until I get the key from under the porch step.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have moved if her life had depended on it. Her legs felt like rubber, and she thought she just might start hyperventilating. Fortunately, she had her wild thoughts under control by the time he\u2019d unlocked the front door and turned the lights on inside the cabin. She got out and helped him carry in the bags.</p><p>The cabin was charming and smelled of pine and Lysol. A stone fireplace faced the front door and was flanked by two wicker chairs with red-and-yellow-checked overstuffed cushions. The hunter green sofa had seen better days, for the arms were frayed, and the fabric was faded, but it looked very comfortable. To the right of the front door was a round pine table and four single ladder-back chairs.</p><p>Beyond the table was a narrow kitchen with a back door. She placed a bag of groceries on the counter, then walked through the living room to the other side of the cabin. There were two doors along the short hallway. The one on the left opened into a bathroom. At the end of the hall she opened the other door and stepped inside. Soft light spilled into the spacious room. A double bed with an old iron headboard was covered with a multicolored quilt.</p><p>The longer she stared at the bed, the faster her heart beat. She could hear John Paul putting the groceries away, knew she should probably help, but couldn\u2019t seem to make herself move.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bed, for Pete\u2019s sake. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>Disgusted with herself for being so nervous, she grabbed her duffel bag and went into the bathroom to take a shower.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered to pack a pretty nightgown or a robe. After she dried her hair and brushed her teeth, she put on a pair of skimpy pink panties and her ratty old Santa Clara T-shirt. It was at least three sizes too big for her. It hung like a tent and ended just above her knees.</p><p>Staring into the mirror, she took inventory and decided she came up lacking in the feminine wiles department. For the first time in her life, she wanted to look pretty. Boy, wouldn\u2019t Carrie have a good laugh now? She was always criticizing the way Avery dressed, and for once, Avery had to agree.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything she could do about her appearance now. With a sigh, she put her bag in the corner of the bedroom so she wouldn\u2019t trip over it, then walked into the living room just as the front door opened and John Paul came inside. He shut the door, bolted it, then turned around and froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asked. He didn\u2019t answer her. \u201cYou look like you showered in the dirt. What happened?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>John Paul couldn\u2019t make himself stop staring at her legs. Fantasies were raging in his mind. \u201cI put the car in the barn, and I thought . . . the oil . . . the tires . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He finally forced himself to look into her eyes, knowing he probably resembled a buck caught in the headlights. When he\u2019d noticed her standing in the doorway, his knees damned near buckled. That well-scrubbed look was intoxicating. She was simply gorgeous. Did she have any idea of the power she had over him?</p><p>\u201cWhat about the oil and the tires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>He was blathering like an idiot, and she was fully responsible for his radical drop in IQ. He strode past her, muttering incoherent words as he went into the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>She took a bottled water out of the fridge, turned the lights off in the kitchen and the living room, and then went into the bedroom. She kept telling herself to relax as she folded the quilt. She found clean sheets on the closet shelf and put them on the bed with a lightweight blanket she pulled out of the cedar chest. She climbed on top, scooted to the middle. Straightening her back, she folded her legs in the lotus position. She tried to clear her mind and concentrate on her breathing. Just as she was about to sit down in her imaginary porch swing without a care in the world, she was interrupted.</p><p>\u201cGoing to your happy place?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. John Paul was standing in the doorway watching her. He wore a pair of shorts and nothing else. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to button them. He had taken the time to shave, she noticed, and he\u2019d washed his hair too. There were big drops of water glistening on his tanned neck and shoulders.</p><p>Sitting on the bed definitely put her at a distinct disadvantage. If they were going to approach their situation as adults, she wanted to be on equal footing. She scrambled to get off the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to relax.\u201d</p><p>He yawned loudly. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He leaned casually against the doorframe, one ankle crossed over the other, his arms loosely folded across his chest. She tried not to stare at the dark swirl of hair around his navel.</p><p>\u201cAm I sleeping on the sofa or in the bed?\u201d</p><p>Did she have the courage to be completely honest with him, to tell him what she wanted? Put up or shut up time, she thought a little frantically. She cleared her throat, then whispered, \u201cIn bed . . . with me, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, she sounded vulnerable, maybe even a little afraid. She couldn\u2019t quite manage to look into his eyes. \u201cIf you want,\u201d she repeated hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want.\u201d</p><p>John Paul took a step toward her but stopped when she put her hand up. \u201cNot so fast, Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he warily asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are a couple of ground rules we need to go over first.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kidding. He would have laughed if she hadn\u2019t looked so nervous. \u201cGround rules? Like no hitting below the belt? That kind of rule?\u201d When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he asked, \u201cAre we going to box, or are you going to let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my T-shirt on. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you want to, but if you change your mind and want to take it off, that\u2019s fine too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I want to, I will, but I don\u2019t want to, and I probably won\u2019t. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>At this point he\u2019d lost track of what she was negotiating. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>He took another step toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Okay, what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to use protection. I can\u2019t have children, but we haven\u2019t had blood tests, and we . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned on using protection,\u201d he said when she stammered to a halt.</p><p>\u201cYou planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He pulled the condom out of his pocket and tossed it on the bed. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty presumptuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, if I don\u2019t touch you pretty soon, I\u2019m gonna go nuts, so hurry up and finish the rules.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing. \u201cIf you\u2019re disappointed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you are, you keep it to yourself. Don\u2019t complain to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you always this uptight before sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I won\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, John Paul. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d waited for as long as he could. \u201cNow it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said as he grabbed a wad of her T-shirt and pulled her toward him. \u201cYou are underneath here somewhere, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He let go and put his arms around her waist. His hand slipped up under the fabric and splayed wide across her back. She didn\u2019t try to wiggle away when his fingers touched her scars. He leaned down and kissed the side of her neck just below her ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shivers raced down Avery\u2019s spine. Her hands had been balled into fists, but as he tickled her earlobe with the tip of his tongue, she began to relax. His sweet warm breath against her sensitive skin only made her shivers intensify. She could feel the strength, the power of those hard, steely muscles under her fingertips. How could anyone this strong be so very gentle? She sighed into his neck and dropped her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPay attention, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got some ground rules too.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and stared into his eyes. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed how incredibly beautiful they were? When he smiled, they lit up.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Trust him? She was falling utterly in love with him. Of course she trusted him. She was terrified of admitting it, though. \u201cThat\u2019s not a rule.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her dodge the question, and when she tried to distract him by pressing against his groin and kissing him, he shook his head. \u201cI already know the answer, but I want . . . no, I need to hear you say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the most opinionated, obstinate, exasperating man I\u2019ve ever known, but almost from the moment we met, I felt this strange connection. It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve waited all my life to feel so safe . . . and free. I can\u2019t explain it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He tilted her chin up, brushed his mouth over hers, and then whispered, \u201cThen trust me. That\u2019s my rule. You have to trust me.\u201d</p> <p>She thought she understood what he was asking. And he was right. Love and trust went hand in hand.</p><p>It was now or never. Please, God, don\u2019t let him be repulsed. She stepped back into the soft light from the bedside lamp, waited until he had let go of her, and then, before her courage completely deserted her, she pulled the T-shirt over her head and tossed it on the floor. She turned so that he could see her ravaged back.</p><p>Most of the damage had been done to her lower spine. The angry, ugly scars puckered her skin. She was afraid to turn around, to look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSugar?\u201d</p><p>There was laughter in his voice. Confused by his reaction, she stood as stiff as a corpse with her hands at her sides staring at the wall.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m a little more interested in the front right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d</p><p>He gently turned her around and pulled her up against him. Her soft br**sts pressed against his chest. He squeezed his eyes shut and whispered, \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve been dreaming about this. It\u2019s better than the dream, though. Much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my back . . . You saw . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of territory to cover,\u201d he whispered as he kissed a tear away from her cheek. \u201cBut in my present condition, I\u2019ve gotta prioritize.\u201d</p><p>Before she could argue, or worry, or cry, his mouth took absolute possession of hers in a kiss that was sinfully carnal. His tongue slid in and out of her mouth in a ritual of lovemaking until she was trembling with desire.</p><p>His hands were everywhere, caressing, stroking, teasing, as his mouth slanted over hers again and again. He rid her of her inhibitions, and she eagerly kissed him back. She stroked his chest, loving the feel of his coarse, dark hair under her fingertips.</p><p>He growled low in his throat with pleasure when she tweaked one of his ni**les between her fingertips, and so she did it again.</p> <p>They were both panting for breath when he ended the kiss and stepped back. He let his shorts drop to the floor, staring into her eyes, reveling in the passion he saw there.</p><p>Avery held his gaze as she slid her hand down to remove her panties. The look of surprise when she realized they were on the floor made him smile over his handiwork.</p><p>She let him have his moment. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she whispered shakily.</p><p>He followed her onto the bed. Bracing his arms on either side of her, he leaned up and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d</p><p>His face was taut with passion. The way he was looking at her made her feel bold. \u201cNeither have you,\u201d she whispered back. She moved restlessly against him, her hands slowly easing down his sides. His body was as hot as his gaze.</p><p>John Paul loved the way she touched him. Hell, he loved everything about her. She made him crazy. She pulled him down for another kiss, and this time he let her be the aggressor. Their tongues dueled as their hands learned the secrets of each other\u2019s bodies.</p><p>When she touched his erection, he thought he might just lose it then and there, and he tried to get her to stop, but she wouldn\u2019t. He could barely breathe because of the ecstasy she evoked. His hand slipped down between her thighs, his fingers caressing her intimately until she arched off the bed and cried out.</p><p>He held off as long as he could until he was desperate to be inside of her. He hungrily kissed her soft, sweet mouth as his knee nudged her thighs apart. Gripping her derriere, he leaned up so that he could watch her. In one slow push, he entered her, then plunged deep.</p><p>She arched up against him at the same time, crying out in rapture as she wrapped her legs around his thighs and squeezed him tight.</p><p>Capturing the sides of her face with his hands, his mouth covered hers and his tongue sank into her warm sweet mouth. He took his time. Long, slow thrusts that cost him dearly. Beads of perspiration covered his brow, and as he made love to her, he realized it had never been this incredible before. Never.</p><p>Avery was overwhelmed by the sensations rushing through her. They were so intense, so new. She couldn\u2019t let him slow the pace any longer. She came undone in his arms, wild, more demanding, her nails scoring his shoulders as she met his thrusts with equal passion.</p><p>Driven to please her and give her fulfillment before he claimed his own, he tried to slow down, but she would have none of it. Their lovemaking turned uncontrolled, primitive, almost savage. He was consumed.</p><p>Avery could feel her control vanishing, but she wasn\u2019t afraid. It was the most amazing feeling to be so uninhibited and to let herself go without fear or worry. She knew she was safe in his arms, and as she reached the precipice and her body began to shiver for release, she arched up against him. Wave after wave of undiluted pleasure coursed through her body as she clung to him.</p><p>Impossible to hold back, his orgasm was triggered by hers, and he cl**axed deep inside of her, clenching his jaw in ecstasy.</p><p>They stayed joined together as one for long, blissful minutes. Their breathing was ragged, and neither one of them had the strength to move. Their hearts pounded in unison. He buried his face in her silky hair, closed his eyes as he inhaled her wonderful fragrance.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. She\u2019d taken every ounce of his strength. His bones felt like liquid as he tried to move so he wouldn\u2019t crush her.</p><p>She obviously didn\u2019t mind his weight because she squeezed him when he shifted his position, and whispered, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Had he been too rough with her? The thought popped into his head and anchored there. He could have been more gentle, but she\u2019d been so wonderfully uninhibited, he\u2019d gone a little crazy.</p><p>\u201cAvery? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled because of the worry she heard in his voice. And then she whispered, \u201cSo that\u2019s what all the fuss was about.\u201d</p><p>And then she laughed with such delight, he smiled in spite of his exhaustion.</p><p>With a sigh, he rolled away, then got up and went into the bathroom.</p><p>She pulled the sheet up, adjusted her pillow, and fell back. She was still a little overwhelmed by what she had just experienced. Sex, she decided, sex with John Paul anyway, could definitely become addictive.</p><p>The bed springs groaned when John Paul stretched out beside her. She opened her eyes and smiled. He looked so arrogantly proud of himself. He was on his side with his head propped up staring at her.</p><p>She looked thoroughly ravaged. Passion lingered in her eyes, and her lips were swollen from his kisses.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d satisfied him, but she still needed him to tell her so. Silly how she could feel so powerful a minute ago and now the old insecurities were creeping back. No, she hadn\u2019t disappointed him. Why wasn\u2019t he telling her so?</p><p>He could see it happening. In her eyes. They were clouded. He didn\u2019t think she was regretting anything . . . just worried maybe.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d guessed right when she said, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He tugged on the sheet, pulling it down to the tips of her breasts. She pulled it back up.</p><p>\u201cBet I can get this off you faster than a prom dress,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother. You\u2019re pretty happy with yourself right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I am,\u201d he said as he leaned down and kissed her. His tongue slipped inside and tickled the roof of her mouth. When he pulled back, she was breathless. But then, so was he.</p><p>Oh, how she loved this man. He was so completely perfect for her. She reached up to brush his hair off his forehead, an excuse to keep touching him. She couldn\u2019t seem to get enough.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Heavens to Betsy\u2019?\u201d he drawled. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said, sugar, when you were coming apart in my arms. Actually, you screamed it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you shouted, but I\u2019m not going to repeat it.\u201d</p><p>His grin was lecherous. \u201cGuess what.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers trailed down the muscled cord on the side of his neck, then crossed his shoulder. She gently traced it with her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked lazily.</p><p>\u201cProm dress is gone.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she lifted her head and looked down. The sheet was around her ankles. \u201cYou are good.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed each breast. His fingers slowly circled her navel. A jagged scar crisscrossed the lower part of her abdomen. The raised, puckered center indicated a bullet had done the damage. Probably a .38, he thought. Or maybe a .45.</p><p>Damn, it was a miracle she had survived. He leaned forward and took his time kissing every inch of her stomach, smiling as she inhaled sharply. He rolled back on his side so he could watch her face as his hand slid down into her soft curls.</p><p>Avery was having trouble catching her breath. \u201cDo you want . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I want.\u201d</p><p>Moaning softly, she moved restlessly against him, her toes rubbing his lower legs.</p><p>She tried to touch him, but he grabbed her hand. \u201cRelax, sugar. Let me . . .\u201d</p><p>It was as far as he got. She was surprisingly strong. And bold. She pushed him onto his back and leaned over him. \u201cRelax? I don\u2019t think so, John Paul. This is a team sport, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer her. Her hands had captured his arousal, and she was slowly driving him wild with her caresses.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . .\u201d she whispered as she straddled his h*ps and kissed him passionately.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d he asked, his voice as coarse as sandpaper.</p><p>Her eyes sparkled when she answered. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a team player.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>THE MAN WAS INSATIABLE. AVERY WOKE UP AT NOON. SHE didn\u2019t usually sleep so late, but John Paul hadn\u2019t let her get much rest during the night.</p><p>She was on her stomach with one arm hanging over the side of the bed. He was tickling her back. His fingers were as light as feathers. Was he trying to drive her crazy, or was he being so very gentle because of her scars?</p><p>Oh, God, her scars. Even Carrie, who loved her like a mother, couldn\u2019t stop herself from grimacing when she looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou awake yet?\u201d he asked. \u201cAvery?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say good morning. She blurted, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u2019</p><p>\u201cMy back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you handle the truth?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. She didn\u2019t like his tone one bit. She could feel her defenses building inside her. \u201cYes, I can handle it,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sweet little ass.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first thing I noticed about you when you came strutting inside the lobby of that spa.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t strut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pervert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liberal. I figure that makes us even. About the scars . . .\u201d</p><p>She was still smiling when she asked, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just scars. They don\u2019t define who you are. Now get up. Breakfast will be ready in ten minutes. Move it,\u201d he said as he rolled off the bed.</p><p>He was stark na*ed and seemed thoroughly happy about it. He was gorgeous. All muscle and male.</p><p>\u201cPut some clothes on for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you go around like that in the swamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t, not with the gators and snakes.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his jeans from the chair and went into the living room. Avery took a quick shower and put on a pair of navy shorts and a pale yellow blouse. Her hair was tucked behind her ears when she padded barefoot into the living room.</p><p>John Paul went into the kitchen to fix her plate and placed it in front of her. Then he handed her a bottle of Tabasco sauce.</p><p>He\u2019d prepared scrambled eggs with lots of pepper. She took a bite and quickly washed it down with orange juice.</p><p>\u201cYou like spicy food,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIn Louisiana, spicy food is a way of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like growing up in Bowen with a father everyone in town calls Big Daddy Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he answered. \u201cMy dad\u2019s quite a character, always got something going, if you know what I mean. He\u2019s a bit of a con, but he\u2019s got a good heart.\u201d</p><p>He told her a couple of funny stories about the mischief that he and his brother, Remy, got into when they were boys. He mentioned his father and his younger sister often, and each time, she noticed, his voice softened.</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s as bossy as you are.\u201d His smile indicated he thought that was a good thing. \u201cShe\u2019s a surgeon,\u201d he added proudly. \u201cHer name\u2019s Michelle, but everyone calls her Mike, everyone but her husband. They\u2019re expecting their first baby in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo,\u201d Avery said. \u201cShe\u2019s married to Theo, and he\u2019s an attorney with Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>He told her another story while she ate her breakfast, and then she helped him do the dishes.</p><p>\u201cIt rained hard early this morning. Thunder shook the rafters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wore you out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sounded cocky. She decided to let him have his due. \u201cYes, you did,\u201d she agreed as she folded the tea towel and put it on the counter. \u201cWe have to make plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he agreed as he followed her into the living room. She curled up on the sofa. He sat down in a chair, kicked his shoes off, and propped his feet up on the opposite end of the sofa. He was such a big man he swallowed up the chair.</p><p>\u201cBut not today,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we rest and talk. Tomorrow we plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we talk about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot what, but who,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to talk about Jilly.\u201d</p><p>She had put it off as long as she could. Nodding, she said, \u201cCarrie kept a diary. She was very young, around eleven, when she started writing in it. The diary wasn\u2019t filled with her hopes and dreams and crushes, though. No, it was all about Jilly. Every single page was filled with one horrific incident after another involving her sick sister. Carrie told me she wanted to have some kind of record . . . proof, I guess, in hopes that one day Jilly would get caught, be put away. She thought that if the doctors read her diary, they would realize how dangerous Jilly was and make sure she stayed behind bars for the rest of her life, but I think there was more to it than that. I think that deep down Carrie believed that one day Jilly would kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a hell of a way to grow up,\u201d he said.</p><p>Avery agreed. \u201cCarrie stopped writing in the diary when Jilly left town, but she always kept it, just in case Jilly came back. I knew where it was hidden, but Carrie wouldn\u2019t let me read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did read it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I did. I wish to God I hadn\u2019t, though. I was old enough to think I could handle anything, but there was such scary, sick stuff in there . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen. I read every word, and I had nightmares for months. Carrie had put in a lot of details, and I learned all the twisted facts about Jilly.\u201d</p><p>She was hugging a throw pillow to her chest in a death grip. The sadness in her eyes was heartbreaking.</p><p>\u201cI hate talking about her,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cThere really are monsters in this world. Predators,\u201d she said. \u201cJilly\u2019s one of them. Do you know what scared me the most after I read that diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I would wake up one morning and be just like her. You know, Dr. Jekyll\u2013Mr. Hyde. Genetically, I\u2019m forever linked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to happen, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a conscience. That\u2019s not going to go away. You\u2019re nothing like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dr. Hahn told me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Dr. Hahn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA psychiatrist. I was waking up screaming every night, and in desperation, Carrie took me to Dr. Hahn.\u201d She added, \u201cCarrie made me promise not to tell anyone because she didn\u2019t want people to think I was crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was worried about what other people thought?\u201d he asked, trying to keep the censure out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cDr. Hahn was wonderful, and he helped me . . . cope, I guess you could say. Carrie didn\u2019t know why I was having the nightmares because I hadn\u2019t told her I\u2019d read the diaries, and I think it was the third or fourth session when Dr. Hahn asked her to come in and I told her then what I had done. She had a fit, of course, but when the doctor had gotten her to calm down, he asked her if he could read the diary, and she agreed. She would have done anything to help me get over what she called my night terrors.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at John Paul as she swung her legs down from the sofa. \u201cI think the doctor had nightmares after he read them. I grew up knowing that Jilly was crazy, and Carrie did tell me stories, but they paled in comparison to what was in the diary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Hahn say about Jilly after he read it? What was his reaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcited?\u201d he repeated, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cHe was sure Jilly was a pure sociopath, and he wished he\u2019d had the opportunity to study her. Based on what he read, he concluded that Jilly was morally and emotionally stunted, which was why he believed she was incapable of feeling guilt or remorse. Other people\u2019s pain certainly didn\u2019t make her feel bad. On the contrary,\u201d she explained, \u201cshe enjoyed hurting people for no apparent reason. She just liked it. She was a master at blaming others and rewriting history, and she was very deceptive.\u201d</p><p>John Paul put his feet down on the floor and leaned forward, bracing his arms on his knees.</p><p>\u201cShe was . . . amazing, the way she could manipulate people. Everyone loved her, no matter what she did. She was so damned clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she was quite young, she started having fun with pets. She tortured and killed Carrie\u2019s cat with gasoline and a match. She told Carrie what she\u2019d done, but in front of their mother, she cried because, she said, she so loved that cat. One of the neighbors took her to get an ice cream cone to make her feel better. By the time she was a senior in high school, she was into bigger and better. She was the most popular girl in school, of course. Everyone loved Jilly. A girl named Heather Mitchell was voted homecoming queen, and Jilly was voted first attendant. According to Carrie, Jilly was gracious about it at school, but when she came home that afternoon, she went into a rage that lasted for hours. She nearly destroyed the house. Carrie\u2019s bedroom suffered the most damage. Not Jilly\u2019s room, of course. Then, after dinner, she became real quiet and got that sly look in her eyes and pretended to accept it.\u201d</p><p>Avery took a breath. The muscles in her arms were aching, and she realized she was gripping the pillow. She let go.</p><p>\u201cThe next day a beaker of sulfuric acid was missing from the chemistry lab. After school, Jilly got Heather alone, but Carrie saw her take her arm and lead her down the street. Jilly told Heather that she\u2019d better not show up for homecoming weekend or she\u2019d be sorry. Heather was a sweet girl, and she was going through a terrible time. Her mother had died two weeks before of an aneurysm, and the poor girl was still reeling from the shock. When Jilly got through tormenting her, Heather locked herself in her bedroom, but her father finally got her to tell him what was wrong. He said that Jilly had admitted stealing the acid. She threatened to wait for Heather one day after school when she was all alone in her house and throw the acid in her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cWhat Carrie wrote wasn\u2019t hearsay. She talked to Heather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Heather\u2019s father do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to the principal the next morning and demanded that Jilly be expelled. He also went to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chief of police was a close friend of my grandmother\u2019s, and he wasn\u2019t going to do anything that would upset her. Besides, it was one girl\u2019s word against the other\u2019s. Jilly, of course, denied the incident. My grandmother and Jilly were called into the principal\u2019s office that afternoon. Grandmother made Carrie go with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Jilly expelled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, scoffing at the notion. \u201cDid I mention that the principal was a man? His name was Mr. Bennett, and he was a very unhappily married man. His wife was a cold woman and very difficult to get along with, or so Carrie wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d John Paul asked, bringing her back to the story.</p><p>\u201cCarrie watched Jilly seduce Bennett. Jilly became hysterical. Lots of tears flowing, but it was all a calculated act. The principal rushed over to the sofa where Jilly was and sat down beside her. He put his arm around her to comfort her, but it was Jilly\u2019s body language that . . . fascinated Carrie . . . and Bennett\u2019s reaction.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHave you ever seen a woman move like a cat? Carrie said Jilly was like that. When Bennett put his arm around her, she rubbed up against him in an obscene way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your grandmother do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was as clueless as ever, according to Carrie. She\u2019d gone out to the front desk to get Jilly a glass of water, but even if she had stayed, she wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything because she didn\u2019t want to notice. Carrie wrote that Jilly was clinging to Bennett while she cried. She had her head on his shoulder, but she looked up at Carrie, who was standing behind the principal, and Jilly had this Cheshire cat smile on her face. When it was over, Bennett threatened to suspend Heather for making up the lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Jilly had a way with men. Some of them became obsessed with her. They would call at all hours of the day and night. Every once in a while, Carrie would sneak upstairs into Grandmother Lola\u2019s bedroom and listen in on the extension. She wrote that the men cried and pleaded, and after Jilly hung up, she could hear her laughing. Oh, how she loved the power she had. She loved manipulating, and she used sex to get what she wanted. Her specialty was destroying married men. I\u2019ll bet you can guess who one of those men was,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all this was going on while she was in high school?\u201d Before Avery could answer, he asked, \u201cWhat happened to Heather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t go to homecoming, and Jilly was crowned queen, but that wasn\u2019t enough for Jilly. Heather had upset her, and so she had to be punished. Jilly tormented her. A month passed, and just as Heather was beginning to think Jilly had moved on, she came home from school one day and went up to her room. She had this old teddy bear she kept on her bed. Someone had poured acid all over it. That someone, of course, was Jilly.\u201d</p><p>John Paul rubbed his jaw and waited until Avery continued.</p><p>\u201cCarrie heard about it at school the next day. She went to see Heather\u2019s father. He had to stay home with his daughter because she was so distraught, and Carrie told him Jilly wouldn\u2019t stop going after Heather and that he needed to get his daughter out of town and not tell anyone where she had gone. Heather was close to a nervous breakdown. She was seeing a therapist,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd the therapist thought it would be good for Heather to get away from Sheldon Beach. She left during Christmas vacation and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it ever end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cHeather\u2019s father filed another report with the police two months later. He said that someone was stealing his mail. One Saturday afternoon, he happened to look outside and saw Jilly opening his mailbox. She was looking for letters from Heather so she could find out where she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t give up, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t. She never had sex with any of the boys in her high school. All her friends believed she was sweet and wholesome. Carrie heard a couple of rumors about Jilly, but not from anyone at school. Heather was the one who was ostracized, not Jilly. She was that good at being bad.\u201d</p><p>She stood and stretched her arms above her head. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>After the story she\u2019d just told him, hard liquor sounded good to him, but he settled on a Diet Coke instead. She got herself a bottle of Evian water and handed him his soda.</p><p>He opened the can, took a swig, and asked, \u201cDid your grandparents try to get her some help when she was little, or did they know then that something was wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandfather left when Carrie and Jilly were little girls, and Grandmother Lola lived in what Carrie called a fantasyland. She had an excuse for every atrocity Jilly committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Jilly get pregnant with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHer senior year. Carrie thought her pregnancy saved Heather because Jilly had other things to think about. Jilly tried to get an abortion, but the doctor wouldn\u2019t do it because she was too far along. She gave birth and left town three days later. And that was the last entry in the diary,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cLeaving me behind was the last straw for Grandmother. She dragged all of Jilly\u2019s things out to the curb for the trash collector. When she was packing up her things from the closet, she found a shoe box full of mail from Heather\u2019s house, and guess what else she found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe acid.\u201d</p><p>Avery nodded. \u201cThe beaker was only half full, but it would have been more than enough to kill Heather. I think Jilly didn\u2019t forget about that girl. I think she was biding her time.\u201d</p><p>A clap of thunder jarred her. She flinched in reaction, then got up and walked to the window to look out. Dark angry clouds loomed overhead. Lightning sliced across the sky, and then there was another booming blast of thunder.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn around as she said, \u201cCarrie didn\u2019t think Jilly was very smart. She used her body to get what she wanted. She\u2019s obviously become more devious and clever over the years. Carrie said there wasn\u2019t a man alive who was immune to her charms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkarrett obviously became obsessed with her, and look where he ended up. When I was five years old, Jilly and Skarrett came to the house. Jilly told Grandmother she had to pay to keep me. Fortunately, Carrie was home. She told Jilly she didn\u2019t have any legal rights to me and pushed her out the door. It was a horrible fight, but Skarrett kept his distance . . . then. Jilly kept screaming, \u2018You\u2019re dead, Carrie. You\u2019re dead.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you while all this was going on?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of it, but Carrie told me she found me hiding under my bed. After they left, Carrie promised me they would never come back.\u201d</p><p>She took a gulp of her water, put the lid back on, and stared down at her hand. There was a deep indentation in her palm from where she\u2019d been gripping the bottle cap.</p><p>\u201cBut they did come back, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He watched her closely as she closed her eyes and told him what had happened on February fourteenth, all those years ago.</p><p>When she was finished, she said, \u201cSkarrett\u2019s her puppet. And I think she\u2019s got Monk doing her bidding now too. She\u2019s playing both of them to get what she wants.\u201d</p><p>She put the bottle down on the table and took a step toward John Paul. \u201cSo now you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.

In exasperation, he asked, \u201cSorry about what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting involved with me. It\u2019s a temporary situation, but even so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cJohn Paul, you\u2019ve got to be a little repulsed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t come from a normal family. Genetically speaking, I\u2019m a mess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSugar, no need to be so melodramatic and no need to shout at me either. I can hear just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you smile after what you just heard? How can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, you didn\u2019t do any of those things. Jilly did.\u201d</p><p>He thought he was being extremely logical, but she wasn\u2019t the least bit interested in being reasonable. \u201cNow do you understand why I won\u2019t ever get married?\u201d</p><p>Before she could take another step away from him, he reached for her. He put his hands on her h*ps and slowly pulled her toward him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to push his hands away, but they were cemented to her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to explain it to me. Are you afraid you\u2019ll sneeze and turn into a sociopath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but I can\u2019t have children, and even if I could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen want children.\u201d</p><p>She stood between his knees, frowning at him while she shifted from foot to foot.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSome don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t going to lie to her. \u201cI always figured I\u2019d settle down one day and have a couple of kids. I still might,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Avery, there are a lot of children out there who need good homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think after doing a background check on my family that I would ever qualify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get married.\u201d</p><p>The defiance was back in her voice. She was trying to hide her vulnerability, but it wasn\u2019t working. He knew she was hurting inside.</p><p>\u201cDid I ask you to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I think we\u2019ve had enough heavy talk for a little while. And I also think you need to lighten up a little.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to her that he was behaving the same way he had when she\u2019d shown him her back. The scars hadn\u2019t seemed to faze him. Obviously, neither did the stories she\u2019d told him about Jilly.</p><p>What the hell was the matter with him?</p><p>\u201cYou need to relax,\u201d he told her. He worked her blouse up over her navel and leaned forward to kiss her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what yoga is for. It helps me relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a better way to unwind.\u201d</p><p>He unbuttoned her shorts and reached for the zipper. She grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>His smile made her heart race. Her hand dropped to her side, and she watched him unzip her shorts. As they fell to the floor, he finally answered her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, sugar. I\u2019m going to my happy place.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>SECRETS WERE BEST SHARED IN THE BEDROOM. THEY MADE love, and after he had kissed and caressed every inch of her beautiful body, she was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d get around to your back,\u201d he said as he rolled away from her.</p><p>She laughed because he\u2019d sounded so smug. Still breathless from their lovemaking, she whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>He grinned arrogantly. \u201cWith you I am.\u201d</p><p>It was a lovely thing to say, almost a compliment, she thought. \u201cMove over,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m falling off the bed.\u201d</p><p>The double bed didn\u2019t give him anyplace to go. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need to buy a king-size bed.\u201d</p><p>Her mood changed as swiftly as the wind. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked tensely.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m too big for a double bed,\u201d he answered. \u201cMy feet hang over. What\u2019s the big deal about a king-size bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know we can\u2019t have any kind of a lasting relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you implied . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, you worry too much.\u201d</p><p>She silently agreed. Of course, she worried . . . about everything. But what terrified her more than anything was ruining things. Admitting to herself that she loved John Paul had already put her in a mild panic. What was going to happen when they parted? Would she ever recover?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in marriage. Look what it does to some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like the Parnells . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, those aren\u2019t what you\u2019d call typical people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the divorce rate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about couples who have stayed together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ruin things,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, she propped herself up with her elbow, leaned over him, and waited. Had he fallen asleep?</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201d</p><p>He was wearing an adorable smile and nothing else. He oozed self-confidence, probably because he didn\u2019t give a hoot what anyone else thought. She\u2019d lived her life trying to please everyone. He was the complete antithesis. He didn\u2019t want to please anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have much faith in yourself, do you? It\u2019s okay,\u201d he added before she could answer. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough for both of us.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his flat, hard stomach and circled his navel with her fingertips. He made everything sound so easy.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop touching him. She could almost see the strength radiating from his muscles, but she wasn\u2019t the least bit intimidated by him. When she was in his arms, she didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed or diminished. On the contrary, he made her feel powerful. It was the most incredible sensation, not worrying about pleasing him, just knowing that whatever she did was all right, being that free, that liberated. Her trust in him was absolute, and she realized what a wonderful gift he\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart. Just give me a couple of minutes, and I\u2019ll be able\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her body was still tingling from the last time. She laughed. \u201cNot that,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cYou were perfect, Avery, but you\u2019ve got to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pinched him. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for a review. I want to know why you walked away.\u201d</p><p>Before he could deliberately misinterpret, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you my secrets, most of them anyway, and now it\u2019s your turn. Why did you retire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s boring stuff.\u201d</p><p>She pinched him again. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at her. The determination he saw told him he wasn\u2019t going to be able to finesse his way out of this one. Besides, he figured he owed her.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any one big assignment that went wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of little screwups that made me . . . reevaluate what I wanted out of life. I had a bad problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started thinking too much. I had a lot of time to do that while I waited in hellholes for the next assignment. They were usually generals,\u201d he explained nonchalantly. \u201cLittle prick dictators who surrounded themselves with thugs. I didn\u2019t mind killing them, for the greater good,\u201d he added sarcastically. \u201cAnd I liked going in after hostages. There was justice in that action, but one night, while I was freezing my ass off, I noticed I was getting a callus on my finger. My trigger finger,\u201d he added softly. \u201cThat really freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished my assignment, told them I was done, and went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it that easy? Didn\u2019t they try to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d he answered. \u201cAt the time, it was easy because I worked for a good, decent man. He knew I\u2019d had it. I think the way he got around all the red tape was to give me an extended leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re still trying to get you to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery once in a while,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t, though.\u201d He closed his eyes again and said, \u201cI did some badass things, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would imagine so,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t believe that what you were doing made any difference, did you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hit the mark dead center. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Dictators are like weeds. You rip one out of the ground and two more pop up overnight.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes again and watched her as he recounted one of his bloodier assignments. When he was finished, he noticed she hadn\u2019t pulled her hand away. She was still stroking his chest. Her touch was soothing.</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re a carpenter,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. I\u2019m still using my hands, but now I build things that will last. I don\u2019t break necks. It\u2019s odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe urge to kill. I never had that before. I do now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. He\u2019d made the confession so casually. \u201cOh? Who do you want to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkarrett.\u201d</p><p>She shivered in reaction. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I want him to live the rest of his life behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if I get the opportunity . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said when he realized she was getting upset.</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t mind if you kill Monk,\u201d she said then. \u201cBut I hope someone brings him in alive. Can you imagine the things he could tell them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe won\u2019t talk. He\u2019s not the kind of man who likes to boast. Maybe, if the interrogators work him, treat him like a professional, he might give them a little insight, but I honestly don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d He shrugged and added, \u201cI think they ought to squash him like a bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jilly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be locked up in an institution for the criminally insane, and she needs to stay there for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want her dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can help being the way she is. I just want to make sure she can\u2019t hurt anyone anymore.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb across her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a gentle heart,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I do,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got great hands,\u201d he added as he reached for her.</p><p>She slapped his hand away. \u201cI already know you\u2019re good with your hands,\u201d she said.</p><p>She got an impish gleam in her eyes as she rolled on top of him. He locked his legs around her to keep her from making a eunuch out of him.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to show you how good I am,\u201d she cooed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an idle boast. Avery had a vivid imagination, and what she did to him with her hands and her mouth was magical, and probably illegal in some states, but of course he wasn\u2019t about to mention that to her.</p><p>That night they slept entwined in each other\u2019s arms even though both of them knew that the interlude would be over in the morning. They couldn\u2019t push reality away any longer.</p><p>Avery awakened before John Paul did and quickly showered and dressed in the bathroom so she wouldn\u2019t disturb him. Then she went into the living room, softly closing the bedroom door behind her, and checked the time. There was a digital clock on the wall above the table. She hoped it was accurate. Five forty-five Colorado time, which meant it was seven forty-five in Virginia.</p><p>She thought she heard the shower running as she reached for the phone. \u201cStay predictable, Margo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t get spontaneous now.\u201d</p><p>She dialed information, got the number she needed, then hung up and waited, her gaze locked on the time.</p><p>At exactly seven-fifty, Avery dialed. The phone was answered on the third ring.</p><p>Avery made up a name, told the employee it was an emergency and that he needed to put Margo on the phone. She described her friend and added, \u201cShe comes in every morning at seven-fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the short lady, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo after her,\u201d Avery shouted. \u201cHurry. Get her back. Go.\u201d</p><p>The phone clattered against the wall when the employee dropped it. She heard him shouting Margo\u2019s name, and then a minute later, she could hear Margo arguing.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows I\u2019m here. What do you mean it\u2019s an emergency? Hello,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMargo, it\u2019s me, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Avery. How did you know I would be here . . . how did you . . .\u201d She was rattled.</p><p>\u201cYou always pick up doughnuts on your way into the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much trouble you\u2019re in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d Avery countered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave that police station in Colorado? The agents are there to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRenard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered impatiently. \u201cTell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door opened, and John Paul stopped in the doorway, staring at her incredulously. She put her hand up when he started toward her.</p><p>\u201cHold on, Margo.\u201d Cupping the receiver with her hand, she said to John Paul, \u201cTrust me.\u201d Then she raised the phone to her ear again. \u201cOkay, Margo. Start talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trial begins July tenth,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Avery, the parole hearing is still on too. Skarrett might pull it off this time. He could get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJeez, don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the hearing still scheduled for the sixteenth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure or not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t get all hostile on me, Avery. They know about Jilly. Your aunt told them. That had to have been a hell of a shock. I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Avery interrupted. She didn\u2019t want sympathy. \u201cDo they have any idea where Jilly and Monk might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my aunt? Have they moved her from the hospital yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. Don\u2019t worry about her. A gnat couldn\u2019t get into that hospital. Security\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she said. \u201cMonk can\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep him busy. He\u2019s going to have to try and stop me from testifying at Skarrett\u2019s trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he care about Skarrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s working for Jilly now, and she wants Skarrett out of prison. I\u2019ll bet, if you check the records at the prison for visitors over the past year, you\u2019ll find that Skarrett had a female visitor listed more than once. I think she\u2019s made some kind of deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the millions in uncut stones that he stole,\u201d Margo said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Skarrett thinks they\u2019ll share the loot and that he\u2019ll live happily ever after with Jilly. But when they have what they want, Jilly will let Monk kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery, you\u2019re in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t stop now, though. About the trial . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out who the prosecutor is, and make sure I\u2019m on his witness list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I tell Carter I talked to you?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re going to tell him anyway, she thought. Margo was her friend, but Avery knew she would believe she was being helpful by filling Carter in.</p><p>\u201cYes, please do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you now? He\u2019s going to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlabama,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. Tell Carter I\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Margo cried. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Avery knew what she wanted to do. She just didn\u2019t know how yet. The conversation with Jilly popped into her head. What had she called her? Oh, yes, how could she forget?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a killjoy.\u201d</p><p>John Paul trusted her. Otherwise he would have ripped the phone out of her hand and hung it up. He\u2019d sat down on the sofa beside her and impatiently waited for her to finish her conversation. He looked relieved when she told him she\u2019d caught Margo at the doughnut shop.</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d he said with approval.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a creature of habit.\u201d</p><p>She told him what Margo had said. \u201cI promised I\u2019d call Carter,\u201d she added, \u201cwhen we get to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better think hard before you agree to go with me, John Paul. It could get . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the long haul.\u201d</p><p>He reached over, cupped the back of her neck with his hand, and drew her toward him. He kissed her possessively and said, \u201cDid you hear me? I\u2019m in it for the long haul. And like it or not, babe, so are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we get Monk and Jilly.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and went into the kitchen. She fixed breakfast, cereal and toast, and then, because she was feeling restless, did the dishes while he looked over the map, figuring their route to Sheldon Beach.</p><p>She was putting the bowls back into the cabinet when he called out to her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got company.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the tea towel and ran into the living room. John Paul was standing by the front window, cautiously looking out. He held his gun at his side, pressed against his leg.</p><p>He saw the car when it came around the grove of trees and relaxed. \u201cBetter get packed,\u201d he said as he flipped the safety back on the gun and tucked it into the back of his jeans. \u201cOur ride\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>What ride? \u201cYou were expecting someone?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He couldn\u2019t see the driver yet because the sun bouncing off the windshield obstructed his view, but the make and model were right. It was a new, gray Honda.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI told Theo I needed transportation. The police will be looking for my car, and I figured you didn\u2019t want them to hold us until the FBI took you into custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI wouldn\u2019t do that unless they had my permission.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. She assumed that meant he didn\u2019t agree. \u201cThey would not trample all over my rights as a citizen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they would,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019d tell you that they were only doing what they felt was best for you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to get into a full-blown argument about the Bureau now. Besides, deep down, she was concerned that there was a kernel of truth in what he\u2019d said. She wasn\u2019t willing to risk it.</p><p>\u201cTheo drove all this way from Louisiana?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe wanted to come, but I talked him out of it. I reminded him that he\u2019s going to be a father and that he\u2019s a lousy shot. If he gets himself killed, then I\u2019ll have to become the kid\u2019s father figure. Said I\u2019d raise his son or daughter to be just like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that gave him chills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd like I said, he\u2019s a lousy shot. He\u2019d probably shoot himself getting his gun out of its holster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want him to get hurt. You better watch it. You\u2019re beginning to sound nice.\u201d</p><p>He squinted against the sunlight trying to see the driver. \u201cTheo said he knew someone who could keep quiet and help. Who wouldn\u2019t mind breaking some rules. Ah, hell,\u201d he groaned when he finally saw who was behind the wheel. \u201cNot him. That son of a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo. My brother-in-law has a sick sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo sent him,\u201d he snapped, stabbing at the air with his finger.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she demanded. She was beginning to feel like an owl.</p><p>\u201cClayborne. He sent Noah Clayborne.\u201d He spat the name out as though it left a foul taste in his mouth.</p><p>She was thoroughly confused by his attitude. \u201cBut you called Noah from the spa. I heard you on the phone. Why are you angry now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did call him, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to see him,\u201d he muttered. He turned to her, gave her a quick once-over from head to toes, and barked, \u201cPut some damn clothes on.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at herself. Yes, there were clothes. White tennis shoes, navy shorts, white T-shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with what I have on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much skin showing. Ah, hell, it wouldn\u2019t matter if you were dressed like a nun. He\u2019s still gonna hit on you. Then I\u2019m gonna have to shoot the bastard.\u201d He stomped to the door, all but pulled it off the hinges when he opened it, and went out onto the porch. \u201cJust see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oh, brother. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing us a car.\u201d She called out the reminder. \u201cStop complaining about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he called back. \u201cWe\u2019ll make him stay here or take my car. He doesn\u2019t need to go with us.\u201d</p><p>Avery stepped back to the window. John Paul had made her curious about Theo\u2019s friend. She knew Noah couldn\u2019t possibly be as obnoxious as John Paul had implied. No one could be that awful.</p><p>The car stopped in front of the house, and Noah Clayborne opened the car door and emerged into the sunlight.</p><p>Avery felt like whistling. Tall, broad-shouldered, with sandy blond hair, the man was dressed casually in jeans and a gray T-shirt. He wore the old-fashioned shoulder holster and a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. John Paul scowled at him, but Clayborne smiled back, as though the joke were on Renard. The man had a dimple and definitely oozed sensuality.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t interested in him, of course, not in that way. John Paul was sexier\u2014everything about him appealed to her\u2014but Noah, in appearance anyway, could be a close runner-up. Of course, her analysis was strictly clinical. She had never taken the time to notice such things about a man before, or if she had, she hadn\u2019t been able to admit it to herself. Had finally ha**ng s*x again turned her mind into mush?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need therapy when this is over,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBig-time therapy.\u201d</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she went outside to meet him. He\u2019d reached the steps but stopped when she walked onto the porch.</p><p>John Paul\u2019s social graces definitely needed work. She waited a couple of seconds for him to introduce her, then realized he wasn\u2019t going to. She would have stepped forward, but John Paul put his arm around her shoulders and jerked her close to him.</p><p>Noah\u2019s response to the ridiculously possessive action was to widen his grin. He removed his sunglasses and looked directly at her. Blue eyes. The man had intense blue eyes. Bet he breaks a lot of hearts, she thought, as she felt John Paul tighten his hold.</p><p>Was he married? She hoped not because she could think of at least three friends to fix him up with, providing, of course, he wasn\u2019t just a body without a mind. Margo wouldn\u2019t be bothered by that, but Peyton, her childhood friend, would definitely want a man with a brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you staring at, Clayborne?\u201d John Paul barked.</p><p>She put a stop to the pissing contest. She pushed his arm away and walked to the edge of the porch.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d she began. Extending her hand, she added, \u201cMy name\u2019s Avery Delaney.\u201d</p><p>Noah came up the stairs and shook her hand. He didn\u2019t let go as he introduced himself and then said, \u201cI gotta know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at John Paul and said, \u201cHow\u2019d a sweet thing like you get hooked up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lucky,\u201d John Paul snapped. \u201cNow let go of her.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled at Avery and continued to hold on to her hand. He was enjoying himself by deliberately provoking John Paul. He seemed to know what buttons to push to get John Paul riled. Come to think of it, it didn\u2019t take much.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate your help, don\u2019t we, John Paul?\u201d</p><p>She had to elbow him to get him to answer. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, come inside. Are you thirsty?\u201d she asked as she led the way into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s thirsty, he can get his own damned drink,\u201d John Paul said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to play hostess, Avery.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cStop being a jerk,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI was being polite, something you know precious little about. Now stop acting like a rooster and get rid of the attitude.\u201d</p><p>He immediately backed down. \u201cYeah, all right.\u201d</p><p>Noah tried not to laugh.</p><p>John Paul looked a bit sheepish as he said to Noah, \u201cShe\u2019s got a temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Noah drawled.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. Never thought you\u2019d fall. Hell, I never thought any woman would want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just here to do Theo a favor,\u201d he explained. \u201cDon\u2019t take your frustrations out on me.\u201d The fact was, he liked John Paul, and he respected him. Maybe even admired him a little because he\u2019d had the guts to walk away from a job that usually broke a man.</p><p>Avery had gone into the kitchen to get a cold soda for Noah. She stopped in the kitchen doorway. The men had returned to the porch, and she couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying. She put the bottle back in the refrigerator and decided to pack her bag.</p><p>She heard a couple of crude and colorful expletives; then she heard laughter. They\u2019re nuts, she thought as she went into the bedroom and shut the door. The bed looked as though acrobats had practiced their act on it. She quickly stripped the sheets, put on fresh ones, and dropped the soiled linens in the hamper.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to pack. She changed into her khaki pants and searched through her bag for her pink blouse. The clothes the woman at the police station had taken home to launder for her were folded neatly on the side of the duffel bag.</p><p>It was such a sweet thing to do, washing her clothes. When this was over, she would have so many people to thank for their kindness. She\u2019d have to do something especially nice for the police chief. Letting them use his cabin was above and beyond his duty.</p><p>She went into the bathroom to collect her toiletries. Glancing in the mirror, she was startled at how tired and pale she looked. She put on a little makeup to cover the dark circles under her eyes, added some blush and tinted pink lip gloss. Then she brushed her hair, gathered up her toothbrush and toothpaste, and put them in her makeup bag. She tossed John Paul\u2019s toothbrush on top.</p><p>She was ready to go when John Paul walked into the bedroom. He shut the door, leaned against it, and looked at her.</p><p>After she\u2019d finished zipping her bag, she stood, then nervously brushed her hands against her slacks, as though she were trying to iron any wrinkles out.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d He was looking at the bed when he made the comment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d His voice was low and urgent.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. She ran to him, threw her arms around his neck, and kissed him.</p><p>When at last they drew apart, there were tears in her eyes. She had never felt this kind of desperation before, and it was so wrenching, so heartbreaking she was afraid she would break down and sob.</p><p>How had she allowed herself to become so vulnerable? Love wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this quickly, was it? Why hadn\u2019t she protected herself? Love sucks, she decided then. All those stupid songs about how wonderful it was. All she felt was pain and fear, fear that something would happen to him. Damn it, she would not love him.</p><p>\u201cYou should go home,\u201d she said. She stepped back, nodded, and then repeated her decision, but this time she was more forceful. \u201cI mean it. I want you to go home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He had asked an obvious question, but she gave him an obscure answer. \u201cYou just should. I can drive myself to Florida. I don\u2019t need you or Noah to baby-sit me.\u201d</p><p>The more she explained, the more forceful her voice became. John Paul reacted to her outburst by simply grabbing his bag, dropping it on the bed, and then beginning to shove his clothes inside.</p><p>Noah was standing at the kitchen counter, drinking from a milk carton. He\u2019d made himself a huge sandwich and was polishing it off as she carried her backpack to the door. John Paul was right behind her with her duffel bag and his.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he called to Noah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>She followed John Paul to the car. He opened the driver\u2019s door, popped the lid on the trunk; then, pausing to glare at her, he tossed their bags inside and slammed the trunk down.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul, I meant . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me again. I told you at least three times I was in this for the long haul. Weren\u2019t you listening?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the door to make sure Noah wasn\u2019t there, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt. Okay? I couldn\u2019t stand it if anything happened to you . . . I don\u2019t think I could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon . . . you can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you love me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His left hand cupped the back of her neck, and as he slowly drew her toward him, he whispered, \u201cWant me to count the ways?\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to be reasonable. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a liberal,\u201d she whispered in desperation.</p><p>He kissed her and then said, \u201cI can live with that, but I can\u2019t live without you. Simple as that, sugar.\u201d</p> <p>His wonderful mouth covered hers in a long, hot, thoroughly arousing kiss. He didn\u2019t overpower her with his strength, didn\u2019t have her chained to him. No, he was being extremely gentle as his mouth slanted over hers. She could have pulled back, but she didn\u2019t want to. She greedily kissed him back.</p><p>He growled low in his throat, which only encouraged her to be bolder. And when at last he lifted his head, she sagged against him.</p><p>She pushed away from him when the screen door opened.</p><p>Noah walked out onto the porch, pulled the door closed, and then tossed the keys to John Paul. \u201cYou drive while I catch up on some sleep.\u201d</p><p>He caught the keys without taking his gaze off Avery. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ask?\u201d he patiently repeated.</p><p>Noah glanced at both of them, shook his head, and then dove into the backseat. \u201cLover\u2019s spat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They both snapped the word at the same time.</p><p>She grabbed the keys out of John Paul\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue with her. The dynamics between the two fascinated Noah. Who would have thought the bear would ever fall? He guessed the old saying was true. There really was someone out there for everyone. A soul mate. Wait until he told Theo about this. He wouldn\u2019t believe it either. The bear was in love.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t suppress his laughter. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s so funny?\u201d John Paul grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re funny. Hey, Avery. Ever hear the one about the Marine . . .\u201d</p><p>John Paul tilted his seat back and closed his eyes. It was going to be a long, long trip.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>THE PLANS KEPT CHANGING. CARRIE DIDN\u2019T LIKE CHANGE, ANY kind of change, unless, of course, she was the one in charge of making those changes. Agent Hillman was point man, and Agent Bean was his gofer. Hillman\u2019s first command when he was placed in charge of Carrie was to order Bean to tell her the decision had been made to keep her in Colorado.</p><p>After Bean informed Mrs. Salvetti of the Bureau\u2019s decision and suffered her reaction, he returned to Agent Hillman and threatened to hand in his resignation if Hillman ever made him do that again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting in for combat pay,\u201d Bean announced.</p><p>They could both hear Carrie screaming from the waiting room. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she realize there are sick people in this hospital?\u201d Hillman muttered, clearly appalled by the woman\u2019s conduct.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Bean countered. \u201cShe\u2019s demanding to go to Florida and stay in the safe house with her niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it, then, you didn\u2019t tell her we can\u2019t find her niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I thought I\u2019d let you explain that to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, man. You\u2019re an agent with the FBI. Surely you can handle a cranky woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, sir, she isn\u2019t just a cranky woman. She\u2019s a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Hillman snapped.</p><p>A she-devil, Bean wanted to say but didn\u2019t dare. Hillman wouldn\u2019t believe him. Besides, he would find out soon enough what the Salvetti woman was capable of when she wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cSir, she isn\u2019t what I would call a normal woman. Normal women don\u2019t have fire shooting out of their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Hillman was disgusted. \u201cShe\u2019ll do whatever we tell her to do.\u201d</p><p>Wanna bet? The ringing in his ears, he noticed, had subsided into a dull echo. \u201cYes, sir, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d He said the last without breaking into a smile and was quite proud of his achievement.</p><p>\u201cWe have the woman\u2019s best interests at heart. Surely you explained our motives to her, didn\u2019t you, Bean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t give me the opportunity to explain our position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she calms down\u2014\u201d</p><p>They both heard another shout. Bean grimaced as Hillman demanded, \u201cWho\u2019s in there with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorman,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe must have told her we haven\u2019t been able to locate her niece.\u201d</p><p>The door to the waiting room opened and Gorman stepped out. Hillman and Bean stood at the end of the hallway and watched as Gorman hastily pulled the door closed. His face was as red as hot peppers.</p><p>Gorman spotted Hillman, drew himself up to his full six foot two height, and walked down the hall to join them.</p><p>\u201cIs she giving you trouble too?\u201d Hillman asked.</p><p>Bean tried not to snicker. Of course she\u2019d given him trouble. Just look at his face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a . . . difficult woman,\u201d Gorman said, trying to be diplomatic. \u201cShe refuses to cooperate. Told me she\u2019s going to Florida with or without Hill of Beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHill of Beans?\u201d Hillman asked.</p><p>Gorman cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s calling you and Agent Bean. Hill of Beans. She\u2019s also demanding a beach house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beach house? She wants a beach house?\u201d Hillman asked incredulously.</p><p>Bean cast him a smug I-told-you-so look. Now, perhaps, his superior would agree that the Salvetti woman was as difficult as he\u2019d told him she was.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you say to her demands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her that wasn\u2019t possible, that since her testimony isn\u2019t mandatory, she\u2019ll be staying in Colorado. I explained the defense attorney has the transcripts of Skarrett\u2019s first trial and he hasn\u2019t asked to depose Mrs. Salvetti again and that, for that reason, there wasn\u2019t any need for her to go to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her response?\u201d Bean asked.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to grab my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she was bluffing,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cLet\u2019s give her a few minutes to cool off,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>It was going to take Carrie more than a few minutes to calm her temper. Blowing up was her response to the fear gnawing at her stomach. What the hell was Avery going to do? Did she think she could stroll into that courthouse and testify against Skarrett? Carrie kept picturing her niece being gunned down on the courthouse steps.</p><p>If Monk . . . or Jilly . . . got hold of her . . . Carrie rushed to the phone, got an outside line, and called Tony collect. She prayed he hadn\u2019t already left for the airport.</p><p>He must have been sitting by the phone, because he picked up on the first ring.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t waste time on preliminaries. \u201cThey\u2019re going to put me in a house and keep me here, in Colorado,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhere in Colorado?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me, but I heard one of them talking on his cell phone. He didn\u2019t know I was listening, and he mentioned a place called Wedgewood. It must be some kind of suburb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAspen\u2019s too small to have suburbs,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the hell it is. Look it up on the Internet, for God\u2019s sake. Use your head. There can\u2019t be more than one Wedgewood suburb in Colorado.\u201d She burst into tears. \u201cIf I have to be in a safe house for a long time, what will happen to my company? I can\u2019t be away too long. I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I can handle things here. I\u2019ve run a company before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need you with me, Tony. You have to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will,\u201d he promised. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go through this alone. Do you want me to come to the hospital? Can they wait to move you until I get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them wait,\u201d she said. \u201cSara has already been moved into the new physical therapy wing. It hasn\u2019t even been opened yet, so security\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll stay there with her until they move both of us. I won\u2019t let them take me anywhere until you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay,\u201d he said, sounding relieved.</p><p>\u201cDo you know they can\u2019t find Avery? When she called me, she told me she wouldn\u2019t be joining me in protective custody. Have you talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. I\u2019ve been pacing by the phone, waiting. It\u2019s not like Avery to make me worry. I don\u2019t understand why she hasn\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows you\u2019ll give her hell for upsetting me,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to disappoint either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but I\u2019m worried sick about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. She\u2019ll call, and when she does, you tell her not to go to Sheldon Beach. Make her realize how dangerous it will be for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Avery calls after you\u2019ve left for the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, she knows my cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>Of course Avery did. Carrie was so rattled she couldn\u2019t think. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>Carrie hung up the phone and decided to call Avery\u2019s office to find out if her friends had heard from her, but she was prevented from making any more calls when Agent Hillman walked into the room and told her that Judge Collins wanted to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be moving you into the new wing in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Hillman was surprised and pleased by her cooperation. He was feeling a bit smug too, for he\u2019d been right. He\u2019d told Bean and Gorman that once Mrs. Salvetti calmed down, she would cooperate, and she was doing exactly that now.</p><p>Maybe this wasn\u2019t going to be such a bad assignment after all.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>JILLY HAD JUST HAD A FULL BODY MASSAGE AND WAS NOW wrapped in a four-hundred-count Egyptian cotton sheet with the logo of Utopia stamped on the hem. She lay on her back, her eyes closed, while the female technician applied an avocado facial mask. The stupid woman wouldn\u2019t stop talking. She gave Jilly one compliment after another about her flawless complexion and her oh, so perfect body.</p><p>Jilly never tired of hearing compliments from men, but she didn\u2019t care what women thought about her, and just when she was about to tell the technician to shut up, she finished applying the goo and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just let this set for fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>She was finally alone. Loosening the sheet, she let the cool air caress her body. It felt good to relax, especially after she\u2019d become so distraught over the news that Carrie and the judge had survived the explosion. Fortunately, Monk hadn\u2019t been in the bungalow when that horrid news came on the television, so she didn\u2019t have to try to behave. He had never seen her throw a full-blown tantrum, and she didn\u2019t know how he would react. She certainly didn\u2019t want to scare him, not yet anyway, because he was so terribly useful. There was still too much to be done, and it was imperative that Monk stay the loyal lapdog.</p><p>Carrie used to call her fits rages, but Jilly had learned control over the years. Not much, but some, she qualified. Admittedly, if one of the housekeeping staff had happened to walk into the bungalow just after Jilly had heard the news about Carrie, Jilly probably would have attacked her. And enjoyed every moment of it.</p><p>Jilly had never killed a person. She\u2019d let her men take care of her problems. Wasn\u2019t that what they were for? She had often wondered, though, what it would feel like to kill someone with a gun or maybe even with her bare hands. If someone caused her to be unhappy, then watching her die did seem fitting. Why should she deny herself that joy and satisfaction? She realized now that Monk had been right all along. He had wanted to kill each woman separately and make the deaths look like accidents, but Jilly had pleaded and cajoled until he\u2019d given in and done things her way. How could such a brilliant plan not work? It was so perfect, so simple, so . . . brilliant.</p><p>Carrie. Carrie was the reason the plan hadn\u2019t worked. That selfish bitch had ruined everything.</p><p>Jilly threw herself on the bed and pounded her fists into the pillows. She stopped suddenly. She heard the newscaster on CNN with the lead-in for the footage that was coming on the screen again. She bolted upright, impatiently wiping the tears from her eyes, and stared at the screen. The film was focusing on the judge, but Jilly wasn\u2019t interested in her, no matter how famous she was supposed to be. She waited, whimpering, until finally the camera turned to her bitch of a sister as she was being carried on a stretcher into the ambulance. Men, paramedics, no doubt, but still men, were actually fawning over her. How dare they give her any attention? How dare they? Jilly was more enraged by the men\u2019s behavior than by the fact that her sister was still very much alive.</p><p>The camera zoomed in on Carrie\u2019s face. Jilly thought she saw her smiling, and that proved to be the last straw. Screaming obscenities, she picked up a lamp and hurled it into the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carrie was ruining everything.</p><p>It took an hour for her to calm down. Then she called the spa and had a masseur come to the bungalow. The massage helped, and she was now able to think about a new plan. This one wouldn\u2019t be as complicated, she decided.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she given in to the urge and killed Carrie with her scissors? Because that wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun. After everything her sister had done to her, she deserved to suffer a long while before she died. It wasn\u2019t fair. Men worrying about her, taking care of her. Couldn\u2019t they see how ugly she was?</p><p>Jilly could feel herself getting worked up again. The mask on her face was beginning to itch. Her cell phone rang just as the technician came back into the suite.</p> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll wash this off. Shut the door behind you.\u201d</p><p>Jilly knocked over a stack of towels as she reached for the phone. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would want to hear some good news. I found out where Carrie and the judge are.\u201d</p><p>She immediately perked up. \u201cYou know? Where, darling? Was I right?\u201d she asked before he could answer. \u201cAre they going to Sheldon Beach? Is that where they\u2019re going to hide Carrie until the trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister isn\u2019t going to Florida because she isn\u2019t going to testify at the trial.\u201d</p> <p>Jilly laughed with delight. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The mask on her face cracked when she smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news. Now tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>She listened carefully, and when he was finished, she told him not to worry, that she would come up with a new, even better plan. \u201cBut something less complicated this time,\u201d she promised. Then in a voice that sounded like a dove cooing, she said, \u201cI miss you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected the call, dropped her towel, and went into the bathroom to shower. Wrapping herself in a terry-cloth robe, she called housekeeping to come and clean up the mess she\u2019d made. The cost of the damage would be put on her credit card.</p><p>Two hours later, when Monk walked into the room, she was ready for him. She wore a black chiffon dress and high heels, but had decided against undergarments. When she stood in the doorway with the light spilling out from the bedroom, she knew he could see through the filmy material. She\u2019d checked to make sure.</p><p>Monk was weary by the time he got there, but as soon as he saw the love of his life, he was rejuvenated. He knew the trouble she\u2019d gone to just to please him. She had instinctively known he would need to make love to her and had prepared the bedroom. There were candles burning to set the mood, and she was wearing his favorite dress. It was identical to the red one she used to have, until he\u2019d torn it. As he strode toward her, he told himself not to ruin this one.</p><p>He watched her mouth. She was slowly rubbing her upper lip with the tip of her tongue. She knew he liked that too.</p><p>Their lovemaking was wild and crude. Like animals in heat, they tore at each other. Her dress fell to the floor in tatters. And when he was finally satisfied, he rolled off her, threw his arm back, and closed his eyes.</p><p>She had pleased him, and now it was his turn to please her. \u201cI think we should wait a couple of days,\u201d Jilly said, \u201cand then, after you\u2019re rested, you can take care of Carrie and the judge. They\u2019ll be all settled in and feeling safe by then. Don\u2019t you agree? It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for you to get in and do what needs to be done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need at least two weeks to organize and plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I just make you happy, Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you did, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make me happy. I could wait maybe a week, but I\u2019d go crazy if I had to wait any longer. Carrie was smiling when they lifted her into the ambulance. I didn\u2019t like seeing her smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told the police about me. Now they know I\u2019m alive, and they\u2019ll be looking for me. You were right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have insisted on the letters, and I shouldn\u2019t have let her see me. But I thought she would die in the explosion, and I wanted her to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Jilly,\u201d he said as he took her in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, cuddling up against him. \u201cAs soon as she\u2019s dead, everything will be all right. She\u2019s made me so unhappy for such a long time. Promise me you\u2019ll kill her soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his neck. Her hands moved skillfully over his body. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go to Sheldon Beach.\u201d</p><p>Monk\u2019s desperation to please her was making him frantic, but at the same time he felt he could do anything and succeed because of her faith in him. She often told him how brilliant she thought he was and how he underestimated and undervalued himself. He realized now that she was right. He could pull it off. He could get in and out without being noticed, no matter how many FBI agents were there.</p><p>He could even become invisible.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>THE DRIVE TO FLORIDA TOOK THREE DAYS. THEY COULD HAVE pushed it, but because they had the time, they took the more scenic back roads through Georgia.</p><p>They spent two nights in clean but no-frills motels tucked away in small towns. The first night they each had their own room. Avery hadn\u2019t invited John Paul to share her bed, and he hadn\u2019t asked or assumed. She was desperately trying to distance herself from him because she believed it would make their final parting less painful, but it wasn\u2019t working. She was only fooling herself. She loved him and didn\u2019t know what to do about it. She didn\u2019t sleep at all that first night, tossed and turned until she made herself dizzy, and by morning, her disposition was as charming as a rhino\u2019s. The second night, John Paul didn\u2019t ask. He simply paid for two rooms while Noah talked to one of his superiors on his cell phone.</p><p>John Paul followed Avery into her room and dropped his bag next to hers. She didn\u2019t argue but said, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to sleep. No sex.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he stripped out of his clothes and headed for the shower. \u201cDid I ask?\u201d he said before shutting the door in her face.</p><p>The air conditioner in the window was cranked up, the room was freezing, and around two in the morning she woke up in his arms, feeling toasty warm and amorous. He was simply irresistible. They made love, and it was even better than the last time because now each knew what the other liked, and within minutes they were perfectly attuned to each other\u2019s needs.</p><p>The wall separating their room from Noah\u2019s was paper thin. She tried to be quiet, but when she felt those first tremors of exquisite pleasure coursing through her body, the feeling was so intense she bit his shoulder to keep the shout of ecstasy from escaping.</p><p>It was so wonderful that when she awakened at six, she rolled into his arms and, as Margo would say, she jumped his bones again.</p><p>He went back to sleep. She went into the bathroom, and after she\u2019d showered, she stood in front of the mirror looking at her face. Her cheeks were red from rubbing against his whiskers, and her lips were swollen from his kisses.</p><p>Sighing, she shook her head and whispered, \u201cHi. My name\u2019s Avery, and I\u2019m a sexaholic.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t blame anyone but herself. Vowing to leave him the hell alone, she picked up her toothbrush and tried not to think about him as she got ready for the day.</p><p>John Paul was in a much better mood as they started out. He was almost pleasant to Noah. Not quite, but almost. Avery thought the two men acted like adversaries in some kind of contest, but it didn\u2019t take her long to realize they both got a kick out of trading insults.</p><p>After they had stopped for lunch, she got into the backseat, put on her baseball cap to block the sun from her eyes, and decided to take a nap.</p><p>The men lowered their voices so they wouldn\u2019t disturb her. Noah knew about Jilly. He\u2019d read Avery\u2019s file, and he\u2019d come prepared.</p><p>They speculated about how she had connected with Monk and what their relationship might be. Noah, of course, knew all about Skarrett too, and thought that maybe he was calling all the shots. John Paul disagreed, pointing out that, once Monk had taken the contract, he did things his way.</p><p>One topic led to another. \u201cAre you going to lose your job because you\u2019re helping us?\u201d John Paul asked. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s looking for Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t work for the FBI. I\u2019m what you might call an independent contractor.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was exasperated. \u201cNo, you work for the FBI. What the hell do you think that badge is for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter parking spots. It\u2019s the only reason I carry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still living in the swamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll want to live there?\u201d</p><p>He pretended not to understand. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He had forgotten how blunt Noah could be. \u201cThe woman you\u2019re sleeping with. The woman you can\u2019t take your eyes off even when you\u2019re driving. You\u2019ve been looking in the rearview mirror every ten seconds since you got behind the wheel. You\u2019re gonna get us killed if you don\u2019t pay attention to the road.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was determined not to discuss Avery. \u201cHow far is it to that little town you picked out on the map for us to stay tonight? What was it called? Walden Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow me, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever gonna settle down. Too many fish in the sea,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Walden Point is what? Twenty or thirty miles from Sheldon Beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever find a woman who would put up with you, but I guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>John Paul couldn\u2019t pretend he wasn\u2019t listening any longer. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. I know all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you read my file?\u201d He didn\u2019t give him time to respond but muttered, \u201cDoesn\u2019t \u2018classified\u2019 mean anything anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not,\u201d Noah drawled. He hadn\u2019t had access to John Paul\u2019s file, but he had talked to Theo about his reclusive brother-in-law. Since it obviously upset John Paul to think that his file had been opened, Noah didn\u2019t tell him the truth. He liked annoying him.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think she\u2019ll like living in Bowen?\u201d</p><p>They had just come full circle. John Paul gripped the steering wheel as he tried to control his temper.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need to stop for gas.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cMan, you\u2019ve got it bad. Your face is getting red.\u201d</p><p>John Paul thought about punching him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You two don\u2019t have any kind of arrangement?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to discuss his and Avery\u2019s relationship.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo future plans?\u201d</p><p>He glared at Noah. \u201cNo,\u201d he snapped. Turning back to the road, he said, \u201cAre you ready to talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop hitting on Avery.\u201d</p><p>He was sorry the second the words were out of his mouth. Noah laughed. \u201cWhy would I want to stop doing that? You just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the hell I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she is a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he could reach over real quick, open Noah\u2019s door, and shove him out. That ought to shut him up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sexy as hell too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you leave her the hell alone. Now, how far is it to Walden Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me.\u201d Noah tilted the seat back, adjusted his sunglasses on the bridge of his nose, and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the damn navigator. Look at the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>He was sound asleep seconds later.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was blissfully quiet. They arrived in Walden Point around six that evening. The sleepy little town was exactly thirty-two miles to the bridge leading into Sheldon Beach.</p><p>If Avery had been in Walden Point as a child, she didn\u2019t remember it. The streets were lined with palm trees, the grass was brown from salt water and sun, and the houses along the side streets were ill kept and weather-beaten. It was a dismal, forgotten-looking place until they reached the older, more populated section of town. The houses along those avenues had been spruced up. The grass was lush and green, and flowers brimmed over terra-cotta pots on freshly painted porches. It was apparent there was a renovation in progress.</p><p>There were several pretty bed-and-breakfast homes along the main street to the waterfront, but Noah wasn\u2019t interested in stopping there. He found a motel about twelve blocks away from the beach and told John Paul to pull into the lot.</p><p>Avery thought Noah was joking. Milt\u2019s Flamingo Motel had flaming pink concrete block walls and a red-tile roof in desperate need of repair. There were hand-painted flamingos in different colors on each lime green door. The U-shaped structure with twelve units had a gravel parking lot. Whoever had chosen the color scheme had to have been color-blind.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any other cars around. Avery thought Milt must have flown the coop, abandoning the dump.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a guy watching as we pulled in,\u201d Noah answered. \u201cIt\u2019s easy in and out. We park behind, and the car\u2019s out of sight from the street. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Since he was asking John Paul and not her, Avery kept her opinion of their lodgings to herself. After having passed the lovely bed-and-breakfast a couple of blocks away with the charming white picket fence and rockers on the wraparound porch, she thought Noah\u2019s choice was awful. She waited for John Paul to protest.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he said, dashing her hopes. \u201cIt kind of reminds me of my dad\u2019s bar. He\u2019s got a big flamingo on his roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember seeing it. I thought it was a pelican. I\u2019ll check us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bed-and-breakfast just down the road,\u201d she interjected. \u201cIt looked nice and clean. I noticed a vacancy sign in the yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is okay, isn\u2019t it?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>If Noah hadn\u2019t been with them, she would have told him no, it wasn\u2019t okay, but she didn\u2019t want to complain in front of an agent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because she sounded so disheartened. \u201cNot as nice as Tyler\u2019s cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Noah had just gotten out of the car when his cell phone rang. John Paul walked ahead to the office, but Avery stayed with Noah. She stretched her arms and legs, stiff from the long ride.</p> <p>Noah, his head down, walked away, obviously so that the conversation would be private. She saw his expression, knew something was wrong, and anxiously waited.</p><p>The conversation lasted a long time. John Paul came back with two keys, took one look at Avery, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d she said, leaning into his side.</p><p>Noah ended the call and walked back to the car. His gaze was on Avery. \u201cYour aunt and the judge are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d John Paul asked.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a delivery; some tanks to be installed behind the physical therapy wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d John Paul whispered. He already knew what was coming. \u201cThey blew, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cThe fire took out most of the wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Monk get past security?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThe delivery man was killed as he was unloading them. Monk got to those tanks before they were set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many down?\u201d John Paul asked.</p> <p>\u201cTwo dead. An agent named Gorman was injured, but he\u2019s gonna make it. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d John Paul demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how it happened. Monk was there on the hospital grounds all that time watching and waiting. He had to have known they couldn\u2019t move the judge so soon after her surgery. When the agents put those decoys in the car and drove off, he probably spotted something and knew the women weren\u2019t Carrie and the judge.\u201d</p><p>Noah led the way to their rooms. They were at the far end of the units and had a connecting door between them.</p><p>Their room was surprisingly clean. There was a double bed with a floral bedspread, two chairs by the window facing the gravel lot, with a small table and lamp in between. There wasn\u2019t a closet. On the far wall was a rack with hangers and built-in shelves next to it.</p><p>The second Noah stepped into their room, Avery asked, \u201cCarrie and the judge weren\u2019t injured? You\u2019re telling me everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYour aunt had just wheeled the judge into the bathroom when it happened. The walls caved in on them and protected them from being incinerated.\u201d</p><p>Avery felt sick to her stomach. Noah\u2019s phone rang again, and he walked into his room. She waited until his back was turned and then went to John Paul, put her arms around his waist, and held him tight.</p> <p>He could feel her trembling. \u201cThis nightmare will be over soon,\u201d he promised. Then, when she didn\u2019t answer, he asked, \u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t think . . . I need to be able . . .\u201d</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cYou need a porch swing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWith lilacs,\u201d he added.</p><p>She smiled because he remembered her happy place.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you lilacs, and I can\u2019t drum up a porch swing for you, sugar, but water . . . I can give you lots of that.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later she and John Paul walked hand in hand along the beach. Both of them had changed into shorts and had left their shoes on the steps where Noah sat.</p><p>Dark clouds were moving in, obscuring the sun. The beach was virtually deserted, and when Avery sat down and assumed the lotus position, John Paul didn\u2019t intrude. He walked back to the steps and sat down next to Noah.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she doing?\u201d Noah asked when Avery hadn\u2019t moved for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cThinking,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>When the sun was dropping, taking the light of the day, John Paul got up and went to Avery. Her eyes were closed. He squatted down in front of her and waited, knew she sensed he was there.</p><p>A moment passed before she acknowledged him. She opened her eyes and looked into his. A single tear slid down her cheek. She took a deep cleansing breath.</p><p>\u201cI need to make a call.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>MONK WAS READY TO MAKE HIS MOVE.</p><p>There was a \u201cno vacancy\u201d sign in the window of the manager\u2019s office, and nailed to the door was another sign. \u201cClosed until further notice.\u201d</p><p>Monk knew the targets were inside. He had already canvassed the area, knew it like the back of his hand. Three cars were parked behind the motel. He was certain two of them belonged to federal agents assigned to protect Avery. The third vehicle was Renard\u2019s.</p><p>Monk drove Jilly past the motel so she could see where it was going to happen, and she could barely contain her excitement when she saw the light shimmering along the edge of the tightly drawn drapes in the unit Monk had pointed out to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in there,\u201d she whispered, her excitement brimming in her voice.</p><p>Monk pulled into the parking lot up the street from Milt\u2019s Motel. The lot did double duty for patrons of the old Spanish-style movie theater, complete with bell tower, and the spillover from the Church of the Risen. He parked the car so that it faced the street, then handed Jilly his binoculars and took a drink of his iced tea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re now officially on a stakeout.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cThis is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Her excitement thrilled him. \u201cYou\u2019re having a good time, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she gushed. \u201cIt\u2019s better than I could ever have imagined. Much better.\u201d</p><p>A car pulled into the parking lot, and she quickly lowered the binoculars. \u201cAre you sure we\u2019re safe here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. I\u2019ll always make it safe for you.\u201d</p><p>They shared a smile, and then Jilly lifted the binoculars again. She could just see the light framing the window, and she was trying to imagine what was happening inside the room.</p><p>Another car pulled in and parked three rows behind them. There was a revival going on inside the church, and it was also dollar night at the movie theater. The lot was nearly full now.</p><p>Jilly offered him the binoculars, but he didn\u2019t need to look. He had already spent one full night and day doing reconnaissance. It wasn\u2019t enough, but it would have to do. Normally, he would have spent at least two weeks following his subject, learning his routine, but this wasn\u2019t a normal situation. Time was running out, and Jilly was too impatient to wait much longer. Like a child, she wanted instant gratification.</p><p>\u201cHow many policemen are inside with them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAgents,\u201d he corrected. \u201cNot policemen. There are four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll get them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They were sitting ducks. His for the taking.</p><p>The night before, Monk had watched Renard sneak out the back door, get into his car, and drive away. Monk hadn\u2019t had a clear shot at him, but he wouldn\u2019t have taken it even if he had because he didn\u2019t want his primary targets moved once again. He had something special planned for them. Pity, they wouldn\u2019t know what hit them.</p><p>Renard had returned to the motel thirty minutes later carrying four big pizzas and a plastic bag Monk guessed was filled with beer or soft drinks.</p><p>He was disgusted with Renard\u2019s carelessness. He was certain the man didn\u2019t have any idea he was being observed. Smug complacency. That\u2019s what it was. He was disappointed in Renard. He\u2019d expected better from his adversary and had made the mistake of believing that Renard was a professional. An equal. He realized now how foolish that hope had been. No one could ever equal or measure up to his standards. Jilly had been right all along. He was a legend.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be a good idea to do it tonight,\u201d Jilly said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait too much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Carrie is feeling safe again. Can you imagine how claustrophobic she and Avery must be feeling now? Being cooped up in that flea-infested room night and day? They must be going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve deliberately waited,\u201d he explained, \u201cso that the agents would be bored and . . . lethargic. Yes, that\u2019s the word. Lethargic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHour upon hour of sitting in that tiny room, waiting and worrying. They haven\u2019t let them out at all, have they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot while I was watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t die in that hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will be better because I\u2019ll get to watch.\u201d</p><p>Monk nodded. \u201cCarrie demanded to come to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to die with Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s going to die tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s going to sit in that courtroom with Avery when the trial starts.\u201d</p><p>Jilly picked up the binoculars once again. Smiling, she said, \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm.\u201d</p><p>Monk suppressed a yawn. He was exhausted, but he didn\u2019t dare complain. Jilly thought he was invincible, superhuman, and he was determined to maintain his knight-in-shining-armor image.</p><p>He knew he was taking risks he never would have considered before, but it was difficult to be cautious with Jilly constantly pushing him to his limits. She believed he could do anything, made him believe in himself.</p><p>Every once in a while a nagging doubt would surface in his mind. He had never walked away from a contract before. His word meant everything. If he wasn\u2019t reliable, his future would be in jeopardy, his reputation in tatters. The thought didn\u2019t repulse him, though. He had more than enough money to keep Jilly in the style she deserved. Maybe he could let this one go and walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou know, darling, we don\u2019t need the money,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p><p>Jilly knew where he was leading. \u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re finished here, let\u2019s sneak away to Mexico and get married. The trial will go for at least a week. Dale isn\u2019t going anywhere. Shall we?\u201d</p><p>She knew how much he wanted a wedding. His fatigue vanished, and he was suddenly smiling in anticipation. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said. He was embarrassed because he\u2019d sounded so eager, but he added, \u201cI know a perfect place . . . you\u2019ll love it, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m marrying you, nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his thigh, leaned across the console, and kissed him. Her hand moved upward to fondle him intimately.</p><p>He became aroused quickly. Satisfied with his reaction, she pulled away. \u201cWhy not put them out of their misery tonight?\u201d she asked again, pouting now.</p><p>It took several seconds for Monk to understand what she was asking. He cleared his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see it all tomorrow. Daylight\u2019s better. Besides, I have a few alterations to make, a few details before I\u2019ll be ready. You want it to be perfect, don\u2019t you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. But why is daylight better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one expects to be hit with the sun shining, and in the past I\u2019ve always tried to go in and get out during the night. Those agents believe they know my pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ve studied you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When it\u2019s dark, their guard will be up.\u201d</p><p>She sighed then. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow. Remember, you promised I could watch. You won\u2019t change your mind, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe, but in a wonderful spot where you can see everything. And I have a surprise for you. I was going to wait until tomorrow, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I know how disappointed you were when you saw the house in Colorado blow. But this time will be different. I\u2019m going to let you push the button.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with delight. \u201cAre you going to dazzle me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m a legend, remember? I\u2019m going to dazzle everyone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>AFTER MONK DROVE JILLY BACK TO THEIR HOTEL ON THE opposite side of Walden Point, he got back into the car and drove to a residential area a mile away from Milt\u2019s Motel.</p><p>He jogged a mile back to his hiding place and quietly climbed the stairs. He still had to put the finishing touches on the wiring. The job took much longer than he had anticipated, no doubt because he was weary, but when he was finally finished, he was content with his handiwork. Nothing was going to go wrong this time.</p><p>It was after three in the morning by the time he got ready for bed. Careful not to disturb Jilly, he eased down on the bed and sat next to her, watching her sleep. Oh, how he loved her. She was so beautiful, so exquisite . . . so perfect. He lay beside her thinking once again that he was the luckiest man in the world. He fell asleep with his arms around her, the scent of her perfume surrounding him, and dreamed of their honeymoon.</p><p>Fairy tales could come true. He and Jilly would live happily ever after.</p><p>Jilly dressed with care the following morning. She was going to church, after all, and so she wore a white skirt, white eyelet blouse, and strappy high-heel sandals. While she brushed her hair and curled it, Monk put their luggage in the car.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget my tape,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI would never forget that,\u201d he assured her, though, in fact, he had forgotten. She would have been beside herself if she\u2019d lost it. She was so obsessed with what she called the evidence, that she insisted on always carrying it with her. A peculiarity he put up with just as she put up with his odd little traits. That\u2019s what a solid relationship was all about, wasn\u2019t it? Give and take.</p><p>He removed the tape from the VCR, slipped it into the carrying case, and put it on the bed next to her straw purse.</p><p>She was primping in front of the mirror. He watched her put on her red lipstick and smiled because he knew she only wore that color to please him. She\u2019d told him so.</p><p>Jilly put the lipstick in her purse with the tape, picked up her straw hat with the white ribbon, and then walked into the center of the room. Whirling around in a circle, she asked, \u201cDo I look ready for church?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed with excitement. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou always look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She went to him, adjusted the knot in his tie just like an adoring wife would, and said, \u201cYou look wonderful in a suit. You should wear them more often.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf it pleases you, I will.\u201d</p><p>She took hold of his hand and walked by his side to the car. He liked little things like that, he thought. Taking his hand. It was a sign of trust, wasn\u2019t it? The way she looked up at him with such admiration. He liked that too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already parked the other car down the street from the church,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as a precaution. The key\u2019s behind the visor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve covered every possibility.\u201d</p> <p>He was certain that he had, and so he agreed, yet there was still that nagging little worry about the wires. He\u2019d been so tired, he hadn\u2019t done more than one test, but that was enough.</p><p>The wind had picked up as they drove. Monk glanced up at the tower above the theater as he turned the corner. He pulled into the lot, parked on the end in front so Jilly could see everything. No one could block the front of his car, and if he had to drive over the curb to get to the street, he could do so without getting trapped.</p><p>He turned the motor off. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe remote\u2019s in the glove compartment.\u201d</p> <p>She carefully lifted it out. \u201cIt looks like a garage door opener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cModified, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I push the button?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be nice to wait until the church bells start.\u201d</p><p>Jilly turned in her seat to watch the men and women and children hurry toward the church. They didn\u2019t want to be late, she thought.</p><p>The show\u2019s outside. Too bad they wouldn\u2019t see it. \u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive more minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait. I want to do it now.\u201d</p><p>Monk reached under the seat and handed her the binoculars. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Jilly wet her lips as she lifted the binoculars. She adjusted the lens until she was looking at the room that had had the light on the night before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my dream back,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She pushed the button. Nothing happened, and so she pushed it again. Then again, harder, holding it down.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Monk muttered. \u201cThe wind must have knocked loose one of the wires. Stop pushing that button, darling. I\u2019ll have to go up there and fix it. You sit tight. All right?\u201d</p><p>He gently removed the remote from her hand. \u201cIf anything goes wrong . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou worry too much. Fix the wire,\u201d she said, a bit more sharply than she\u2019d intended. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t be so anxious. I can wait another few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in case, you remember what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go into the church, then out the side door, and get in the other car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drive away on the side street I showed you. Don\u2019t drive in front of the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave without you.\u201d</p><p>Her loyalty was heartwarming. He patted her hand, put the remote on the floor by his seat, and then got out of the car. Slipping one hand into his pocket, he casually strolled across the parking lot and up the stairs to the church.</p><p>The bells rang as he walked inside. Thirty seconds later, he came out the side door, crossed the street, and walked three blocks to the north before he was convinced he wasn\u2019t being followed. He crossed the street and headed toward the movie theater.</p><p>The back door was locked, of course. He used his tools to undo the dead bolt, went inside, and quickly locked the door behind him.</p><p>He was in the back hallway. The door leading upstairs to the tower and the marquee was across the lobby. He stayed low and quiet.</p><p>He stood in the shadow behind the snack bar for several minutes, listening for any sounds, and when he was convinced he was all alone, he crept to the door. That, too, was locked, just as he had left it. He quickly unlocked it, opened the door, and looked up. The brown string he\u2019d left on the third step hadn\u2019t been disturbed. No one had found his little hiding place. He stepped over the string and slowly, cautiously went up, aware that there was a squeak on the fifth step. He knew he was alone\u2014the theater wouldn\u2019t open until the matinee at two\u2014but he still avoided the step.</p><p>There was a trip wire at the top, much thinner than dental floss and all but invisible to the na*ed eye. Monk released the lever so that when he opened the door, he wouldn\u2019t be blown to kingdom come.</p><p>Good thing the owner didn\u2019t want to change the marquee today, he thought with a smile. He only changed the movies on Wednesdays, but Monk had set a trap anyway. Can\u2019t be too cautious, no matter what his darling Jilly believed.</p><p>He opened the door a crack and looked in. The rifle with the scope attached was still there in the corner, propped against the pillar.</p><p>His gaze went to the trigger mechanism below his homemade missile. Just as he had suspected, one of the wires had slipped down. It wasn\u2019t dangling free. The wind had loosened it just enough to break the connection.</p><p>He\u2019d have it fixed in two seconds. He pushed the door open, stepped forward, and bent down on one knee. Then he froze. The voice came from his left on the other side of the bell. \u201cNice Roman candle you\u2019ve got there.\u201d</p><p>Monk was too stunned to move. His mind was screaming, No, no, no. The wire . . . the string . . . nothing had been disturbed. How did . . .</p><p>Another voice came from his right. \u201cI think he\u2019s having trouble getting it to work.\u201d</p><p>Monk lunged for his rifle. Neither man tried to stop him. He rolled, firing as he moved.</p><p>Nothing happened. The rifle was empty. Noah stepped into the sunlight. Monk saw him and coiled back. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>John Paul moved forward from the shadows.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Monk\u2019s face twisted with fury, and his voice shook.</p><p>\u201cEasy. I\u2019m smarter than you.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s gun was pointed at Monk\u2019s forehead. John Paul saw the look in Noah\u2019s eyes and knew exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cCuff him,\u201d he said. \u201cThen read him his rights.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him first. Then I\u2019ll cuff him and read him his rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d Noah released the trigger and put the gun back into his holster. He had the cuffs out and was moving toward Monk when they heard an agent shouting.</p><p>Monk lashed out with his foot, knocking Noah off balance. He stumbled in front of the killer, making it impossible for John Paul to get a clear shot.</p><p>Agents were racing up the stairs as Monk tried to get his gun from his ankle holster, but John Paul anticipated that response. He slammed his foot down on Monk\u2019s leg, pinning him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cQuit messing around,\u201d he shouted. \u201cGet the hell off him so I can shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna shoot him,\u201d Noah shouted back. He hit Monk in the face, grunting from the sheer pleasure of hearing cartilage snap. He punched him again, trying to strike the exact spot so that it would hurt him more.</p><p>The door slammed into the pillar when the first agent came flying across the threshold. Monk seized the opportunity. With every ounce of strength he possessed, he shoved Noah off him and dove headfirst off the tower.</p><p>The killer landed on the slanted tin roof. He rolled to his hands and knees and crawled like a gorilla down to the marquee. When his right foot hit a bracket, he braced himself and went for his gun. He was swinging it up when John Paul and Noah, dropping down to the roof, fired simultaneously. Their bullets riddled Monk\u2019s body, sending him dancing backward like a marionette they were manipulating. He swung around and fell forward, his body draped across the marquee.</p><p>Panting, Noah put his gun away and then said, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d John Paul muttered.</p><p>An agent leaning from the bell tower window called down to them. \u201cSubject is on the move.\u201d</p><p>Noah pulled his walkie-talkie from his belt. He repeated what the agent had just told him.</p><p>\u201cRoger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that Avery\u2019s voice? That was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>Noah spoke into the handset. \u201cAvery? Is that you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>He used the endearment just to piss off John Paul, and he grinned when he saw his reaction. If looks could kill, he\u2019d be hanging over the marquee with Monk now.</p><p>John Paul snatched the handset. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Avery? You were supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re both fine. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger. Over and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. She\u2019s in one of the tail cars.\u201d</p><p>They were both sprawled out on the roof. Noah laughed. \u201cYou could tell that from \u2018Roger, over and out\u2019?\u201d</p><p>John Paul ignored him and hit the button again. \u201cKelly?\u201d</p><p>The agent in charge of the operation was quick to respond.</p><p>\u201cKelly here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Avery in one of the tail cars?\u201d John Paul demanded. \u201cSon of a bitch, I know she is. I told her to stay on that damn boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger. Over and out.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cGuess Avery\u2019s got a mind of her own.\u201d He leaned over the side of the building to judge the distance to the ground. \u201cHow the hell are we gonna get\u2014\u201d</p><p>John Paul shoved him off the roof. He followed him down and landed in a clump of dead shrubs beside the agent.</p><p>Kelly was on the handset again. \u201cDo you have Monk in custody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d John Paul answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the marquee. \u201cHe\u2019s at the movies.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>JILLY HAD GROWN IMPATIENT WAITING FOR MONK TO RETURN to the car. What was taking him so long? She picked up the binoculars from the floor and watched the tower. Where was he? He knew how much she hated waiting. \u201cFix the damn thing,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>Monk suddenly came into view. Jilly gasped in disbelief as she watched him somersault onto the roof. She thought he was going to break his neck. He came flying down from the tower, but while he was still in the air, he twisted around and landed like a cat on his feet. He lost his balance, skated down the roof on his hands and knees. She thought he was going to flip down over the building, but he caught himself in time.</p><p>Two men leapt onto the roof above Monk. They were moving so fast their faces were a blur.</p><p>\u201cKill them,\u201d she whispered to Monk. \u201cKill them now. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Gunshots reverberated around her. She thought she heard Monk scream her name, and she watched with detached curiosity. He fell so ungracefully and draped over the marquee, blood pouring down over the lights. He died with his ass sticking up in the air. She cursed his incompetent soul.</p><p>How dare he do this to her? Her disappointment overwhelmed her, and her eyes stung with tears. The remote. She frantically grabbed it and pushed the button. Once, then again and again. Nothing happened.</p><p>Damn. How could Monk be so thoughtless? He knew how important her dreams were.</p><p>Stomping her feet on the floor, she cursed him because he had ruined everything. Worse, he had made her unhappy.</p><p>\u201cDamn you to hell,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He\u2019d left the keys in the ignition. Ignoring his order to take the other car if there was trouble, she hiked her skirt up over her thighs, climbed over the console, and got behind the wheel. Men, FBI men, she knew, were running to the theater, and there were people flooding out of the church to see what all the commotion was about. No one would notice her leaving. She pulled out onto the street, and so that she wouldn\u2019t draw any undue attention to herself, she stayed below the speed limit as she cruised through town.</p><p>The second she reached the on-ramp to the highway, she slammed her foot on the gas pedal. Muttering curses, she slapped the steering wheel, trying to vent some of her rage.</p><p>She had someone else ready to help, of course. No one was going to steal her dreams again. No one. She knew Monk had weapons packed in his suitcases, and by God, if she had to kill Carrie and Avery herself to get her dreams back, then that\u2019s what she would do.</p><p>\u201cStupid Monk,\u201d she hissed. \u201cStupid, stupid man.\u201d</p><p>The tail car stayed well behind Jilly. There were three agents riding with Avery in the sedan. Kelly was driving, and she sat behind him. She tried not to let her anxiety show, but it was extremely difficult.</p><p>Her heart felt like it had stopped when she heard the gunshots, and she didn\u2019t take a breath until she heard John Paul\u2019s voice over the radio. She went weak with relief and then immediately started worrying again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s spotted us?\u201d she asked Kelly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s being followed,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Jilly was now so far ahead of them on the highway, Avery could barely see the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s speeding, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe\u2019s going at least eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a speed trap\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She moved on to another worry. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you get closer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose her, Delaney. Now sit back and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see her.\u201d</p><p>Avery forced herself to stop telling the agent in charge what to do. It would all be over in just a few minutes. If she could just stay calm that long, she could spend a month falling apart if that was her inclination. Stay cool, she told herself.</p><p>Jilly had almost missed the entrance to the Windjammer motel. Avery watched her slow her car, make the turn, and drive across the parking lot. She lost sight of her then as Kelly sped on. He pulled into the exit, circled around the motel, and parked next to the restaurant adjacent to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s parked in front of the steps,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Avery was looking up at the units. All the doors faced the street. Then she looked at Jilly. She wished they were closer so she could get a good look at her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d she asked as she leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cBrushing her hair,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Avery squinted against the sunlight. She saw Jilly pull down the vanity mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs she putting lipstick on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure is,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>She sat back when the agent turned off the motor and rolled the window down. \u201cYou get out of this car, Delaney, and I swear\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t let him finish his threat. \u201cI won\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Avery looked at Jilly again. She must have been satisfied with her appearance because she finally opened the car door and got out.</p><p>\u201cShowtime,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Jilly ran up the first flight of stairs, raced along the outside corridor until she found the number she was looking for, and then stopped. Avery watched her spread the collar on her blouse so that cl**vage would show. She smoothed her tight skirt, and then rapped on the door.</p> <p>Avery\u2019s stomach lurched. She heard her voice calling out, \u201cDarling, it\u2019s me, Jilly.\u201d</p><p>Tony Salvetti opened the door.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>THE TRIAL IN SHELDON BEACH DIDN\u2019T DRAG ON LONG. THE attorney prosecuting the case was competent and effective, and with the evidence at hand, he was able to convince a second jury that Dale Skarrett had broken into Lola Delaney\u2019s home with the intent of kidnapping Avery Delaney. In the process of committing the felony, he had caused the premature death of Lola Delaney.</p><p>Skarrett insisted on testifying, which was a big mistake. He mumbled and squirmed, and by the time the prosecuting attorney got finished with him, the felon was screaming obscenities at him for twisting everything he said.</p> <p>Skarrett insisted that he hadn\u2019t used Avery as a shield and that he was really only trying to assist the child to her feet when her grandmother fired the gun. He couldn\u2019t explain why he\u2019d taken his belt off and beaten her nearly to death except to say that he was simply trying to coax her into going with him to see her mother.</p><p>The photos of Avery in the hospital proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Skarrett had left her in that hallway to die. Within an hour, the jury rendered its verdict, and Skarrett was led back to prison, where he belonged.</p><p>John Paul stayed in Sheldon Beach with Avery through the entire trial, and Carrie flew in the day before Avery was scheduled to testify. The aunt had been to hell and back, and he expected to meet a shattered woman. She wasn\u2019t, though. If she was devastated by her husband\u2019s betrayal, she didn\u2019t let it show.</p><p>In between her calls to her staff in Bel Air, John Paul told Carrie he was going to marry Avery. She didn\u2019t want to hear that. If her niece was going to marry, she should find a man with potential . . . and money. What kind of life would she have, married to a carpenter?</p><p>Oh, yes, Carrie was one tough cookie . . . and meaner than a crocodile when she didn\u2019t get her way.</p><p>He really liked her.</p> <p>Chapter 40</p><p>MR. CARTER WILL SEE YOU NOW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Avery straightened her skirt and smiled at the receptionist as she walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go in with you?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll wait here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and stepped into the freezer. She\u2019d come prepared this morning and was wearing a long-sleeved jacket.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave a seat, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy, but then, she\u2019d never seen Carter smile before, so she wasn\u2019t certain if he was still angry with her or not.</p><p>She sat in the chair facing his desk, folded her hands in her lap, and said, \u201cSir, if you\u2019re going to fire me, I\u2019d like the opportunity to preempt and resign first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He\u2019d stood when she entered the room but now took his seat behind the massive desk.</p><p>\u201cResigning would look better on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m asking you why you think I\u2019m going to fire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t follow procedure,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her hands were trembling. She wasn\u2019t certain if it was due to the frigid air in the office or the fact that she was so nervous. He had the ability to turn her into an insecure twit simply by looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI should have figured it all out much, much sooner, but in my defense, sir, I was busy jumping in and out of fivers and dodging bullets. I didn\u2019t have time to analyze the data, but I should have made the time,\u201d she hastily added so that he would know she was taking full responsibility for her mistakes. \u201cI also used your name to force Agent Kelly to let me ride in the tail car, and you were very specific with your order that I should never do that again. I broke the chain of command. I didn\u2019t let the agents assigned to protect me do their job. Sir, I ran from them. I did. Oh, and I also bothered you during your monthly poker game when I called you that night from Walden Point, and everyone at the Bureau knows how sacred your poker games are to you.\u201d</p><p>She thought she noticed the corner of his mouth turn up just a little. Was he about to smile or sneer?</p><p>He leaned forward and stacked his hands on the desk. \u201cJust so you know, I had a full house, Delaney, but you used the priority code, so I had to fold. Why did you call me instead of going through channels?\u201d</p><p>She might as well tell him the truth. She didn\u2019t have anything to lose. \u201cI knew you\u2019d listen to me and tell me if I was right or wrong. I also knew you\u2019d help me, and we had to move fast. Because you gave the okay, we could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cWhile the agents were getting things set up in Florida, I called Aunt Carrie and told her that John Paul and I were staying at Milt\u2019s Motel in Walden Point and that she would be brought there to stay with us until Skarrett\u2019s trial. I knew she would call her husband, Tony, and tell him to come there. And, by the time she did that, agents were monitoring Tony\u2019s phone calls and e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she hadn\u2019t called him?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cThen I would have,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she did tell him, and just as I suspected, Tony contacted Jilly and gave her the news that Carrie and I would be together in Florida. Then he booked a flight there for himself.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and continued. \u201cBy the time the agents pinpointed Jilly\u2019s location, she and Monk had vanished, but of course we knew where they were headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalden Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI really hated using my aunt that way, blatantly lying to her, but it was the only thing I could do. After everything was in motion, thanks to the agent you put in charge, Tom Kelly, I called Carrie back and told her she\u2019d be staying in Colorado for a while longer, and I told her why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she take the news about her husband?\u201d</p><p>I broke her heart, Avery thought. \u201cIt was . . . difficult for her to accept. She\u2019s a strong woman,\u201d she added. \u201cShe\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was John Paul Renard who figured out how Monk would strike, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We moved to a houseboat while the trap was being set at the motel. The agents made it look like we were still there. It was John Paul who found the trip wire on the stairs leading to the tower, and he and Agent Clayborne got ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I want to know. How did you put it together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Politicians, sir.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. She nodded. \u201cI was sitting on the beach . . . thinking about the situation, and that case came to mind. They had their own agenda, remember? They wanted everyone to think they were politically motivated, but it was really all about money. That got me thinking about agendas, I guess you could say. I realized I wasn\u2019t seeing the forest because of the trees. So I did the same thing I had done when I was working on the Politician case. I took it all apart and looked at each piece. Everyone had his own agenda,\u201d she added. \u201cMonk and Jilly and Skarrett and Tony Salvetti.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to call the bastard her uncle now, not after what he had done. \u201cThey each wanted something desperately.</p><p>\u201cIt was what Jilly wanted that made everything fall into place. Carrie told me about the letter that Jilly had left for her. She said Jilly accused her of stealing her dream and giving it away. That kept nagging at me. I had read all of Carrie\u2019s diaries, and I knew what Jilly was capable of. I also knew how patient she was. She\u2019d wait years to get even. I asked myself what she wanted most. Money? Revenge? Then it clicked. Jilly wanted to be a star. She craved adulation and attention. Carrie took her dream away from her. Carrie went to Hollywood and became successful and powerful. She made people stars. In Jilly\u2019s mind, Carrie had taken her dream. She blamed Carrie for all her failures. We found proof of her obsession when the agents confiscated her belongings.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. \u201cAgent Kelly told me they found a tape in Jilly\u2019s purse. It was a copy of a commercial you starred in when you were a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the commercial started it all. Jilly saw it on television, and I imagine became quite enraged. She began plotting and planning way back then. She knew who I was. Evidently Jilly felt Carrie had given her dream to me, and she was going to get even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe held on to that dream for over twenty years?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. She has a twisted, inflated opinion of herself,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked myself, who did Jilly think could get her dream back? Who could make her a star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Salvetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was still co-owner of Star Catcher. I didn\u2019t want to believe Tony was involved with any of this. John Paul said that, on some level, I must have known all along because I never called to tell Tony where I was.\u201d She glanced down at her engagement ring and lovingly adjusted it on her finger.</p><p>\u201cIt was so easy for Jilly. When she met Tony, she found an angry, bitter man. Carrie and he had merged two companies. When they got married, they were supposed to run the business as equal partners, but Carrie started bringing in the accounts. She slowly squeezed Tony out of the operation until he didn\u2019t have any power at all. He told Agent Kelly that Carrie was trying to emasculate him. He knew he would lose everything when she divorced him, and that was inevitable because she was becoming more and more distrustful, especially after she discovered over a hundred thousand dollars was missing from their accounts. Tony told Carrie that the money was in the bank and that it was an accounting error, but she certainly would have had the company books audited.</p><p>\u201cJilly told Tony she had a connection that would solve the problem for them both. She knew a man serving a sentence in a Florida prison who could help them get a hit man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale Skarrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She went to Skarrett and promised to help him get out of prison. If he would give her the name of a killer for hire, she would get rid of Carrie and me, and there would be no one to testify against him. She told him that Tony Salvetti was willing to put up the money to get rid of his wife. Jilly also promised Skarrett that she would be waiting for him when he got out. He was still obsessed with her. I\u2019m sure she would have found a way to keep him believing she loved him long enough to get the stolen diamonds. She also promised him she would get rid of the judge who had sentenced him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that brings us to Monk. When Jilly met him, she found a killer for hire, but she also found a lonely man. It took nothing for her to win him over. As it turns out, she didn\u2019t even have to offer him the money that Tony had given her. He fell madly in love and was willing to do anything she asked. So, nobody was the wiser. She could keep the money for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho came up with the idea of putting all those women in the Colorado house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJilly,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe does like to complicate things. The drama appealed to her, and making Carrie suffer was an added bonus. Monk had already taken the contract to kill Anne Trapp, and he\u2019d also taken money from Dennis Parnell to blow up the mountain house. Parnell was convinced the judge would award the estate to his ex-wife,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I can only imagine what he must have felt when he found out the judge had awarded the house to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk was a busy boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you see it on the news?\u201d he asked. \u201cEric Trapp finally broke down and confessed. He\u2019s going to go away for a very long time. If your aunt hadn\u2019t given us that letter from Anne, we wouldn\u2019t have had the evidence we needed. Trapp told the interrogator his wife was taking too long to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like the Politicians,\u201d Avery said, \u201cgreed motivated all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d he said then, \u201cthe way Jilly manipulated Salvetti and Monk and Skarrett. She was the piper and they were dancing to her tune, none of them knowing what she was up to. I talked to Agent Kelly a little while ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSkarrett still isn\u2019t admitting much, but Salvetti\u2019s talking. The odd thing is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of them will say a bad word about Jilly. They\u2019re still singing her praises.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise her. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s not talking, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s still stonewalling. You\u2019re going to make a great field agent, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, with the proper training, I could be good, but sir, I don\u2019t want to, not anymore. If I\u2019ve learned anything during the past weeks, it\u2019s that life is too short, and I don\u2019t want to waste another minute going after men and women who are beyond hope. I want to make a difference before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>She stood and waited until he walked around the desk. She shook his hand. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to resign? I can\u2019t talk you into staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind, sir. I need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that the trial and the parole hearing are over and Skarrett is back where he belongs, I\u2019m going to spend a couple of weeks with my aunt, and then I\u2019m moving to Louisiana and going back to school to get my teacher\u2019s certificate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door for her, and as she walked past, he said, \u201cOne more thing, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>THE DETECTIVE LED AVERY AND JOHN PAUL DOWN A LONG hallway to what he called their screening room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see her through the glass, but she won\u2019t be able to see you,\u201d he explained before he opened the door and stepped back.</p><p>Avery didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the interrogation room now with two detectives,\u201d he explained.</p><p>And still she didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>The detective glanced at John Paul. \u201cI\u2019ll just let you take your time,\u201d he said before he turned and walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She stood on the threshold another long minute, and then she straightened her shoulders and walked in. The room was the size of a closet. She turned to the mirrored window, her hands fisted at her sides, and looked at the woman who had given her life and then had so desperately tried to take it away.</p><p>John Paul slipped his hand in hers and asked, \u201cDo you remember her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I was only five when she came to the house,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo long ago.\u201d</p><p>Jilly sat on one side of the square metal table facing two detectives. Her back was straight, one leg crossed over the other, her hands folded on the table. The top three buttons of her eyelet blouse were undone, and the neckline opened a little wider each time she moved ever so slightly. She suddenly turned and looked directly at the mirror. Avery inhaled sharply and drew back as she felt the bile rising in her throat.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Avery whispered.</p><p>\u201cI see her,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>Avery shook her head. \u201cNot her. Look at the detectives. Look how they\u2019re reacting to her.\u201d</p> <p>Both detectives were leaning forward, as though they were unconsciously trying to get closer to her. One said something and then reached out and touched her hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working them,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>A policeman opened the door to the interrogation room. Jilly looked up at him, then, like a languorous Persian cat, she stretched her lithe body and stood. As she followed him out the door, she paused to glance back over her shoulder and smile at the two men. Both detectives eagerly returned the smile. They watched her every movement until the door closed behind her.</p><p>Avery looked into John Paul\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m ready to move on now.\u201d</p><p>She led the way out of the police station. She didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>SUNSET WAS AVERY\u2019S FAVORITE TIME OF DAY. SHE\u2019D GO OUT side and sit on the porch swing John Paul had built for her. She could hear the water lapping against the dock behind the house, and if she closed her eyes, she could almost smell the lilacs John Paul had planted.</p><p>The screen door opened and closed, and her husband sat down next to her. He put his arm around her, leaned back, and gave the swing a push.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for school tomorrow, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201d he asked. \u201cWere you going to your happy place?\u201d</p><p>She put her head on his shoulder and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m already there.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
