Her hair is down in waves that reach her shoulders, the top of her head hidden under a bright-pink winter hat. Her creamy, pale skin only causes her bright-blue eyes to look even bigger.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d she repeats, searching my face as her cheeks turn pink.</p> <p>I remember the women I\u2019ve been with, and she doesn\u2019t look familiar. My eyes travel from her face down her body. She\u2019s short, her head reaching my chin. The black, thermal shirt and vest she has on show off her full breasts, which lead to a small waist and wide hips. Even with her short height, her legs appear long and are encased in a pair of blue jeans that flare out, showing off a pair of high-heel boots. If by some chance I didn\u2019t remember that face, I would definitely remember that body.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m mistaken. Sorry,\u201d she mumbles, ducking her head and walking away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mike,\u201d I tell her back as my eyes automatically drop to her ass. Yes, I would definitely remember her.</p><p>She turns to face me, and I watch her chest heave as she takes a breath.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, looking around.</p> <p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d I ask, watching as her cheeks darken even more as she looks around the hardware store. Cute, I think as I watch her look for an escape.</p><p>\u201cKat. Well, Kathleen Mullings.\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>Well, shit. I look her over again, but this time, I focus on her eyes\u2014the same eyes I would look into when I was supposed to be studying. Instead, I was wondering what Kat would do if I ever kissed her. We never hung out with the same crowd, but back when we were in high school, I would look for excuses to hang out with her. After graduation, she went away to school and I stayed in Tennessee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all grown up,\u201d I say, watching as a smile spreads across her lips.</p><p>\u201cThat does tend to happen after thirty-one years.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I chuckle and shake my head. \u201cSo what brings you to town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI needed a good place to raise my son, so I figured what better place than where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a son?\u201d I ask, watching her face light up.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He just turned sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You really did grow up, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I say, covering up the slight disappointment I feel when I think about her having a husband.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you coming or what?\u201d</p><p>I look over Kat\u2019s shoulder as a tall boy walks down the aisle towards us wearing a hoodie that is pulled up on his head, a pair of baggie jeans, and boots. His eyes come to me and narrow before looking at his mom again.</p><p>\u201cHoney, this is Mike. We went to school together. Mike, this is my son, Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I stick out my hand and he looks at it for a second before giving it a shake.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d he repeats as soon as he drops my hand.</p><p>Kat pulls her bag off her shoulder and pulls out her wallet before handing him a twenty and a set of keys. \u201cGo pay for the stuff. I\u2019ll meet you at the car,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>He looks at me again then shakes his head before walking off.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. He\u2019s been like that since the two of us moved here,\u201d she says quietly, watching him go. Then her eyes come back to me when I speak.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I smile a real smile then feel like an ass for being happy that his dad\u2019s not in the picture.</p><p>\u201cI need to go, but we should get a drink sometime and catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says, and her eyes get big when she realizes what she just said.</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone.\u201d I hold out my hand.</p><p>She pulls her phone out of her pocket, handing it to me. I quickly plug my number into her phone before pressing call. When I hear my phone ring, I hang up then pull my phone out and save her number.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d She looks adorably stunned, and the urge to pull her to me and press my mouth to hers hits me in the chest so hard that I have to take a step back.</p><p>\u201cSee you around, sweetheart,\u201d I say, and she blinks then shakes her head. It makes me feel better to know she feels it too.</p><p>\u201cUh...see you around.\u201d She turns around.</p><p>I watch her walk away. As she reaches the end of the aisle, she looks over her shoulder at me and smiles, giving a wave before turning away again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I spin my head quickly and meet Asher\u2019s eyes. \u201cAn old friend...\u201d I run my hand over my head then look around, trying to remember what the hell I came in here for to begin with.</p><p>\u201cYou were giving her the look,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look at him again and narrow my eyes. \u201cWhy are you here and not at home with my daughter and grandbabies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter\u2019s hair keeps clogging up the damn drain,\u201d he says, holding up a bottle of Drano. \u201cSo me, being the amazing husband I am, told her that I would go to the hardware store then stop off at Annie\u2019s and get doughnuts for her \u2018cause they are her favorite. Now, tell me why you were giving that lady the look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no look,\u201d I deny, looking around again.</p><p>\u201cOh, there was a look,\u201d he says, and my eyes go back to him and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cDo not say anything to November,\u201d I plead immediately.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cTwo months ago, she signed me up for a dating website. I do not need help dating,\u201d I remind him, and he starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat shit was funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny?\u201d I shake my head and shudder. Some of the replies I received were downright scary.</p><p>\u201cShe just wants you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>KAT</p><p>I bend over, find my jeans, and quickly pull them on. I find my tank next and pull that on over my head before taking a seat and pulling on my boots. I hate this part; the whole leaving thing really bothers me. It makes me feel dirty, like I\u2019ve done something wrong. How can something that feels so right be wrong?</p><p>Almost a year ago, when I saw Mike for the first time after so many years, I didn\u2019t know what to think. The boy who I used to help study had turned into a gorgeous man. He was always good-looking, but after a few years had been added, everything about him held a story, from the small smile wrinkles around his eyes to the calluses on his hands.</p><p>I doubt that anyone who met him would think that he was anywhere near his forty-seven years, but he aged well. His height of six feet on the dot would probably not be tall to most, but at five two, I have to tilt my head back to catch his eyes. His dark hair, which was always unruly, still looks the same\u2014long enough that, if you happen to be standing next to him, your hands itch to run your fingers through it. His naturally tan skin, which turns golden after a long summer, always makes his hazel eyes appear more emerald. The tattoos that now cover his arms and chest are something new, but they also tell their own story and change his classic good looks to something more rugged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had a crush on him in high school, and the years didn\u2019t diminish my feelings. If anything, my crush has seems to have turned into lust, and now, love was mixed in there as well.</p><p>The crush I could deal with. It was just an innocent emotion I could easily block out. Lust? That is something completely different. My body craves his touch; I want to be around him and I want him to want me. And now that I\u2019ve been feeling the love bug, it is no longer just my body that wants him. I want to hear him laugh or talk. I want to share my day with him. But since our first date, we agreed that we\u2019re never going to be anything more than what we are now, which is basically fuck buddies.</p><p>At forty-three years old, I did not want this to be my life. My son is going to be eighteen in a week, and he\u2019s going off to college at the end of the year. I\u2019m not getting any younger, and I want someone to share my life with.</p><p>I look at the closed bathroom door, where Mike disappeared to moments ago, and sigh. I know what I need to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to do it.</p> <p>Once I finish putting on my boots, I stand and run my fingers through my hair, trying to tame it. I look at the bed, and my stomach twists. Sex between us is phenomenal. He knows exactly how to touch me, but I desire more. No, I deserve more.</p><p>I hear the bathroom door open and almost back out of what I need to do. The sight of Mike in nothing but a towel doesn\u2019t help at all. I still have no idea how he can have so many muscles at his age, but he does. I close my eyes, take a breath, and open my eyes at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d His eyes come together in confusion.</p><p>I know what he\u2019s thinking\u2014not that I don\u2019t leave after sex, just that we normally spend the entire day together. But after that last round, where the word love was pressed to the roof of my mouth so hard that I wanted to cry, I knew then that I needed to end things between us.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Okay. The words are out. I can breathe again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t do this anymore?\u201d His eyes narrow further and drop to my hand as I pick up my bag.</p><p>\u201cThis thing between us... I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d I shake my head, lifting my bag up and over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis thing?\u201d The words are growled and his eyes sweep the room.</p><p>I take a second to think about what I need to say before opening my mouth again. \u201cYou were honest with me and told me that you weren\u2019t looking for a relationship.\u201d I take a breath, feeling my heart speed up. \u201cNine months ago, I was okay with that because I felt the same way.\u201d I smile but feel it wobble. \u201cI no longer feel that way. I want more.\u201d</p><p>He runs a hand over his hair, and I see pain flash through his eyes. The urge to comfort him hits me hard.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>He\u2019s right. He did tell me what his daughter\u2019s mother had done to him, but that was years ago. I don\u2019t want to sound like a heartless bitch, but people get screwed over every day. Sometimes, you have to get over shit. My ex-husband abandoned me, and as horrible as that is, I know that not all men are the same and somewhere out there is a man who will love me the way I need to be loved. Even if the man I wanted to love me didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou did tell me, but I can\u2019t be stuck in the past with you, Mike. I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d he says, his eyebrows pulling together. I want to laugh at how oblivious he is.</p><p>\u201cMike, I see you for a few hours a couple of times a week. We have sex. Then I go home. We don\u2019t have dinner or talk about our lives, so yes, I\u2019m alone, and in five years, Mike, I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>I wait to see if he\u2019s going to say something, anything that will change the way I feel right now. If he will try to convince me to stay. But he just stands there looking at me. I shake my head in disappointment and turn for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait. We can do dinner,\u201d he says.</p><p>A laugh so painful that I have to put my hand to my heart bubbles out of my mouth before I can stop it. I don\u2019t even turn around to look at him when I reply.</p><p>\u201cMike, dinner isn\u2019t going to change how I feel.\u201d I\u2019m positive that dinner would just make this whole thing more complicated, and it doesn\u2019t need to be any more complicated.</p> <p>\u201cWill you please stop?\u201d His hand wraps around my elbow as I start to open the front door. My head drops and I turn to face him. \u201cGive me some time.\u201d</p><p>My throat clogs and tears sting my nose at the pain I hear in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I shake my head again, pulling my elbow from his grasp before heading out to my car. I don\u2019t want things to end like this, but there\u2019s no way I can continue with the way things are going.</p><p>I quickly buckle up and start my car. I look up at the house one last time. Seeing Mike standing on the front porch makes me question my decision. Then I think about my life and what I want for myself and put my car in reverse, pulling my eyes from him and backing out of his driveway.</p><p>I look at the guy across from me and bite the inside of my cheek. I signed up for online dating three week ago and have gone out on two dates so far. This guy is better-looking than the last guy, but I just mean better-looking, not good-looking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell Steve.</p><p>He nods, not even taking his eyes off the phone in his hand. I roll my eyes and stand up, grabbing my bag. As soon as I reach the restroom I step up in front of the sink and turn on the cool water, splashing some on my cheeks before looking at myself in the mirror. I told Mike that I didn\u2019t want to be alone in five years and I need to date in order for that to happen, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.</p><p>Mike has called a couple of times, and when he does reach out to me, I can\u2019t help but pick up my phone. Call me weak if you want to, but I love him. He never says anything about hooking up again. He just asks how work\u2019s going and if Brandon is doing okay. I try to keep the conversations short. My heart can only take so much.</p><p>After shaking the thoughts of Mike out of my head and pulling a couple of paper towels out of the dispenser, I dab my face, reminding myself that I just need to get through dinner. Then I can go home, have a glass of wine, and curl up in bed with some twenty-something hot guy with tattoos on my Kindle. I touch up my lip gloss, step out of the bathroom, and run right into a solid wall.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble, as warm hands wrap around my shoulders steadying me. A familiar smell surrounds me as my eyes travel up and meet a pair of warm, hazel eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKat.\u201d The sound of my name leaving his mouth has goose bumps breaking out across my skin and anxiety turning in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d I try to take a step back, but his hands hold me a little tighter as his eyes travel down my body, taking in my dress and heels.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he says as his hands slide down my arms and his thumbs run over my bare skin. My stomach flips at the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I try to take a step back again, but he leans in, his nose running along my neck.</p> <p>\u201cYou smell good, too.\u201d</p><p>I take a shaky breath and close my eyes as his nose runs up my neck towards my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks, his lips brushing my lobe.</p><p>My hands come up to grip his shirt so I don\u2019t fall on my face.</p><p>\u201cKathleen, are you okay?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice cuts in.</p> <p>I let go of Mike immediately and take a step away from him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Steve,\u201d I say, taking another step back, trying to get my body back under control.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s just arrived at the table and I can\u2019t eat until you get there,\u201d he says, slightly annoyed.</p><p>I look from him to Mike and take a breath when I see the look on Mike\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m coming now,\u201d I tell Steve, who mumbles something before crossing his arms over his chest watching us.</p><p>I start down the hall towards him when he clears his throat. If the feeling of guilt weren\u2019t running through me for what just happened, I would tell Steve where to shove it. When I reach the end of the hall, I feel eyes boring into my back. I turn my head to look over my shoulder and look at Mike.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice seeing you,\u201d I tell Mike.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just lifts his chin in my direction before looking over my head and glaring. I turn back around and head out to the dining room, following behind Steve. When we sit at the table, he looks at his food, grumbling under his breath about the temperature before he starts eating. Why the hell I needed to be here in order for him to eat is still confusing me as I start to cut up the ravioli that I ordered.</p> <p>Suddenly, I feel eyes on me again, so I lift my head. My eyes lock on Mike\u2019s from across the restaurant as he sits at the bar with a guy who I know is his brother. His hand, which is holding a beer, comes up in my direction before I lower my eyes to continue eating.</p><p>This date will go down as the second worst date of my life, and that\u2019s second to the one I had a week ago with a computer programmer who thought he was God\u2019s gift to women. Sadly, he reminded me of the aliens from Men In Black\u2014the ones with the giant, beefed-up bodies and teeny tiny heads. Yeah, that was not a good time.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you were making out with someone while we\u2019re on a date,\u201d Steve says, catching me off guard and bringing me out of my thoughts.</p><p>Guilt turns my stomach at his words. My ex-husband cheated on me. He was having an affair for two years and I didn\u2019t even find out until he was packing his stuff to move out. I begged him to work it out, but in the end, he chose his new girlfriend and her kids over my son and me. I hate cheaters, and even though I have no commitment to Steve, I still feel guilty for what happened with Mike.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t making out with him,\u201d I say defensively.</p><p>\u201cHis mouth was on you.\u201d Okay, so that was true. \u201cI would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t touch other men when we\u2019re out together.\u201d</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be too hard because I\u2019m thinking this is going to be the last time I will ever see Steve.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d I tell him, really wanting to stab him.</p> <p>I sit there for a few more minutes, not eating while feeling holes being drilled into me from across the room. It\u2019s taking everything in me not to look at Mike. My body knows he\u2019s near. I swear I can feel my blood cells pulling me in his direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d I tell Steve.</p><p>His eyes narrow, but he nods like I need his damn permission. I grab my bag and start toward the restrooms, but instead of walking all the way down the hall, I turn to the left and head towards the hostess.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d the hostess asks as soon as I make it to the front of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cActually, I need to leave. I have an emergency.\u201d I pull out a hundred-dollar bill and hand it to her. \u201cCan you please give that to our waitress and give a message to my date that I left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she replies, giving me a knowing smile. She seated me with Steve thirty minutes ago, so I\u2019m sure she understands why I want to get out of here.</p><p>I smile, lift my bag up over my shoulder, and head for the front of the restaurant. Once I reach the parking lot, I find my keys, quickly get in my car, and take off like the hounds of Hell are on my heels.</p><p>When I reach my house, my cell starts ringing from my purse. I pull it out and slide my finger across the screen when I see that Mike is calling.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t last long,\u201d he says, his tone almost playful.</p><p>But something about his words pisses me off. I know what I want out of life, and I know that I deserve to have a man who is supportive at my side. I have been single for a long time, but I miss having someone to wake up to or someone to call when I just need to vent.</p><p>\u201cHe was kind of lame, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I hiss. My stomach tightens and the urge to throw my phone across the room consumes me. \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk!\u201d I say, hanging up.</p><p>When my phone lights up again, I hit the power button. Screw him.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>MIKE</p><p>I look at my coffee and rub the space between my eyes. I need to get dressed, but since everything went down with Kat, I haven\u2019t felt like doing shit. I hear the front door open and slam then the sound of Beast\u2019s dog tags jingling together before I ever see November come around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy!\u201d my daughter says, walking into the house.</p><p>I watch as she tosses her bag across the room and onto the couch before coming to sit down at the island next to me with a huff. Her eyes search my face for a second before I turn away from her.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl,\u201d I mumble, taking a drink of my coffee, setting my elbows down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, spill it,\u201d she says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSpill what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh lord. Don\u2019t play dumb. You\u2019ve been moping around for a while and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on, I\u2019m going to call Grandma,\u201d she says, standing and walking around the island into the kitchen. Then she grabs a coffee cup out of the cupboard before pouring herself a cup of coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you drink that right now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She frowns at me over the top of her coffee cup, making me smile. \u201cHa, ha.

I know she\u2019s not a little girl, but the idea of explaining to her how I let the woman I love slip through my fingers because I\u2019m a dumbass is not at all appealing.</p><p>\u201cDad, talk to me,\u201d she says quietly.</p> <p>I look at her across the counter and lower my head. \u201cI fucked up. I mean really fucked up, and I don\u2019t know if I can fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still breathing?\u201d she asks softly, and I lift my head.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still breathing?\u201d she repeats, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell her and frown when I see her eyes flash.</p> <p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She nods. \u201cYou know, this man once told me that, as long as you were breathing, anything was possible.\u201d She takes a drink of her coffee, searching my face again. She shakes her head and I see tears fill her eyes. \u201cYou could have given up on me,\u201d she whispers, and my heart contracts. \u201cYou could have just said screw it and given up, but you didn\u2019t\u2014you never did. You are someone who fights for what you want. So if you love this woman, she\u2019s probably pretty amazing and worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I say, my jaw locking.</p><p>\u201cThen fight, Dad. I want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so darn smart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs, taking another drink from her cup.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Dad.\u201d She smiles then leans onto the counter with her elbows. \u201cNow tell me about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I take a breath and sit up on the stool. \u201cHer name\u2019s Kathleen. We knew each other back in school before she moved away,\u201d I say.</p><p>She nods before taking another drink and then lowering her cup to the counter. \u201cHow long have you been seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>Shit, I think, and she narrows her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been seeing her, Dad?\u201d she repeats.</p><p>\u201cNine months,\u201d I mumble looking down at the counter.</p><p>\u201cNine months? You\u2019ve been seeing her for nine months and I\u2019m just now hearing about her?\u201d She shakes her head and stands to her full height before turning away from me and walking around the kitchen twice. Then she stops in front of me, opening and closing her mouth again and doing another circle. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t told me about this,\u201d she says, making me feel instantly worse.</p><p>\u201cShe has a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a son?\u201d she repeats, coming around the counter to sit on the stool next to me again. \u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, running my fingers though my hair.</p><p>\u201cHow do you guys get along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing this lady for nine months, you\u2019re in love with her, and you don\u2019t know her son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I fucked up,\u201d I tell her, lowering my head towards the counter again.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying,\u201d she mumbles under her breath, and I swing my head towards her and narrow my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says, holding up her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late.\u201d She wraps her arm around my back, laying her head on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty easy to love, Dad, and one thing I know for sure is that everything will work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, baby girl.\u201d I wrap my arm around her, lean in, and kiss the top of her head. And pray that I find away to get my woman back.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>KAT</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d I ask Conner as we pull up in front of a large log house.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I told you before. It\u2019s all good. We\u2019re not going to stay long\u2014just a beer. Then we can go to the movies, or if you want, we can go back to my place,\u201d he says, his voice changing slightly, making me panic.</p><p>Oh God. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. Conner is a very nice man. He\u2019s good-looking, attentive, and kind. He\u2019s also successful, but the idea of doing anything more than kissing him on the cheek makes me feel nauseated.</p><p>I feel bad that there is no spark with him. He has done everything to make me feel comfortable, but something keeps holding me back. There are just no sparks. I keep asking myself, Who the hell needs sparks? But my brain is not listening.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone out with Conner a few times. I met him when we were both in line at the bank. He seemed like a nice guy, and I\u2019m still adamant about getting over Mike and finding someone to build something lasting with. Yeah, I know I\u2019m breaking the rules about being an independent woman, but I know what I want. And since the man I want is an idiot, I need to look elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to a movie,\u201d I tell him right away and see disappointment flash through his eyes before he takes his eyes off me and looks at the house in front of us.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d he says, opening his door and climbing out of his truck.</p><p>I open my door and meet him in front of the house. He takes my hand in his and I fight the urge to make him release me as we walk up the steps to the front porch. When we reach the door, he doesn\u2019t knock; he just walks in. The second we step over the threshold, I\u2019m bombarded by the sounds of people laughing and having a good time.</p><p>Conner leads us through the crowd, stopping along the way to say hi to people he knows. When we reach the kitchen, a young, very good-looking guy with his hair shaved off comes up to us, pulling Conner in for a one-arm hug. When they pull away, the guy looks at me and then to Conner. Again, something flashes in his eyes, but I\u2019m not fast enough to understand what it is.</p><p>\u201cAsher, this is Kathleen. Kathleen, this is Asher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I smile and take his hand when he puts it out for a shake.</p><p>\u201cYou look familiar,\u201d he says, and I shake my head no. \u201cDo you know my wife November?\u201d he asks.</p><p>My stomach drops. No way. Fate cannot be this cruel. But the chance of another woman named November living in this town is about as likely as being struck by lightning. I\u2019ve never met November, but Mike talked about her often, along with his granddaughters\u2014he even brought up his son-in-law a few times, but I never put two and two together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>\u201cBabe!\u201d Asher yells across the room.</p><p>I turn my head in the direction his eyes are facing and see a beautiful woman smile and walk towards us holding a little girl in her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d she asks, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know Conner, baby, and this is Kathleen,\u201d he tells her.</p><p>When she reaches his side, his arm goes around her waist and her eyes come to me. \u201cKathleen,\u201d she mumbles. The look in her eyes is making me wonder if Mike ever told her about me.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I tell her, wanting to break the awkward moment.</p><p>Conner\u2019s hand goes to my back and my body stiffens at the contact. November\u2019s eyes look between Conner and me and a smile starts to spread across her lips.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d she says then looks down at the girl in her arms. \u201cThis is June,\u201d she says, lifting the little girl higher up on her hip before stepping out of her husband\u2019s grasp.</p><p>November pulls me in for a one-arm hug, forcing the little girl in her arms between us. When she starts to pull away, the little girl grabs on to the front of my shirt. I look down at her and smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s adorable,\u201d I say, looking up at November.</p><p>June doesn\u2019t let up. Instead, she seems to hold on tighter to me as her mom starts to pull her away.</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d I ask.</p><p>November nods, and I take the girl completely from her, pulling in a lungful of her baby smell.</p><p>\u201cYour dad around?\u201d I hear Conner ask as I run my fingers down June\u2019s chubby cheek.</p><p>\u201cYep. He\u2019s manning the grill,\u201d Asher tells him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d Conner says, squeezing my side before walking away.</p><p>I feel a singe across my skin and turn my head, looking around the room full of people before locking on Mike. Even from the distance between us, I can see his jaw grinding.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one who has my dad all messed up?\u201d November asks.</p><p>I pull my eyes from Mike and look at her. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad,\u201d she says, looking behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s been moping around for a while. He spoke about you to me about a week ago when I threatened to sic Grandma on him if he didn\u2019t tell me what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper. This is not what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d she whispers back, her smile catching me off guard.</p> <p>I feel a hand at my back and don\u2019t even have to turn my head to know that it\u2019s Mike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here with Conner?\u201d is growled near my ear as Asher reaches over, plucking June from my arms, giving me a soft smile before wrapping an arm around November\u2019s waist and leading her away.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Kathleen,\u201d November calls over her shoulder before looking at her dad and shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cMike, I\u2014\u201d I start to tell him that I\u2019m sorry when he cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually...\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cFuck no. You didn\u2019t even give me a second to work shit out in my head,\u201d he says, his voice low, and my hands begin to shake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this here,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to do this shit here, but seeing\u2019s how you ain\u2019t returning my calls, I got no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Mike me, baby. I\u2019m pissed the fuck off right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to be mad.\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He looks at me, top to toe, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve had my mouth and hands on every inch of you. And you show up at a party at my kid\u2019s house with a date.\u201d He shakes his head again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a vulgar. And I had no idea this was your daughter\u2019s house,\u201d I tell him, feeling my face heat in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou may not have known, but Conner knew this is my daughter\u2019s house. As for being vulgar,\u201d he says, his face dipping even closer to mine, his voice dropping, \u201cyour body knows me, craves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I bite out, becoming pissed off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been mine since you walked back into my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tol\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off, ducking his head so he\u2019s face to face with me. \u201cI know what I said, baby. I thought that you were cool with how we were. You told me you wanted to keep things simple \u2018cause your boy. I had no clue that you were feeling like you weren\u2019t important to me.\u201d His hand comes up, his fingers wrapping around the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t stop me from leaving,\u201d I say quietly, still hurt by that.</p><p>\u201cI was caught off guard. I thought I had time. Then I saw you out on a date and was pissed but happy the guy was a loser.\u201d He smiles and I narrow my eyes. \u201cThen I called you. I wanted to laugh about it with you, but that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agree. \u201cI was really mad at you. I am really mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think weeks of silent treatment hasn\u2019t shown me that?\u201d</p><p>My heart starts to feel lighter, and then guilt starts to kick in. \u201cI\u2019m here with Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were here with Conner. Now, you\u2019re here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d I whisper-hiss his name.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019ll talk to Conner.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Conner knew I was seeing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery man in town knew I was seeing you. They all knew you were off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I repeat, stunned.</p><p>\u201cYou never wondered why the fuck no one ever hit on you?\u201d he asks, his thumb sliding down my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer, swallowing at the intense look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey knew you were off-limits. Just \u2018cause our relationship wasn\u2019t out in the open doesn\u2019t mean I hid that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why me and Conner are gonna talk,\u201d he states, and anxiety fills my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. I\u2019m still talking to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk,\u201d I hiss and try to break out of his grasp.</p><p>His hand wraps around my waist and his hand at my neck slides farther back into my hair, holding me captive as his mouth comes down on mine, pulling the air from my lungs. I gasp in surprise, and he takes the opportunity to slip his tongue between my lips. His familiar taste fills my mouth, and my body, which is completely owned by him, leans in until my chest is pressed firmly to his. When he groans and I feel his arousal at my stomach, a whimper escapes into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I hear barked.</p><p>My eyes squeeze shut.

I can\u2019t believe I just kissed Mike in front of all of these people; I really can\u2019t believe I did it when I am out with Conner.</p> <p>\u201cOh shit. This should be good.\u201d</p><p>I look to my left at a young guy. His head\u2019s shaved. He looks similar to Asher, and I wonder if they\u2019re brothers.</p><p>His eyes come to me and a smile spreads across his lips. \u201cI\u2019m Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathleen,\u201d I say then hear yelling and start to head towards the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think Mike would want you out there, doll,\u201d a guy covered in tattoos says, stepping in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cI need to stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, and I try to step around him, but he blocks my way again.</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d I glare, and he smirks, shaking his head.</p><p>I look around me and see a sliding glass door not far from where I\u2019m standing. I\u2019m just about to make a run for it when Mike comes storming back into the house carrying my purse, which I left in Conner\u2019s truck.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Mike says, and the tattoo guy in front of me smiles before stepping out of the way. When Mike reaches my side, his hand slides around my waist and his eyes go to the tattoo guy. \u201cThanks, Nico, and tell November I\u2019ll call her,\u201d he says before leading me out of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask when I finally find my voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to my house so we can talk,\u201d he says, opening the passenger\u2019s side door to his car and pushing me in before slamming the door closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d I whisper to myself as I watch Mike slide behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cSeatbelt, babe,\u201d he says as I sit there, stunned. His arm comes across me, pulling the belt across my body before locking it in place.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon,\u201d he tells me, starting up the car and putting it in reverse.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, babe,\u201d he mutters, pulling out his phone and pressing a couple of buttons before putting it to his ear. \u201cI won\u2019t be at the club tonight. Can you handle it?\u201d he asks into the phone while turning his car onto the main road. \u201cGood. Thanks,\u201d he mutters before pulling the phone from his ear and putting it in the cup holder between us.</p><p>\u201cCan you take me home?\u201d I ask softly.</p> <p>His hand comes to mine in my lap. He twines his fingers with mine before pulling my hand to his mouth and whispering, \u201cNo,\u201d against my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI just kissed you when I was out on a date with someone else,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replies, pulling my hand to his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI feel really horrible about that, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to apologize to Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly.</p><p>\u201cMike, you know about my past, about my ex and what he did to me. I doesn\u2019t sit well that I did that to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d he asks on a growl.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with Conner?\u201d he repeats, sounding even angrier.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d he says, his face showing disgust.</p><p>\u201cYes. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you see yourself with him in five years?\u201d he asks, and I turn my head to look at him, noticing that his jaw is clenched.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t need to call him.\u201d</p><p>We drive the rest of the way to his house in silence. My brain keeps repeating everything that just happened and I have no idea why I\u2019m not fighting him or why I don\u2019t have more of an issue with his telling me that I can\u2019t call Conner. All I keep thinking about is that, every time he touches or kisses me, it feels right.</p><p>When we pull up to his house, he shuts down the car and immediately gets out, walks around to my side, opens my door, leans in across me, unhooks my belt, and pulls me out with him.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I mumble, not sure what I\u2019m going to say as he shuts the door behind us.</p><p>He grabs my hand, dragging me with him into the kitchen. \u201cSit here,\u201d he says as his hands go to my waist, hoisting me up on to the counter. Then he kisses me on the lips before going to the fridge and getting two beers.</p><p>I watch him, at a loss for words, while he pops the tops on both beers before coming to stand in front of me, pushing my legs apart, and then standing between them.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk,\u201d he says, setting his beer down at my hip. His hands slide around me, pulling me closer to him. \u201cFirst, I fucked up, but this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. There is supposed to be an us.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my mouth opening and closing, but no words are coming out.</p><p>His eyes search my face, his voice drops and his hands go to my face, holding it gently. \u201cI love you. You love me.\u201d</p><p>I double blink and feel my insides melt.</p><p>\u201cI messed up.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is going on?</p><p>I look around the kitchen, making sure that I\u2019m not getting Punk\u2019d. Men do not do this\u2014at least not the men I know. Then again, Mike has never been normal\u2014hence my not being able to get over him.</p><p>\u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d he asks softly, his eyes pleading.</p><p>I take a deep breath, holding it in. I still can\u2019t form words as I look into his eyes. I know we have a lot to work through, but I want to be with him. So I take my hands off the counter, place them on his shoulders, and lean in, pressing my mouth to his. His hands hold my face more firmly while he takes over control of the kiss by tilting my head farther so he can get deeper. His tongue tangles with mine and the feel of his hand skimming down my side to run smoothly over my breast causes me to lift my hips and circle my legs around his waist. Then he pulls his mouth away and rests his forehead against mine with his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to work out,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>He nods, his hands sliding around me.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, I want all of it, not just the sex.\u201d I know deep down that I\u2019m just as guilty as he is for what happened between us before. I should have told him sooner that I wanted more before flipping out and jumping ship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou got me, Kat.\u201d</p><p>I search his face and see the truth and love in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou love me too, right?\u201d he asks, sounding worried. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that wrong, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d I whisper.

I get up off the couch and go to my bag, pulling out my phone.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey,\u201d I answer, putting the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I ask, hearing the anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were with Mike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am with Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon, you\u2019re the child. I\u2019m the parent,\u201d I remind him. Since we have been on our own without his dad, he has been stepping over his boundaries more and more.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he says before hanging up on me.</p><p>I pull the phone away from my ear and look at the screen.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Mike asks, making me jump.</p><p>I sigh and turn to look at him. As much as I want to hang out, I need to go home and talk to my son.</p><p>\u201cI need to go home,\u201d I tell him, shaking my head.</p> <p>\u201cBrandon okay?\u201d he asks, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just need to go home and have a talk with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, getting my bag and following him out to his truck.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>KAT</p><p>I answer my phone, my voice cracking. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d Mike asks, his voice softening as my body collapses back onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d I tell him, pulling the covers over me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying the night at a friend\u2019s house tonight,\u201d I mumble, cuddling deeper into my pillow. I woke up with a headache, and throughout the day, I have slowly gotten worse. My nose started running, and then I started getting chills. \u201cI took some medicine,\u201d I say absently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be over in an hour.\u201d His concern comes to me though the phone like a soothing caress.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to come,\u201d I say immediately, not wanting him to get sick. Working from home, I\u2019m able to make my own schedule, but I know he doesn\u2019t have the option of being sick. His club is very important to him and his brother.</p><p>\u201cDo you like chicken noodle soup?\u201d he asks, ignoring me and my protest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Now answer my question.\u201d</p><p>I smile at his bossiness and nod into my pillow as I tell him, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, baby,\u201d he says, softly making my heart swell. Since we got back together, he has been all in and our relationship couldn\u2019t be any better.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d I whisper, falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cKat, wake up, baby,\u201d I hear then feel a cool rag on my forehead.</p><p>I open my eyes slowly. They feel so heavy.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mike says, running a finger down the underside of my jaw. \u201cI need you to sit up and take some medicine for me.\u201d</p><p>I blink and slowly sit up with his help. \u201cThanks,\u201d I tell him, taking the pills from his hand and putting them in my mouth before taking the cup from him and swallowing them down.</p><p>\u201cYou got a thermometer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He gets up and leaves, coming back a few seconds later with it in his hand. \u201cOpen up, babe,\u201d he says, sitting on the side of the bed near my hip.</p><p>I open my mouth before closing my lips around it. When I hear it go off, I open my eyes, not even having realized they were closed.</p><p>He removes it from my mouth and shakes his head. \u201cOne-oh-two,\u201d he says, looking at me worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d I lean my head against the headboard and pull the covers up to my waist.</p><p>His hand comes up, his fingers running along my hairline. \u201cI\u2019d feel better if you didn\u2019t have a temp.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you sick. How about you take a shower while I make you some soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I sigh. I can tell by the look on his face that he\u2019s not going to give up until my temperature is down. I sit up completely, and he helps me into the bathroom, starting the shower for me before helping me remove my clothes. There is nothing sexual about it, and I can tell by the concentration on his face that he is just focused on taking care of me and helping me get better.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay or do you want me to stay in here?\u201d he asks, helping me into the shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d I nod, tilting my head back under the water.</p><p>The feel of the warm water running over me makes me sigh in relief. I open my eyes when I don\u2019t hear him say anything else. His hands are above his head, holding on to the shower rod, the muscles of his harms flexing. The look on his face has me swallowing hard.</p><p>\u201cI was good until you made that sound,\u201d he says, his voice raising the hairs on my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat sound?\u201d I ask. Even though I\u2019m sick, I feel my body react to the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this noise you make when I slide inside you. I haven\u2019t heard it in so long. When the sound left your mouth, my boy woke up,\u201d he says, tilting his head down toward his crotch.</p><p>I lower my eyes and see the large outline of his erection through his jeans. We haven\u2019t had sex since we got back together. Between Brandon, work, and Mike\u2019s schedule at the club, we haven\u2019t been able to spend more than a few hours together. Now, after not having had him for so long, my body is waking back up. It never took much for him to get to me. I swear I can feel myself get wet just by thinking of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go make your soup,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I nod, licking my lips, my eyes tracking his movements. I want to lean out of the shower and wrap myself around him.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he mumbles before turning and leaving me standing in the shower.</p><p>I hear him as he goes down the stairs and listen as cabinets open and close. I can\u2019t help it; the smile that spreads across my lips gets bigger the louder he becomes downstairs. I can imagine him muttering under his breath while slamming the cabinets.</p> <p>I finish washing up then get out. I twist my hair in a towel before wrapping up in my favorite robe and climbing back into bed. I turn on the TV just as Mike walks into the room carrying a tray I didn\u2019t even know I owned.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d I ask him as he walks around the bed, setting the tray down on my lap.</p><p>\u201cBrought it with me.\u201d He smiles. \u201cMa was over at my place when I called you. She told me what you would need.\u201d</p><p>My heart flutters. No one has ever looked after me when I was sick before\u2014not even my ex-husband. He was always too busy. Of course, later I learned that it was difficult for him to be married to me while carrying on a relationship with his girlfriend and her children.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, looking down at the tray. Not only did he bring me soup, but he also brought me crackers and ginger ale. I dip the spoon into the soup, coming up with broth and tiny stars. I smile bigger as I swallow a spoonful.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel better after your shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes.\u201d I nod, watching as he takes off his boots and pulls his shirt off over his head. I don\u2019t think I will ever get over the sight of him.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had any problems with my weight. My whole life, I have been the same size. Even when I was pregnant with my son, I didn\u2019t gain more than twenty pounds. But Mike\u2019s body is something different altogether. His muscles are defined. You can tell just by looking at him that he takes care of himself.</p><p>After he is down to his boxers and his clothes are neatly placed in the large, oversized chair in the corner of my room, he climbs into bed next to me, careful not to spill my soup as he wraps an arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou got the remote?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Without thinking, I hand it to him. Then he turns on a football game and kisses the side of my head. The whole thing feels surreal. It feels like we have done this a million times.</p> <p>\u201cWhat time do you have to go into work?\u201d I ask him. I don\u2019t want him to leave, but he works nights and being the owner of a strip club doesn\u2019t come with a normal schedule.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s got it covered tonight,\u201d he says absently, his eyes focused on the game.</p><p>My insides are turning liquid. He is having his brother take over so he can be with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay if you need to go to work,\u201d I tell him, scooping up another spoonful of soup.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got it, babe,\u201d he says, looking over at me. \u201cThe club\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s probably gonna be a slow night anyway, and Joe can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he says, his tone gentle.</p><p>I nod and finish eating. When I\u2019m done, he takes the tray downstairs only to come back up carrying a plastic shopping bag. When he gets back into the bed, he dumps the bag out and I start to laugh. There is every kind of medication you could think of, from stuff for colds, period pain relievers, and stuff for gas and bloating.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to leave after I got here, so I got a little bit of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d I smile then start putting stuff back. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of this,\u201d I tell him, handing him the bag.</p><p>He takes it and puts it on the floor. I pick up the Nyquil and he takes it from me, opening it and pouring it into the little cup before handing the cup to me. I take it immediately before handing him the empty cup back. He puts the stuff on the table next to him before lying down, pulling me with him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming and taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>His hands wrap around me tighter and his lips touch the top of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to take care of you,\u201d he tells me, and I can hear the seriousness in his tone.</p><p>\u201cAnd I get to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>His body stills and he takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I know about his dating history, and I know that he never wanted to get close to anyone again. However, I also know that, even if he told himself that all of his previous bed partners were long term and that he might not have been looking for love, he was not sleeping with a different woman every night. He wanted to connect with someone, but somehow, he never did.</p><p>I burrow deeper into his side and angle my face towards the TV.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d Mike says, his lips resting on my forehead briefly before pulling away.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d I whisper back. My eyes close completely, and my only thought is that this is the thing I\u2019ve been looking for.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d I hear Brandon say.</p><p>I sit up quickly, looking at the open door of my room. My eyes meet my son\u2019s angry ones. Then his go back to Mike, who is now sitting up as well, wrapping an arm around me.</p><p>\u201cBrandon Tim, watch your mouth,\u201d I tell him, running a hand through my hair.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Mom, this is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your mom,\u201d Mike says in a tone I\u2019ve never heard from him before.</p><p>Brandon glares at Mike then looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m taking the car,\u201d he states, his jaw clenching.</p><p>I start to nod when Mike cuts in. \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandon asks, confused.</p><p>I hate to admit it, but since my husband left, I have let Brandon do his own thing. I know it\u2019s stupid, but I hate fighting with him. I feel so guilty that he no longer has his father in his life, and sometimes, it\u2019s just easier to go with the flow than to go head-to-head with an eighteen-year-old man-child.</p><p>\u201cAsk if you can use your mom\u2019s car. Don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re taking it,\u201d Mike says, not taking his eyes off Brandon.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s jaw starts to grind and his eyes cut to me. \u201cCan I use the car?\u201d he grits out.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say.</p><p>Brandon immediately stomps off down the stairs, slamming the front door behind him, and I flop back on the bed and cover my face.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHe knows we\u2019re together,\u201d Mike says, and I know he knows, but it\u2019s one thing to know and another to find your mom in bed with a man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, but maybe we shouldn\u2019t have sleepovers anymore,\u201d I say through my hands. I feel the bed move. Then my hands are being pried away from my face.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I came over on a night when he was sleeping at a friend\u2019s so that I could take care of you while you were sick,\u201d he says softly, pushing my hair away from my face. \u201cThat being said, I have a feeling it wouldn\u2019t matter if he came home from college and found me in your bed. He would still be pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper, feeling tears fill my eyes.</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes go soft as he wipes my tears away with his thumbs. \u201cHe loves you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I repeat on a sob.</p><p>He rolls to his side pulling me with him. \u201cWhat time does he normally get home?\u201d he asks, and I try to bury my face deeper into his chest, not wanting to answer that. \u201cKat?\u201d</p><p>I take a shaky breath before tilting my head back and looking at him. \u201cI told him his curfew is ten on school nights and twelve on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme guess. He doesn\u2019t come home when he\u2019s supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I understand that you\u2019re trying to soften things up for him \u2018cause his dad left, but I think you\u2019re hurting more than you\u2019re helping at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d I close my eyes, shaking my head. My son is so angry. He\u2019s a good kid and I know that he loves me, but he has so much anger inside him that I can feel it when we\u2019re in the same room.</p><p>\u201cI do understand. I know how much trouble teenage boys can get into when left to do their own thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my kid and I can\u2019t tell you what to do or how to raise him, but he needs to have structure and discipline. He\u2019s not too old for you to get on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say because I do know. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he was expecting to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him we\u2019re together, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say immediately. \u201cHe stormed off, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it \u2018cause he always storms off when I try to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out together,\u201d he says, and my heart settles a little bit more. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks after a few minutes. His hand goes to my forehead and his eyes look me over.</p><p>\u201cI feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like you have a temp anymore. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually feel really great. I haven\u2019t slept that good in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d He kisses me then pulls away before sitting on the side of the bed and raising his arms above his head.</p><p>I watch, fascinated, as his back muscles bunch and expand.</p> <p>\u201cHow about a shower then breakfast?\u201d he asks, looking over his shoulder at me.</p><p>I lick my bottom lip and nod when his eyes darken slightly. He stands to come around to my side of the bed. I lie back as his upper body cages me. One hand goes to my hair while the other makes a fist in the bed near my head as his face lowers toward mine.</p><p>\u201cHow much better are you feeling, exactly?\u201d he asks, his nose running along mine.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d I put my hands to his chest. Even while lying down, I feel like I need to steady myself.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he rumbles, his hand in the bed going under me then traveling down my ass to the back of my thigh.</p><p>When I feel his hand on my bare skin, I squirm. When his hand travels farther up and his hand grabs on to my bare ass cheek, I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have on anything under your robe?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head no and his eyes turn even darker as they travel down my body, landing on the tie of the robe.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>MIKE</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine not having this, not having her. My eyes skim down her body to the robe, which is tied around her.</p><p>Last night, when Kat was in the shower, it almost killed me to go downstairs knowing that she was naked and soaking wet a few feet from me. I haven\u2019t even jerked off since she told me that she wanted more and left me stunned, still in my towel, at my house while I watched her drive off. I had known that I love her before she broke down, but I hadn\u2019t realized the extent of it or how much she had consumed me.</p><p>The night I saw her at the restaurant on her date, I was talking to Joe about her and working out with him what I needed to do. Things were not cut-and-dry. She has a teenage son. I didn\u2019t know why that scared me more than anything else. I love kids, but he is not a kid. Brandon is practically a man.</p><p>I also had my own baggage, things I needed to deal with. It pisses me off how much November\u2019s mother affected me, but she did. The things she did while she was pregnant and then when she took off with my kid have made me question every woman I\u2019ve come into contact with. Was it fair to loop all women into the category of lying, conniving bitches? No, but it is what it is. Now, I have a woman who has been honest to a fault since day one under me and I am going to find a way to deal with my insecurities so that we can have a future together.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re running a fever,\u201d I tell her, untying her robe.</p><p>She wiggles under me until her leg comes up to rest behind my thigh so she can pull me closer. I feel the heat of her pussy through the thin cotton of my boxers and groan, pulling her closer to me as I spread the robe open. My eyes travel down her body. She is really beautiful; everything about her appeals to me.</p><p>My head lowers and I kiss her, pulling her bottom lip into my mouth before releasing it, my mouth traveling down her jaw, to her neck, then down to her breast. I look up at her, our eyes meeting, as I pull one nipple into my mouth. I suck deep, and her whimper fills the room as I release it and kiss my way to her other breast. I pull it into my mouth, watching her eyes close and her back arch. Fuck, she\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Her legs pull me tighter, and I know what she wants. I pull down my boxers with one hand and wrap my hand around myself before running the head from her entrance to her clit then back down again. I place one last kiss on each nipple before leaning back to look at her.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my name leaving her mouth is enough to cause my balls to draw up. I watch as I enter her slowly, fighting myself against slamming into her. Her body lifts forward, her hands going to my ass, her nails digging into my skin.</p><p>\u201cFuck. So fucking tight,\u201d I groan, pulling out, feeling her muscles clamping down on me and try to pull me back in. \u201cI missed this.\u201d I lean over her completely. My feet are planted on the floor, her legs now wrapped around my hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispers, pulling my mouth down to hers.</p><p>I push my tongue into her mouth while one hand travels down to wrap around her hip, my thumb sliding over her clit. Her body bucks under me as her moans fill my mouth. I know I won\u2019t be able to hold out much longer. I haven\u2019t had this in so long and her slick, tight heat is only making it that much harder to hold back.</p><p>\u201cSo close,\u201d she breathes. Her hands move to her breasts, her fingers pulling hard on her nipples.</p><p>I lean back, pull her hips up higher, and start slamming into her hard. Her lower body is off the bed, only her shoulders left on the mattress. Looking down her body at my cock sliding in and out of her and at her tits bouncing with each thrust causes my balls to pull up tighter.</p> <p>\u201cSo wet. You feel like silk, so smooth and hot wrapped around my cock.\u201d Her lust-filled eyes meet mine and I can feel her get tighter around me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna come, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her teeth biting into her bottom lip. I lift my foot up onto the bed and spread her legs wider, pounding into her harder. Her cry and the convulsing of her pussy send me over. I plant myself deep and come hard. My head falls forward, my chest moving quickly. I lift my leg that has fallen asleep and lean forward, sliding my hands under her before pulling her up and then falling to my back with her on my chest without falling out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask after I get my breath back.</p><p>She nods against my chest, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cWe need to shower,\u201d I mumble, running my hands down her back.</p> <p>When she nods again, I feel her cheek move against my chest and I know she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou speechless?\u201d</p><p>She nods again, and I laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou called me Kitten.\u201d She giggles, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she whispers then lifts her head to look at me. Her eyes search my face for a long moment before she looks away and lays her head back on my chest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust happy,\u201d she says on a squeeze.</p><p>I kiss the top of her head. \u201cYou ready to shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nods, pressing a kiss to my chest before lifting her hips and pushing off the bed.</p><p>I watch her walk to the bathroom, mesmerized by the flare of her hips.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d she asks over her shoulder.</p><p>My eyes travel up her body to her face and I smile, getting off the bed following her into the shower.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come down to the station,\u201d James says as soon as I pick up the phone.</p> <p>I look at the clock and see that it\u2019s after two in the morning. I know Kat\u2019s at home. I talked to her at twelve. She was working on edits for a client. Then was going to get ready to go to bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask, grabbing my keys from the drawer. A couple of the girls who worked here would call if they\u2019d gotten in trouble, so it wasn\u2019t the first time I have been called away from work to help someone out.</p><p>\u201cBrandon was just brought in for drinking.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I look at the ceiling and pray for patience.</p><p>\u201cIs Kat there?\u201d I ask immediately.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s a good kid with a lot of anger he doesn\u2019t know what to do with, so he continues to act out without thinking about the consequences. It doesn\u2019t help that his dad is a piece of shit, forcing everything on Kat. My woman is strong, but at the end of the day, the kid needs his dad.</p><p>\u201cNo. He said he didn\u2019t want to call her, and since he isn\u2019t a minor anymore, my hands are tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Okay. I\u2019m on my way,\u201d I tell him before hanging up. When I make it to the front of the club, I find my brother sitting at the bar, going over an order list. \u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asks, standing and following me out of the club.</p><p>\u201cBrandon\u2019s at the station with James,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes change from curious to concern. \u201cWha\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was drunk.\u201d I shake my head, unlocking my car.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call Kathleen?\u201d Joe asks.</p><p>I pause, thinking about it before answering. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll see her when I drop him at home,\u201d I tell him, getting in the car.</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me,\u201d he says, stepping away from the car.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d I mumble, slamming the door closed.</p><p>I do not want to be in the middle of this, but Kat has been dealing with her son on her own for too long and the kid has been pushing her around, using what happened with his dad as an excuse to be a pain in the ass. So if he wants to call me thinking that, as his mom\u2019s man, I\u2019m gonna ease the blow \u2018cause I wanna be on his good side, he has another thing coming.</p><p>By the time I get to the precinct, I\u2019m pissed. When I walk into the building, I can hear someone singing \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d in a loud tone. I know right away that it\u2019s Brandon, and I immediately wonder how much he\u2019s had to drink and if he was driving drunk. I walk down into the bullpen and see James talking to another officer.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d James says as soon as he spots me.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d I ask, \u2018cause if this kid was driving drunk, he is going to learn a hard lesson. His ass will be staying in jail at least until morning\u2014if not longer.</p><p>\u201cHim and a couple other boys were drinking in the parking lot of the high school.\u201d He looks across the station when the singing stops and the sound of someone getting sick can be heard. \u201cWhen Braxton pulled up, the other boys ran off. Brandon stayed put and cooperated.\u201d He pauses again when the sound of singing picks up once again. \u201cI don\u2019t know this kid well, but from what people say, he\u2019s a good boy.\u201d His arms cross over his chest and his hip leans against his desk.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad kid. He\u2019s angry and acting out but not a bad kid,\u201d I confirm.</p><p>\u201cBraxton told me that he stopped Brandon a week ago for driving recklessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Kathleen know about that?\u201d I ask, She never mentioned it to me and I couldn\u2019t picture her not mentioning it at least in passing.</p><p>\u201cBraxton let him off with a warning.\u201d James shakes his head. \u201cBrandon told him that he was just messing around. He didn\u2019t have anyone in the car with him and he was in a deserted parking lot, so no one was in any danger. But when he picked him up tonight, he knew that he needed to bring him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mumbled, rubbing the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cHe was rambling about his dad earlier.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHis dad\u2019s a piece of work.\u201d I sigh and sit down in one of the chairs, dropping my head towards my lap.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to step in. He needs a role model in his life,\u201d James says.</p><p>I lift my eyes to his. \u201cI own a strip club. I can\u2019t exactly take him there to hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat teenage boy doesn\u2019t like women?\u201d James asks, looking at me with a smile twitching his lips.</p> <p>Braxton laughs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a good role model.\u201d I\u2019ve never thought about how my owning a strip club would affect any relationship I had. Luckily for me, Kat doesn\u2019t have a problem with what I do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I think it is a normal occupation for someone with a family.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re there. Your club\u2019s clean. I\u2019m not saying that he needs to be there. Honestly, I just think he needs something he needs a man in his life that he can look up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure my woman would approve of me taking her kid to the strip club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dating his mom?\u201d James asks with a tilt of his head, making me notice for the first time how much his boys take after him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou serious about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think you need to figure out how to be what this kid needs so you can be the man your woman needs as well. I\u2019ve seen it happen too many times. Young man, no one to turn to, starts acting out, ends up in trouble that he can\u2019t get out of. I don\u2019t want that for you or Kathleen.\u201d</p><p>I let his words sink in and know I need to do something. I just need to figure out exactly what my role would be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d I tell him.</p> <p>\u201cFigured you would,\u201d James mumbles, taking his eyes off me and looking over at Braxton. \u201cYou wanna bring him out?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Braxton says, getting up from behind the desk and heading towards the back of the station.</p><p>A minute later, Brandon stumbles around the corner with Braxton and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cMike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, what day is it?\u201d Brandon says as soon as our eyes meet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say, ignoring him and grabbing his arm.</p><p>\u201cHow can someone who owns a strip club be so lame?\u201d he asks, leaning his weight against me.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to help you get him into your car?\u201d James asks, holding open the door to the station.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good. I\u2019ll call you later. We need to figure out when we\u2019re doing our fishing trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanna go on a fishing trip,\u201d Brandon mutters as I lead him out to my car.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I ask, surprised. I haven\u2019t even thought about taking him because he has never seemed like he wants to even be in the same room I\u2019m in let alone to go away for a few days on a trip.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was supposed to take me on a trip for graduation, but he told me we can\u2019t go \u2018cause his new kid needs braces,\u201d he says and his eyes draw together like he\u2019s trying to remember something. \u201cMy dad\u2019s a piece of shit,\u201d he slurs out.</p><p>\u201cYour right about that,\u201d I mutter in agreement while helping him into my car.</p><p>Once I see that he\u2019s buckled in, I shut his door, walk around to the driver\u2019s side door, and open it.</p><p>\u201cWe may have to schedule the fishing trip sooner rather than later!\u201d I yell over the roof of my car at James, who is standing in the door of the station.</p><p>His eyes go from me to the passenger\u2019s side of my car and he nods.</p><p>I get in and slam the door. Hearing Brandon talk about his father makes me realize what he has been missing. I have a good dad. Even when he and my mother split, I knew I could depend on him. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a young man without a father to depend on. And it pisses me off that this kid wants to have a relationship with his dad and his father is too blind to understand that he\u2019s lucky enough to have the opportunity to know his son, to watch him grow, to help shape the type of man he\u2019ll be.</p><p>\u201cMy mom loves you,\u201d Brandon mumbles, rolling his head against the headrest to look at me. \u201cYou hurt her, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he says as I pull out onto the highway towards home.</p><p>A smile twitches my lips, and I nod before answering. \u201cI love her too, and I won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he mutters before rolling down the window, sticking his head outside, and getting sick all over the side of my car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re washing my car tomorrow,\u201d I tell him, trying not to laugh as he gags harder.</p><p>This scenario is familiar. I remember calling my mom to come pick me up when I had drunk too much in high school. The next day, I had to wash the inside and outside of my mom\u2019s car. She told me that it was part of my punishment and it worked. I learned my limit quickly.</p><p>As soon as we pull up in front of Kat\u2019s house, Brandon opens his door and falls out of the car onto the street. I get out, walk around to his side, and help him untangle his foot from where it somehow got stuck on the seatbelt before assisting him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good guy, Mike,\u201d he says, patting my chest as he leans into me.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re not drunk, we\u2019re gonna sit down and have a talk,\u201d I tell him, walking up to the front door and pulling out my key.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you have a key. It is serious,\u201d he says, his body almost pulling me down with him.</p><p>As I unlock the door and push it open, he leans over and vomits all over the porch. I hold him up, trying to help him over to the grass. The poor kid is going to have one hell of a hangover tomorrow, and cleaning up puke isn\u2019t going to help.</p><p>\u201cMike? Brandon?\u201d</p><p>I turn slightly to look at Kat, who is standing in the doorway wearing nothing but a robe.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Oh my God. Is he drunk?\u201d she asks, starting to step outside.</p><p>I turn towards her, taking one hand off Brandon, placing it in her stomach, and pushing her back inside. \u201cHe got sick out here, baby,\u201d I tell her, and she nods, looking at her son.</p><p>\u201cI thought that, when we moved, you wouldn\u2019t do this anymore, Brandon,\u201d she says.</p><p>I can see the worry in her eyes, and I understand it, but I also understand why her son is acting out right now. Brandon stands up and leans his body weight completely on me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him into bed. Tomorrow, we\u2019re all gonna sit down and have a talk,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She looks ever more worried. The urge to comfort her almost strangles me, but I need to deal with her son first. Then I can talk to her and hopefully make her understand what\u2019s going on and what this kid really needs. She can\u2019t continue to act like his behavior is normal. It\u2019s not fair to her son or her. Without saying anything else, I follow her into the house and up the stairs towards Brandon\u2019s room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to shower or you want to sleep?\u201d I ask Brandon, who is now moving more quickly to his room.</p><p>He lifts his head slightly and looks at me. \u201cI just want to sleep,\u201d he mutters, falling back onto his bed.</p><p>I find his garbage can and put it next to him. Then I make sure that he\u2019s on his side before I pull his shoes off and cover him up. Kat comes in with a cup full of green liquid and holds it to his mouth. He rinses his mouth then leans over to spit in the trash can before lying back again.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mom,\u201d he says, closing his eyes.</p> <p>Kat sits down next to him on the bed, pushing his hair away from his forehead and pressing a kiss there, muttering, \u201cI know you do,\u201d softly before pulling away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>I see her body sag. I step towards her, putting a hand to her back.</p><p>\u201cThis is not okay, Brandon. I love you more than life, but this is not okay.\u201d The pain in her voice is obvious and I know she\u2019s close to tears.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s eyes open and he looks at his mom. The look in his eyes is so bleak that I want to track down his father and kill him for doing that to his son and the woman he was supposed to love.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeats, and I don\u2019t even know if he knows what he\u2019s apologizing for.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow. I\u2019m going to leave your door open so I can hear you if you need me,\u201d she tells him, leaning in again and kissing is forehead.</p><p>We both head out of his room then down the stairs. I pull off my jacket and toss it onto one of the chairs in the living room before going to the kitchen and grabbing a beer.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>MIKE</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d Kat asks.</p> <p>I turn to face her and see that she has her arms wrapped around her waist and her eyes have become full of worry. \u201cJames called me and told me that Brandon asked him to call me to come pick him up after he was arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was hoping that he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble if he called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d I say softly, running a finger down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m your boyfriend. My guess is he thought I would pick him up and ease the blow with you to try and get on his good side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to do this before we moved. This was one of the reasons we moved to begin with. He was always hanging out with the wrong crowd. He would come home late or not at all. Sometimes, he would show up drunk or high. I tried to talk to him, but nothing was working. Then I decided to move here. I loved growing up here and figured that it was probably a safe place to raise my son.\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath, letting her hands drop to her side. \u201cWhen we first moved into town, he was okay. He was doing good in school and not giving me any problems. Then, a few months ago, right after his birthday, something happened and he stopped listening. He started getting angry easier and our relationship, which had started to repair, went downhill fast.\u201d She looks away when I see tears begin to fill her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with him. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so angry. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s mad at me or how to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that whatever happened has to do with his dad more than it has to do with you,\u201d I say, and her eyes come back to me. \u201cDid you know that his dad told him that he couldn\u2019t take him on a graduation trip because his girlfriend\u2019s kid needs braces?\u201d I ask, watching her body still and her face contort with anger.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I nod and take a drink from my beer. \u201cI talked to James, and what he said along with what Brandon said got me thinking,\u201d I say, pulling her into me by the rope of her robe. \u201cI think that Brandon needs some male bonding time. Every year, me and the Mayson\u2019s go out on the lake for a few days, and I\u2019m gonna take Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she whispers, leaning into me. Her eyes go soft, and I lean in and press my mouth to hers.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be good for him and I to get to know each other better. I also think it would be good for him to have someone to look up to. Asher, Trevor, Cash, and Nico are not too much older than him. I know that I don\u2019t have a conventional job and I\u2019m not much of a role model, but I think that the other guys will be a good influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, when I first found out that you owned a strip club, I was a little put off,\u201d she says.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow because a little put off is a huge understatement.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I was a lot put off,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cBut now I know to you. It\u2019s your business and nothing more. You would also be a good influence on him. You\u2019re a hard worker, you love your child and grandchildren, and you take care of the people you care about. I think all of those things are the qualities of a good man.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightens \u2018cause those are not things I would have thought of. I know that a lot of people look at me and my club and say that I\u2019m taking advantage of the women who work for me and I only see women as sex objects, but in my club, the women are safe. They are treated with respect. Most of them are students or mothers just trying to make a better life for themselves or their families. If I knew that the women who worked for me would be able to find somewhere else to work that had the same kind of environment, I would have closed the doors to Teasers after November moved home.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that I should call his dad and tell him that his son needs him?\u201d she asks, bringing me back to the moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need him,\u201d Brandon says, swaying into the kitchen. \u201cHe has never wanted to be a part of my life\u2014even when you were married to him. He didn\u2019t want to be a dad to me, so I don\u2019t need him or want him in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom. Fuck him,\u201d he growls, opening the door to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d I say.</p><p>Brandon looks at me over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad,\u201d he states, holding my eyes.</p><p>Mine narrow on him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. If I was your father, your ass would be handed to you for the stress you\u2019re putting your mom through. I\u2019m not your dad, but I\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou feelin\u2019 better?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shrugs, which only pisses me off further.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up and you don\u2019t seem as drunk as you were, so take the hose and go wash off my car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, looking from me to his mom.</p><p>\u201cGo rinse off the vomit from the side of my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s, like, midnight or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d he says, looking at his mom again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me for help. And when you come in, we need to talk about your punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says, stomping out of the kitchen, the sound of the door slamming shut echoing through the house.</p><p>\u201cThat went well,\u201d Kat says then looks at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy son doesn\u2019t agree to do stuff he doesn\u2019t want to do. You have to understand that, as much as he\u2019s mad right now, he respects you enough to go outside in the middle of the night to clean off your car because you told him to do it. That\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re reading to much into that, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and takes the beer from my hand before putting it to her mouth and taking a drink. \u201cRegardless, thank you for picking him up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I tell her, kissing her head.</p><p>After about fifteen minutes, the front door opens then shuts and Brandon comes into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow long am I grounded for?\u201d he asks his mom, and an idea comes to me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna come work for me,\u201d I say.</p><p>Kat and Brandon both say, \u201cWhat?\u201d at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNovember has been trying to transfer all the stuff from my office to her home office. You\u2019re gonna help her get everything organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to work at a strip club?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Kat\u2019s mouth has opened and closed a few times, but she still hasn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>I look from her to Brandon and shake my head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not working at the strip club. You\u2019re going to help November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk about this,\u201d Kat says.</p><p>My eyes go to her and then back to Brandon. When Brandon\u2019s eyes come back to me, something flashes in them before he looks at his mom.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to get a job anyways, so I think this would be a good opportunity for me,\u201d he tells his mom.</p><p>I give Kat\u2019s waist a squeeze then look at Brandon. He needs something, and though I may not be the best person to give him what he needs, I want him to be successful and I want to heal the rift between him and his mom. I just hope I don\u2019t make shit worse.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you\u2019re still grounded. You can use the car for school and work, but no hanging out with friends for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d he asks, stunned. Then he looks at me like I should help him out.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to remind you that you were picked up by the cops for underage drinking? If you were anyone else, you would have spent the night in jail and had to go in front of the judge in the morning. You\u2019re lucky that this is your punishment,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Kat leans slightly back into me. \u201cA month, Brandon. If you mess up during the month, another month gets added,\u201d she says.</p><p>Brandon looks at her and nods.</p><p>\u201cI love you, honey. I know that you\u2019re mad about your dad and what happened, but I love you and I want you to be a better man than he is, and right now I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d Kat says softly.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s body loosens completely. He nods again, and Kat steps out of my hold and gives him a hug.</p><p>\u201cWant a beer?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s face lights up and his hand goes forward to take the beer when Nico snatches the beer from Asher and opens it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, kid. You need to get some hair on your chest. Then you can have a beer,\u201d Trevor says, handing Brandon a soda, smirking.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Brandon grumbles, sitting back in his chair and taking a drink of his soda before looking around the campsite.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a month since I picked up Brandon from the station. He has made a lot of changes since then. He is home more often than not or he is hanging out with me, Joe, or one of the Maysons. His grades have improved, and his and Kat\u2019s relationship has done a complete one-eighty. Not only has he been helping November, but he has also shown a great interest in the club and improving it. I know nothing about social media, but the kid is a damn wiz and he has helped build clientele online with Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Joe is completely impressed with the damn kid, and I have to say I\u2019m proud as hell of him.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is the girl you were hanging around the other day?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>I look at Brandon and then Nico and raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Brandon mumbles, glaring at Nico.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look like no one to me, kid. You were making goo-goo eyes at her.\u201d</p><p>Brandon glares harder. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Nico,\u201d Cash says and smiles at Brandon. \u201cThat\u2019s his study partner, right?\u201d Cash asks, looking at Brandon.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s eyes narrow even further. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend,\u201d he grits out.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s this?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no one. Just a friend from school,\u201d Brandon says.</p><p>\u201cFriend... Hmmm,\u201d Trevor says.</p><p>Brandon glares at him. \u201cShe is a friend,\u201d he says.</p><p>Trevor gets a strange smile on his face. \u201cLiz is my best friend,\u201d he says, which makes me chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Brandon says, laughing, and the rest of the guys laugh too.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we going to go fishing or sit around all day gossiping?\u201d James asks, walking up to the group with his fishing pole.</p><p>\u201cCome with me for a second, bud,\u201d I tell Brandon.</p><p>He follows me to the back of Asher\u2019s Jeep, where we have all our stuff stowed. When I open the hatch, I pull out the gift I got for him and hand it to him. His eyes go from me to the box then back again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He pulls off the paper his mom insisted I wrap it in last night and his eyes go from his new pole to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good one,\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard and nods.</p><p>\u201cYour mom insisted on wrapping it even though I told her not to,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His lips twitch and he looks at me again. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod, patting him on the back. I fell in love with Kat a long time ago, but I have slowly fallen in love with her son over the last month.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to help you set it up?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He nods again, pulling it completely from the box. We spend the next ten minutes getting his new trigger pole ready to use. Once it\u2019s completely set up, I grab my pole and the tackle box I brought and head out to the boat we launched into the water when we arrived at the lake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once we all get in the boat, we head out into the middle of the lake, where the water is deeper and the fish radar is showing a school of fish below. We all cast off into the water and settle in for the day.</p><p>My dad used to bring my brother and me to this same lake when I was growing up. Most of our summers were spent out on the water. I have a lot of good memories here, and it feels good to share this place with Brandon. It makes me feel closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI think you got something, bud,\u201d I tell Brandon as I watch the end of his pole bend slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asks, looking from the pole to me.</p> <p>\u201cWatch the point of your pole,\u201d I tell him, and his eyes move to the pole. The end moves again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I look around the boat and see that everyone is focused on Brandon and me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna give your pole a tug. If something is on there, you want to make sure that it\u2019s hooked good and tight. Then you\u2019re gonna start reeling it in,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He nods then does as I said, giving the pole a firm tug before reeling in the line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d he says, his body and arms flexing as he fights against the fish that is determined to get away.</p> <p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d I tell him, standing at his side, coaching him the whole time\u2014letting him know when to release some and when to bring the line in.</p><p>It takes a good half hour to get the fish to the top, and I\u2019m surprised to see a giant bass break the surface of the water.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Asher says, leaning over the side of the boat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one big fish!\u201d Nico laughs and Brandon smiles looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cGet the net,\u201d Cash tells Trevor.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, Kid,\u201d Trevor tells Brandon, leaning into the water to help Asher scoop out the fish.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you caught dinner,\u201d James says.</p><p>The smile that was on Brandon\u2019s face disappears in an instant. \u201cYou mean we\u2019re going to eat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to eat it!\u201d Asher smiles bringing the fish onto the boat.</p><p>\u201cI never agreed to eating fish. Didn\u2019t we bring hot dogs or something?\u201d Brandon asks, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cThis is like the Wild West, Kid. You live off what you catch,\u201d Trevor tells Brandon, and all the boys laugh when Brandon shudders.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, bud,\u201d I say, bringing Brandon\u2019s attention to me. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was cool,\u201d he says. Then he looks back at the fish then to me again. \u201cAre you sure we don\u2019t have hot dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have a pack in the cooler,\u201d I tell him, squeezing his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he mumbles under his breath, making James and me laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, what college are you going to?\u201d Cash asks Brandon. We just finished dinner and are now all sitting around the bonfire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I may stay local and just do some business classes,\u201d Brandon tells him then looks over at me. \u201cJoe said that, if I worked hard and proved to you both, he would talk to you about me managing Teasers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d I say. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that my brother would say something like that. I know he has been thinking about stepping back from the club just like I have.</p><p>\u201cWell, he said that you guys are old,\u201d Brandon says with a smile, making me smile into the beer I just brought to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just turn eighteen?\u201d Cash asks, and Brandon nods. \u201cYou think you can run a strip club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can. I know I can,\u201d Brandon says, and pride fills my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a kid,\u201d Nico says.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does when there are naked women around,\u201d Trevor says.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you tryin\u2019 to say that Mike sleeps with the women who work at the club?\u201d Brandon asks. \u201cOr that Joe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Trevor says, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, why would you think that I would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turned eighteen,\u201d Cash repeats.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he could do it,\u201d I say.</p><p>All eyes come to me.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way. Joe and I opened teasers when we were in our twenties. I have never slept with or even touched one of the women who work for me nor do I want to. It\u2019s a job and nothing more. I think that, if he went to school, got some business classes or management classes under his belt, he could do good by the club and the girls. I know that he is young, but if he continues down the road he is on now, he will do amazing things one day,\u201d I say and turn to look at Brandon. \u201cIf you prove to me and Joe that you really want to run the club one day, I would be honored to hand the reins over to you.\u201d</p><p>I watch as his eyes go soft and a look I often see from his mom appears on his face before he looks away. I now know that I will do anything in my power to make sure he succeeds in whatever he chooses for his life and fully understands what my mom said to me when I told her that I wanted to own a strip club.</p><p>\u201cAll I have ever wanted was for you to be happy, son. So if this is what makes you happy and is a reason for you to get out of bed every day, then who am I judge it?\u201d</p><p>From that moment on, my mom was my biggest ally, and I know that I will be that for Brandon.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Brandon says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think Brandon would feel about you guys living with me?\u201d I ask Kat.</p><p>We have been going strong for a few months. Most mornings, when I get off work, I just come straight to Kat\u2019s. Even if I\u2019m just going to be sleeping, I like knowing that Kat is in the next room. I can\u2019t stand being away from her. The idea of her moving in with me has been floating around in my head for some time now. Her townhouse is nice, but my house is nicer. I also have more space. Brandon wouldn\u2019t feel like we are living on top of him like he does now. I remember what it\u2019s like to be a teenage boy, and no way would I want my mom\u2019s room next to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou want us to move in with you?\u201d Kat asks, her already large eyes getting larger.</p><p>\u201cWe basically live together now. I just figured we should make it official.\u201d I shrug like it\u2019s not a big deal even though my gut is twisting and my heart rate has sped up.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say immediately.</p><p>This is the next step for us. At this point, we\u2019re just putting off the inevitable. We spend all of our free time together and I never go home to my place anymore when I get off work unless there is something I need to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI...\u201d She pauses, looking around her place. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel good about moving Brandon. Not right now in the middle of the school year.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I didn\u2019t even think about that. \u201cOkay, so we wait and I\u2019ll move in here until the school year\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving with you isn\u2019t a hardship.\u201d I smile, crowding her against the counter in the kitchen. \u201cSleeping next to you.\u201d I nip her neck. \u201cWaking up with you.\u201d I kiss her lips.</p> <p>\u201cSo then, I guess we just need to sit down and talk to Brandon about it?\u201d she whispers against my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou want both of us to talk to him or do you want to do it on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should talk to him first,\u201d she mumbles, looking down at her fingers that are now playing with the buttons of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d I ask, tilting her head back so I can see her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean... I don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s been so good lately that I\u2019m nervous about messing that up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, if we have to keep things the way they are right now, I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I kiss her on the mouth just as the front door is opens.</p><p>\u201cMom, Mike, I\u2019m home!\u201d Brandon yells.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna head home and you call me when you\u2019re done talking with him,\u201d I tell her, kissing her once more.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Brandon says when he walks into the kitchen. His eyes go from his mom to me then back again.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d Kat asks him as he opens the fridge door.</p> <p>\u201cSchool,\u201d he mumbles, pulling up his pants.</p><p>I don\u2019t even understand why he\u2019s wearing a belt when his pants are hanging off his ass anyways. I look at Kat, who blows out a long breath, looking at her son.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna head out,\u201d I say.</p><p>Kat pulls her eyes from Brandon\u2019s back before looking at me. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d I tell Brandon. I know he is supposed to be meeting me at the club in a few hours. Joe has some questions for him and wants to have a sit-down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna grab some food then change. I\u2019ll see you in a while,\u201d he mutters, not pulling his head from the fridge.</p><p>Kat squeezes my hand, and I follow her out of the kitchen to the front door.</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me.\u201d I lean in and kiss her forehead then lips.</p> <p>She nods when I pull away, and I can tell she\u2019s worried about talking to him about us.</p><p>\u201cLook, if he\u2019s not okay with us moving in together, I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s moving in?\u201d Brandon says from behind us.</p><p>Kat whispers, \u201cShit,\u201d under her breath before turning her head to look over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf Mike\u2019s moving in, then I want to move to his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kat asks, looking at him.</p><p>\u201cHis place is bigger.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cCan I have the downstairs apartment?\u201d he asks, taking a drink of his Coke and looking at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to your mom,\u201d I say, looking at Kat.</p><p>\u201cI... Well... I guess that\u2019s something we will have to talk about,\u201d Kat says, stunned.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he mumbles before walking up the stairs. \u201cI have to head out to meet Asher before going to the club. Is it okay if I use the car?\u201d he asks from the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSure, honey,\u201d Kat tells him then looks at me when he is out of sight. \u201cOkay, so that was weird.\u201d</p><p>I put an arm around her waist and pull her closer to me. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re moving in,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She looks from where Brandon just disappeared to me. \u201cWe are.\u201d She smiles.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>KAT</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your day like?\u201d Mike asks, crawling into bed next to me.</p><p>I close up my computer then look over at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower. I have to go to the school to meet with Brandon\u2019s teachers. Then I have a doctor appointment at two,\u201d I tell him, smiling when he pulls me closer to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to go to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a checkup.\u201d I shrug like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m going through menopause. I hate getting old or older. It\u2019s not something you want to admit is happening when it\u2019s happening, but I can no longer pretend like I\u2019m not going through the change.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I say, laying my head on his chest so that he can\u2019t read my face and figure out that I\u2019m lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brandon?\u201d he asks after a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cHis guidance counselor wants to meet about college.\u201d</p><p>He nods then leans back looking up at the celling.</p><p>I continue. \u201cI know that he is adamant about not wanting to go away for college, but I really want him to hear all the choices before making a decision.</p><p>\u201cWant me to come with you?\u201d he tilts my face back to look at me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head while fighting a smile. I love him so much, and knowing that he cares about my son only makes that love grow even deeper.</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind, let me know. I\u2019m going to sleep while you shower,\u201d he says sleepily.</p><p>As much as I want to lie in bed with him, I know that, if I stay, he won\u2019t sleep. Since we\u2019ve moved in, it has been getting harder and harder for him to go to the club in the evenings, and when he gets home in the morning, it\u2019s hard for me to leave him in bed alone.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest and I\u2019ll see you when I get home.\u201d I kiss his jaw then roll out of bed and hurry to the bathroom without looking at him. I know that, if I see him in bed, I won\u2019t be able to help climbing back in with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant, Miss Mullings,\u201d the doctor says, stepping back into the room.</p><p>I look at him then shake my head. \u201cThere has to be a mistake,\u201d I say, trying to see the papers he\u2019s holding. \u201cI\u2019m going through menopause,\u201d I say, feeling another hot flash as soon as I say the word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re too young. Normally, women go though menopause in their early fifties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old to be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re healthy. You\u2019re not overweight. You don\u2019t smoke. Your blood pressure and vitals are all perfect. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d He smiles. He obviously has no idea what he\u2019s talking about, because Mike is going to freak out. \u201cYou\u2019re approximately eleven weeks along. We will need to keep a closer eye on you, but I expect things to go well. We will do an internal ultrasound to make sure that everything looks right, but I\u2019m guessing, with your hormone levels, that everything is fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I mumble. I have no idea what else to say. My brain has shut down.</p><p>I stay silent though the procedure. Even when I hear the heartbeat and see the little baby on the screen, it still doesn\u2019t feel real. When everything is done and I have discussed with the doctor what I should expect, I\u2019m still in a daze. Then I wait for him to fill my prescription for prenatal vitamins before following him out to the front desk, where I make another appointment.</p><p>After my meeting at Brandon\u2019s school, all I wanted was a large glass of wine\u2014now, I wanted the whole bottle.</p><p>I shake my head and head out to my car. I have no idea how I\u2019m going to tell Mike this news. Things have just settled with us. We\u2019re at a good place in our relationship. I know that he didn\u2019t want a relationship after what had happened with November\u2019s mother, but I didn\u2019t know if he ever thought about having more kids.</p> <p>A million thoughts race through my mind and I feel my stomach bubble with anxiety when I pull up in front of the house and see Mike\u2019s car as well as his mom\u2019s. I sit in silence for a few minutes, working up the courage to go inside. When I finally make it up to the front door, the sound of a little girl laughing greats me from the other side, and I take a deep breath before walking inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d Mike says when he spots me standing in the hall watching him. He\u2019s sitting on the floor in the living room wearing one of his many band tees with a pair of jeans. June is standing between his spread legs, holding on to his fingers. \u201cHow was everything?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look from June\u2019s sweet face to Mike\u2019s and take a deep breath. \u201cIt was good,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes draw together. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, smiling when his mom walks into the room.</p> <p>\u201cHey, girly,\u201d Emma, Mike\u2019s mom, says, walking across the room to me.</p><p>I meet her in the middle and give her a hug. My parents both live in Oklahoma, so having Mike\u2019s mom here in town along with the Maysons has made being away from family much easier.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my boy at?\u201d she asks as the front door opens and Brandon walks in.</p><p>\u201cGran,\u201d Brandon says, giving her a hug. Then his eyes go to the floor where June is.</p><p>The moment June sees him, she starts gurgling and bouncing. She and July both love Brandon, and he loves both the girls.</p><p>\u201cJune bug,\u201d he says, getting down on his knees and holding out his hands.</p> <p>June has been trying to learn to walk for a few weeks now. The farthest she has gotten when I have been around is two steps before giving up and crawling.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Brandon says, holding out his hands, and June immediately lets go of Mike\u2019s fingers and walks four steps to Brandon before falling into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re getting so good,\u201d he says, standing with her in his arms.</p><p>She laughs, looking into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay, baby?\u201d Mike asks, coming to stand next to me.</p><p>I nod and lean into his side, and his mom smiles at us then looks at Brandon with June. She laughs when June grabs Brandon\u2019s hair and pulls his face closer so she can gnaw on his chin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really great with kids,\u201d Mike\u2019s mom says. Then she looks at me and smiles. \u201cSo, do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?\u201d</p><p>I immediately shake my head no and start thinking of something I need to do this weekend. Shopping with Emma is like pulling teeth. I don\u2019t even know why she calls it shopping when we\u2019re never in the store for more than a few minutes. I think she was happier than anyone in the world when online shopping was invented.</p><p>\u201cI think Susan needs my help this weekend getting ready for the Halloween party that they are putting on downtown,\u201d I answer.</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll call and see if she and November would like to go with us to pick up some stuff in Nashville. Then we can head over to the local warehouse store and pick up the stuff for the Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that would be nice,\u201d I tell her and feel Mike\u2019s body shaking behind me.</p><p>He knows that his daughter and I both hate shopping with his mom. November was actually the one to warn me about shopping with her grandma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take June home before it gets too late,\u201d Emma says.</p><p>At the sound of her name, June turns her head in our direction, and when she sees me, she gets a huge smile on her face and holds out her hands towards me. I step away from Mike and take her from Brandon, and she immediately snuggles into my chest.</p><p>\u201cHi, June Bug,\u201d I say, rubbing my cheek over the top of her head.</p><p>The smell of her and feel of her in my arms causes me to tear up. Thinking about having this feeling while holding Mike\u2019s and my child in a few months is absolutely crazy. I lift my eyes and look at Mike\u2014his eyes are pulled together like he\u2019s trying to figure something out. I smile and he smiles back, but I can still see the concern in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to come back for dinner?\u201d I ask Emma.</p><p>She shakes her head no, running a hand over the top of June\u2019s head. \u201cI have to go help November out tonight with the girls because Asher has some job he\u2019s working on and won\u2019t be home until late, and November is pregnant again, so Asher is on edge with leaving her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper in shock.</p><p>\u201cOh crap. There I go again, letting the cat out of the bag,\u201d she says, looking between Mike and me.</p><p>I can honestly say that I\u2019m not even a little surprised that Asher and November are pregnant again. I know that they both wanted to have their children young and that Asher really wants a boy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything until they announce it,\u201d Emma mumbles, walking over to the couch, where she grabs the diaper bag and June\u2019s sweater.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I hear Mike mumble.</p><p>Brandon laughs. I just stand there silently watching Emma gather all of June\u2019s belongings while trying to understand what I\u2019m feeling. I will be pregnant at the same time that my boyfriend\u2019s daughter is pregnant. How in the world does that even happen? How awkward was it going to be when we both show up places at the same time?</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Mom?\u201d Brandon asks.</p><p>I look at my son and do the only thing I can at this moment\u2014I plaster a fake smile on my face. \u201cJust great. So, what are you doing tonight?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He narrows his eyes but answers anyway. \u201cI\u2019m going to help a friend study for a test we have coming up in history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat friend is that?\u201d I ask because he hasn\u2019t been hanging out with any of his old friends lately. If he\u2019s not working, he\u2019s at school or at home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust a girl from class,\u201d he says.</p><p>Mike coughs behind me, so I swing my head to look at him before looking back at Brandon.</p><p>\u201cA girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl that is my friend, yes.\u201d He smiles.</p> <p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes at me. \u201cNo, Mom.\u201d He sighs.</p><p>\u201cWill you be home for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think were going to get something from the diner,\u201d he says and his cheeks brighten slightly, making me wonder who this girl is. \u201cI have to go change. I\u2019ll be home by ten at the latest.\u201d He kisses the side June\u2019s head and then mine before disappearing downstairs to his room.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who she is?\u201d I ask Mike after a few moments.</p> <p>\u201cNope, and if I did, I wouldn\u2019t tell you anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d I ask, feeling my eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cNope. Dude code, baby. We don\u2019t gossip with women about women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t gossip with women about women, but you gossip about women to men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you call it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExchanging valuable information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...gossiping,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He smiles, leans in, and kisses me once.</p><p>\u201cAll right, June Bug. Come to Great-Grandma so Grandma and Grandpa can get some alone time,\u201d Emma says.</p><p>I almost blurt out, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d because I never thought that I was a grandma and I definitely never thought I would be a pregnant grandma. A grandma pregnant by a grandpa. Could my life get any more ridiculous?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna help Mom get her in the car,\u201d Mike says, so I kiss June one more time before passing her over to her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI will call and let you know what November and Susan say about our shopping trip,\u201d Emma says, following Mike out the door.</p><p>\u201cJust let me know,\u201d I mutter, hoping that November is quick on her feet.</p> <p>\u201cBe back in a second,\u201d Mike says.</p><p>I watch him carry June to the car and put her in the car seat before kissing his mom\u2019s cheek and coming back up the stairs to me, where we both watch his mom drive away.</p><p>\u201cNow will you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mike asks as soon as the front door is closed.</p><p>I turn to look at him. I want to tell him that I\u2019m pregnant, but the words are stuck in the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I mumble and head for the kitchen, where I pull out the chicken breast I left to marinate in olive oil and a ranch dressing packet this morning.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like nothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d he says, watching me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I repeat as I start up the oven and place the chicken on a baking pan, before going into the pantry and getting a few potatoes to peel.</p><p>He comes over to where I\u2019m standing at the sink and takes the potato peeler from my hand. Then he sets it on the counter next to the sink before turning me around to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at the school?\u201d he asks.</p><p>It takes a second for the question to register before I respond. \u201cNothing. Brandon has raised his GPA and the guidance counselor believes that he could get into pretty much any school he wants to,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so if it\u2019s not Brandon, then what happened at your appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say then sigh when his eyes narrow. \u201cOkay, promise you won\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I say when I realize that he\u2019s not going to give up or promise me that he won\u2019t freak out.</p><p>His body stills and his face goes blank immediately. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispers so quietly that I more read his lips then hear the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I repeat. I\u2019m completely shocked that the words are coming out of my mouth.</p><p>I know a few women who waited until later in life to have children. I never thought that I would be having another child. I was sure that I wasn\u2019t even able to. When I was with my husband, we never used anything to prevent pregnancy. It just never happened. Plus, breast cancer runs in my family and my doctor advised against the pill.</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Mike mumbles.</p><p>I close my eyes and drop my head. \u201cUnprotected sex and stupidity,\u201d I answer, opening my eyes and looking at him.</p><p>His eyes roam over me then land on my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even say anything\u2014I just walk to my bag, pull out the internal ultrasound pictures, and hand them to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he says, looking at the picture.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks eleven weeks,\u201d I say quietly, closely watching his face.</p><p>\u201cDo you...\u201d He stops to look at me and I see his Adam\u2019s apple bob as he swallows. \u201cDo you want to keep it?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Through all of this, I haven\u2019t even thought about not keeping him or her. I nod then bite my lip to keep from crying.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I don\u2019t even know what to say about this,\u201d he says, looking back down at the pictures.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d he asks, looking at me again.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor assured me that the baby and me should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are risks at my age, but he says they are minimal considering how healthy I am.\u201d</p><p>His body relaxes and his hands pull me closer as he shoves his face into my neck. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death but happy as hell,\u201d he says against my neck.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, pushing my fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a few days for this to sink in.\u201d</p><p>I smile as he kisses my neck before he pulls away and puts his hands on either side of my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he says, and I nod. \u201cWith my baby.\u201d</p><p>I smile and whisper, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He pulls my face towards his.</p><p>When I\u2019m close enough, his lips press against mine. His tongue runs over my bottom lip and my mouth instinctively opens up under his. My hands fist into the front of his shirt so I can keep standing as his taste and the feel of his hands tangling into my hair cause my legs to go weak.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have a whole house. Do you have to do that in the middle of the kitchen?\u201d Brandon says, breaking the moment.</p><p>Mike pulls his mouth from mine then smiles, looking over at Brandon. \u201cThought for sure that we would be on our own in a year. Looks like we have along ways to go until we have an empty house,\u201d Mike says quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandon asks, walking fully into the kitchen. I notice that he\u2019s dressed in a nice sweeter and a pair of dark jeans that actually fit him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about me marrying your mom?\u201d Mike asks, and my stomach drops.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cool with it,\u201d Brandon says with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cDo me a favor and run out to my car. There\u2019s a box in the glove box. Can you bring it to me?\u201d Mike asks.</p><p>Brandon looks at me then Mike and heads towards the front door. I stand there, stunned, as Mike turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cGive me one second, babe.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t breathe or even blink as he heads towards the direction where Brandon just left. It feels like an eternity for them to come back. When they come back around the corner, Mike is holding a small box in his hand and Brandon is behind him with a large smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about marrying me?\u201d Mike asks, pulling my hand towards him and slipping the perfectly simple diamond ring on my finger.</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d I stutter, looking at the ring on my finger. His laugh causes my head to come up and my eyes to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the point, Kitten,\u201d he says softly as his hands come up to hold my face.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get married?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I planned on asking you this weekend, but this seems like the perfect time to me,\u201d he says. Then he looks over at Brandon before looking back at me. \u201cSo what do you say? Will you and Brandon both take my last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Brandon are mine and I would like it if we we\u2019re all Rouger\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say yes,\u201d Brandon says, coming over to put his arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whisper, feeling a tear slide down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d he asks again.</p><p>I tilt my head back to look at Brandon, who looks at me and nods, kissing the side of my head. \u201cYes,\u201d I say through my tears when my eyes meet Mike\u2019s again.</p><p>As soon as the word leaves my mouth, Mike\u2019s hands wrap into the back of my hair and his mouth crashes down onto mine.</p><p>\u201cCan you guys control yourselves at least until I don\u2019t have to see it?\u201d I hear Brandon say. I can tell by his tone that he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>I kiss Mike once more before whispering, \u201cI love you,\u201d against his lips and then leaning back.</p><p>\u201cWere you serious about us both having your last name?\u201d Brandon asks after a minute.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mike replies, pulling me around to tuck me under his arm. \u201cI would be honored if you had my last name.\u201d</p><p>Brandon swallows then looks at me. There are so many emotions in his eyes, and as his mom, I know that the look on his face is relief from being wanted and accepted. Without another word, Brandon wraps one arm around me then one around Mike. As I stand between my two guys, I burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Mom. Relax.\u201d Brandon chuckles, and I feel Mike\u2019s laugher against my side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just... Just happy.\u201d I cry, squeezing Brandon once more before stepping back.</p><p>\u201cI know you have to go help your friend, but can you come home for dinner?\u201d I ask and feel Mike\u2019s fingers squeeze into my side. I know that we just found out the news, but I really want my son to know what\u2019s going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brandon asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just come home for dinner,\u201d I sigh. Apparently, the men in my life don\u2019t know how to let up.</p><p>\u201cIs this about Dad coming to visit?\u201d he asks, his eyes drawn together.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mike asks.</p><p>I double-blink. I haven\u2019t heard anything from my ex in over a month. He sent me an e-mail after I confronted him about canceling his designated time with Brandon that was scheduled for Thanksgiving. When I found out that he\u2019d told Brandon that he couldn\u2019t come out for four days because his girlfriend\u2019s parents were in town and there was just no room, I flipped out. I was tired of him letting his son down and not caring about disappointing his child.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean your dad is coming here?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>Brandon shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He sent me a text telling me he would be here next week after I told him that I wouldn\u2019t be coming out for any of my scheduled visitation times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not the reason you wanted me to be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cJust come home after your study date, bud, and we\u2019ll talk then,\u201d Mike says.</p><p>Brandon nods and pulls me in for another hug. \u201cLove you, Mom,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I take a shuddering breath before telling him that I love him too and watching him leave. When I turn to face Mike, his eyes are so soft that my breath pauses.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much you have done for not only me but for Brandon,\u201d I tell him, closing my eyes before opening them slowly. I know that Brandon and I would have been okay eventually, but I doubt that our relationship would have healed like it has without him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have. You have helped bring my son back to me. You have given him something he hasn\u2019t received from his dad since he was little and you have given that to him when he needs it most. So, yes, you have done a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a hardship to love him. He\u2019s a good kid. And you\u2019re an amazing mom, and your ex... Well, he\u2019s a piece of shit.\u201d He smiles, walking towards me. \u201cI figure we have a couple of hours before he comes home. What do you say we go upstairs and celebrate our engagement?\u201d he says.</p><p>I look down at my hand and the ring that is sitting on my finger before bringing my eyes back up to meet his. \u201cI think I like that idea,\u201d I tell him and start to laugh when he quickly pulls his shirt off over his head. I pause, checking out his body before pulling my shirt up over my head and turning towards the stairs. I hear his footsteps behind me and my pulse begins to speed up as wetness floods between my legs.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he says against my ear as his hand slides around my waist.</p><p>Even though I know what\u2019s coming, I still have butterflies in my stomach. My pulse skids as his hand cups my pussy and his fingers press into the seam of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I hiss as my head falls back onto his shoulder.</p><p>He grunts something, but I can\u2019t make it out as his fingers move to the button of my jeans and his other hand slides up to cup my breast over my bra. When he has my jeans unzipped and his fingers slide between my folds, I moan and lift my hands over my head to grip into his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo slick,\u201d he says against my neck, and his fingers slide up and around my clit.</p><p>\u201cI need you inside me,\u201d I hiss, feeling my pussy contract.</p><p>He removes his hand and places his fingers in his mouth before pulling my chin towards him and taking my mouth in a deep kiss. The taste of myself on his mouth has me grabbing, pulling at the buckle of his belt. When I almost have it undone, his hand covers mine.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he demands, and my eyes go to his.</p><p>My knees almost buckle at the hunger I see in his eyes. I nod, and without another word, I rush up the stairs into the bedroom, listening as his footsteps follow me up the stairs. I turn around and face the door. As soon as I reach the bed, my hands go to behind my back and my fingers work quickly to unhook my bra. Once it\u2019s unclasped, I lean forward and let it drop off my shoulders and onto the floor. When my eyes meet his and he smirks, he is pushing his pants down over his hips. I lick my lips as I watch his cock bounce against his stomach. Then I strip of my jeans and panties, quickly kicking them to the side as I watch him stroke himself.</p><p>\u201cClimb up on the bed and lay back, spreading your legs, Kitten,\u201d he demands.</p><p>I listen, getting up onto the bed and lying back. I sit up on my elbows, watching as he walks towards me, his eyes locked between my legs. I start to scoot back, expecting him to climb up on the bed, but his hand around my ankle stops me. He pulls me back towards the edge of the bed before lowering his face and sucking the skin of my inner thigh deep into his mouth, causing me to whimper and my back to rise off the bed.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he breathes, licking up to the crease of my leg right on the edge of my pussy.</p><p>I wiggle my hips and grab his hair with one hand. I feel his smile against my skin and whimper as he pulls one pussy lip into his mouth, Then I feel the edge of his tongue slide near my entrance as his fingers dig into my thighs. He spreads my legs farther apart before his lips cover my clit and he pulls it into his mouth. I feel my orgasm building as his fingers fill me, moving slowly as he releases my clit and moves up my body. One arm holds me under my back as he lifts me onto the center of the bed. I pull his face down to mine, kissing him, tasting myself on his mouth. I lift my hips and wrap one leg around his hip as his fingers slide out and he enters me.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I moan, feeling myself clamp down on him. I scrape my nails down his back as his hand cups my breast and his fingers tug on my nipple.</p><p>\u201cYour pussy is so fucking hot,\u201d he growls against my mouth, and I moan into his, placing the heels of my feet into the back of his thighs so I can lift my hips to meet each of his thrusts with one of my own.</p><p>My hand travels up his back into his hair before sliding down his neck and over his shoulder and chest. Then I flip it to run over my stomach so my fingers can roll over my clit. He leans back and looks down, watching as I touch myself. His eyes get even darker as he slows his thrusts and sits up on his knees, his thumbs holding my pussy lips apart as he watches himself sink into me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close,\u201d I moan, rolling my fingers over my clit faster as his thrusts speed up. At this angle and with the way he\u2019s hitting my G-spot, my orgasm is building rapidly. When his hand pushes mine away and his finger rolls over my clit, my head digs into the pillow behind me.</p><p>\u201cPull those nipples, baby,\u201d he grunts, and I lift my hands to my breasts and pull my nipples as he pounds into me.</p><p>My orgasm is sudden and my body vibrates. White light fills my vision and I feel like I float away. I slowly come back to myself and feel him grow larger as his hips jerk and he groans, planting himself deep inside me. His body comes forward, covering mine while keeping his weight off my lower abdomen. I let out a long breath and run my hands up his back into his hair, listening closely as his breathing evens out.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I think about my kid inside you, I want to beat my chest,\u201d he says, making me laugh as he presses his face deeper into my neck. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t leave me,\u201d he whispers after a couple of minutes.</p><p>I swallow against the lump in my throat and pull his face away from my neck so I can look into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with us. We\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d I tell him and watch relief flash in his eyes before he lowers his mouth back to mine.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Brandon asks as we sit down for dinner.</p><p>I look at Mike, and he squeezes my thigh under the table. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a brother,\u201d I tell him, deciding that I may as well just get it over with.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m going to be a brother?\u201d he asks, confused.</p><p>I take another breath, thinking that this is much harder than it was when I told Mike. \u201cI mean I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re old,\u201d he blurts, looking at Mike and then me.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not that old,\u201d I scold him.</p> <p>Mike starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re not young. I\u2019m eighteen. It\u2019s just weird that you\u2019re having a kid after so many years,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor assures me that everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still weird,\u201d he mumbles, taking a bite of the meatloaf I made for dinner. \u201cI\u2019m happy that my room is in the basement. I don\u2019t want a screaming kid to wake me up in the middle of the night,\u201d he says, not even looking up from his plate.</p><p>I look over at Mike, who shrugs and takes a bite of his dinner. I look at my two men then down at my stomach and let out a breath. Things are going to change drastically when the baby gets here. But I am happy that my two men are taking this whole thing so well.</p><p>Now we have to see what everyone else thinks about it.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>MIKE</p><p>\u201cCan you believe that he had the nerve to show up and make a spectacle like we were together? Like we\u2019re a couple?\u201d Kat rambles as I pull up to the front of the house. \u201cHow could he be so stupid? I mean really, what the hell is wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t after the last hour. My blood pressure still hasn\u2019t gone back to normal. I\u2019m at a loss for words as to what just happened.</p><p>I\u2019ve never thought that her ex was a smart man, but when he showed up at Brandon\u2019s school, pulled Kat to him, and kissed her, I lost my shit. I\u2019d known that he was coming to town, but what I hadn\u2019t known was his reasoning. Apparently, he broke up with his girlfriend and thought that he was coming back to claim his wife. The fuck now has two black eyes to prove that he isn\u2019t getting anywhere near my woman\u2014ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate him. I hated him before, but now, I really, really hate him. I hope...\u201d She pauses to take a breath. \u201cI hope he gets run over by a bus. Too bad we don\u2019t have buses in town,\u201d she mutters under her breath as I shut off the car and hop out.</p><p>After walking around to her side to help her out, I take her hand and help her up the stairs and into the house.</p><p>\u201cReally, who does he think he is?\u201d she asks before rambling some more while pulling off her cap and unwrapping the scarf she had tied around her neck.</p><p>I walk straight into the kitchen, open the cupboard above the fridge, and pull down my whiskey before pulling the cap off and putting the bottle to my lips to take a swig.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not fair,\u201d Kat states as I put the bottle down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten,\u201d I say and put the lid back on the bottle. \u201cCome here,\u201d I tell her, feeling the liquid heat of the alcohol lessening some of the anger I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>She looks at me for a few seconds before walking to where I\u2019m standing. When she\u2019s close enough, I wrap my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I ask, rubbing her back.</p><p>\u201cPissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got that, Kitten. How\u2019s our boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d she says and immediately melts into me.</p><p>Earlier in the week, we found out that we would be adding another boy to our family. Everyone was overjoyed. Well, everyone except Asher, who had found out the week before that he and my baby girl were going to be adding another girl to their bunch. When we told everyone that we were expecting, they were all really excited about the news, and November was more than excited about becoming a big sister\u2014even if she already considered Brandon her brother.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Brandon will be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d I rub her back again. \u201cHe said he was going to talk with his dad and then he would be home,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>Brandon was upset with his father as well but had tried to neutralize the situation and agreed to go talk with his dad while I took Kat home. I was proud of him.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you punched him.\u201d She pauses then looks up at me and smiles. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had his hands and mouth on you,\u201d I growl, my anger returning at the memory. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky that he was able to walk away and that Trevor was there to hold me back after I got the first two hits in.\u201d</p><p>I never thought that, at my age, I would be fighting at a high school function. But seeing that fuck touch my woman\u2014the woman carrying my child\u2014had my blood boiling.</p><p>I hear Kat\u2019s yawn and look down at her, realizing that she has been going all day. The stress of this situation added on top of her pregnancy has her worn out.</p><p>\u201cHead up and get ready for bed, babe. I\u2019m going to send Brandon a message to make sure he\u2019s okay before locking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She yawns again, and I kiss her forehead and pat her bottom. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in bed,\u201d she says, walking away.</p><p>When I hear the water turn on upstairs, I send I message to Brandon asking if he\u2019s okay. I quickly get a reply that let me know that he just got in his car and is on his way home. I clean up the kitchen and wait until I hear Brandon pull up outside. Then I open the front door and meet him on the porch.</p><p>When I see him, I can tell that he is stressed. As much as he has matured over the last few months, he is still a young kid, and sometimes, it\u2019s hard to remember that.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask him, letting him inside.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s heading home tomorrow. I guess the only reason he wanted to come was to see if he had a chance of getting back with Mom,\u201d he says.</p><p>I want to get in my car, head to the fuckwad\u2019s hotel, and beat the shit out of him for hurting his kid again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, bud,\u201d I tell him, squeezing his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNothing with him surprises me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I want to go to bed. Can you tell Mom I said goodnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell him, watching as he heads down the basement stairs.</p><p>I finish locking up and set the house alarm before heading upstairs. When I reach the bedroom, Kat is already asleep, so I make quick work of my clothes before getting into bed behind her and pulling her into me.</p><p>\u201cIs Brandon home?\u201d she asks sleepily when I kiss the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her, running my hand over her slightly rounded stomach.</p><p>\u201cI should go make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to bed and said to tell you goodnight.\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI hate that he has to go through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, Kitten.\u201d I sigh, tucking her closer to me.</p><p>I wish there were something I could do for both her and Brandon, but I know that this situation is beyond my control. Kat, her ex, and Brandon will be tied together for the rest of their lives whether I like it or not. The only thing I can do I is be here for both of them when they need me.</p><p>I wait and listen for Kat\u2019s breath to even out before closing my eyes and following her off to sleep.</p><p>I walk into the kitchen and stop when my eyes land on Kat and Brandon. They are leaning on the counter and have their heads together, looking at some recipe book. I watch as Kat says something, making him laugh, then bumps him with her hip, smiling at him. I like knowing that our son is going to have this, that he is going to grow up with people around him who want and love him and that he will never feel like November felt growing up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go pick out a Christmas tree,\u201d I say after a few more seconds of watching them.</p><p>Both her and Brandon\u2019s heads rise at the same time, and Kats eyes draw together in confusion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even Thanksgiving,\u201d she says, standing up. I smile when I see the small bump that is starting to form on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s a tradition I started when November moved home. I always get her a tree. And now that we\u2019re a family, I would like to get one for us as well so that we can start our own traditions,\u201d I say, looking at first Brandon then down at Kat\u2019s stomach.</p><p>I missed out on so much with November; I refuse to miss out on anything now.</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t believe that I was going to be a dad and that I would be having a son. I had given up hope of having a larger family a long time ago. I never would have dreamed that I would be getting married or having a baby or marrying a woman who had a child already and adopting him as my own. Life has a way of giving you everything you didn\u2019t even know you needed, and Kat, Brandon, and now our new little one are proof of that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo we need to buy Christmas decorations?\u201d Kat asks.</p><p>Brandon groans behind her. Kat loves to shop and could spend hours in one store just walking around.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that another time,\u201d I say.</p><p>Brandon mumbles, \u201cThank God,\u201d under his breath, making me laugh and causing Kat to roll her eyes.</p> <p>When we get to the tree farm, we spend way more time than is necessary looking at trees. When I was on my own, I would come here and pick out whatever tree was closest to the entrance of the farm. But like she does when she\u2019s shopping, Kat has to look at and compare each tree before settling on one. I swear she does it to be a pain in the ass. She liked two trees when we got to the farm but insisted on looking around only to end up coming back to the first two.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Kat says with a smile, sipping on her hot chocolate.</p><p>\u201cMom, you had us walk around for over an hour only to come back to the first trees you saw,\u201d Brandon says.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure we got good ones,\u201d she says then looks at me.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh at the innocent look on her face. \u201cLet\u2019s get these tied down, bud,\u201d I tell Brandon when I see that he is going to say something else.</p> <p>I send a message to Asher to make sure he and November are home before getting back into the truck with Kat pressed to my side and Brandon sitting next to the door. As soon as we pull up in front of November\u2019s house, July and June are on the porch, jumping up and down, while November stands behind them with a smile on her face. I get out and help Kat, walking her up the front steps, where she and November hug and start laughing when the girls yell, \u201cUncle Brandon,\u201d and attack him before he even makes it up all the steps. Once he has both girls picked up, one on each side of him, he makes it up the rest of the steps, the girls talking to him about God knows what.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d November says, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl,\u201d I say and pull her in for a hug before releasing her and putting my arm around Kat\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTree time already?\u201d Asher asks with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He nods then kisses November\u2019s head before heading down the stairs to the truck. I kiss Kat and Brandon puts the girls down before we follow behind Asher and work at getting the tree inside.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>KAT</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas already?\u201d July asks, looking at me then her mom.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d November laughs. \u201cGrandpa always brings me a tree before my birthday and Thanksgiving,\u201d she explains.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d July pouts. \u201cWhen do we get presents from Santa?\u201d she asks, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cOn Christmas, but you have to be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. June\u2019s not always good,\u201d she says, lifting her chin.</p><p>November bites her lip and looks at me then back down at July, who is watching the men put up the tree. \u201cIs tattling being good?\u201d she asks July.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t twattle,\u201d she says, her eyes going wide.</p><p>\u201cJust making sure.\u201d November laughs.</p><p>July jumps off her lap and runs to her dad, pouting out her lip. I can\u2019t hear exactly what he says, but I can tell by the look on her face that it must make it better.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s so happy,\u201d November says quietly.</p><p>I look at her then over at Mike, who turns his head and winks when his eyes meet mine.</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to find someone. I set him up on an online dating website and pushed him to date, but he was never really into it. I thought that he would spend the rest of his life alone. I never would have thought that he would be getting married and having a baby. And that I would be getting not only one but two brothers.\u201d She smiles and lets out a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cI never expected all of this either,\u201d I say quietly, laying my hand against my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m excited. Even if Asher is jealous that you\u2019re having a boy,\u201d she says, and I laugh. \u201cHe swears he\u2019s cursed with girls because he was a man-whore.\u201d She rolls her eyes, and I laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Asher asks.</p><p>I immediately stop laughing, look at November, and feel my eyes go wide.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d November tells him, leaning back in her chair so she can smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he grunts then bends down and kisses her. \u201cI\u2019m going to head up to the attic and get the Christmas decorations. The girls want to decorate tonight,\u201d he says.</p><p>November sighs. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s late. They need to take a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe...\u201d is all he says, and she shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey,\u201d she mumbles. When he walks away, she says, \u201cWhen our girls get older, he is so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Mike asks.</p><p>I roll over to look at him. \u201cYes, but I had a really great time,\u201d I tell him, wrapping my arm around his stomach. \u201cJune and July have their daddy wrapped around their little fingers.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d he agrees and takes a breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for more for my daughter or my grandbabies. He loves all of them unconditionally and would do anything for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that for them,\u201d I say, kissing his chest.</p><p>\u201cJust think. Next year, that will be us and our little man,\u201d he says, and I smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to make thousands of memories with you,\u201d I tell him quietly.</p><p>\u201cMe too, babe,\u201d he says, kissing the top of my forehead.</p><p>After seeing Mike with his granddaughters and Brandon, I know that the memories we make as a family will be extra special.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>MIKE</p><p>A few years later</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to let me run the club?\u201d Brandon asks.</p><p>I nod. I never really thought about retiring at my age, but I like the idea of being home with Kat. Brandon has taken it upon himself to get management classes under his belt, and he had also proven himself mature enough on more than one occasion to run the club without me around. I knew that he would take the job seriously and always treat the girls at the club with respect. He also works well with Joe, and that says a lot. My brother is difficult and doesn\u2019t trust many people, but he loves Brandon like his own kid.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m handing the reins over to you. But if you need me, I\u2019ll be around,\u201d I tell him, watching as his face changes.</p><p>He looks away from me and scrubs his hands down his face before lowering his head, his shoulders slumping. \u201cI know you\u2019re not my dad,\u201d he says, and I can hear the strain in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I tell him, watching as he slowly lifts his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my dad, but you\u2019re the man I look up to. The man who has shown me how to be a man, and for that, I will always be grateful and would be honored if you would let me call you Dad.\u201d</p><p>I sit back in my chair and look at the man in front of me. The kid who used to wear jeans that were way too baggy now wears suits on a daily basis. His hair, which was shaggy, is now groomed and cut into a style that says he cares about his appearance. Women and men notice him when he walks into a room. Where he used to be quick to anger, he is now cautious in his reactions. I didn\u2019t raise him, but he is no longer the boy I once knew. He is now a man, and I would like to think I had something to do with that.</p><p>\u201cI would be proud to call you my son,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I watch his eyes fill with tears. Then he takes a breath and shakes his head smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna cry about this shit.\u201d He shakes his head again before standing up. \u201cI have work to do. Can you tell Mom that I\u2019ll see her this weekend for Christmas dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I mutter, my chest still compressed from the sheer weight of what just happened. \u201cYou bringing a date?\u201d I ask when he gets to the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, and you can tell Mom I said that,\u201d he says before walking out the door and shutting it behind him.</p><p>I take a deep breath, letting it out slowly. Then I pick up the phone, call Kat, and tell her that I will be home for dinner.</p><p>ASHER</p><p>\u201cBaby, wake up. It\u2019s Christmas,\u201d I whisper to November, who grunts and rolls away from me. Nothing much has changed since we got together. \u201cBaby, we need to get up. Everyone\u2019s gonna be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she mutters, sticking her head under the pillow.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we gotta make breakfast,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cAsher, I swear I will kill you one of these days,\u201d she cries, making me chuckle.</p><p>I force her to her back before placing my mouth over hers in a deep kiss. Then I lift her out of the bed and put her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cNow go get ready to help me make breakfast,\u201d I say before smacking her ass and leaving the room.</p><p>TREVOR</p><p>\u201cStay like that,\u201d I groan into Liz\u2019s ear and plant myself balls-deep inside her tight pussy. I swear I will never get enough of this, of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please. I\u2019m so close,\u201d she whispers, and I smile and slide back out.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna stop, babe. Just hold still,\u201d I tell her again, swiveling my hips.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d she hisses.</p><p>\u201cDada, frewnd!\u201d I hear my son cry.</p><p>I stop and look down at Liz, who narrows her eyes on me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas!\u201d my daughter yells through the baby monitor in my son\u2019s room. Then my boy starts to laugh.</p><p>I lay my head against Liz\u2019s back and want to cry\u2014my kids are total cock blockers.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me ten orgasms,\u201d Liz says, falling to her stomach. \u201cAnd hours of oral,\u201d she adds, putting her head under the pillow.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby. Merry Christmas,\u201d I tell her, kissing her quickly and getting out of bed to go get my kids.</p><p>CASH</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I put out my hand in search of Lilly and come up with a small, cloth-covered foot. I lift my head, look across the expanse of our California king bed, and see that Jax and Ashlyn have both gotten into bed with us and are lying crossways in the bed between Lilly and me. I sit up and straighten first Jax then Ashlyn before making my way over to Lilly. Lying down along her back and wrapping my arms around her, I breathe in her scent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I smile against her neck. \u201cIt is. Do you want your gift?\u201d I ask, rubbing myself against her.</p><p>\u201cNice try, mister. I know the kids are in bed with us,\u201d she groans.</p><p>\u201cThey are. I guess you\u2019ll have to get my gift later,\u201d I tell her, kissing her neck and making her laugh.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s Christmas!\u201d I hear behind me.</p><p>I roll to my back just in time for Ashlyn to land on my gut, making me grunt.</p><p>\u201cDo we get to open owe pwesents now?\u201d Jax asks.</p><p>I look over at Lilly as Ashlyn crawls on top of her and Jax comes to lie on my chest.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you have to brush your teeth. Then you can see what Santa brought for you,\u201d Lilly says.</p><p>At that, both the kids get out of bed and take off out of the room.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last,\u201d Lilly says, running her fingers through my hair as I lower my mouth to hers.</p><p>\u201cSanta came!\u201d the kids shout.</p><p>I groan, closing my eyes. \u201cWe need another \u2018naked house\u2019 day,\u201d I tell her, and she smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I guess I got you the perfect gift,\u201d she says, getting out of bed.</p><p>I watch her go before lying back, looking up at the ceiling, and smiling.</p><p>NICO</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fit into anything!\u201d Sophie cries lying back on the bed in a huff. Her large, pregnant stomach rolls as our daughters move around. Her naked breasts rise and fall and her pussy is slightly visible through the thin, white fabric she\u2019s wearing.</p><p>\u201cYou looked good in what you had on,\u201d I tell her, kneeling down between her legs with my hands on her stomach.</p><p>Her head comes up and she looks at me, her cheeks flushed and her eyes narrow. \u201cI look like a whale,\u201d she says, laying her head back down. \u201cA giant, stuffed whale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous, sexy as fuck,\u201d I tell her and pull down her panties, tossing them behind me. \u201cYou look good enough to eat.\u201d I breathe over her pussy, which is pink and swollen from pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cNico,\u201d she whimpers, raising her hips.</p><p>My beautiful girl is so sensitive; the slightest touch is enough to set her off lately. I love her pregnant. Her body is so ripe. Her taste is fucking addictive.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d I say against the lips of her sex before spreading them open with my thumbs and taking a swipe of her with my tongue. The second her taste fills my mouth, I go at her, burying my face in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cBest. Christmas. Gift. Ever,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t agree more.</p><p>MIKE</p><p>I look around the table at everyone. James has his arm around Susan. Asher has his hand on November\u2019s stomach as he and May talk to her four-months-pregnant stomach. Trevor has Liz and his son on his lap. Cash and Lilly are locked in their own private moment while Nico is whispering something to Sophie that is making her smile.</p><p>I feel a hand on my thigh, and when I look to my right, my eyes meet Kat\u2019s soft ones. I lean over and place a kiss on her lips. When my son yells, I watch as he holds out the turkey thigh he was eating to Beast, laughing when Beast licks it. I take a full breath then look at Brandon, who looks at me and smiles before laughing at something the kids are doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I\u2019m always thankful for what I have, but this year, I\u2019m thankful for the second chances I didn\u2019t even know were possible to have.</p>   </body></html>"]
