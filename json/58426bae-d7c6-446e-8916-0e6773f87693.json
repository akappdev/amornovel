Never have been. Never will be. It\u2019s not the style of anyone who wants to play in the majors. And because of my personal philosophy, this moment sucks. My best friend is seconds from scoring a phone number from the chick working the Taco Bell counter, placing him in the lead.</p><p>What started as a simple dare twisted into a night-long game. First, Chris dared me to ask the girl in line at the movies for her number.</p><p>Then I dared him to ask the girl at the batting cages for her number. The more we succeeded, the more momentum the game gained. Too bad Chris owns a grin that melts the hearts of all girls, including the ones with boyfriends.</p> <p>I hate losing.</p><p>Taco Bell Chick blushes when Chris winks at her. Come on. I chose her because she called us redneck losers when we ordered.</p><p>Chris rests his arms on the counter, inching closer to the girl, as I sit at the table and watch the tragedy unfold. Shouldn\u2019t she be having an epiphany right about now? If not, can she find some self-respect and tell Chris to beat it?</p><p>Every single muscle on the back of my neck tenses as Taco Bell Chick giggles, writes something on a piece of paper, and slides it over to him. Dammit. The rest of our group howls with laughter and someone pats me on the back.</p><p>Tonight isn\u2019t about phone numbers or girls.</p> <p>It\u2019s about enjoying our last Friday night before school begins. I\u2019ve tasted everything\u2014the freedom of hot summer air in the Jeep with the panels down, the peace of dark country roads leading to the interstate, the exciting glow of city lights as we took the thirty-minute drive into Louisville, and, lastly, the mouthwatering taste of a greasy fast-food taco at midnight.</p><p>Chris raises the phone number like a referee holding up the glove of the prize champion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d There\u2019s no way I\u2019ve gotten this far to have Chris outdo me.</p><p>He slouches in his seat, tosses the paper into the pile of numbers we\u2019ve collected over the evening, and tugs his Bullitt County High baseball cap over his brown hair. \u201cLet\u2019s see.</p><p>These things have to be thought through. The girl chosen carefully. Attractive enough so she won\u2019t fall for you. Not a dog because she\u2019ll be excited someone gave her a bone.\u201d</p> <p>Mimicking him, I shift back in the chair, extend my legs, and fold my hands over my stomach. \u201cTake your time. I\u2019ve got forever.\u201d</p><p>But we don\u2019t. After this weekend, life changes\u2014my life and Chris\u2019s. On Monday, Chris and I will be seniors starting our last fall baseball league. I only have a few more months to impress the professional baseball scouts or the dream I\u2019ve been working toward my entire life will dissolve into ashes.</p><p>A shove at my foot brings me back to the here and now.</p><p>\u201cStop the serious shit,\u201d Logan whispers. The lone junior at the table and the best damn catcher in the state nods toward the rest of the group. He knows my facial expressions better than anyone. He should. We\u2019ve been playing together since we were kids. Me pitching.</p><p>Him catching.</p><p>For Logan\u2019s sake, I laugh at a joke Chris told even though I didn\u2019t hear the punch line.</p><p>\u201cWe close soon.\u201d Taco Bell Chick wipes a table near ours and gives Chris a smile. She almost looks pretty in the glow of the red neon Drive-Thru Open sign.</p><p>\u201cI may call that one,\u201d says Chris.</p> <p>I lift a brow. He worships his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if it weren\u2019t for Lacy.\u201d But he has Lacy, and loves her, so neither one of us continues that conversation.</p><p>\u201cI have one more try.\u201d I make a show of glancing around the purple Tex-Mex decorated lobby. \u201cWhat girl are you choosing for me?\u201d</p><p>A honk from the drive-thru announces the arrival of a car full of hot girls. Rap pounds from their car and I swear one girl flashes us. I love the city. A brunette in the backseat waves at me. \u201cYou should pick one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Chris says sarcastically. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t I hand you the title now?\u201d</p><p>Two guys from our table hop out of their seats and go outside, leaving me, Logan, and Chris alone. \u201cLast chance for hot city girls before we drive back to Groveton, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Logan doesn\u2019t say anything one way or another, nor does his face move an inch. That\u2019s Logan for you\u2014unmoved by much. Unless it involves a feat associated with death.</p><p>\u201cThere she is.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes brighten as he stares at the entrance. \u201cThat\u2019s the girl I\u2019m calling as yours.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a deep breath. Chris sounds too happy for this girl to be good news. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust came in, waiting at the counter.\u201d</p><p>I risk a look. Black hair. Torn clothes. Total skater. Damn, those chicks are hard-core. I slap my hand against the table and our trays shift.</p><p>Why? Why did Skater Girl have to wander into Taco Bell tonight?</p><p>Chris\u2019s rough chuckles do nothing to help my growing agitation. \u201cAdmit defeat and you won\u2019t have to suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I stand, refusing to go down without a fight.</p><p>All girls are the same. It\u2019s what I tell myself as I stroll to the counter. She might look different from the girls at home, but all girls want the same thing\u2014a guy who shows interest. A guy\u2019s problem is having the balls to do it. Good thing for me I\u2019ve got balls. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Her long black hair hides her face, but her slim body with a hint of curves catches my attention. Unlike the girls at home, she isn\u2019t wearing marked-down designer labels. Nope.</p><p>She has her own style. Her black tank top shows more skin than it covers and her skintight jeans hug all the right places. My eyes linger on a single rip in them, directly below her ass.</p><p>She leans over the counter and the rip widens. Skater Girl turns her head toward me and the drive-thru. \u201cIs someone going to take my fucking order?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s laughter from our corner table jerks me back to reality. I pull off my baseball cap, mess my hand through my hair, and shove the hat back in place. Why her? Why tonight? But there\u2019s a dare and I\u2019m going to win. \u201cCounter\u2019s a little slow tonight.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me like I\u2019m a little slow. \u201cAre you speaking to me?\u201d</p><p>Her hard stare dares me to glance away, and a lesser guy would. I\u2019m not lesser. Keep staring, Skater Girl. You don\u2019t scare me. I\u2019m drawn to her eyes though. They\u2019re blue. Dark blue. I never would have thought someone with such black hair could have those brilliant eyes.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d She rests a hip against the counter and crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cOr are you as stupid as you look?\u201d</p><p>Yep, pure punk: attitude, nose ring, and a sneer that can kill on sight. She\u2019s not my type, but she doesn\u2019t have to be. I just need her number. \u201cYou\u2019d probably get better service if you watched your language.\u201d</p><p>A hint of amusement touches her lips and dances in her eyes. Not the kind of amusement you laugh with. It\u2019s the taunting kind. \u201cDoes my language bother you?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d Girls don\u2019t use fuck. Or they shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t care for the word, but I know when I\u2019m being tested and this is a test.</p><p>\u201cSo my language doesn\u2019t bother you, but you say\u2014\u201d she raises her voice and leans over the counter again \u201c\u2014I could get some fucking service if I watched my language.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t hurt. Time to switch tactics. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Her head snaps up as if she had forgotten I was there. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eat. What do you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish. What do you think I want? I\u2019m at a taco joint.\u201d</p><p>Chris laughs again and this time Logan joins in. If I don\u2019t salvage this, I\u2019ll be listening to their ridicule the entire way home. This time I lean over the counter and wave at the girl working the drive-thru. I give her a smile. She smiles back. Take lessons, Skater Girl. This is how it\u2019s supposed to work. \u201cCan I have a minute?\u201d</p><p>Drive-Thru Chick\u2019s face brightens and she holds up a finger as she continues with the order from outside. \u201cBe right there. Promise.\u201d</p><p>I turn back to Skater Girl, but instead of the warm thank-you I should be receiving she shakes her head, clearly annoyed. \u201cJocks.\u201d</p><p>My smile falters. Hers grows.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m a jock?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes wander to my chest and I fight a grimace. Written in black letters across my gray shirt is Bullitt County High School, Baseball State Champions.</p><p>\u201cSo you are stupid,\u201d she says.</p><p>I\u2019m done. I take one step in the direction of the table, then stop. I don\u2019t lose. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to make you leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>And there it is\u2014my opening. \u201cGive me your phone number.\u201d</p><p>The right side of her mouth quirks up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead serious. Give me your name and phone number and I\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be brain damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Taco Bell. Can I take your order?\u201d</p><p>We both look at Drive-Thru Chick. She beams at me, then cowers from Skater Girl.</p><p>With her lids cast down, she asks again, \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>I pull out my wallet and slam ten dollars on the counter. \u201cTacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Coke,\u201d Skater Girl says. \u201cLarge. Since he\u2019s paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOookaay.\u201d Drive-Thru Chick enters the order, slides the money off the counter, and returns to the order window.</p><p>We stare at each other. I swear, this girl never blinks.</p><p>\u201cI believe a thank-you is in order,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your name and phone number and we\u2019ll call it even.\u201d</p><p>She licks her lips. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing you can do to ever get me to give you my name or number.\u201d</p><p>Ring the bell. Playtime ended with those words. Purposely invading her space, I steal a step toward her and place a hand on the counter next to her body. It affects her. I can tell. Her eyes lose the amusement and her arms hug her body. She\u2019s small. Smaller than I expected. That attitude is so big I hadn\u2019t noticed her height or size. \u201cI bet I can.\u201d</p><p>She juts out her chin. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight tacos and one large Coke,\u201d says the girl from behind the counter.</p><p>Skater Girl snatches the order and spins on her heel before I can process I\u2019m on the verge of losing. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>She stops at the door. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>This \u201cwhat\u201d doesn\u2019t have nearly the anger of the one before. Maybe I\u2019m getting somewhere.</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone number. I want to call you.\u201d</p><p>No, I don\u2019t, but I do want to win. She\u2019s wavering. I can tell. To keep from scaring her off, I bury my excitement. Nothing sends me higher than winning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what.\u201d She flashes a smile that drips with a mixture of allure and wickedness.</p><p>\u201cIf you can walk me to my car and open the door for me, I\u2019ll give you my number.\u201d</p><p>Can.</p><p>She steps into the humid night and skips down the sidewalk to the back parking lot. I wouldn\u2019t have pegged this girl as a skipper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skip she does and I follow, tasting the sweet victory.</p><p>Victory doesn\u2019t last long. I freeze midstep on the sidewalk. Before she can prance past the yellow lines confining an old rusty car, two menacing guys climb out and neither appears happy.</p><p>\u201cSomething I can do for you, man?\u201d the taller one asks. Tattoos run the length of his arms.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I shove my hands in my pockets and relax my stance. I have no intention of getting into a fight, especially when I\u2019m outnumbered.</p> <p>Tattoo Guy crosses the parking lot, and he\u2019d probably keep coming if it wasn\u2019t for the other guy with hair covering his eyes. He stops right in front of Tattoo Guy, halting his progress, but his posture suggests he\u2019d also fight for kicks.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem, Beth?\u201d</p><p>Beth. Hard to believe this hard-core girl could have such a delicate name. As if reading my thoughts, her lips slide into an evil smirk.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she answers as she jumps into the front seat of the car.</p><p>Both guys walk to their car while keeping an eye on me, as if I\u2019m stupid enough to jump them from behind. The engine roars to life and the car vibrates like duct tape holds it together.</p> <p>In no hurry to go inside and explain to my friends how I lost, I stay on the sidewalk. The car slowly drives by and Beth presses her palm against the passenger window. Written in black marker is the word signaling my defeat: can\u2019t.</p><p>Beth</p><p>THERE\u2019S NOTHING BETTER than the feeling of floating. Weightless in warmth. Comforter out of the dryer warmth. The warmth of a strong hand against my face, running through my hair.</p><p>If only life could be like this...forever.</p><p>I could do forever here, in the basement of my aunt\u2019s house. All walls. No windows. The outside kept outside. The people I love inside.</p><p>Noah\u2014his hair hiding his eyes, keeping the world from seeing his soul.</p> <p>Isaiah\u2014a sleeve of beautiful tattoos that frightens the normal and entices the free.</p><p>Me\u2014the poet in my mind when I\u2019m high.</p><p>I came to this house for safety. They came because the foster care system ran out of homes. We stayed because we were stray pieces of other puzzles, tired of never fitting.</p><p>One year ago, Isaiah and Noah bought the couch, the king-size mattress, and the TV from the Goodwill. Shit thrown away by somebody else. By yanking it down a flight of stairs into the depths of the earth, they made us a home. They gave me a family.</p><p>\u201cI wore ribbons,\u201d I say. My own voice sounds bizarre. Echoing. Far away. And I speak again so I can hear the strangeness.</p><p>\u201cLots of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when she does this,\u201d Isaiah says to Noah. The three of us relax on the bed.</p><p>Finishing another beer, Noah sits at the end with his back propped against the wall. Isaiah and I touch. We only touch when we\u2019re high or drunk or both. We can because it doesn\u2019t count then. Nothing counts when you feel weightless.</p> <p>Isaiah runs his hand through my hair again.</p><p>The gentle tug urges me to close my eyes and sleep forever. Bliss. This is bliss.</p><p>\u201cWhat colors?\u201d The normal rough edges of Isaiah\u2019s tone disappear, leaving smooth deepness.</p><p>\u201cPink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDresses. I loved dresses.\u201d</p><p>It feels as if I\u2019m turning my head through sand in order to look at him. My head rests on his stomach and I smile when the heat of his skin radiates past his T-shirt onto my cheek. Or maybe I\u2019m smiling because it\u2019s Isaiah and only he can make me smile.</p><p>I love his dark hair, shaved close to his scalp. I love his kind gray eyes. I love the earrings in both ears. I love...that he\u2019s hot. Hot when he\u2019s high. I giggle. He\u2019s tragically hot when he\u2019s sober. I should write that down.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a dress, Beth?\u201d Isaiah asks.</p><p>He never teases me when I remember my childhood. In fact, it\u2019s one of the few times he asks endless questions.</p><p>\u201cWould you buy me one?\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but the thought lightens my heart. The teeny sober part of my brain reminds me I don\u2019t wear dresses, that I spurned ribbons. The rest of my mind, lost in a haze of pot, enjoys the game\u2014the prospect of a life with dresses and ribbons and someone willing to make my wildest dreams come true.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers without hesitating.</p><p>The muscles around my mouth become heavy and the rest of my body, including my heart, follows suit. No. I\u2019m not ready for the comedown. I close my eyes and will it to go away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s baked.\u201d Noah\u2019s not baked and part of me resents him for it. He quit pot and being carefree when he graduated, and he\u2019s taking Isaiah with him. \u201cWe waited too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Isaiah moves and places my head on something soft and fluffy. He gave me a pillow. Isaiah always takes care of me.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d His warm breath drifts near my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s a groggy whisper.</p><p>\u201cMove in with us.\u201d</p><p>Last spring, Noah graduated from high school and the foster system. He\u2019s moving out and Isaiah\u2019s going with him, even though Isaiah can\u2019t officially leave foster care until he graduates next year and turns eighteen. My aunt doesn\u2019t care where Isaiah lives as long as she keeps receiving the checks from the state.</p><p>I try to shake my head no, but it doesn\u2019t work too well in sand.</p><p>\u201cThe two of us talked and you can have a bedroom and we\u2019ll share the other one.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ve been at this for weeks, trying to convince me to leave with them. But ha! Even stoned I can foil their plans. I flutter my eyes open. \u201cWon\u2019t work. You need privacy for sex.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckles. \u201cWe have a couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s Isaiah. In case you didn\u2019t notice, you\u2019re both seniors this year.\u201d</p><p>Smart-ass. I glare at Noah. He merely sips his beer.</p><p>Isaiah continues, \u201cHow else are you going to get to school? You gonna ride the bus?\u201d</p><p>Hell no. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get your sorry ass up early to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will,\u201d he murmurs, and I find a hint of my bliss again.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you move in with us?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>His direct question sobers me up. Because, I scream in my mind. I flip onto my side and curl into a ball. Seconds later something soft covers my body. The blanket tucked right underneath my chin.</p><p>\u201cNow, she\u2019s done,\u201d says Isaiah.</p><p>MY ASS VIBRATES. I stretch before reaching into my back pocket for my cell.</p><p>For a second, I wonder if pretty boy from Taco Bell somehow managed to score my number. I dreamed of him\u2014Taco Bell Boy.</p><p>He stood close to me, looking all arrogant and gorgeous with his mop of sandy-blond hair and light brown eyes. This time he wasn\u2019t trying to play me by getting my number. He was smiling at me like I actually mattered.</p><p>As I said\u2014just a dream.</p><p>The image fades when I check the time and the caller ID on my cell: 3:00 a.m. and The Last Stop bar. Fuck. Wishing I never sobered up, I accept the call. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s asleep beside me, his arm haphazardly thrown over my stomach. Gently lifting it, I squeeze out from underneath.</p><p>Noah\u2019s passed out on the couch, with his girlfriend, Echo, pulled tight against him. Shit, when did she get back in town?</p><p>Quietly, I climb the stairs, enter the kitchen, and shut the door to the basement. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s causing problems again,\u201d says a pissed-off male voice. Unfortunately, I know this voice: Denny. Bartender/owner of The Last Stop.</p><p>\u201cHave you cut her off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop guys from buying her drinks. Look, kid, you pay me to call you before I call the police or bounce her out to the curb. You\u2019ve got fifteen minutes to drag her ass out.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up. Denny really needs to work on his conversational skills.</p><p>I walk the two blocks to the strip mall, which boasts all the conveniences white trash can desire: a Laundromat, Dollar Store, liquor store, piss-ass market that accepts WIC and food stamps and sells stale bread and week-old meat, cigarette store, pawn shop, and biker bar.</p><p>Oh, and a dilapidated lawyer\u2019s office in case you get caught shoplifting or holding up any of the above.</p><p>The other stores closed hours ago, placing the bars over their windows. Groups of men and women huddle around the scores of motorcycles that fill the parking lot. The stale stench of cigarettes and the sweet scent of cloves and pot mingle together in the hot summer air.</p><p>Denny and I both know he won\u2019t call the cops, but I can\u2019t risk it. Mom\u2019s been arrested twice and is on probation. And even if he doesn\u2019t call the cops, he\u2019ll kick her out. A burst of male laughter reminds me why that\u2019s not a good thing. It\u2019s not happy laughter or joyous or even sane. It\u2019s mean, has an edge, and craves someone\u2019s pain.</p><p>Mom thrives on sick men. I don\u2019t get it.</p><p>Don\u2019t have to. I just clean up the mess.</p><p>The dull bulbs hanging over the pool tables, the running red-neon lights over the bar, and the two televisions hanging on the wall create the bar\u2019s only light. The sign on the door states two things: no one under the age of twenty-one and no gang colors. Even in the dimness, I can see neither rule applies. Most of the men wear jackets with their motorcycle gang emblem clearly in sight, and half the girls hanging on those men are underage.</p><p>I push between two men to where Denny serves drinks at the bar. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Denny, in his typical red flannel, has his back to me and pours vodka into shot glasses.</p><p>He won\u2019t talk and pour at the same time\u2014at least to me.</p><p>I force my body to stay stoically still when a hand squeezes my ass and a guy reeking with BO leans into me. \u201cWanna drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, dickhead.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and squeezes again. I focus on the rainbow of liquor bottles lined up behind the bar, pretending I\u2019m someplace else.</p><p>Someone else. \u201cHand off my ass or I\u2019ll rip off your balls.\u201d</p><p>Denny blocks my view of the bottles and slides a beer to the guy seconds away from losing his manhood. \u201cJailbait.\u201d</p><p>Dickhead wanders from the bar as Denny nods toward the back. \u201cWhere she\u2019s always at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I draw stares and snickers as I walk past.</p><p>Most of the laughter belongs to regulars. They know why I\u2019m here. I see the judgment in their eyes. The amusement. The pity. Damn hypocrites.</p><p>I walk with my head high, shoulders squared. I\u2019m better than them. No matter the whispers and taunts they throw out. Fuck them.</p><p>Fuck them all.</p><p>Most everyone in the back room hovers over a poker game near the front, leaving the rest of the room empty. The door to the alley hangs wide open. I can see Mom\u2019s apartment complex and her front door from here.</p><p>Convenient.</p><p>Mom sits at a small round table in the corner. Two bottles of whiskey and a shot glass sit beside her. She rubs her cheek, then pulls her hand away. Inside of me, anger erupts.</p><p>He hit her. Again. Her cheek is red. Blotchy.</p><p>The skin underneath the eye already swelling.</p><p>This is the reason why I can\u2019t move in with Noah and Isaiah. The reason I can\u2019t leave. I need to be two blocks from Mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElisabeth.\u201d Mom slurs the s and drunkenly waves me over. She picks up a whiskey bottle and tips it over the general area of the shot glass, but nothing comes out. Which is good because she\u2019d miss the glass by an inch.</p><p>I go to her, take the bottle, and set it on the table beside us. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinks her hollow blue eyes. \u201cBe a good girl and go get me another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen get you something too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Mom smoothes her blond hair with a shaky hand and glances around as if she just woke from a dream. \u201cHe hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit him back.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t doubt she hit him first. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>That statement hits me in ways a man can\u2019t.</p><p>I release a long breath and search for a way to ease the sting of her words, but I fail. I pick up the other bottle, grateful for the pitiful amount remaining, pour a shot, and swig it down. Then pour another, pushing it toward her. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Mom stares at the drink before letting her middle-aged fingers trace the rim of the shot glass. Her nails are bitten to the quick. The cuticles grown over. The skin surrounding the nails is dry and cracked. I wonder if my mom was ever pretty.</p><p>She throws her head back as she drinks.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do. Your father would never have left if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The burn from the whiskey suppresses the pain of the memory. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did...it forced him to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>She begins to cry. It\u2019s the drunk cry. The type where it all comes out\u2014the tears, the snot, the spit, the horrible truth you should never tell another soul. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>I flinch. Swallow. And remind myself to inhale. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Mom grabs my hand. I don\u2019t pull away. I don\u2019t grab her in return. I let her do what she must. We\u2019ve been down this road several times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d Mom wipes her nose with the bare skin of her forearm. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>I love you. You know I do. Don\u2019t leave me alone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d What else can I say? She\u2019s my mom. My mom.</p><p>Her fingers draw circles on the back of my hand and she refuses eye contact. \u201cStay with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>This is where Isaiah drew the line. Actually, he drew the line further back, forcing me to promise I\u2019d stay away from her altogether after her boyfriend beat the shit out of me. I\u2019ve kind of kept the promise by moving in with my aunt. But someone has to take care of my mom\u2014make sure she eats, has food, pays her bills. It is, after all, my fault Dad left.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiles, not noticing I haven\u2019t answered. Sometimes, at night, I dream of her smiling. She was happy when Dad lived with us. Then I ruined her happiness.</p><p>Her knees wobble when she stands, but Mom can walk. It\u2019s a good night.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask when she steps in the direction of the bar.</p><p>\u201cTo pay my tab.\u201d</p><p>Impressive. She has money. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Stay right here and I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Instead of handing me cash, Mom leans against the back door. Great. Now I\u2019m left with the tab. At least Taco Bell Boy bought me food and I have something to give Denny.</p><p>I push people in my quest to reach the bar, and Denny grimaces when he spots me. \u201cGet her out, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out. What\u2019s her tab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready paid.\u201d</p><p>Ice runs in my veins. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cWho do you think?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m falling over myself, stumbling over people, yanking them out of my way. He hit her once. He\u2019ll do it again. I run full force out the back door into the alley and see nothing.</p><p>Nothing in the dark shadows. Nothing in the streetlights. Crickets chirp in surround sound.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Glass breaks. Glass breaks again. Horrible shrieks echo from the front of Mom\u2019s apartment complex. God, he\u2019s killing her. I know it.</p><p>My heart pounds against my rib cage, making it difficult to breathe. Everything shakes\u2014my hands, my legs. The vision of what I\u2019ll see when I reach the parking lot eats at my soul: Mom in a bloody pulp and her asshole boyfriend standing over her. Tears burn my eyes and I trip as I round the corner of the building, scraping my palms on the blacktop. I don\u2019t care. I need to find her. My mom...</p><p>My mom swings a baseball bat and shatters the back window of a shitty El Camino.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what are you doing?\u201d And where did she score a baseball bat?</p><p>\u201cHe.\u201d She swings the bat and breaks more glass. \u201cCheated.\u201d</p><p>I blink, unsure if I want to hug her or kill her. \u201cThen break up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou crazy ass bitch!\u201d From the gap between the two apartment buildings, Mom\u2019s boyfriend flies toward her and smacks her face with an open palm. The slap of his hand across her cheek vibrates against my skin. The baseball bat falls from her hands and bounces three times, tip to bottom, against the blacktop.</p><p>Each hollow crack of the wood heightens my senses. It settles on the ground and rolls toward my feet.</p><p>He yells at her. All curses, but his words blend into a buzzing noise in my head. He hit me last year. He hits Mom. He won\u2019t hit either one of us again.</p><p>He raises his hand. Mom throws out her arms to protect her face as she kneels in front of him. I grab the bat. Take two steps. Swing it behind my shoulder and...</p><p>\u201cPolice! Drop the bat! Get on the ground!\u201d</p><p>Three uniformed officers surround us. Damn.</p><p>My heart pounds hard against my chest. I should have thought of this, but I didn\u2019t, and the mistake will cost me. The cops patrol the complex regularly.</p><p>The asshole points at me. \u201cShe did it. That crazy ass girl took out my car. Her mom and I, we tried to stop it, but then she went nuts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the bat! Hands on your head.\u201d</p><p>Dazed from his blatant lie, I forgot I still held it. The wooden grip feels rough against my hands. I drop it and listen to the same hollow thumping as it once again bounces on the ground. Placing my hands behind my head, I stare down at my mom. Waiting. Waiting for her to explain. Waiting for her to defend us.</p><p>Mom stays on her knees in front of the asshole. She subtly shakes her head and mouths the word please to me.</p><p>Please? Please what? I widen my eyes, begging for her to explain.</p><p>She mouths one more word: probation.</p><p>An officer kicks the bat from us and pats me down. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI destroyed the car.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>SWEAT DRIPS FROM MY SCALP and slithers down my forehead, forcing me to wipe my brow before shoving the cap back on. The afternoon sun beats on me as if I\u2019m simmering in hell\u2019s roasting pan. August games are the worst.</p><p>My hands sweat. I don\u2019t care about my left hand\u2014the one wearing the glove. It\u2019s the throwing hand I rub repeatedly on my pant leg.</p><p>My heart pounds in my ears and I fight off a wave of dizziness. The smell of burnt popcorn and hot dogs drifts from the concession stand, and my stomach cramps. I stayed out too late last night.</p><p>Taking a look at the scoreboard, I watch as the temperature rises from ninety-five degrees to ninety-six. Heat index has to be over one hundred. In theory, the moment the index hits one-o-five, the umps should call the game. In theory.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter if the temperature was below zero. My stomach would still cramp. My hands would still sweat. The pressure\u2014it builds continually, twisting my insides to the point of implosion.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ry!\u201d Chris, our shortstop, yells from between second and third.</p><p>His lone battle cry instigates calls from the rest of the team\u2014those on the field and those sitting on the bench. I shouldn\u2019t say sitting.</p><p>Everyone in the dugout stands with their fingers clenched around the fence.</p><p>Bottom of the seventh, we\u2019re up by one run, two outs, and I screwed up and pitched a runner to first. Damn curveball. I\u2019ve thrown one strike and two balls with the current batter.</p><p>No more room for error. Two more strikes and the game\u2019s over. Two more balls and I walk a batter, giving the other team a runner in scoring position.</p><p>The crowd joins in. They clap, whistle, and cheer. No one louder than Dad.</p><p>Grasping the ball tightly, I take a deep breath, wrap my right arm behind my back, and lean forward to read Logan\u2019s signal. The stress of this next pitch hangs on me.</p><p>Everyone wants this game done. No one more than me.</p><p>I don\u2019t lose.</p><p>Logan crouches into position behind the batter and does something unexpected. He pulls his catcher\u2019s mask onto the top of his head, places his hand between his legs, and flips me off.</p><p>Damn bastard.</p><p>Logan flaunts a grin and his reminder causes my shoulders to relax. It\u2019s only the first game of the fall season. A scrimmage game at that. I nod and he slides his mask over his face and flashes me the peace sign twice.</p><p>Fastball it is.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder toward first. The runner\u2019s taken a lead in his hunt for second, but not enough to chance a steal. I cock my arm back and throw with a rush of power and adrenaline. My heart thumps twice at the sweet sound of the ball smacking into Logan\u2019s glove and the words \u201cStrike two\u201d falling out of the umpire\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Logan fires the ball back and I waste no time preparing for the next pitch. This will be it. My team can go home\u2014victorious.</p><p>Logan holds his pinkie and ring fingers together. I shake my head. I want to close this out and a fastball will do it, not a curve. Logan hesitates before showing me two peace signs.</p><p>That\u2019s my boy. He knows I can bring on the heat.</p><p>Keeping his hand between his legs, he pauses, then points away from the batter, telling me that my fastballs have been straying outside. I nod. An understanding to keep placement in mind with my speed. The ball flies out of my hand, punches Logan\u2019s glove right in the middle, and the umpire shouts, \u201cBall!\u201d</p><p>I stop breathing. That was a strike.</p><p>The fence rattles as my teammates bang on it, screaming at the injustice. Shouting at the umpire, Coach stands on the verge of no-man\u2019s-land between the dugout and the field.</p><p>My friends on the field whistle at the bad call.</p><p>The crowd murmurs and boos. In the bleachers, with her head down and lost in prayer, Mom grasps the pearls that hang around her neck.</p><p>Dammit. I yank hard on the bill of my hat, trying to calm the blood racing in my veins.</p><p>Bad calls suck, but they happen. I\u2019ve got one more shot to close this out. One more...</p><p>\u201cThat was a strike.\u201d Dad steps off the bleachers and heads to the fence right behind the umpire. The players and the crowd fall silent. Dad demands fairness. Well, his version of fair.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the stands, Mr. Stone,\u201d the ump says. Everyone in this town knows Dad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll return to my seat when we have an ump that can call fair. You\u2019ve been calling bad this entire game.\u201d Even though he said it loud enough for the entire park to hear, he never raised his voice. Dad\u2019s a commanding man and someone this entire town admires.</p><p>From behind the fence, Dad towers over the short, fat ump and waits for someone to make right what he views as a wrong. We\u2019re carbon copies of each other, my dad and I. Sandy hair and brown eyes. Long legs. All shoulders and upper arms. Grandma said people like Dad and me were built for hard labor. Dad said we were built for baseball.</p><p>My coach steps onto the field along with the coach from the other team. I agree. The ump\u2019s been calling bad, on both sides, but I find it ironic that no one had the guts to say anything until Dad declared war.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s the man.\u201d Chris walks onto the pitcher\u2019s mound.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The man. I glance over to Mom again and at the empty space where my older brother, Mark, used to sit. Mark\u2019s absence stings more than I thought it would. I extend my glove out to Logan, who has inched away from the four men discussing the fairness of the calls. He automatically pitches the ball back.</p><p>Chris scans the crowd. \u201cNotice who came to the game?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother looking. Lacy always attends Chris\u2019s games.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d he says with a canary-ate-the-cat grin. \u201cLacy heard she\u2019s into you again.\u201d</p><p>I react without thinking and turn my head to search the bleachers for her. For two years, Gwen and baseball were my entire life. The breeze blows through Gwen\u2019s long blond hair and, as if she could sense my stare, she looks at me and smiles. Last year, I loved that smile. A smile once reserved for me. Several months have passed since that time. Mom still loves her. I\u2019m not sure how I feel anymore. A guy scales the bleachers and puts his arm around her. Yeah, rub it in, asshole. I\u2019m well aware Gwen and I are done.</p> <p>\u201cPlay ball!\u201d The voice of a new ump booms from the batter\u2019s box. The old ump shakes hands with Dad on the other side of the fence.</p><p>As I said, Dad believes in fairness and also thinks justice should be served with a man\u2019s pride still intact. Well, for every man that isn\u2019t my brother.</p><p>Everyone off the field claps and watches my father return to his seat. Some people extend their hands to him. Others pat his back. Off the field, Dad\u2019s the leader of this community. On the field, I\u2019m the man.</p><p>Out of the batter\u2019s box, the batter takes a few practice swings. Two strikes. Three balls. And the kid knows I can bring heat. I whistle and gesture for Logan.</p><p>Beside me, Chris laughs. He knows I\u2019m up to no good. Logan approaches with his catcher\u2019s mask on top of his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p> <p>This is what a great catcher does. \u201cThe batter was sluggish, but he\u2019s had a break, which means he\u2019ll give it everything he has.</p><p>Your fast has been wandering outside and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>I roll the ball in my fingers. \u201cHe\u2019ll be expecting fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was him, I\u2019d expect you to throw fast,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>I shrug my shoulder and the muscles yell in protest. \u201cLet\u2019s do a changeup. He\u2019ll read it as fast and won\u2019t have enough time to readjust.\u201d</p><p>A smile slides across Chris\u2019s face and he places his glove over his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re popping him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re popping him out,\u201d I repeat, hiding my own lips with my glove.</p><p>I turn toward the field and whistle to get everyone\u2019s attention. Chris goes back to short, slides his open hand across his chest, and taps his left arm with his right hand twice. The center fielder runs up, and our second baseman passes on the message. By the time I face the batter, Logan\u2019s already sent the message to first and third.</p> <p>Logan flips his mask over his face, crouches into position, and holds his glove out for the pitch. Yeah, I\u2019m closing this out.</p><p>\u201cSEE YOU TONIGHT, DAWG.\u201d Chris kicks my foot as he walks past. He cradles his bat bag in one hand and Lacy\u2019s hand in the other. Chris and I met Lacy when our schools combined in sixth grade. I liked her the day she skinned her knee playing football with the boys. Chris fell in love with her the day she pushed him on the playground after he tagged her out in baseball.</p><p>They\u2019ve been a couple since sophomore year\u2014the year he grew a pair and finally asked her out.</p><p>Lacy pulls a rubber band off her wrist and twists her brown hair into a messy bun. I love that she isn\u2019t a girly girl. In order to keep up with me, Chris, and Logan, a girl has to have thick skin. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014she\u2019s hot as hell, but Lacy doesn\u2019t give a damn what others think of her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the party tonight.</p><p>I want conversation and people and dancing.</p><p>There is more to life than batting cages and dares.\u201d</p><p>With our fingers frozen on unlacing our cleats, Logan and I snap up our heads. Chris\u2019s face blanches. \u201cThat\u2019s sacrilegious, Lace. Take it back.\u201d</p><p>Next to me, Logan shoves his feet into his Nikes and tosses his cleats into his bag. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the thrill of winning a good dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDares aren\u2019t fun,\u201d she says, the reprimand thick in her tone. \u201cThey\u2019re crazy. You set my car on fire.\u201d</p><p>Logan holds up his hand. \u201cI opened the window in time. In my defense, the upholstery is barely singed.\u201d</p><p>Chris and I chuckle at the memory of Lacy screaming as she was doing forty on a curve.</p><p>The short story: a hamburger wrapper, a lighter, a stopwatch, and a dare. Logan accidentally dropped the blazing wrapper and it rolled under Lacy\u2019s seat. One patented I\u2019ll-kick-you-until-you-drop glare from Lacy shuts us both up. \u201cI wish you\u2019d get a girlfriend so she can drive your insane ass around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Logan waggles his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m Ryan\u2019s wingman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWingman.\u201d She spits the word, then points a sparkly fingernail at both me and Logan, but I don\u2019t miss how it lingers on me. \u201cOne of you needs to find a girl and commit. I\u2019m tired of this testosterone bull.\u201d</p><p>Lacy hates the string of girls I\u2019ve dated over the summer. She\u2019s terrified I\u2019ll influence Chris to drop her, though she should know better. Chris reveres her as his own personal religion.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t approve of the one I committed to last time,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy should I try again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can do better than evil.\u201d</p><p>I drop my tone. \u201cGwen\u2019s not evil.\u201d Gwen and I broke up, but there\u2019s no reason to talk trash about her.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d mumbles Logan.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ryan.\u201d I turn my head to witness Gwen in all her glory. A blue cotton dress swishes around her tanned legs, and she wears a new-to-me pair of cowboy boots. Hand-curled</p><p>ringlets bounce at the ends of her long blond hair. Surrounded by her three best girlfriends, she floats right past, but keeps her green eyes locked on me.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d I say in return. Reaching the concession stand, she sweeps her hair over her shoulder as she refocuses her attention. I keep staring, trying to remember why we broke up.</p><p>\u201cDrama!\u201d Lacy purposely blocks my view of Gwen\u2019s ass. \u201cShe was nothing but drama.</p><p>Remember? You said, \u2018Lacy, there\u2019s nothing real about her,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I know,\u2019 and I happily threw an \u2018I told you so\u2019 in your face.</p><p>Then you said, \u2018Don\u2019t let me go back to her,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Can I rip off your balls if you attempt it,\u2019 and you said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I said no because Lacy would actually do it, and I prefer my balls attached, but I did ask her to remind me of that conversation if I became weak. Logan and I should ask some girls to the movies next weekend. Hell, if Skater Girl had given me her number, I might even have considered calling her. God knows she was sexy as hell and when it comes to Gwen, a distraction always helps.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Logan,\u201d says Chris. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home.\u201d</p><p>Near the dugout, Dad wraps an arm around Mom as the two of them chat with Coach and a man dressed in a polo shirt and khakis. I wonder if anyone else notices how Mom leans slightly away from Dad\u2019s body. Probably not.</p><p>Mom\u2019s in homecoming-court mode, all smiles and laughs.</p><p>From over his shoulder, Dad indicates I should join them by giving me one of his rare I\u2019m-proud-of-you smiles. It makes me unbalanced. Yeah, we won, but we win a lot.</p><p>It\u2019s what state champions do. Why the outpouring of pride now?</p><p>As I said, Dad and I are clones, except for the age and the skin. Years of rain, sun, heat, and cold have seasoned his face. Owning a construction company requires a lot of time in the elements. \u201cRyan, this is Mr. Davis.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Davis and I both offer our hands at the same time. He\u2019s tall, thin, and possibly my father\u2019s age, except Mr. Davis doesn\u2019t look weathered. \u201cCall me Rob. Congratulations on a well-played game. You have a hell of a fastball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d I\u2019ve heard it before. Mom tells everyone God gave me a gift, and while I\u2019m not sure what I think of that, I won\u2019t deny I\u2019ve enjoyed the ride. Too bad Dad and I couldn\u2019t garner any interest at pro baseball tryouts.</p><p>I\u2019m used to meetings and introductions.</p><p>Because Dad owns his own company and has a seat on the city council, he\u2019s into networking.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Dad\u2019s not the power-hungry sort. He declined running for mayor several times, even though my mom has been begging him to consider it for years. He\u2019s just real into the community.</p><p>Rob tilts his head to the field. \u201cDo you mind throwing a couple for me?\u201d</p><p>Mom, Dad, and Coach share knowing grins and I feel like someone told a joke and left me out of the punch line. Or maybe I am the punch line. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Rob pulls a radar gun and a business card out of the bag. He keeps the radar gun in his left hand and hands me the card. \u201cI came here today to watch a player from the other team.</p><p>Didn\u2019t see what I was looking for with him, but I think I found something promising with you.\u201d</p><p>Dad claps my back, and his public showing of affection has me looking at him. Dad\u2019s not a touchy guy. My family\u2014we aren\u2019t like that. I grip the card in my hand, and it takes everything I\u2019ve got not to swear in shock in front of my mother. The man heading to the area behind home plate is Rob Davis, scout for the Cincinnati Reds.</p><p>\u201cTold you that spring tryouts weren\u2019t the end of it.\u201d Dad motions for me to follow Rob. \u201cGo blow him away.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>THE OLDER PRISON GUARD, the nice one, walks beside me. He didn\u2019t put the cuffs on supertight like the other dickhead guard. He isn\u2019t in my face, trying to scare the shit out of me. He\u2019s not trying to reenact a scene from Cops. He just walks next to me, ignoring my existence.</p><p>I\u2019m all for silence after listening to a girl come down from a bad acid trip last night.</p><p>Maybe it was today.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a clue what time of day it is.</p><p>They gave me breakfast.</p><p>They discussed lunch.</p><p>It must be morning. Maybe midday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guard opens the door to what I can only describe as an interrogation room. Other than the holding cell I\u2019ve shared with the fifteen-year-old who\u2019s way too strung out for my taste, this is where I\u2019ve spent the majority of my time since they arrested me for destruction of property. The guard relaxes his back against the wall. I sit at the table.</p><p>I need a cigarette.</p><p>Bad.</p><p>Unbelievably bad.</p> <p>Like I would rip off my own arm if I could get one drag.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you coming down from?\u201d The guard stares at my fingers.</p><p>I stop tapping the table. \u201cNicotine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rough,\u201d he says. \u201cI never kicked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It fucking blows.\u201d</p> <p>The police officer who arrested me last night\u2014this morning\u2014steps into the room.</p><p>\u201cShe speaks.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Didn\u2019t mean to. I clamp my mouth shut. Last night, this morning\u2014who the hell knows\u2014I managed to keep silent when they grilled me on my mom, my home life, my mom\u2019s boyfriend. I refused to talk, refused to say one word, because if I did, I could have said the wrong thing and sent my mom to jail.</p><p>There\u2019s no way I could live with that.</p><p>I have no idea what happened to her or her boyfriend after they snapped the handcuffs on my wrist and sat me in the back of the squad car. If God\u2019s hearing prayers from me, then maybe Mom\u2019s in the clear and the asshole\u2019s sharing a urinal with the other felons-of-the-month.</p><p>The officer resembles a twenty-year-old Johnny Depp, and he smells clean\u2014soap with a hint of coffee. He\u2019s not the one who tried to talk to me last night. Just the guy that arrested me. He settles into the seat across from me and the guard leaves.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Officer Monroe.\u201d</p><p>I glare at the table.</p><p>Officer Monroe reaches over, unlocks the cuffs, and slides them to his side of the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what really happened last night?\u201d</p><p>Just one drag. Oh God, it\u2019d be better than a deep kiss from a really hot guy. But I\u2019m not kissing a hot guy and I don\u2019t have a cigarette because I\u2019m currently being questioned in purgatory.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s boyfriend, Trent\u2014we know he\u2019s bad news, but he\u2019s smart. We\u2019ve never gotten enough to put him away. Maybe you can help us and yourself. Help us put him in jail, then he\u2019ll be away from you and your mom.\u201d</p><p>I agree\u2014he\u2019s Satan. Other than the fact that he\u2019s a washed up has-been of a football player who traded tackling men on the field for beating the shit out of women, though, I have nothing to tell them beyond rumors I\u2019ve heard on the street. The cops who walk the south-side beat are well aware of our bedtime stories regarding The Asshole Known as Trent. The tantalizing tidbit that he hits me and Mom could get us a flimsy piece of paper with the words Emergency Protection Order on the header, but domestic violence offenders rarely sit inside jail cells for long, plus Trent burns EPOs and puppies for fun.</p><p>Even before my mother got involved with Trent, the police were after him, but he\u2019s the walking, talking real-life version of an oil spill\u2014impossible to pick up once he\u2019s been released. Helping the police will only bring the ooze and his sickening wrath quicker to our doorstep.</p> <p>\u201cHe lives in the same apartment complex as your mom, right? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to live with her again and not have to worry about him?\u201d</p><p>Having no idea how he knows I don\u2019t live with my mom, I fight hard not to glance at him. Refusing to indicate he\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know he was dating your mom. He, uh, sees other women.\u201d</p><p>I keep from rolling my eyes. There\u2019s a shock.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d he says after my nonresponse.</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d I hate my given name. \u201cMy name is Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth, your one phone call has been standing in the lobby since five a.m.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah! My eyes flash to Officer Monroe\u2019s.</p><p>The walls I built to protect myself crumble and fatigue sets in as the iciness I\u2019ve clung to all night melts. Fear and hurt rush to take its place.</p><p>I want Isaiah. I don\u2019t want to be here. I want to go home.</p><p>I blink, realizing the stinging sensation is tears. Wiping at my face, I try to find my strength\u2014my resolve, but I only find a heavy emptiness. \u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d</p><p>Someone knocks. Officer Monroe cracks the door open and exchanges a few heated whispers before nodding. Seconds later, my aunt, an older and cleaner version of my mother, walks in. \u201cBeth?\u201d</p><p>Officer Monroe leaves, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Shirley comes straight to me. I stand and let her hug me. She smells like home: stale cigarettes and lavender fabric softener. I bury my face in my aunt\u2019s shoulder, wishing for nothing more than to lie in the bed in her basement for a week.</p><p>A cigarette is a close second.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Isaiah?\u201d Though I\u2019m grateful for my aunt, my heart was set on seeing my best friend.</p><p>\u201cOutside. He called me the moment he heard from you.\u201d Shirley squeezes me before breaking our embrace. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have you seen Mom?\u201d</p><p>She nods, then leans in and whispers in my ear, \u201cYour mom told me what really happened.\u201d</p><p>The muscles around my mouth tighten and I try to stop my lower lip from trembling. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>Shirley runs her hands up and down my arms. \u201cStick with your story. They brought Trent and your mom in for questioning. With you not talking, they couldn\u2019t find anything to arrest them on. Your mom\u2019s twitchy though. If you talk, they\u2019ll send her to jail for breaking probation and the destruction of property. She\u2019s scared of going to jail.\u201d</p><p>So am I, but Mom can\u2019t hack jail. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d</p><p>Her arms drop to her sides and she places the table between us. It\u2019s only a few steps, but it creates a gap resembling a canyon. I turned seventeen last month. Before tonight, I felt like an adult: old and big. I don\u2019t feel so big anymore. Right now I feel small and very, very alone. \u201cShirley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle and I don\u2019t have money for a lawyer. Isaiah and Noah, even that girl Noah brings around, they offered what they had, but your uncle and I got scared once the cops told us you took a bat to Trent. Then I had an idea.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks as if someone yanked a trapdoor right below it. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want anything to do with your dad\u2019s side, but his brother, Scott\u2014he\u2019s a good man. Left that baseball team and became a businessman. He has a lawyer. A fancy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d My mouth gapes.</p><p>\u201cHow...what...\u201d My breathing becomes shallow as I try to make sense of the insanity falling out of my aunt\u2019s lips. \u201cImpossible. He left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cBut he moved back to his hometown last month and he called me to find you. He wanted you to go live with him and his wife, but we blew him off. Your mom talked to him when he got persistent and she told him you ran away.\u201d</p><p>My lip curls at the thought of him anywhere near me. \u201cGood choice. So why involve Scott now? We don\u2019t need him. We can figure this out without him or his fancy lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said you were going to hit Trent with a bat,\u201d Shirley repeats as she wrings her hands together. \u201cThat\u2019s serious and I thought we needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m in hell. Or pretty damn close.</p><p>\u201cWe would have respected your wishes about him, but then this happened and...I called him. Listen to me, he has a great life now. Lots of money and he wants you.\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh. Only it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s not even close to funny. It\u2019s the saddest damn thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I collapse into the seat and rest my head in my hands. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got the charges dropped.\u201d Not a hint of happiness can be found in her voice.</p><p>I keep my face hidden, unable to look at her to see whatever truth she\u2019s been building toward. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I ask again.</p><p>Shirley kneels beside me and pitches her voice low. \u201cWhen I called him, your uncle Scott went to your mom\u2019s apartment. He saw things he shouldn\u2019t have seen. Things that can hurt your mom.\u201d</p><p>I sway to the side as if I\u2019ve been hit by a wave and the rushing sound of being sucked into the ocean whirls in my ears. My world is crashing around me. He went into my old room. Mom told me never to go in there after I left to live with Shirley. I never have. There are things even I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell the police,\u201d she says.</p><p>Shocked by her revelation, I peek at her through my fingers. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Shirley\u2019s lips turn down and she scrunches her forehead. \u201cYour mom had no choice. He walked into the station with his lawyer and made the demand\u2014she either turned over custody of you to him, or he would tell the cops what he saw.\u201d</p><p>My aunt stares at me, her eyes bleak. \u201cShe signed over custody. He\u2019s your legal guardian now.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>THANKS TO THE SHOWERS at the community center, there\u2019s no need to head home. Clean and dressed in street clothes, I return to heaven.</p><p>Everyone has left the ballpark. The bleachers are empty. The concession stand closed. Kenny Chesney blares from the parking lot, meaning that Chris ignored me when I told him I\u2019d catch up with him later. Chris is really good at three things\u2014playing shortstop, loving his girl, and knowing what I need even when I don\u2019t know it myself.</p><p>At least most of the time.</p><p>From the community pool, little kids squeal in delight in time to the sounds of splashing and the bounce of the diving board. My brother Mark and I spent most of our summers swimming in that pool. The other part, we spent playing ball.</p><p>I stand on the pitcher\u2019s mound, except this time I\u2019m in blue jeans and my favorite Reds Tshirt. The early evening sky fades from blue to orange-and-yellow. It\u2019s no longer a million degrees and the breeze shifts from the south to the north. This is my favorite part of the game\u2014the time alone afterward.</p><p>The rush of winning and the knowledge I have a scout interested in me still linger in my blood. My lungs expand with clean oxygen and my muscles lose the tension that weighed me down during the game. I feel relaxed, at peace, and alive.</p><p>I stare at home plate and in my mind I see Logan crouched in position and the batter taking a practice swing. My fingers curl as if I\u2019m clutching the ball. Logan calls for a curve; I accept, except this time I...</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be here.\u201d In her brown leather cowboy boots and blue dress, Gwen swings around the gate into the dugout.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou screwed up the curve.\u201d In one smooth motion, Gwen sits on the bench in the dugout and pats the wood beside her. She\u2019s playing a game. One I\u2019ll lose, but damn if my feet don\u2019t move toward her.</p><p>She looks good. Better than good. Beautiful.</p><p>I ease down beside her as she tosses her blond ringlets behind her shoulder. \u201cI remember you explaining the bases to me in this dugout. The best baseball conversation we ever had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean forward and clasp my hands together.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you missed part of the conversation, because I wasn\u2019t explaining baseball.\u201d</p><p>Gwen flashes her bright smile. \u201cI know, but I still enjoyed the demonstration.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes meet for a moment and I glance away when heat crawls along my cheeks.</p> <p>Gwen\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve had any real experience with. She used to blush when she talked about anything sexual, but she doesn\u2019t today. Nausea rolls through my gut. What new bases has Mike taught her?</p><p>\u201cYou seemed out of it during the game.\u201d The material of her dress swishes as she crosses her legs and angles her body toward mine. Our thighs touch now, creating heat. I wonder if she notices. \u201cAre you having problems with your dad again?\u201d</p><p>Gwen and I spent countless afternoons and evenings in this dugout. She always knew when Dad pushed me too far with the refs or that if I played like crap, I\u2019d come here for clarity. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Everything. Mom and Dad fighting. Mark\u2019s absence. Me and pro ball. My friends/not-friends relationship with Gwen. For a moment, I think about telling her about Mark. Like the rest of the town, she remains blissfully unaware. I stare into her eyes and search for the girl I first met my freshman year. She wouldn\u2019t have messed with me then.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I\u2019ve since become her favorite pastime. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to be played, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>Gwen raises her hand and twirls her hair around her finger. The glint of a large red-stoned ring strikes me like an ice pick. I shift so that our thighs no longer touch. \u201cMike gave you his class ring.\u201d</p><p>She drops her hand and covers it with the other, as if hiding the ring will make me forget it\u2019s there. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d If I could have let more anger seep out I would have.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My voice rises with each word. \u201cFor starters, not be here screwing with me.\u201d</p> <p>She ignores my comment as her own voice hardens. \u201cMike\u2019s a good guy and he\u2019s always around. He\u2019s not gone all the time and doesn\u2019t have a thousand commitments like you.\u201d</p><p>In all of our breaks and breakups, we never fought. Never raised our voices at each other.</p><p>Before, I never considered yelling at Gwen; now it\u2019s the only thing I want to do. \u201cI told you that I loved you. What else could you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be first. Baseball always came first with you. God! How much clearer a picture did you need? I broke up with you at the beginning of your seasons.\u201d</p><p>I stand up, unable to sit next to her. How much clearer a picture? Obviously I needed detailed drawings with written directions. \u201cYou could have told me that\u2019s how you felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it have changed anything? Would you have given up baseball?\u201d</p><p>I curl my fingers into the metal of the fence and stare out at the field. How could she ask that type of question? Why would any girl ask a guy to give up something he loves?</p><p>Gwen\u2019s playing games right now and I\u2019ve decided to throw the pitch that ends the inning.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I hear her sharp intake of air and the guilt of hurting her punches me in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just baseball,\u201d she rushes out.</p><p>How can I make her understand? Beyond the fence is a raised mound, a trail of dirt leading to four bases all surrounded by a groomed green field. It\u2019s the only place where I\u2019ve felt like I belonged.</p><p>\u201cBaseball isn\u2019t just a game. It\u2019s the smell of popcorn drifting in the air, the sight of bugs buzzing near the stadium lights, the roughness of the dirt beneath your cleats. It\u2019s the anticipation building in your chest as the anthem plays, the adrenaline rush when your bat cracks against the ball, and the surge of blood when the umpire shouts strike after you pitch. It\u2019s a team full of guys backing your every move, a bleacher full of people cheering you on. It\u2019s...life.\u201d</p><p>The clapping of hands to my right causes me to jump out of my skin. In pink hair and a matching swimsuit cover-up, my junior</p><p>English teacher and soon-to-be senior English teacher stops the annoying sound and raises her hands to her chin as if in prayer. \u201cThat was poetry, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Gwen and I share a what-the-hell look before returning our stares to Mrs. Rowe.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She picks her beach bag up off the ground and swings it. \u201cThe pool closed for the night. I saw you and Ms. Gardner and decided to remind the two of you that your first personal essay is due to me on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s boots stamp on the ground as she switches legs again. A month ago, Mrs. Rowe tried to ruin everyone\u2019s vacation with a summer homework assignment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited to read them,\u201d she continues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve completed yours?\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019t even started. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Gwen stands and readjusts Mike\u2019s ring on her finger. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d And she does.</p><p>Without another word. I shove my hands in my pockets and rock on my feet, waiting for Mrs.</p><p>Rowe to follow Gwen\u2019s lead. I\u2019ve got a ritual to complete.</p><p>Obviously having no intention of leaving, Mrs. Rowe leans her shoulder against the dugout entrance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding about what you said, Ryan. You showed a lot of talent in my class last year. Between that and what I just heard, I\u2019d say you have the voice of a writer.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh. Sure, that class was more interesting than math, but... \u201cI\u2019m a ballplayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and from what I hear a fine one, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be both.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Rowe is always looking for a book convert. She even started a literary club at school last year. My name isn\u2019t on that roster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>She glances over her shoulder toward</p><p>Chris\u2019s truck. \u201cPlease tell Mr. Jones that his paper is also due on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Again I wait for her to leave. Again she doesn\u2019t. She just stands there. Uncomfortable, I mumble a goodbye and head for the parking lot.</p><p>I try to shake off the irritating itch embedded in my neck, but I can\u2019t. That moment on the mound is hallowed ground. A need. A must.</p><p>My mother calls it a superstition. I\u2019ll call it whatever she wants, but in order for me to win the next game, I have to stand on that mound again\u2014by myself\u2014and figure out the mistake I made with my curveball.</p><p>If not, it means bad mojo. For the team. For my pitch. For my life.</p><p>With his head tilted back and eyes closed, Chris sits in his old black Ford. His door hangs wide open. Chris worked his ass off for that truck. He plowed his granddaddy\u2019s cornfield this summer in return for a leaky truck that rolled off the line when we were seven.</p><p>\u201cI told you to head home.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his eyes closed. \u201cI told you to let the bad throw go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d We both know I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Chris comes to life, closes the door, and turns over the motor. \u201cHop in. We\u2019ve got a party to go to that will make you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a ride.\u201d I motion to my Jeep, parked next to his truck.</p><p>\u201cMy goal is to make sure you ain\u2019t gonna be fit to drive home.\u201d He revs the engine to keep it from stalling out. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>OFFICER MONROE PUSHES OFF THE WALL the moment I slip out of the girls\u2019 bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk to him, but I\u2019m not real giddy for the long-lost uncle reunion either. I pause, folding my arms over my chest. \u201cI thought I was free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d Officer Monroe has clearly mastered the Johnny Depp puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to tell me what happened last night, I want you to call.\u201d He holds out a card.</p><p>Never going to happen. I would rather die than send Mom to jail. I brush past him and walk into the lobby. Hurting my eyes, the sun glares through the windows and the glass doors. I blink away the brightness and spot Isaiah, Noah, and Echo. Isaiah leaps to his feet, but Noah puts a hand on his shoulder and whispers something to him, nodding to the left.</p><p>Isaiah stays still. His steely-gray eyes implore me to come to him. I want to. More than anything.</p><p>Two people cross in front of Isaiah, and pain slices my chest. It\u2019s my mom. Like some sort of deranged baby monkey, she clings to her asshole boyfriend. Her eyes are desperate. She sucks her cheeks in as if she\u2019s trying to hold back tears. That bastard has engulfed her in his disgusting life. I swear to God, I\u2019m going to drag her back out.</p><p>Trent yanks her out the door. It\u2019s not over, asshole. Not even close.</p><p>I\u2019m about to step toward Isaiah when I hear it. \u201cHello, Elisabeth.\u201d A shiver snakes down my spine. That voice reminds me of my father.</p><p>I turn to face the man who\u2019s hell-bent on destroying my life. He resembles my father in looks as well: tall, dark brown hair, blue eyes.</p><p>The main difference is that Scott\u2019s built like an athlete, whereas my father had the body mass of a meth head.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He gives Isaiah the judgmental once-over. \u201cI think you\u2019ve been left alone for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to care. I know your promises are worth shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get out of here, now that you\u2019re free to go. We can talk at home.\u201d</p><p>Scott puts a hand on my arm and is unmoved when I jerk away. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says in an annoyingly even tone.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my back tense as if I\u2019m a cat arching its back to hiss. \u201cDid you just tell me what to do?\u201d</p><p>Fingers wrap around my wrist and gently pull me to the left. Isaiah hovers over me and speaks in a hushed tone. \u201cDo you need a reminder you\u2019re in a police station?\u201d</p><p>I sneak a peek and notice Officer Monroe and another cop watching our dysfunctional family reunion. My uncle regards Isaiah and me with interest, but keeps his distance.</p><p>My body is nothing but anger. Rage. It beats at my lungs, wreaks havoc with my blood. And Isaiah is standing here telling me to rein it in? I have to let it go because it\u2019s consuming me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah does something he\u2019s never done sober. He touches his hand to my cheek. His palm feels warm, strong, and safe. I lean into it as the anger drains from his simple touch. Part of me craves that anger. I don\u2019t care for the frightening emptiness left behind.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he whispers. \u201cGo with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God I\u2019m going to take care of you, but I can\u2019t do it right here. Go with him and wait for me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I nod as I finally comprehend what he\u2019s attempting to tell me without saying the words.</p><p>He\u2019s going to come for me. A shimmer of hope breaks through the emptiness and I fall into the safety of Isaiah\u2019s protective arms, our bodies pressed tight to one another.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>IN THE BACK FIELD that borders three farms, a field party rages without me, Logan, and Chris. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parties are great. They have girls, girls who drink beer, dancing, girls who like dancing, and guys who hate dancing but do it anyway in the hope of laying the girls who drink beer.</p><p>Lacy\u2019s in the mood to dance, Chris is in the mood to avoid dancing, I\u2019m still burnt from Skater Girl last night, and Logan\u2019s always game for the stupid and insane. Ten minutes into the party, Lacy was dancing and the three of us took on a dare. Actually, I took on a dare.</p><p>I lost last night and I don\u2019t lose. Chris and Logan are along for the ride.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pull this one off.\u201d Chris walks beside me as we head toward the cars parked neatly in a line. The full moon gives the field a silver glow and the scent of bonfire smoke hangs in the air.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have no imagination.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, I have plenty and I know a few guys who get a kick out of screwing with friends.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be sweet,\u201d Logan says when I change course and head toward a group of defensive linemen enjoying their own private party.</p><p>Tim Richardson owns a mammoth-size, ozone-killing truck, which is good, because the four guys sitting on lawn chairs on the back of it easily weigh 275 pounds each. Tim liberates a can of beer from his cooler and tosses it to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Ry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I put the cold can on the tailgate.</p> <p>No drinking for me. I\u2019ve got business to take care of. \u201cNot in the mood for the party?\u201d</p><p>His truck is one of the few that can make it over the hill into the back field. \u201cA girl over there is pissed at me,\u201d Tim mutters. \u201cAnytime I go near her, she won\u2019t keep her mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Logan snorts and Chris smacks him on the back of the head. Pissed would be an understatement. Rumor at school said Tim\u2019s ex-girl caught him making out with her twin sister. Tim throws a warning glare at Logan before focusing on me. \u201cHow\u2019s your brother?</p><p>The team\u2019s ticked at him. He promised he\u2019d help with summer practice while he was home from college.\u201d</p><p>Hating these kinds of questions, I shift my stance and shove my hands in my pockets. Dad made it clear that we tell no one what happened with Mark. \u201cHe\u2019s been busy.\u201d Before Tim has a chance to probe further, I switch to the problem at hand. \u201cHow would you guys like to help me with a...situation?\u201d</p><p>Tim leans forward as his fellow linemen snicker. \u201cWhat dare did you sign up for this time?\u201d</p> <p>I bob my head back and forth like what I\u2019m preparing to ask isn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cNothing fancy. Rick dared me to move his car.\u201d</p><p>Tim shrugs because it doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal.</p><p>\u201cWithout the keys,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>Tim lowers his head, and deep chuckles resonate from his chest. \u201cYou three are the definition of insane. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy that tackles other dudes for fun,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you in or out?\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s lawn chair moves with him as he stands. As he reaches his full height, the chair plunges onto the bed of the truck with a loud clank. \u201cIn.\u201d</p><p>CURLED FINGERS MISERABLY clutch metal and my back and thighs burn with pain. Seven guys, one 2,400-pound car, and one more inch to go.</p><p>\u201cOn three,\u201d I say through clenched teeth.</p> <p>\u201cOne...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d yells Logan and I barely unwedge my fingers from the bumper of the two-door Chevy Aveo when the six other guys drop the car to the ground. The frame of the blue car bounces like a Slinky before coming to a rest.</p><p>\u201cSweet shocks,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>Sweat soaks my shirt. Gasping for air, I bend over and place my hands on my knees. The rush of the win races through my veins and I laugh out loud.</p><p>Logan admires our handiwork. \u201cSix feet over and nicely parallel parked between two trees.\u201d Nicely meaning the front and rear bumpers currently kiss bark.</p><p>Tim\u2019s chest heaves as if he\u2019s experiencing a heart attack. \u201cYou\u2019re a crazy son-of-a-bitch, Ry.\u201d Pant. \u201cHow the hell is Rick going to move this piece of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, Logan, and I will stick around. Once he gets done freaking, we\u2019ll lift the back end and move it so he can wedge out.\u201d</p><p>Tim laughs while shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at school on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Let\u2019s go, guys. I need a beer.\u201d</p><p>I sag to the ground and lean against the tree near the bumper. Chris slides against the passenger door until his butt hits the dirt. We both stare at Logan, waiting for him to join us, but he\u2019s busy studying the two oak trees pinning in our third baseman\u2019s car.</p><p>In any circle that doesn\u2019t involve me, Chris, and Lacy, Logan is known for silence and his constant state of boredom. At the moment, so-called silent, bored boy\u2019s mind is spinning like a toddler on a sugar high. It\u2019s ironic: at school, people think I\u2019m the adrenaline junkie because I admire a good dare. Hell, I\u2019m not looking for a high\u2014I just like to win. Logan, on the other hand, thrives on the edge. Gotta love a guy like that.</p><p>I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s noticed Logan\u2019s insane infatuation with the tree. Chris eyes him warily. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Junior?\u201d</p><p>Logan winks at me. \u201cBe back in a second, boss man.\u201d He scrambles up the old oak tree.</p><p>Small dead limbs that can\u2019t hold his weight fall through the branches and onto the ground.</p><p>Chris grows restless. He won\u2019t admit it, but heights scare the shit out of him and Logan\u2019s fear of nothing scares the shit out of him more.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass back down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d calls Logan from somewhere high in the tree.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>From above, tree limbs crackle and snap and leaves whoosh as if a strong breeze rushes through them. It\u2019s not wind. It\u2019s Logan, and one of these days he\u2019s going to get himself killed. A swirl of dirt accompanies the thud on the ground. Logan\u2019s body presses against my foot. On his back, with his black hair full of torn leaves, Logan convulses with laughter.</p><p>Obviously this isn\u2019t the night he was meant to die. He turns his head to look at Chris. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I kick Logan hard when I remove my foot from under his ass. \u201cYou\u2019re the crazy son-of-a-bitch, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d Logan rolls over to sit up. \u201cI\u2019m not the one following a psycho chick into a parking lot for a phone number. Those guys could have kicked your ass.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I hoped they had forgotten. \u201cI could have taken them.\u201d They would have eventually handed my ass to me, but I would have given them some bruises as payback. Two versus one are bad odds.</p><p>\u201cNot the point,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cSince you mentioned it.\u201d Chris takes his baseball cap off and holds it over his heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take this moment and remind everyone of the following\u2014I won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won tonight. So we\u2019re even again.\u201d</p><p>Chris shoves his hat back on. \u201cDoesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t. The only dares we keep track of are the ones we give to one another. \u201cEnjoy the brief taste of victory. I\u2019ll be winning next time.\u201d</p><p>We lapse into silence, which is fine. Our silences are never uncomfortable. Unlike girls, guys don\u2019t have to talk. Every now and then, we hear laughter or shouting from the party.</p><p>Every now and then, Chris and Lacy text. He likes to give her space, but doesn\u2019t trust drunk guys near his girl.</p><p>Logan fiddles with a long branch that fell to the ground. \u201cDad and I headed into Lexington this morning to check out U of K.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath, hoping that the conversation doesn\u2019t turn to where I think it\u2019s heading. Logan\u2019s had this visit scheduled for weeks. He\u2019s a damn genius and will have every college knocking on his door next year, including the University of Kentucky. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Mark.\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my head and try to ignore the nagging ache inside. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He asked about you. Your mom.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYour dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but it was weird. I\u2019m cool that he\u2019s your brother and that he\u2019s made his choices, but I\u2019m not sticking around to play head shrink over your family problems, especially when he had an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn audience?\u201d I echo.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Logan. \u201cHis boyfriend, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The twisting pressure usually only reserved for games pummels my stomach. I pull my knees up and lower my head. \u201cHow do you know it was his boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s face scrunches. \u201cI dunno. He was standing next to another dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been a friend,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>\u201cDid the guy look gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark didn\u2019t look gay, asswipe.\u201d Logan snaps. \u201cWho would have guessed the damn defensive lineman had it for the home team. And sure, the other dude could\u2019ve been straight. But how the hell should I know?\u201d</p><p>Listening to them discuss my gay brother\u2019s possible gay boyfriend is just as comfortable as convincing my mom over and over again that I prefer girls and their girl parts. Nothing makes you think you might need years of therapy like having to say the word breasts in front of your mother. \u201cCan we end this conversation?\u201d</p><p>I consider walking back to Tim\u2019s truck and collecting that beer. I\u2019ve only been shit-faced drunk twice in my life. Once when Mark told the family he was gay. The second time when</p><p>Dad kicked him out for that announcement.</p><p>Both incidents happened in the span of three days. Lessons learned: don\u2019t tell Dad you\u2019re gay, and getting drunk doesn\u2019t make anything untrue. It just makes your head hurt in the morning.</p><p>With a loud crack, Logan breaks the twig in his hand. He\u2019s looking for courage, which means I\u2019m going to hate the words coming out of his mouth. \u201cMark was all cryptic, but he said you\u2019d know what he meant. He said he can\u2019t come and he hoped you\u2019d understand why.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my neck tighten. My brother didn\u2019t even have the balls to tell me himself. I texted him last week. I outright defied my parents and texted him. I asked him to come home for dinner tomorrow night and he never texted back. Instead, he took the coward\u2019s way out and used Logan.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Dad gave the ultimatum: as long as Mark chooses guys, he\u2019s no longer a part of our family. Mark walked out, knowing what leaving meant: leaving Mom...leaving me. He never considered trying to stay home and fight to keep our family together. \u201cHe made his choice.\u201d</p><p>Logan lowers his voice. \u201cHe misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he left,\u201d I snap. I kick the back tire of the car. Angry. Angry at Dad. Angry at Mark.</p><p>Angry at me. For three days straight Mark talked. He said the same thing over and over again. He\u2019s still Mark. My brother. Mom\u2019s son.</p><p>He told me how he spent years confused because he wanted to be like me. He wanted to be like Dad.</p><p>And when I asked him to stay, when I asked him to stand his ground...he left. He packed up his shit and he left, leaving me and the destruction of my family behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cScrew the serious talk,\u201d says Chris. \u201cWe won today. We\u2019ll win fall season and spring.</p><p>We\u2019re going to graduate victorious and when we do, Ryan\u2019s going pro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>From their lips to God\u2019s ears, but sometimes God chooses not to listen. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up. The scout today could be a one-time deal. Next week they could find somebody else to love.\u201d I should know. That happened at the pro tryouts this past spring.</p> <p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d says Chris. \u201cDestiny is knocking, Ry, and you need to get your ass up to answer.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>I FELL ASLEEP. Either that or my dear old uncle Scott drugged me. I\u2019m going with fell asleep.</p><p>Scott may be a dick, but he\u2019s a dare-to-keep-kids-off-drugs kind of dick. I should know. He once brought red ribbons and a police mascot to my preschool.</p><p>I love irony.</p> <p>Moonlight streams through white lace curtains hanging from an artsy brown metal rod. I sit up and a pink crochet blanket falls away. The bedding beneath me is still perfectly made and I\u2019m wearing the same outfit I wore on Friday night. Someone has neatly laid my shoes on the wooden floor next to the bed.</p><p>Even sober, I wouldn\u2019t have done that. I don\u2019t do neat.</p><p>I lean over and turn on a lamp. The crystals decorating the bottom edge of the shade clink together. The dull light draws my focus to the painfully cheery purple paint on the wall.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I count the days. Let\u2019s see.</p><p>Friday night I went out with Noah and Isaiah and put Taco Bell Boy in his place. Early Saturday, Mom tried to become a felon.</p><p>Saturday morning, Scott ruined my life.</p> <p>I pretended to fall asleep in the car so I wouldn\u2019t have to talk to Scott, but I sucked and actually fell asleep. Scott woke me, I think, and half carried me into the house. Crap. Why don\u2019t I put a sign on my head and announce I\u2019m a loser girl who needs help.</p><p>I open my eyes and stare at the ticking clock on the bedside table. Twelve fifteen. Sunday.</p><p>This is early Sunday morning.</p><p>My stomach growls. I\u2019ve gone a full day without eating. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>Won\u2019t be the last. I slip out of bed and slide my Chuck Taylor wannabes onto my feet. Time to have a coming-to-Jesus moment with Uncle</p><p>Scott. That is, if he\u2019s awake. It may be better if he went to bed. That way I can slip out without the fight.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll score some food before I call Isaiah. With a room like this, I bet he buys brand-name cereal.</p><p>The house has that newly built, fresh sawdust smell. Outside the bedroom is a foyer instead of a hallway. A large staircase, the type I thought existed only in movies, winds to the second floor. An actual chandelier hangs from the ceiling. Guess baseball pays well.</p> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d A woman\u2019s voice carries from the back of the house. I can tell she\u2019s still talking, but she\u2019s lowered her tone. Did he marry or does he keep a fuck on hand like he did when I was a kid? Gotta be a fuck. I overheard Scott tell Dad once that he\u2019d never marry.</p><p>I follow the low voices to the brink of a large open room and pause. The entire back of the house\u2014excuse me, mansion\u2014is one enormous wall of windows. The living room flows right into the eat-in kitchen.</p><p>\u201cScott.\u201d Exasperation eats at the woman\u2019s tone. \u201cThis is not what I signed up for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month you were on board with this,\u201d says Scott. Part of me feels vindicated. He\u2019s lost that annoyingly smooth calm from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cYes, when you told me you wanted to reconnect with your niece. There is a difference between reconnecting and invading our life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were fine with it when I called last month from Louisville and said I wanted her to live with us.\u201d</p><p>The woman snaps, \u201cThat was after you said she ran away. I didn\u2019t actually think you would find her. When you described the hellhole she lived in, I figured she was long gone. She\u2019s a criminal. You expect me to feel safe with her in my home?\u201d</p><p>Her words slice me open. I\u2019m not that bad.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not kittens and bunnies, but I\u2019m not that bad. I glance down at my outfit. Jeans.</p><p>Tank top. My black hair falls in front of my face. It doesn\u2019t matter. She made her decision before she met me. I bury the hurt, step into the room, and welcome the anger. Screw her. \u201cYou might want to listen to her. I\u2019m a fucking menace.\u201d</p><p>The shocked expression on their faces is almost worth being here. Almost. I press my lips together to keep from laughing at Scott. He wears a pair of chinos and a short-sleeved button-down shirt. It\u2019s a far cry from the outfits he used to wear when I was a kid: gangsta jeans that showed his underwear.</p><p>The woman is nothing like the girls Scott dated when he was eighteen. Her hair is a natural blond instead of bleached. She\u2019s thin, but not alcohol-diet thin, and she looks kind of smart. Smart as in she probably finished high school.</p><p>She sits at a massive island in the center of the kitchen. Scott leans on the counter across from her. He glances at her, then talks to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, Elisabeth. Why don\u2019t you go back to bed and we\u2019ll talk in the morning.\u201d</p><p>My stomach cramps, and a light wave of dizziness fogs my brain. \u201cDo you have food?\u201d</p><p>He straightens. \u201cYes. What do you want? I can fix some eggs.\u201d</p><p>Scott used to make me scrambled eggs every morning. Eggs\u2014the WIC-approved food. The reminder hurts and creates warm fuzzies at the same time. \u201cI hate eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Oh. The man\u2019s a conversational genius. \u201cDo you have cereal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He enters a pantry and I plop onto a stool at the island as far from Scott\u2019s girl as possible. She stares at a spot right in front of me. Huh. Funny. I\u2019m in arm\u2019s reach of a butcher block full of knives. I can imagine the thoughts running through her single-celled brain.</p><p>Scott places boxes of Cheerios, Branflakes, and Shredded Wheat in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding.\u201d</p><p>Where the hell are the Lucky Charms?</p><p>\u201cNice language,\u201d the woman says.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I fucking care?\u201d</p><p>Scott slides a bowl and spoon to me, then goes to the refrigerator for milk. \u201cLet\u2019s tone it down.\u201d</p><p>I choose the Cheerios and keep pouring until a few toasty circles trickle onto the counter.</p><p>Scott sits in the chair next to mine and the two of them watch me in silence. Well, sort of silence. My crunching is louder than a nuclear bomb blast.</p><p>\u201cScott told me you had blond hair,\u201d says the woman.</p><p>I swallow, but it\u2019s hard to do when my throat tightens. The little girl I used to be, the one with blond hair, died years ago and I hate thinking about her. She was nice. She was happy. She was...not someone I want to remember.</p><p>\u201cWhy is your hair black?\u201d The lawn ornament at the other end of the island has officially become annoying.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you exactly?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThis is my wife, Allison.\u201d</p><p>The Cheerios catch in my throat and I choke, coughing into my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d says Scott. Ugh. He does that googly-eye thing Noah does with Echo.</p><p>I slide another spoonful of Cheerios into my mouth. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done\u2014\u201d crunch, crunch, crunch \u201c\u2014I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home now.\u201d Scott has that calm tone again.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s eyes dart between me and the knives. Yeah, lady, a couple of hours in jail and I\u2019ve moved from destruction of property to sociopath.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should listen to her,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say through more crunches,</p><p>\u201cmaybe you should listen to me. Your wife\u2019s worried I\u2019m going to go all Manson and slit her throat while she sleeps.\u201d I smile at her for effect.</p><p>Color drains from her face. At times, I really enjoy being me.</p><p>Scott gives me the once-over\u2014starting with my black hair, then moving on to my black fingernails, the ring in my nose, and finally my clothes. Then he turns to his wife. \u201cWill you give us a few minutes alone?\u201d</p><p>Allison leaves without saying a word. I shovel in more cereal and purposely talk with my mouth full. \u201cDid you have to purchase the leash for her or did it come as a package deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t disrespect her, Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do as I fucking please, Uncle Scott.\u201d I mimic his fake haughty tone. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m done eating my shitty cereal, I\u2019m calling Isaiah and I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Him\u2014silence. Me\u2014crunch, crunch, crunch.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he asks in a soft voice.</p><p>I swallow what\u2019s in my mouth, put down the spoon, and push the bowl of half-eaten</p><p>Cheerios away. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2014the master of long silences.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he leave?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to be a mind reader to know Scott\u2019s asking about his deadbeat brother. The black paint on my fingernails chips at the corners. I scrape off more of it. Eight years later and I still have a hard time saying it.</p><p>\u201cThird grade.\u201d</p><p>Scott shifts in his seat. \u201cYour mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell apart the day he left.\u201d Which should tell him a lot, because she wasn\u2019t exactly the poster child for reliability before Dad took off.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between them?\u201d</p><p>None of his business. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come for me like you promised.\u201d And he stopped calling when I turned eight. The refrigerator kicks on.</p><p>I scrape off more paint. He faces the fact that he\u2019s a dick.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI go by Beth. Where\u2019s your phone? I\u2019m going home.\u201d The police confiscated my cell and gave it to Scott. He told me in the car that he tossed it in the garbage because I \u201cdidn\u2019t need contact with my old life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turned seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? Wow. I must have forgotten since no one threw me a party.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, he continues, \u201cThis week my lawyers will secure my legal guardianship of you. Until you turn eighteen, you will live in this house and you will obey my rules.\u201d</p><p>Fine. If he won\u2019t show me the phone, I\u2019ll find it. I hop off the chair. \u201cI\u2019m not six anymore and you aren\u2019t the center of my universe. In fact, I consider you a black hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that you\u2019re pissed off I left....\u201d</p><p>Pissed? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not pissed. You don\u2019t exist to me anymore. I feel nothing for you, so show me where the damned phone is so I can go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElisabeth...\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t care. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>No phone in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou need to understand....\u201d</p><p>I walk around his fancy ass living room with his fancy ass leather furniture looking for his fancy ass phone. \u201cTake whatever you have to say and shove it up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk....\u201d</p><p>I lift my hand in the air and flap it like a puppet\u2019s mouth. \u201cBlah, blah, blah, Elisabeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ll only be gone a couple of months.

You can take the boy out of the trailer park and pretty him up in a Major League Baseball uniform, but you can\u2019t take the trailer park out of the boy.\u201d</p><p>He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Where\u2019s the phone?\u201d</p><p>Noah told me once that I have a gift that borders on supervillain status\u2014the ability to push people past the edge of sanity. The way Scott releases another breath and rubs his forehead tells me I\u2019m pushing him hard. Good.</p><p>Scott tries for that obnoxious, level tone again, but I can hear the edge of irritation in it.</p><p>\u201cYou want trailer park, I can go trailer park. You are going to live in my house with my rules or I\u2019ll send your mother to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke out the windows of the car. Not her. You have nothing on her.\u201d</p> <p>Scott narrows his eyes. \u201cWanna discuss what\u2019s in your mom\u2019s apartment with me?\u201d</p><p>My body lurches to the left as the blood seeps out of my face, leaving behind a blurry and tingling sensation. Shirley already warned me, but hearing it from him is still a shock.</p><p>Scott knows what I don\u2019t want to know\u2014</p><p>Mom\u2019s secret.</p><p>\u201cPush me, Elisabeth, and I\u2019ll have this same exact conversation with the police.\u201d</p><p>I stumble as I try to stay upright. The back of my legs collide with a coffee table. Losing the battle, I sit. Right beside me is a phone and as much as I want to, I can\u2019t touch it. Scott has me. The bastard traded my life for my mom\u2019s freedom.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I LEAN AGAINST THE CLOSED tailgate of Dad\u2019s truck and listen from two parking spots away as Dad recounts to a group of men loitering outside the barbershop every detail of our meeting with the scout last night. Some of them heard the story at church this morning.</p> <p>Most of the listeners are generational farmers and this kind of news is worth hearing again, even if it means standing in the type of August heat where you can smell the acrid stench of blacktop melting.</p><p>In my peripheral view, I notice a man stop on the sidewalk and assess the ring of listeners and my storytelling father. I don\u2019t pay attention to tourists and if he were a local, he\u2019d join the group. It\u2019s better to leave the tourists alone. If you look at them, they talk.</p><p>Groveton\u2019s a small town. To appeal to tourists, Dad persuaded the other councilmen to call the old stone buildings dating back to the 1800s Historic then add the words Shopping District. Four B-and-Bs and new tours of the old bourbon distillery later, and the city folk brave the fifteen-mile winding country road from the freeway. It can make parking a bitch on the weekends, but it gives lots of good people jobs when money gets tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the local gossip?\u201d the man asks.</p><p>He\u2019s speaking and I didn\u2019t even make eye contact. That\u2019s bold for a tourist. I fold my arms across my chest. \u201cBaseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d There\u2019s a drop in his tone that catches my attention.</p><p>I turn my head and feel my eyes widen in slow motion. No way. \u201cYou\u2019re Scott Risk.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in this town knows who Scott Risk is. His face is one of the few to peer at the student population from the Wall of Fame at Bullitt County High. As a shortstop, he led his high school team to state championships twice.</p><p>He made the majors straight out of high school.</p><p>But the real achievement, the real feat that made him a king in this small town, was his eleven-year stint with the New York Yankees. He\u2019s exactly what every boy in Groveton dreams of becoming, including me.</p><p>Scott Risk wears a pair of khakis, a blue polo, and a good-natured grin. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan Stone,\u201d Dad answers for me as he appears from out of thin air. \u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d</p><p>The circle of men outside the barbershop watch us with interest. Scott holds out his hand to Dad. \u201cScott Risk.\u201d</p><p>Dad shakes it with a badly suppressed smug smile. \u201cAndrew Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCity Councilman Andrew Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dad says with pride. \u201cI heard rumors you were moving back to town.\u201d</p><p>He did? That\u2019s the sort of news Dad should have shared.</p><p>\u201cThis town always did love gossip.\u201d Scott keeps the friendly look, but the light tone feels forced.</p><p>Dad chuckles. \u201cSome things never change. I heard you were looking at buying some property nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought,\u201d says Scott. \u201cI purchased the old Walter farm last spring, but asked the Realtor to keep the sale quiet until we moved into the home we built farther back on the property.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shoot up and so do Dad\u2019s.</p><p>That\u2019s the farm right next to ours. Dad takes a step closer and angles his back to make the three of us into our own circle. \u201cI own the property a mile down the road. Ryan and I are huge fans of yours.\u201d No, he\u2019s not. Dad respects Scott because he\u2019s from Groveton, but loathes anyone from the Yankees. \u201cExcept when you played the Reds. Home team takes precedent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t expect anything else.\u201d Scott notices my baseball cap. \u201cDo you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d What exactly do I say to the man I\u2019ve worshipped my entire life? Can I ask for his autograph? Can I beg him to tell me how he stays calm during a game when everything is on the line? Do I stare at him like an idiot because I can\u2019t find anything more coherent to say?</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s a pitcher,\u201d Dad announces. \u201cA major-league scout watched him at a game last night. He thinks Ryan has the potential to be picked up by the minors after graduation.\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2019s easygoing grin falls into something more serious as he stares as me. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive. You must be pitching in the upper eighties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineties,\u201d says Dad. \u201cRyan pitched three straight in the nineties.\u201d</p><p>A crazy gleam hits Scott\u2019s eyes and we both smile. I understand that spark and the adrenaline rush that accompanies it. We share a passion: playing ball. \u201cNineties? And you\u2019re just now getting the attention of scouts?\u201d</p><p>I readjust my hat. \u201cDad took me to Reds\u2019 tryout camp this past spring, but...\u201d</p><p>Dad cuts me off. \u201cThey told Ryan he needed to bulk up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have listened,\u201d Scott says.</p><p>\u201cI want to play ball.\u201d I\u2019m twenty pounds heavier than last spring. I run every day and lift weights at night. Sometimes, Dad does it with me. This dream also belongs to Dad.</p><p>\u201cAnything can happen.\u201d Scott looks over my shoulder, but his eyes have that far-off glaze, as if he\u2019s seeing a memory. \u201cIt depends on how badly you want it.\u201d</p><p>I want it. Badly. Dad checks his watch, then extends his hand again to Scott. He\u2019s itching to pick up some new drill bits before supper. \u201cIt was nice officially meeting you.\u201d</p><p>Scott accepts his hand. \u201cYou too. Would you mind if I borrowed your son? My niece lives with me and she\u2019ll be starting Bullitt County High tomorrow. I think the transition will be easier for her if she has someone to show her around. As long as that\u2019s okay with you, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an honor, sir.\u201d It would. This is beyond my wildest dreams.</p><p>Dad flashes me his all-knowing smile. \u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d The crowd near the barbershop parts like Moses commanding the Red Sea as Dad strolls toward the hardware store.</p><p>Scott turns his back to the crowd, steps closer to me, and runs a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth...\u201d He pauses, rests his hands on his hips, and starts again. \u201cBeth\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but she\u2019s a good girl. She could use some friends.\u201d</p><p>I nod like I understand, but I don\u2019t. What does he mean by rough around the edges? I keep nodding because I don\u2019t care. She\u2019s Scott Risk\u2019s niece and I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s happy.</p><p>Beth. A strange uneasiness settles in my stomach. Why does that name sound familiar?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll introduce her around. Make sure she fits in. My best friend, Chris, he\u2019s also on the team.\u201d Because I\u2019ll try to work Chris and Logan into any conversation I have with Mr. Risk. \u201cHe has a great girl who I\u2019m sure your niece will love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You have no idea how much this means to me.\u201d Scott relaxes as if he dropped a hundred-pound bag of feed. The bell over the clothing shop chimes. Scott places a hand on my shoulder and gestures at the shop. \u201cRyan, I\u2019d like you to meet my niece, Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>She walks out of the shop and crosses her arms over her chest. Black hair. Nose ring.</p><p>Slim figure with a hint of curves. White shirt with only four buttons clasped between her breasts and belly button, fancy blue jeans, and an eye roll the moment she sees me. My stomach drops as if I swallowed lead. This is possibly the worst day of my life.</p><p>Beth</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S NICE TO MEET YOU,\u201d Arrogant Taco Bell Boy says as if we never met. Maybe he doesn\u2019t remember. Jocks usually aren\u2019t smart. Their muscles feast on their brains.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in hell. No question about it. This bad version of the town from Deliverance is certainly hot as hell. The heat in this forsaken place possesses a strangling haze that envelops me and seizes my lungs.</p><p>Scott clears his throat. A subtle reminder that fuck is no longer an acceptable word for me in public. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Ryan Stone.\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time, Scott used to say words like s\u2019up and sick. Variants of fuck were the only adjectives and adverbs in his vocabulary.</p><p>Now he sounds like a stuck-up, suit-wearing, cocky rich guy. Oh wait, he is.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s volunteered to show you around at school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he has,\u201d I mumble. \u201cBecause my life hasn\u2019t sucked enough in the past forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>God must have decided He wasn\u2019t done screwing with me yet. He wasn\u2019t done screwing with me when Scott blackmailed me into living here. He wasn\u2019t done screwing with me when Scott\u2019s wife bought these tragically conservative clothes. He wasn\u2019t done screwing with me when Scott told me he was enrolling me at the local redneck, Children of the Corn school. No, he wasn\u2019t quite done screwing with me yet. The damn icing on this cake is the conceited ass standing in front of me. Ha fucking ha. Joke\u2019s on me. \u201cI want my clothes back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott asks. Good\u2014I messed with him without cursing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dressed like a moron, so why should I?\u201d I motion to the designer jeans and starched Catholic-schoolgirl shirt disgracing my body. Per Scott\u2019s request to play nice with Allison, I stepped out of the dressing room to look at this atrocity in the full-length mirror.</p><p>When I returned, my clothes were gone.</p><p>Tonight, I\u2019m searching for a pair of scissors and bleach.</p> <p>Scott censures me by subtly shaking his head. I have close to a whole year of this bull in front of me, and the woman I\u2019m trying to protect I can\u2019t even see\u2014my mom. A part of my brain tingles with panic. How is she? Did her boyfriend hit her again? Is she worried about me?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love it here,\u201d says Taco Bell Boy\u2014I mean Ryan.</p><p>\u201cSure I am.\u201d My tone indicates I\u2019m going to love this place as much as I\u2019d love getting shot in the head.</p><p>Scott clears his throat again and I wonder if he cares that people will assume he\u2019s diseased.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s father owns a construction business in town and he\u2019s on the city council.\u201d Underlying message to me: don\u2019t screw this moment up.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Of course. Story of my freaking life. Ryan\u2019s the rich boy that has everything. Daddy who owns the town. Daddy who owns the business. Ryan, the boy who thinks he can do anything he wants because of it.</p><p>Ryan flashes me an easygoing grin and it\u2019s sort of hypnotizing. As if he created it just for me. It\u2019s a glorious grin. Perfect. Peaceful.</p><p>With a hint of dimples. It promises friendship and happiness and laughter and it makes me want to smile back. My lips start to curve into an answer and I stop myself abruptly.</p><p>Why do I do this to myself? Guys like him don\u2019t go for girls like me. I\u2019m a toy to them. A game. And these types of guys, they all have the same rules of play: smile, trick me into thinking that they like me, then toss me to the side once I\u2019ve been used. How many countless losers do I have to stupidly make out with only to regret it in the morning? Over the past year\u2014too many.</p><p>But while listening to Ryan easily digress into a conversation with Scott about baseball, I swear that I\u2019m done with loser guys. Done with feeling used. Just done.</p><p>And this time, I won\u2019t break the promise\u2014 no matter how lonely I get.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryan says to Scott as if I\u2019m not standing right here, as if I\u2019m not important enough to involve in conversation. \u201cI think the Reds have a shot this year.\u201d</p><p>God, I hate Ryan. Standing there all perfect with his perfect life and perfect body and perfect smile, pretending he never laid eyes on me before. He glances at me from the corner of his eye and I realize why he\u2019s pouring on the charm. Ryan wants to impress Scott. Guess what? Misery definitely loves company. My life shouldn\u2019t be the only one that sucks. \u201cHe hit on me.\u201d</p><p>Silence as my words kill the moronic baseball conversation. Scott rubs his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou just met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. Friday night. He hit on me and he stared at my ass while he did it.\u201d</p><p>Joy. Utter joy. Okay, not utter, but the sole joy I\u2019ve had since Friday night. Ryan yanks off his hat, runs his hand through his mess of sandy-blond hair, and shoves the hat back on. I like him better with his hat off.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d Scott asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d stutters Ryan. \u201cNo. I mean yes. I asked for her phone number, but she didn\u2019t give it to me. But I was respectful, I swear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou stared at my ass. A lot.\u201d I turn and lean over a little so I can give a demonstration.</p><p>\u201cRemember, there was a rip right along here.\u201d I slide my finger along the back of my leg.</p><p>\u201cYou bought me tacos afterward. And a drink.</p><p>So I\u2019m assuming you must have enjoyed the view.\u201d</p><p>I hear muffled male comments and I peek at the crowd of men farther down the sidewalk.</p><p>The first genuine smile slips across my face.</p><p>Scott\u2019s going to love a show. Maybe if I push hard enough I\u2019ll be home in Louisville by dinner.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth.\u201d Scott drops his voice to trailer-park pissed. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Twelve different shades of red blotch Ryan\u2019s cheeks. He doesn\u2019t even look at my ass, but at my uncle. \u201cOkay...yes, I asked her out.\u201d</p><p>Scott does a double take. \u201cYou asked her out?\u201d</p><p>Hey now. Why\u2019s he surprised? I\u2019m not a dog.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to take her on a date?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Scott sounds happy. No. I\u2019m not going for happy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ryan holds out his hands. \u201cI thought...I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I would be easy?\u201d I snap, and Scott winces.</p><p>\u201cThat she was funny,\u201d Ryan says.</p><p>Yeah. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what he thought. \u201cMore like you thought it would be fun to screw with me. Or just plain screw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d hisses Scott. His narrowing blue eyes rage at me as I thrust my hands in the stiff pockets of the new jeans. Scott lowers his head and pinches the bridge of his nose before forcing that fake relaxed grin into place. \u201cI apologize for my niece. She\u2019s had a rough weekend.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to apologize for me to anyone. Especially not to this arrogant ass. My mouth drops open, but the brief white-trash glance Scott gives me shuts it. Scott becomes Mr. Superficial again. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to help Elisabeth at school.\u201d</p><p>Ryan has this blank, way too innocent expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Risk. I\u2019d love to help Elisabeth. \u201d He turns to me and smiles.</p><p>This smile isn\u2019t genuine or heartwarming, but cocky as hell. Bring it, jock boy. Your best won\u2019t be good enough.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>THE WALLS OF OUR KITCHEN used to be burgundy. As kids, Mark and I would race home from the bus stop and when we\u2019d burst into the kitchen we\u2019d be greeted by the aroma of freshly baked cookies. Mom would ask us about our day while we dunked the hot cookies in milk. When Dad came home from work, he\u2019d sweep Mom into his arms and kiss her.</p><p>Mom\u2019s laughter in Dad\u2019s arms was as natural as Mark\u2019s and my constant banter.</p><p>With an arm still wrapped around her waist, he\u2019d turn to us and say, \u201cHow are my boys?\u201d</p><p>Like Mark and I didn\u2019t exist without each other.</p><p>Thanks to the renovations Dad finished last week, the kitchen walls are gray now. And thanks to my brother\u2019s announcement and my father\u2019s reaction to the announcement this summer, the loudest sound in the kitchen is the clink of knives and forks against china.</p><p>\u201cGwen came to your game,\u201d says Mom. It\u2019s only the third time she\u2019s mentioned it in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>Yeah, with Mike. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d I shove a hunk of pot roast into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHer mom said she still talks about you.\u201d</p><p>I stop mid-chew and glance at Mom. Proud for earning a reaction from me, she smiles.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Dad says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a girl distracting him.\u201d</p><p>Mom purses her lips and we enter another five minutes of clinking forks and knives. The silence stings...like frostbite.</p><p>Unable to stomach the tension much longer, I clear my throat. \u201cDid Dad tell you we met Scott Risk and his\u2014\u201d psychotic \u201c\u2014niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My mother stabs at the cherry tomato rolling around in her salad bowl. The moment she spears the small round vegetable, Mom glares at Dad. \u201cHe has a niece?\u201d</p><p>Dad holds her gaze with irritated indifference and follows it up with a drink from his longneck.</p><p>\u201cI gave you a wineglass,\u201d Mom reminds him.</p><p>Dad places the longneck, which drips with condensation, next to said glass right on the wood of the table\u2014without a coaster. Mom shifts in her seat like a crow fluffing out its wings. The only thing she\u2019s missing is the pissed-off caw.</p><p>For the last few months, Dad and I have been eating our dinners in the living room while watching TV. Mom gave up food after Mark left.</p><p>Mom and Dad began marriage counseling a few weeks ago, though they have yet to directly tell me. The need to project perfection won\u2019t allow them to admit to a flaw like their marriage needing help from an outside source.</p><p>Instead I found out the same way I discover anything in this house: I overheard them fighting in the living room while I lay in bed at night.</p><p>Last week, their marriage counselor recommended that Mom and Dad try to do something as a family. They fought for two days over what that something should be until they settled on Sunday dinner.</p><p>It\u2019s why I invited Mark. We haven\u2019t had a dinner together since he left and if he\u2019d showed, maybe the four of us could have found a way to reconnect.</p><p>I wonder if Mom and Dad feel the emptiness of the chair next to mine. Mark possessed this charm that kept my parents from fighting. If they were annoyed with each other, Mark would tell a story or a joke to break the chill.</p><p>The arctic winter in my house never existed when he was home.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he has a niece,\u201d I say, hoping to move the conversation forward and to fill the hollowness inside me. \u201cHer name is Elisabeth.</p><p>Beth.\u201d And she\u2019s making my life hell\u2014not too different from suffering through this dinner.</p><p>I tear a biscuit apart and slather on some butter. Beth embarrassed me in front of Scott Risk and I lost a dare because of her. I drop the biscuit\u2014the dare. A spark ignites in my brain.</p><p>Chris and I never set a time limit on it, which means I can still win.</p><p>Mom straightens the napkin on her lap, disrupting my thoughts. \u201cYou should be friendly with her, Ryan, but maintain your distance. The Risks had a reputation years ago.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s chair scrapes against the new tile and he makes a disgusted noise in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mom demands.</p><p>Dad rolls his shoulders back and focuses on his beef instead of answering.</p><p>\u201cYou have something to say,\u201d prods Mom, \u201csay it.\u201d</p><p>Dad tosses his fork onto his plate. \u201cScott Risk has some valuable contacts. I say get close to her, Ryan. Show her around. If you do a favor for him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d do one for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Mom. \u201cGive him advice that goes directly against mine.\u201d</p><p>Dad begins talking over her and their combined raised voices cause my head to throb. Losing my appetite, I slide my chair away from the table. It\u2019s gut-wrenching, listening to the ongoing annihilation of my family. There is absolutely no worse sound on the face of the planet.</p><p>Until the phone rings. My parents fall silent as all three of us look over at the counter and see Mark\u2019s name appear on the caller ID. A rocky combination of hope and hurt creates a heaviness in my throat and stomach.</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d Dad murmurs.</p><p>Mom stands on the second ring and my heart beats in my ears. Come on, Mom, answer.</p><p>Please.</p><p>\u201cWe could talk to him,\u201d she says as she stares at the phone. \u201cTell him that as long as he keeps it a secret he can come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, hoping that one of them will change their minds. Maybe this time Mark would choose to stay and fight instead of leaving me behind. \u201cWe should answer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rings a fourth time.</p><p>\u201cNot in my house.\u201d Dad never stops glaring at his plate.</p><p>And the answering machine picks up.</p><p>Mom\u2019s cheerful voice announces that we\u2019re away at the moment, but to please leave a message. Then there\u2019s a beep.</p> <p>Nothing. No message. No static. Nothing.</p><p>My brother doesn\u2019t have the balls to leave me a message.</p><p>And I\u2019m not stupid. If he wanted to talk to me, he could have called my cell. This was a test. I invited him to dinner and he was calling to see if I was the only one who wanted him home. I guess we all failed.</p><p>Mom clutches the pearls around her neck and the hope within me fades into an angry clawing. Mark left. He left me to deal with this destruction on my own.</p><p>I jerk out of my seat and my mother turns to face me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got homework.\u201d</p><p>The corkboard over my computer desk vibrates when I slam my bedroom door shut. I pace the room and press my hands against my head. I\u2019ve got a damn homework assignment and the clarity and calm of a boat being tossed by the waves. What I need to do is run off the anger, lift weights until my muscles burn, throw pitches until my shoulder falls off.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be writing a damn four-page English paper on anything \u201cI want.\u201d</p><p>The chair in front of my desk rolls back as I fling myself into the seat. With one press of a button the monitor brightens to life. The cursor mockingly blinks at me from the blank page.</p><p>Four pages. Single spaced. One-inch margins. My teacher\u2019s expectations are too high. Especially since it\u2019s still technically summer vacation.</p><p>My fingers bang on the keys. I\u2019ve played ball since I was three.</p> <p>And I stop typing. Baseball...it\u2019s what I should write about. It\u2019s what I know. But the emotions churning inside of me need a release.</p><p>Dad and Mom would turn into raging bulls if I wrote about the real status of my family.</p><p>Appearances mean everything. I bet they haven\u2019t even told their marriage counselor the truth about why they see her.</p><p>A dawning realization soothes some of the anger. I shouldn\u2019t do it. If anyone figured it out, I\u2019d be in deep, but right now I need to dump all the resentment. I erase the first line and give words to the emotions begging for freedom.</p><p>George woke up with a vague memory of what used to be, but one glance to the left brought on a harrowing realization of what his new reality was. Of what, specifically, he had become.</p><p>Beth</p><p>\u201cTHEY MIGHT REMEMBER ME.\u201d Mondays suck and so does the first day of school in Hicksville, USA. I lean against the windows in the guidance counselor\u2019s office and look around. D\u00e9cor circa the 1970s: faux wood paneling, desk and chairs bought from the Wal-Mart bargain basket. The scent of mildew hangs in the air. This is backwoods schools at their finest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point, Elisabeth.\u201d Scott flips through a thick schedule booklet. \u201cYour old elementary school is one of three schools that feed into here. You\u2019ll know some people and rekindle old friendships. What about Home Ec? You and I baked cookies a couple of times, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeth. I go by Beth.\u201d It\u2019s like the man is learning impaired. \u201cAnd the last time I baked anything, it was brownies and I put...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put Home Ec in the No section. But I prefer the name Elisabeth. What was your best friend\u2019s name? I used to drive you to her house.\u201d</p><p>And we played with dolls. Over and over again. Her mom let us use her real cups for tea parties. They had a real house with real beds and I loved staying for dinner. Their food was hot. It becomes hard to swallow. \u201cLacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Lacy Harper.\u201d</p><p>The door to the office opens and the guidance counselor pops in his head. \u201cJust a few more minutes, Mr. Risk. I\u2019m on the line with Eastwick High.\u201d</p><p>Scott drops that cheesy grin. \u201cTake your time. Is there a Lacy Harper at this school?\u201d</p><p>Somebody shoot me. Now. Right now.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><p>The fun doesn\u2019t stop coming. Scott glances at me. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>I overly fake my response. \u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>He either chooses to ignore my sarcasm or believes my excitement. \u201cMr. Dwyer, could you place Beth in one of Lacy\u2019s classes?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dwyer practically falls to the floor in admiration. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly try.\u201d He withdraws from his own office and shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cWere you smacked upside the head with a bat?\u201d I can\u2019t believe Scott expects me to attend this school.</p><p>\u201cOnly when I was five and on days that end in y,\u201d he mumbles, still flipping through the catalog. His response pricks my chest. I\u2019ve done my best to block out that portion of my childhood. Grandpa, his dad, used to beat the crap out of him and my dad. Scott kept him from doing the same to me. \u201cWhat about Spanish?\u201d</p><p>I actually smile. \u201cMy friend Rico taught me some Spanish. If a guy\u2019s too touchy I can say...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrike Spanish.\u201d</p><p>Damn. That could have been fun. \u201cSeriously, Scott. Do you really want me going to school here? Have you thought this through? Your pet with a wedding ring...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison. Her name is Allison. Let\u2019s say it together. All-i-son. See, not so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. She loves how everybody worships you. How long is that going to last when they remember that you\u2019re low-life trash from the trailer park a couple miles out of Groveton?\u201d</p><p>He stops flipping through the catalog. Even though his eyes fix on the paper, I can tell he\u2019s no longer reading. \u201cI\u2019m not that kid anymore. People only care about who I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it will take before people remember me or Mom?\u201d I meant to say it nasty, like a threat, but it came out soft and I hate myself for it.</p><p>Scott looks at me and I loathe the sympathy in his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ll remember you the way I do\u2014a beautiful girl who loved life.\u201d</p><p>Pissed that he keeps discussing that poor pathetic girl, I break eye contact. \u201cShe died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAs for your mom, she moved into town her sophomore year and dropped out when she was still fifteen. People won\u2019t remember her.\u201d</p><p>Nausea strikes and my hand drops to my abdomen. Scott wasn\u2019t there when the police came to the trailer and he wasn\u2019t there to dry my tears. This is a small town and everyone knows everyone else. Even though they promised to keep that night a secret, I\u2019m sure someone told.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to both of us when someone remembers Dad?\u201d I ask. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to worship you then. This is a bad mistake, Scott. Send me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Risk.\u201d The guidance counselor from Hicksville pokes his head into the office.</p><p>Worry lines clutter his overly large forehead and his fingers white-knuckle a fax. I told him I majored in detention while at Eastwick. \u201cCan I have a moment?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head, knowing the words to say to make Mr. Dwyer uncomfortable. \u201cWhat was that class you wanted to put me in? Hmm.\u201d I tap my finger to my chin. \u201cHonors English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Elisabeth.\u201d Scott\u2019s getting really good at demanding things in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Dwyer, let\u2019s discuss Beth\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, bow your heads and give an amen. Scott Risk\u2019s niece is attending Bullitt County High and the dare is back in play. I weave through the crowded hallway with an extra spring in my step. Defeat is a nasty word. A word I no longer have to accept.</p><p>My mood crashes when I spot Chris backing Lacy against a locker. His head angles down as hers inches up. Not a good position to be in with the assistant principal exiting his office.</p><p>Last year, he lectured the junior class on our hormones, carnal impulses, and the consequences for those who break the body boundary barrier. In plain English: if you\u2019re caught standing close to a person of the opposite sex, then you\u2019ll spend a day in detention. Back-to-back state championships require practice, not detention.</p><p>\u201cBackseats of cars work.\u201d I ease to the other side of Chris and Lacy to block the oncoming assistant principal\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cPreferably off campus.\u201d</p><p>Chris groans when Lacy places her hand on his chest and pushes him until they\u2019re an \u201cacceptable\u201d distance apart. She lets out a frustrated sigh. \u201cMorning, Ry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Chris says flatly.</p><p>\u201cThe assistant principal is on the prowl and we are not moving practice like we did last year because you\u2019re sitting in detention.\u201d</p><p>Chris lets out a sigh identical to Lacy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou need a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Lacy throws her arms out. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that for months. Not an evil girlfriend. We are not doing evil again. I was tired of wearing crucifixes. I considered carrying holy water, but then I would have had to sneak into a church and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it down,\u201d I tell her. There has always been bad blood between Gwen and Lace, but I dated Gwen once. I won\u2019t tolerate anyone disrespecting her.</p><p>The first warning bell rings, and the three of us head to English. Standing by himself, oozing perpetual boredom, Logan waits for us at the line between the seniors\u2019 lockers and the juniors\u2019. The four of us take as many classes as we can together. For fun. For camaraderie. For Lacy and Logan to help me and Chris with homework.</p><p>Because the boy is smarter than Einstein and most of the kids in this school are dumber than dirt, Logan takes senior courses. Next year, they won\u2019t have any classes advanced enough for him, so odds are they\u2019ll shove him in a dark corner of the library and pretend he doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>I glance around the hallway, trying to spot Beth. \u201cSo, about that continuing dare from Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the bet you lost on Friday.\u201d Chris enters English and claims our usual seats by the window. Lacy stays in the hallway to do her girl-talk thing.</p><p>\u201cNo, the bet I\u2019m going to win.\u201d</p><p>Chris flashes a disbelieving grin. \u201cLogan, do you hear the smack he\u2019s talking?\u201d</p><p>Logan drops into his seat and slouches. \u201cYou lost, Ryan. Badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBadly?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe most fun I\u2019ve had in weeks,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIn fact, let\u2019s relive the moment. Hi, I\u2019m Ryan, I want your phone number.\u201d He holds out his hand to Logan.</p><p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d Logan says. \u201cShe had this elegant way of talking. Oh, yeah, I believe her response was \u2018Fuck you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting her name wasn\u2019t the dare.\u201d</p><p>Determined to keep Mrs. Rowe from taking into her possession every hat he owns like last year, Chris shoves his cap into his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou lost. Be a man. Suck it up. Or let us continue to make fun of you. Either way works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like making fun of him,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>I lower my voice and lean into the aisle so only Logan and Chris can hear. I have a small window of opportunity and the longer people stay in the dark regarding her uncle, the better my odds of scoring her number. Scott is a god at this school, which automatically makes her a demigod. \u201cHer real name is Elisabeth Risk and she\u2019s Scott Risk\u2019s niece.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeth.\u201d Books slam on my desk and the three of us flinch and look up. Black hair, nose ring, and a form-fitting white shirt unbuttoned recklessly close to areas where guys stare. Well, at least where I stare. Good God almighty, the girl\u2019s hot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this slowly and use little words in the hope you can follow along. If you call me Elisabeth again, I\u2019ll make sure you can never father children. Tell anyone else whose niece I am and you\u2019ll be sucking air out of a tube in your throat.\u201d</p><p>Chris laughs and it\u2019s the deep, throaty kind that tells me the shit we\u2019re entering is bad. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. Ryan just told us how badly he wanted to call you, didn\u2019t you, Ry?\u201d</p><p>Ding-ding, Chris rang the bell for round two and he\u2019s in direct violation of game play by interfering. Well played, because I would have done the same damn thing. \u201cI tried looking for you this morning, but the secretary said you were in a meeting with Mr. Dwyer.\u201d</p> <p>Her blue eyes pierce me, and an eyebrow slowly arches toward her hairline. The silence stretching between us becomes excruciating.</p><p>Chris shifts in his seat and Logan slouches lower by an inch. I will her to leave, but I need her presence to win the dare. I focus on keeping my face relaxed. If I even breathe, Skater Girl will know she has the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she finally responds. \u201cI\u2019m sure you did. Suck-ups do that type of thing. Here\u2019s the deal. I avoid you, you avoid me, and when my uncle asks if you helped me today I\u2019ll giggle like one of those pathetic girls standing in the hallway and gush about how poor, defenseless me couldn\u2019t make it in the big, mean school without big, strong Ryan to help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can giggle?\u201d asks Logan.</p><p>She glares at him. He shrugs. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as the giggling type\u2014just saying.\u201d</p> <p>Damn, Logan entered game play too, which means he\u2019ll want to place money on the dare. Time to salvage. \u201cThis is Chris and Logan. They play baseball with me. Chris has a girlfriend who I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love and if you want, you can sit with us today during lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, you really are brain damaged.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and Skater Girl goes to the opposite side of the room and holes up in the corner. That went well. My friends both wear smiles that make me want to kick their asses.</p><p>\u201cTwenty she curses you out by lunch,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>\u201cThirty she kills you by lunch,\u201d adds Logan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting her number.\u201d The two of them laugh, and the muscles in my biceps tighten at the thought of another loss. The paper in my notebook crinkles in my fist. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot enough game for that,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove you wrong.\u201d Out of the corner of my eye, I glimpse Beth. With her head down and her long black hair hiding her face, she doodles in a notebook with a pen in her left hand. Huh\u2014a southpaw.</p><p>Chris shakes his head. \u201cSorry, dawg. Beth attending Bullitt High is a rule-changing event.</p><p>See, phone numbers are for those we will never see again. You have months to work her. You want a win, then the stakes are raised\u2014you have to ask her out and she has to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the date has to be at a public venue for no less than an hour,\u201d adds Logan. \u201cYou know, to keep it legit.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t do it. If I mess this up, I could tick off Scott Risk; but then again, if I work this right, I could have Scott Risk eating out of the palm of my hand. He all but begged me to become friends with the spawn of Satan over there. Plus, if I walk away from this opportunity, it means I lost and I don\u2019t lose.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cDare accepted.\u201d</p><p>Game on, Skater Girl. Game on.</p> <p>Beth</p><p>I NEED A CIGARETTE and a smoker who will trust me. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t come across either of those in my four hours of living the teen version of Deliverance. From a distance, while the juniors and seniors head to lunch, I follow two guys with long hair and sagging jeans. I hope I can convince one of them to give me a drag.</p><p>They round a corner and I give them a sec. If I approach before they light up, they\u2019ll try to act cool like they aren\u2019t doing anything. Then there will be nothing I can say to convince them I won\u2019t snitch.</p><p>Hell, I wouldn\u2019t believe me. The new girl in a white button-down shirt.</p><p>I\u2019ve given them long enough. I turn the corner, prepared to tell them to chill, but the words catch in my mouth. They aren\u2019t there.</p><p>It\u2019s a short hallway with double doors leading out. I hurry to the window and watch as the two guys duck and weave through the parking lot. My head smacks the door. Damn. I never thought they\u2019d skip. First day. That\u2019s hard-core.</p><p>At the sound of a knock, my heart kicks out of my chest and with one glance out the window it melts. It\u2019s him. My body sags with relief. It\u2019s really him. I press the door open and the moment the warm summer sun caresses my face, Isaiah gathers me into his arms.</p><p>Normally, I wouldn\u2019t do this\u2014touch him so aware. Today, I don\u2019t mind. In fact, I bury myself in him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Isaiah kisses my hair and his hand cradles the back of my head, keeping me close. He kissed me. This embrace should bother me and I should push him away. We don\u2019t connect like this. Not sober. Today, his touch entices me to hold him tighter.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I mumble against the material of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFigured you\u2019d come out for a smoke at some point. This is the only place anyone has been doing it.\u201d</p><p>His heart has a strong, steady rhythm.</p><p>There were times, in my search for weightlessness, that I pushed too hard. Drank too much. Inhaled more than I should. Became physical with guys who were no good for me. I would go beyond weightlessness as a balloon on a string that had been snapped\u2014left alone in a frightening abyss. With one touch, Isaiah could ground me. Keep me from floating away with his arms as my anchor. His steady beating heart the reminder he would never let go.</p><p>With reluctance, I put space between us.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d be at this school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain it to you later. Let\u2019s go before we get caught.\u201d He holds his hand out to me.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I play along, knowing what my answer will be. I want the fantasy\u2014if only for a second.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want. You once said that you wanted to see the ocean. Let\u2019s go to the ocean, Beth. We can live there.\u201d</p><p>The ocean. The scene comes alive in my mind. Me in a pair of old faded jeans and a tank top. My hair blowing wildly in the breeze.</p><p>Isaiah with his hair buzzed short and shirt off, his tattoos frightening the tourists as they stroll by. I\u2019ll sit barefoot on the warm sand and watch the crashing waves while he watches me. Isaiah always keeps his eye on me.</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself and clutch the hem of my shirt to prevent myself from grasping him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his arm extended, but the weight of my words causes it to waver. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if I run away, if I break Scott\u2019s rules, he\u2019ll send my mom to jail.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s hand clenches into a fist and his arm drops to his side. \u201cFuck him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck her, too. In fact, why were you even with her Friday night? You promised me you\u2019d stay away from her. She hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was her boyfriend. Mom would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe let you take the fall for her bullshit and she sat back while he used you as a fucking pi\u00f1ata. Your mom is a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>A car door slams in the parking lot, and we slink to opposite corners by the door.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Beth.\u201d</p><p>I agree. We do. I nod toward the pinewoods.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over there.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah pokes his head out and scans the area. He waves his hand for me to go. We don\u2019t run. We walk in absolute silence. Once we\u2019re deep enough in, I turn, waiting for the question that has to be tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d Isaiah shoves his hands into his jeans pocket and stares at the brown pine needles on the ground. \u201cYou told me you never knew your dad.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Not a question, but an accusation.</p><p>One I deserve. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about my dad.\u201d</p><p>He keeps looking at those damn needles. A few years ago, I told Isaiah the same lie I gave everyone else regarding my father. Isaiah was so moved that he told me something he\u2019d never told anyone else: that his mother had no idea who his father was. The lie I told Isaiah bonded him to me for life. By the time I figured out what cemented our relationship, that he believed we both had huge question marks on the paternal side, it was too late to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou know how people are.\u201d I hate the desperation in my voice. \u201cThey love gossip and if there\u2019s a story, they\u2019ll dig, and I never wanted to think about the bastard again.</p><p>When I told you I never knew who my father was, I had no idea that was your reality. I didn\u2019t know that was the story that would make us friends.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shut at the word friends and his jaw jumps as if I said something to hurt him. But we are friends. He\u2019s my best friend. My only friend.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah...\u201d I have to give him something.</p><p>Something that will let him know what he means to me. \u201cWhat happened with my dad...\u201d</p><p>It hurts to breathe. \u201cWhen I was in third grade...\u201d Say it already!</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s gray eyes meet mine. The kindness in them fades as they turn a little wild. \u201cIs your dad around?\u201d In the predatory movement of a panther, he takes several steps toward me. \u201cAre you in danger?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. He\u2019s gone. Uncle</p><p>Scott and Dad hated each other. Scott didn\u2019t even know Dad left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dick, but he\u2019d never lay a hand on me. I swear.\u201d</p><p>He blinks and the wildness fades, but his muscles still ripple with anger. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d</p><p>His three simple words gut me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I can give him honesty now. \u201cI wish I could go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mom. I expected you to understand.\u201d It\u2019s a low blow. I stay silent, unmoving, waiting for him to swallow his demons.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he says in a hard voice, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean I agree.\u201d</p><p>Good. He\u2019s forgiven me. Guilt still eats at me, but at least my stomach muscles relax while the guilt feasts.</p><p>\u201cNice shirt,\u201d he says, and I smile at his playful tone.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl. I was wondering if they sucked out your personality in first period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not far off.\u201d Time is running short.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost so much already. I can\u2019t lose him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your uncle\u2019s terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo running away and no more seeing you or Noah.\u201d Scott said he wanted me to completely forget my old life. That the only way I\u2019d have a fresh start was to make a clean break and if I wouldn\u2019t willingly amputate the past, then he\u2019d do it for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isaiah grimaces. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ditching school.

No smoking.</p><p>No drugs. No drinking. And...no contact with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I agree with the last one. Can you make it happen this time?\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. He flips me off. God, he\u2019s aggravating. \u201cNo more cursing. Keep curfew.\u201d</p> <p>His head pops up. \u201cHe\u2019s letting you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably with a GPS stitched under my forehead. I have to clear every second of every outing through him. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019re a bright girl who could manipulate the devil for a passage out of hell.</p><p>You get out of that house and I\u2019ll come get you. Any day. Any time. And I\u2019ll have you safely home by curfew.\u201d</p><p>Hope fills me, yet it\u2019s not enough. I need more than Isaiah. I need something else. I fiddle with the ends of my shirttail. \u201cWill you take me to see my mom?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cNo. She\u2019s no good for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him. She made her choices.\u201d</p><p>I stumble back as if he punched me. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>The anger returns to his eyes. \u201cHow? A few months ago, she let you bleed in front of her.</p><p>How could she go back to that bastard? How could she let you take the fall for her? Don\u2019t play the sympathy card on me. No one fucks with you. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>I nod to placate him, but I\u2019ll find another way. Isaiah\u2019s right. I can play Scott, keep Isaiah, and find a way to take care of Mom.</p><p>He pulls something out of his back pocket and tosses it to me. I slide open a shiny new gray cell phone. \u201cWe saw Scott trash your cell so I bought a new one for you and put you on my plan.\u201d</p><p>I quirk up a smile. \u201cYou got a plan?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cNoah and I got a plan and we put you on it. Cheaper that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...\u201d Echo inspired. \u201cGrown-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Noah\u2019s been doing a lot of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know? That I\u2019d be here? In Groveton? At school?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah focuses on the trees. \u201cEcho. At the police station, she sat close enough to your uncle and your mom to overhear what was going down. Then Echo talked Shirley into giving us the rest of the information. Scott told Shirley his plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI\u2019m in debt to psycho bitch.\u201d The moment I say it, I feel a twinge of remorse. She\u2019s not entirely crazy, but the truth is our relationship is strained. She\u2019s sweet and she\u2019s nice and she makes Noah happy, but she\u2019s brought change...too much change...and how can I like that?</p><p>He shifts from one side to another. That\u2019s not good. \u201cWhat else, Isaiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcho sold a painting.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cSo?\u201d Echo\u2019s been selling her paintings since last spring.</p><p>He reaches into his back pocket again and produces a wad of cash. Holy Mother of God, I\u2019m going to start painting. \u201cIt was one of her favorites. Something she painted for her brother before he died. Noah was ticked when he found out.\u201d He holds out the money.</p><p>\u201cShe did it for you.\u201d</p><p>Pissed. I\u2019m beyond pissed. \u201cI don\u2019t want her charity.\u201d She didn\u2019t do it for me. She did it for Noah and Isaiah, but she mainly did it so I\u2019d have to owe her and she knows that pride is one of the few things I rightfully own.</p><p>Isaiah closes the distance between us and shoves the bills in my back pocket before I have a chance to step away. \u201cTake it. I want to know you have cash in case you need to bail quickly. It\u2019s my debt to pay.\u201d</p><p>The wad of cash feels heavy in my back pocket. Even though I\u2019m determined to see this year out, I also know that life sucks. It\u2019s best to be prepared.</p><p>The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>As I walk past him, Isaiah wraps a hand around my arm. \u201cOne more thing.\u201d His eyes darken into shadows. \u201cCall me. Anytime. I swear to you, I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It takes a second to work up the courage to say it, but he\u2019s my best friend and worth the words. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you.\u201d Isaiah releases me, and as I walk back to school my fingers trace the area where my skin still burns from his touch. He\u2019s my friend...my only friend.</p><p>I pull on the handle of the same door I\u2019d snuck out of and my heart sinks as the door stays shut. No. I broke the cardinal rule of ditching: always make sure you can sneak back in. I wiggle the handle. Nothing. I wiggle the other door\u2019s handle. Same result. The dread sparks deep in my stomach and becomes a flash fire of panic in a heartbeat. I can\u2019t get back in, which means I\u2019ll be busted when I don\u2019t show for next period. When Scott finds out, he\u2019ll burst a blood vessel.</p><p>With both hands, I grab the handle again.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d I yank. The door gives. A hand flies out, snatches my arm, and drags me into the building.</p><p>I glance up at my rescuer and my insides become liquid when I see the most beautiful light brown eyes staring down at me. Ruining the moment, their owner speaks. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is what your uncle meant by showing you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, my life sucks,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>It\u2019s Ryan. I really hate this town.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>SKATER GIRL IS ON THE LOSING END of this moment. She snaps her arm out of my hand and glares at me with those unblinking blue eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want your help.\u201d</p><p>Winning feels great. Awesome. Drives me higher than anything else in the world. The twisting and pressure that I so often feel\u2014gone. Winning leaves my muscles loose, makes me lift my head higher, and damn if it doesn\u2019t bring on a smile. \u201cYou may not want it, but you need it.\u201d</p><p>The second bell rings and Beth slams into my arm as she stalks past. Twenty bucks she thinks she\u2019s late for class. \u201cIt\u2019s only second bell.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates and her spine goes rigid. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter lunch?\u201d I casually walk up to her.</p><p>This is too much fun. \u201cThree. One to release lunch. A two-minute warning bell. Then the tardy bell.\u201d</p><p>She releases a slow stream of air from her perfectly shaped lips, and relief relaxes her cheeks. This girl is sexy, but she\u2019s also a handful. If I hadn\u2019t accepted the dare, I\u2019d toss her into avoid-like-the-plague territory.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your next class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d Beth rushes down the hallway and I pursue her at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Lockers lurch open and clang shut. Chatter fills the hallway. People stop and stare as Beth moves. Moves\u2014that\u2019s exactly what the girl does. She holds her head high and owns the middle of the hallway. A few kids have transferred to this school since my freshman year, but they spent their first couple of weeks trying to blend into the paint. Not Beth. Her hips have this easy sway that catches the eye of every guy, including me.</p><p>Beth checks out the numbers over the doors, no doubt searching for her fifth-period room. I pick up the pace and fall in step with her as she pulls a badly folded schedule out of her back pocket. Her thumb skims the list until it finds its target: Health/Physical Education.</p><p>The odds of winning just increased in my favor. That\u2019s my next class too. \u201cI can show you where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you stalking me? If so, you\u2019ll get your ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who? The guy you made out with in the tree line?\u201d I have a hard time believing that a man as great as Scott Risk would allow his niece to date Tattoo Guy, but maybe that\u2019s why he switched her schools. You gotta love a man who takes care of family. \u201cSorry to tell you, but I can hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Beth wears a scowl that could kill on sight.</p><p>\u201cThreaten Isaiah again and I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle at the thought of the tiny, black-haired threat throwing swings at me. Punches from her would feel like a bunny biting a lion.</p><p>By the way she pinches her lips together, I can tell my laughter pisses her off. Time to end this bull. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpful? You mean you\u2019re trying to help yourself. You\u2019re a walking hard-on for my uncle.\u201d</p><p>A muscle near my eye ticks. On rare occasions, bunnies can develop rabies, and Scott did warn me she was rough around the edges. He failed to mention that razor blades are her softest layer. My mouth snaps open to ask what the hell is wrong with her when Lacy sidles between us. She shoots me a warning glare. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, dawg.\u201d Chris waggles his eyebrows and I realize he sent in Lacy to disturb us, thinking he interrupted me making a play. \u201cLet\u2019s go to class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Class. I want to win the dare, but that won\u2019t happen if I lose my temper. I follow Chris, willing to do anything to get away from Beth.</p><p>Beth</p><p>The moment Ryan turns his back, I sag against a purple locker. The acrid smell of fresh paint fills my nose. Watch\u2014the damn locker is newly painted and I\u2019ll have purple on my ass.</p><p>A hallway full of strange teenagers gawk at me like I\u2019m an animal caged at the zoo. I swallow when two girls giggle as they pass.</p><p>Both crane their necks to get a better glimpse of the new school freak.</p><p>People judge. They\u2019re judging me now.</p><p>\u201cYour hair used to be blond,\u201d says Lacy.</p><p>What is the deal with the people in this town and my hair? I barely recognize the girl I once claimed as a friend. We sized each other up in English, trying to figure out if the other was really who we thought she was. Lacy has the same chestnut-brown hair as when we were kids. Just as long, but not as stringy. It\u2019s thick now. She nods at Ryan\u2019s friend Chris, indicating that he should follow Ryan into the classroom and he does.</p><p>\u201cYou used to hang out with cool people,\u201d I say.</p><p>The right corner of her lips tilts up. \u201cI used to hang with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and a few remaining stragglers race to class. Lucky me, I share another class with Ryan. I push off the wall, check for paint, and feel off-balance when Lacy follows.</p><p>The cliques split off as fast as cockroaches when a light shines. Ryan and a couple other guys relax at a table near the back as if they\u2019re God\u2019s gift to women. Their expensive jeans and T-shirts that sport their favorite moronic teams scream total jock. I hand my enrollment sheet to a teacher deep in conversation with two more jocks. They discuss baseball, football, basketball. Blah, blah, blah. It must be a male thing to talk about playing with balls.</p><p>Lacy plops down at an empty table and kicks out a chair for me to join her. \u201cRyan says you go by Beth.\u201d</p><p>I fall into the chair and glance over at Ryan. He quickly averts his eyes. My blood tingles\u2014was he really staring at me? Stop it.</p><p>The tingling fades. Of course he was. You\u2019re the freak, remember? \u201cWhat else did Ryan tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Meeting you Friday night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yesterday with Scott.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cSo the whole damn school knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says thoughtfully. Lacy looks me over and I can tell she\u2019s searching for that pathetic girl from a long time ago. \u201cHe only told me, Chris, and Logan. The one with dark hair sitting next to Ryan is my boyfriend, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s worth it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cMost of the time.\u201d</p><p>For four classes, people have ignored me. I helped the situation by sitting in the back of each room and glaring at anyone who looked at me for longer than a second. Lacy drums her fingers against the table. Two thin black ponytail holders wrap her wrist. She wears low-rider jeans and a green retro T-shirt imprinted with a faded white four-leaf clover.</p><p>\u201cHow many people have you told?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>The drumming stops. \u201cTold what?\u201d</p><p>I lower my voice and pick at the remaining black paint on my nails. \u201cWho I am and why I left town.\u201d I\u2019m fishing. Because of the enrollment slip, no one has called my name out in class and no one\u2019s mentioned my uncle. For today, I\u2019m anonymous, but how long will that last? I\u2019m also testing the waters for the town gossip. Lacy\u2019s dad was a police officer and he was the first one to walk into the trailer that night.</p> <p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell people about your uncle when you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s sickening. No one gave a crap about Scott until the World Series. Now everyone worships him.\u201d</p><p>A group of girls break into laughter. The same type of purse rests on the table in front of each perfectly manicured girl. Sure, the colors and sizes of the purses are different, but the style is the same. The blonde laughing the loudest catches me looking and I toss my hair over my shoulder as a shield. I know her, and I don\u2019t want her to remember me.</p><p>\u201cGwen\u2019s still staring,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cIt might take a few days for the hamster wheel turning her brain to make the full circle, but she\u2019ll figure you out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I might appreciate her sarcasm if I wasn\u2019t distracted by the blonde. Gwen Gardner. The summer before kindergarten, Lacy\u2019s mom suggested to Scott that I go with Lacy to Vacation Bible School. I put on my favorite dress, one of two that I owned, pinned as many ribbons as I could in my hair, and skipped into the room. A group of girls in beautiful fluffy dresses surrounded me as I introduced myself.</p><p>To the tune of giggles and whispers from the other girls, Gwen proceeded to point out every hole and stain on my beloved dress.</p><p>That was the high point in my relationship with Gwen. From there, it went downhill.</p> <p>\u201cShe still a bitch?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWorse.\u201d Lacy\u2019s tone drops. \u201cYet everyone believes she\u2019s a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought third grade sucked.\u201d</p><p>Lacy snorts. \u201cImagine what middle school and training bras were like with her. I swear the girl blossomed into a C-cup between fifth and sixth grade. Thank God Ryan finally broke up with her last spring. I couldn\u2019t stand being within a foot of her a moment longer.\u201d</p><p>Of course Ryan dated Gwen. I\u2019m sure the break-up is temporary and they\u2019ll marry soon and create tons of other little perfect spawns of Satan in order to torture further generations of people like me.</p><p>We lapse into an awkward silence. It\u2019s strange talking to Lacy. It used to be the two of us against the world. Then I left. I assumed, in my absence, she\u2019d become one of them\u2014the girls who were perfect. She had the potential to be one. Her parents had money. Her mom would have bought her the clothes. Lacy was pretty and fun. For some insane reason, she stuck with me\u2014the girl who had two outfits and lived in the trailer park.</p><p>I scratch off the remaining paint. Yesterday Allison bought me nail polish in the annoying shade of mauve. How can anyone look at me and think mauve? \u201cWhat did your dad tell you?\u201d</p><p>Lacy\u2019s pinkie taps the table repeatedly.</p> <p>\u201cThat he was called to your home and that you later moved to another city.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I glance up to catch sincerity in her dark eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks Scott swooped in and saved you. Daddy and the other guys that responded that night let that rumor stand.\u201d Her forehead crinkles. \u201cIt\u2019s what happened, right? You\u2019ve been living with Scott?\u201d</p><p>I scratch my cheek, trying to hide whatever reaction she might see. I could lie and tell her yes, but that would be like I\u2019m embarrassed about Mom. And I\u2019m not embarrassed. I love her. I owe her. Yet there are times...</p><p>\u201cI cried for three months when you left,\u201d</p><p>Lacy continues. \u201cYou were my best friend.\u201d</p><p>I cried too. A lot. Thanks to me and my stupid decisions, I cost my mom everything and I lost my best friend. Typical me\u2014a hurricane that leaves nothing but destruction.</p><p>\u201cGo sit with your friends, Lacy. I\u2019m bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this classroom, those two guys sitting over there are the only real friends I have.\u201d</p><p>Lacy drums her fingers once more. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYour life must suck then.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s a good life.\u201d</p><p>The teacher calls the class to order and I inch my seat away from Lacy\u2019s. An unseen, uncomfortable vise tightens my chest.</p><p>Normal people don\u2019t like me. They don\u2019t want to be my friend, and here is someone offering friendship willingly.</p><p>As the teacher calls attendance, Ryan\u2019s name is read and he answers with a deep, soothing,</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Taking a chance, I peek in his direction and find him staring at me again. No smile. No anger. No cockiness. Just a thoughtful expression mixed with confusion. He scratches the back of his head and I\u2019m drawn to his biceps. My traitorous stomach flutters. God, the boy may be an ass, but he sure is built.</p><p>And guys like him don\u2019t go for girls like me.</p><p>They only use me.</p><p>I force my eyes to the front of class, pull my knees to my chest, and wrap my arms around them. Lacy invades my space and whispers to me, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, Beth.\u201d</p><p>A sliver of hope sneaks past my walls and I slam every opening shut. Emotion is evil.</p><p>People who make me feel are worse. I take comfort in the stone inside of me. If I don\u2019t feel, I don\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>WAITING ON SUNDAY DINNER, I can observe a lot from my seat on the couch in the living room of the mayor\u2019s house. For instance, the serious set of Dad\u2019s mouth and the angle of his body toward Mr. Crane suggests that Dad\u2019s talking business. Serious business. Mom, on the other hand, is laughter and giggles as she stands next to the mayor\u2019s wife and the</p><p>pastor\u2019s wife, but the way she fingers her pearls tells me she\u2019s anxious. That means someone asked a question about Mark.</p><p>Mom misses him. So do I.</p><p>The power of observation. It\u2019s a skill I need to play ball. Is the runner on base going to chance a steal? Is the batter going to hit the ball out of the park or is he going to hit a sacrifice fly in order to score the runner on third? Is Skater Girl the hard-nosed chick I believe her to be?</p><p>For the last two weeks, I\u2019ve watched Beth roam the school. She\u2019s interesting. Nothing like the girls I know. She sits by herself at lunch and eats a full meal. Not salad. Not an apple. A full meal. Like an entr\u00e9e, two sides, and a dessert. Even Lacy doesn\u2019t do that.</p><p>Beth sits in the back of every class, except for Health/Gym, where Lacy patiently makes small talk even though Beth stays quiet.</p><p>Sometimes Lacy can get Beth to crack a smile, but it\u2019s rare. I like it when she smiles.</p><p>Not that I care if she\u2019s happy or anything.</p><p>What I find the most interesting is that even though she\u2019s Ms. Antisocial, she doesn\u2019t avoid people. Yeah, plenty of kids hide in plain sight.</p><p>They duck into the library before school or during lunch. They evade eye contact and walk in the shadows as if they can go to school and never be detected. Not Beth. She stands her ground. Owns the space around her and smirks if someone comes too close, as if she\u2019s daring them to take her on. A smirk that dares turns me on.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for the quiz tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Rowe, my English teacher, rests against the arm of the couch. She also happens to be the mayor\u2019s daughter. While everyone else wears suit pants, ties, or conservative dresses, Mrs. Rowe wears a daisy-print hippie dress.</p><p>Today, her hair is purple.</p><p>Considering the fights my family has had over Mark, I\u2019m curious about the brawls that happen behind closed doors at this house. Or maybe other families find a way to accept one another.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d To discourage small talk, I shove a bacon-wrapped shrimp into my mouth.</p><p>Dad likes me to be at these occasional Sunday gatherings. I come in handy when the men discuss sports. I used to come in handier when I dated Gwen. Her dad is the police chief, plus my mother\u2019s friends thought we were \u201ccute together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated these things when I was your age,\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Rowe continues. I pop in another shrimp and nod. If she hated them, I would think she\u2019d remember that useless conversation is physically painful. \u201cMy dad made me attend every dinner he threw.\u201d</p><p>I swallow and realize that not once in my four years of being old enough to represent the family have I seen Mrs. Rowe attend one of these functions. I consider asking why she\u2019s here tonight, then remember I don\u2019t care. In goes a meatball.</p><p>\u201cI read your paper,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shrug. Reading my paper is her job.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. In fact, it\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart to hers and I curse internally when she smiles. Dammit, it shouldn\u2019t matter if it was good. I want to play ball, not write. I make a show of staring in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about expanding it into a short story?\u201d</p><p>This I have an answer for. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shrug again and begin to search the room for a viable reason to escape\u2014like the curtains catching on fire.</p><p>A sly smile spreads across her face. \u201cListen, I received good news and I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to wait until tomorrow to share. Do you remember the writing project we worked on last year?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d be tough to forget. We spent the year devouring books and movies. Then we tore them apart as if they were machines so we could see how the parts worked together to create the story. After that, Mrs. Rowe snapped the whip and made us write something of our own. Hardest damn class I ever took and I loved every second. Hated it too. When I became too interested or too eager in class, the guys from the team rode me hard.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how I entered everyone into the state writing competition?\u201d</p><p>I nod a yes, but the answer is no. Just because I loved the class didn\u2019t mean I listened to everything she said. \u201cWhy? Did Lacy win?\u201d</p><p>She had a hell of a short story.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>In goes another meatball. That sucks. Lacy would have been excited if she won.</p><p>\u201cYou finaled, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>The meatball slips into my throat whole and I choke.</p><p>DITCHING THE FORMAL CLOTHES for a pair of athletic pants and a Reds T-shirt, I lean back in the chair at my desk and stare at the homework assignment I turned in to Mrs. Rowe. In four pages, poor George woke up to discover he had become a zombie. My favorite sentence is the paper\u2019s last: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Staring down at his hands, hands that someday would likely kill, George swallowed the sickening knowledge that he had become absolutely powerless.</p><p>Why it\u2019s my favorite, I don\u2019t know. But every time I read it something stirs inside me, some sort of sense of justification.</p><p>I run a hand over my hair, unable to comprehend that I finaled in a writing competition. Maybe later tonight hell will freeze over and donkeys will start flying out of my ass. It all seems possible at this point.</p><p>I swivel the chair and survey my room.</p> <p>Trophies and medals and accolades for playing ball are scattered on the wall, the shelves, my dresser. A Reds pennant hangs over my bed. I know baseball. I\u2019m good at it. I should be. It\u2019s been my entire life.</p><p>I\u2019m Ryan Stone\u2014ballplayer, jock, leader of the team. But Ryan Stone\u2014writer? I chuckle to myself as I pick the paperwork up off the desk.</p><p>All of it describes in detail how to continue to the next phase of the writing competition, how to win. Not once in my life have I backed down from a challenge.</p><p>But this...this is beyond what I am. I toss the papers down again. I need to stay focused on what\u2019s important and writing isn\u2019t it.</p><p>Beth</p> <p>GYM IS AN ABOMINATION to self-esteem. While changing out of the white ruffled shirt into the required gym attire of a pink Bullitt County High T-shirt and matching shorts, I take stock of the other girls. They gossip as they change.</p><p>Most brush their hair. Some fix their makeup.</p><p>All thin. All fit. All beautiful. Not me, though.</p><p>I\u2019m thin enough, but I\u2019m not pretty.</p><p>The girls who really irritate me are the ones God gave everything to: money, looks, and a C-cup chest. Gwen is the worst. The moment she enters the locker room, she strips her shirt and walks around freely in her lace bra. Her nonverbal reminder that us B-cups are inferior.</p><p>Busting out of the locker room, I relax when I see the gym is empty. Most of the school is a no-cell zone, but not the gym. I desperately need to speak to Mom. It\u2019s been two weeks since the last time I talked to her and her last words to me were that pathetic</p> <p>\u201cplease...probation\u201d in the parking lot. Trent wouldn\u2019t permit her to say goodbye to me at the police station. God, I hate him.</p><p>I duck under the bleachers, pull the phone out of my shorts pocket, and dial Mom\u2019s number. I\u2019ve called several times over the last two weeks, but she\u2019s never answered. Anytime after four she\u2019d be at the bar. Mom told me once that you\u2019re only an alcoholic if you drink before noon. Good thing for Mom she never wakes before three.</p><p>The phone rings once then three loud beeps answer. A calm, annoying voice states a message of doom: \u201cSorry, the number you have dialed has been disconnected.\u201d</p><p>Regret becomes a weight in my stomach.</p><p>Last month, I could pay the electricity bill with Mom\u2019s disability check or I could pay the phone bill. The electricity company sent a disconnect notice. I thought I had more time on the phone. I picked the electricity bill.</p><p>My throat becomes thick and my eyes burn.</p><p>Crap\u2014my mom. I messed up. Again. Imagine that. I should have paid the phone bill. I should have found a way. I could have taken on more hours stocking at the Dollar Store. I could have sucked up my pride and asked Noah or Isaiah for money. I could have done so many things and I didn\u2019t. Why am I such a screwup?</p><p>I suddenly wish it was ten at night. Isaiah and I talk then\u2014every night. Usually, it\u2019s not for long. Just a few seconds or so. He\u2019s not a phone talker by nature, but the first time I called he asked me to check in nightly and I do. His voice is the only thing keeping me sane.</p> <p>I slip the phone into my pocket as everyone files into the gym. They chatter and laugh, oblivious to the real problems of the real world. I need to find a ride into Louisville and I need to find one fast. A sharp pain slices through my head and threatens to form into a headache when Lacy breaks away from Chris and Ryan to join me. I\u2019m not in the mood for this\u2014not today.</p><p>\u201cYou changed quickly,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cAre you okay? You look upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But I itch to wipe my eyes.</p><p>Somehow, they\u2019re wet and full, and I refuse to touch them around Lacy or anyone else. I never cry and I\u2019ll never let anyone believe that I\u2019m capable of the moronic act.</p><p>\u201cFive-minute round up!\u201d Mr. Knox, our health teacher, calls.</p><p>He wears a shiny whistle around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOn the bulletin board is every exercise you are required to perform in order to receive credit for this class. We will be spending three days in the gym and two in the classroom.</p><p>Some exercises you can do on your own.</p><p>Others require teamwork. You have two opportunities to impress me, so I suggest that you use your time wisely and do not come to me for credit unless you have practiced the item to perfection.\u201d</p><p>We stare at him in silence. Mr. Knox jerks his thumb behind him. \u201cGet to work.\u201d</p><p>I lag behind the others, praying that most of the exercises can be done on my own. My insides twist as I watch people pair off into twos and threes to complete their assignments.</p><p>Left alone, I sidle up to the board and sigh so heavily that the posted paper moves. Surely I can convince Mr. Knox that I am, within myself, a four-layered pyramid.</p><p>\u201cYou can work with me.\u201d</p><p>My heart stutters at the sound of Ryan\u2019s voice. Damn, why do I have to find everything about this boy attractive? His voice, his face, his biceps, his abs... stop it! I cross my arms over my chest and turn to face him. \u201cI thought we had an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You threw a hissy fit on the first day of school. That doesn\u2019t constitute an agreement.\u201d</p><p>Ryan isn\u2019t wearing his baseball cap and I love it. His sandy-blond hair has a golden tone.</p><p>It\u2019s styled-yet-not-styled into the disarray of not quite curls that kick out in various directions. Get a grip, Beth. Hot guys don\u2019t go for loser girls. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>I walk away from Ryan because he shows no sign of leaving me. Stacks of equipment line the wall on the other side of the gym. One of the four items that can be completed on my own is jumping rope. I can do that. I think. I used to jump rope when I was a kid.</p><p>I grasp one of the ropes and twenty others tumble out of the box along with it. All of them knotted and intertwined. Gwen and a group of girls giggle as they gawk at me. I wonder if they\u2019ll still be giggling when I turn and beat them with the jump-rope knot from hell.</p><p>\u201cTrust fall.\u201d Lacy magically teleports in front of me.</p><p>Still holding the train of ropes, I glance up at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust fall. Me and the boys are doing it and you\u2019re going to do it with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. Requirements say that we have to have at least two girls in the group.\u201d</p><p>I blink twice. \u201cGo ask one of the girls grooming each other like monkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t girls. They\u2019re vultures.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and Chris watch us. The other one studies the five-foot platform we\u2019re supposed to \u201cfall\u201d from. I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the guy with black hair doing in this class?\u201d He wasn\u2019t last week, but he is in my English class and had the balls to tease me on my first day. Platform guy is lucky to be alive.</p><p>Lacy waves him off. \u201cThat\u2019s Logan. He tested out of his math and they switched his schedule and the rest is totally not important.</p><p>Let\u2019s go.\u201d She snatches my hand and the rope drags with me until I remember to drop it.</p><p>She releases me when we reach the platform. Ryan gives me a condescending smile. \u201cChanged your mind? Don\u2019t worry, most girls do when it comes to me.\u201d</p><p>I wish I had a jacket that I could pull around myself and hide in. I don\u2019t, so I do the next best thing. \u201cDid you have to bribe those girls with tacos or was that reserved for me?\u201d</p><p>Chris and Logan chuckle and Ryan angles his shoulders away from me. On the other side of the gym, Lacy kicks at a huge foam mat.</p><p>The boys rescue her by lifting the gigantic mat into the air like it weighs nothing, then tossing it in front of the platform. A spark of panic hurts my lungs. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case we drop you,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cIn case you what?\u201d Frantically, I eyeball the wooden platform that reminds me of a diving board at a public pool. I can\u2019t swim and I don\u2019t jump.</p><p>\u201cDrop you,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>Lacy smacks the back of Logan\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cStop it. We won\u2019t drop you.\u201d</p><p>Of course they won\u2019t, because I\u2019m not jumping. I step backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Boss Man?\u201d asks Logan as he looks at Ryan. I snort and Ryan glances at me. Of course, they see perfect Ryan as their fearless leader.</p><p>Ryan rearranges the mat to center it with the platform. \u201cEach of us takes one practice run.</p><p>We perfect our technique and then we show Coach. Logan, you\u2019re first. That way if we have the wrong technique, we drop a guy, not a girl.\u201d</p><p>Chris, Ryan, and Lacy gather around the mat. I stay planted in my spot. \u201cIf you\u2019re the boss, then why don\u2019t you go first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Logan\u2019s crazy and would go first even if I didn\u2019t ask. At least now someone\u2019s here to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d adds Lacy. \u201cLogan\u2019s too smart for common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear.\u201d Logan sits on the platform. His legs dangle over the side. \u201cToo smart for fear.\u201d</p><p>Lacy shrugs. \u201cPotayto, potahto. Same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it down,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cCome on, Beth.</p><p>You and Lacy take the area toward his feet.</p><p>Chris and I will handle his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so we can get kicked in the head?</p><p>That\u2019s real gallant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Ryan with forced patience.</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2019s all upper body. Chris and I are going to take the heavier part.\u201d</p><p>Logan pumps his chest with his fist. \u201cSolid wall, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess talking, more jumping,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, dawg.\u201d</p><p>I take my place across from Lacy. Without giving me much of a choice, Lacy grabs hold of my hands and seconds later we grip each other tighter when heavy legs plop onto our arms.</p><p>\u201cSon-of-a-bitch, Junior,\u201d swears Chris. \u201cYou were supposed to count down before you jumped. Drop his sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Lacy and I let go and Logan falls the remaining way onto the mat. He laughs as he scrambles up. \u201cYou caught me just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Lacy hops over the mat and climbs the platform.</p><p>Ryan takes Lacy\u2019s place across from me and offers me his hands. I stare down at them. I don\u2019t touch people and they don\u2019t touch me. I mean, Lacy has, but it\u2019s different. We used to be friends, even if was a long time ago. Sweat forms on my palms and I rub them against my shorts and place my hands over Ryan\u2019s. His fingers clutch mine. His skin is the right mixture of strength and warmth, and his touch sends shivers through my body. I\u2019ve gone two torturous weeks without a cigarette and I really crave one right now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Lace,\u201d Ryan says in that deep, soothing voice. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan and I have been holding hands for five seconds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of high.\u201d Lacy stands on the edge of the platform. A bit of the fire that constantly lives in her eyes diminishes.</p><p>Ryan gives me that glorious smile\u2014the cute one with a hint of dimples. A curling heat spreads in my bloodstream. Damn, I like that smile.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this, baby,\u201d says Chris.</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s thumb moves across the top of my hands and every single cell of my being becomes a live electrical socket. We\u2019ve been holding hands for ten seconds.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lacy doesn\u2019t look like she knows.</p><p>She looks as unsure as I feel about catching her. \u201cMaybe one of you guys should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around, Lace, and fall backwards.\u201d</p><p>Ryan uses a gentle yet commanding tone. Even though he speaks to Lacy, he keeps those brilliant light brown eyes locked on me. His thumb does another heart-skipping sweep across my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this and you know we got you.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what it would be like if he held me in his arms? Would I feel as alive as I do now?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she sighs. \u201cGive me a sec.\u201d</p><p>My hands sweat again and I don\u2019t want any more thoughts of my body lying next to his or visions of his hands on my skin or hope that his smile is for me. I don\u2019t want anyone touching me anymore. Especially guys that are strong and warm and slightly cute and can make my heart stutter. I try to pull away, but Ryan tightens his grip. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do it,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Ryan studies me for a second. \u201cYes, she can.</p><p>Lacy can do anything she puts her mind to.\u201d</p> <p>I try to jerk my arms away again, but Ryan\u2019s hold is too tight.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid.\u201d Panic floods my brain and makes me feel a little crazy. \u201cAll of this is stupid. What\u2019s the stupid point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo learn how to work together as a team and to put our trust in one another.\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice becomes a calming balm on my panic until I figure out how much I want to listen.</p><p>This isn\u2019t good. Not good at all. Isn\u2019t that how the pied piper worked? Didn\u2019t he play something soothing and all the rats drowned?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a part of your stupid team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but let\u2019s pretend for a few seconds that you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ready,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>A split second later Lacy\u2019s Nikes are inches from my face. Resting safely in our hands, Lacy laughs. \u201cThat was great. Let\u2019s do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan releases me and helps the guys lower Lacy to her feet. I step back and try to rub any trace of Ryan off onto my clothes. I don\u2019t want strong hands holding my arms. I don\u2019t want to be part of a team, and I sure as hell don\u2019t have to prove anything by jumping off a ledge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re next, Beth,\u201d Ryan says.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word comes out automatically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go sometime, so let\u2019s do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Lacy flies to my side. \u201cAt first I was like \u2018no way\u2019 and then Ryan was like \u2018You can\u2019 and then I thought \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 and then I thought \u2018These guys would never drop me\u2019 and I was like \u2018Okay\u2019 and then I did it and it was such a rush.\u201d</p><p>Logan and Chris warily look at me. They\u2019d drop me. Just like Ryan would definitely drop me. \u201cWhat type of game are you playing?\u201d I ask of Ryan.</p><p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used Lacy to lure me over here. Was your plan to make me believe I could trust you and then drop me so everyone can laugh?\u201d</p><p>With each word, my voice becomes higher and my heart pounds faster in my chest.</p><p>Ryan shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel and head to the locker room. I\u2019ll claim cramps and blood and periods and tampons and keep saying words like menstruation until the teacher lets me out of class. Right on the verge of entering the locker room, Ryan\u2019s large figure looms in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I say.</p><p>He points at me. \u201cYou are a part of this team and you will help us until this task is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I bite out. \u201cI\u2019m not part of your perfect team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the beauty of living in America. You can\u2019t make me do a damn thing.\u201d I slam my body into his and enter the safety of the locker room.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>COACH KNOX MADE US hit the locker rooms early and I rushed to get dressed. Beth will be one of the first girls out since she was the first in. Me and her\u2014we have unfinished business.</p><p>She left my team in a bind plus she ruined my plan to ask her out.</p><p>At the top of the wooden bleachers, she sits by herself with her back against the cinder-block wall and her legs stretched out. Her black hair rests behind her shoulders and she types into a cell phone with her thumbs. A small smile curves her lips. There\u2019s a look about Beth, one I haven\u2019t seen before...something almost peaceful.</p><p>Scaling the bleachers, I take the rows two at a time. The hollow thumping of my steps echoes in the empty gym. Beth snaps the phone shut and shoves it in her back pocket. The small smile and peacefulness fade as she officially extracts the claws. \u201cAren\u2019t you popular people supposed to be gracing the masses with your presence in the locker room, leaving us losers to hide in peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Noted, but her being alone won\u2019t help me win the dare. \u201cThis is going to be a long year if you keep pushing everyone away. I can help you fit in, you know.\u201d</p><p>In a slow, sexy motion, Beth slides her silky hair behind her ear. \u201cI see. You\u2019re into charity work. Admirable, but I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>How she does it, I don\u2019t know, but she has this hypnotizing sway and seductive voice that can make me forget for a few seconds why I don\u2019t like her. Then my brain replays her snide comments. Ignoring my admiration of her body and that I love the sound of her voice, I sit on the row below her.</p><p>Beth flutters her fingers in the air. \u201cGo on,\u201d she says as if she was talking to a dog. \u201cShoo.\u201d</p><p>Play it cool. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times. Pull out the charm. Overlook the fact she dismissed me when I asked her to hang with me during gym. Pretend I didn\u2019t have to resort to using Lacy in order to accomplish my goal. Repeat over and over again that I don\u2019t care that she left a team depending on her. \u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p><p>She glances at her outfit: black pants\u2014 stylish, form-fitting\u2014and another white button-down shirt, except this one has puffed sleeves. Definitely not the style she wore when I first met her. On Gwen, those clothes would look like they came out of a fashion show. On Beth...it makes me miss the jeans with holes.</p><p>\u201cNice for a clown in a traveling circus. What angle are you playing?\u201d</p><p>For her to give me a damn break. \u201cGo out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to snag the niece to impress Scott or a fuck to impress your friends?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in my jaw jumps and her all-seeing eyes catch it. I\u2019ve come to detest that wicked grin. Be nice. Even if she isn\u2019t. Getting mad won\u2019t help me win her over. Plus, she\u2019s not far off the mark. \u201cThere\u2019s a field party Friday night. It would be a good chance to meet people instead of blowing them off.\u201d</p><p>She leans in and I inhale the distinct scent of roses. \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a secret. I kind of enjoy blowing people off. It goes well with my attitude of this-school-can-eat-shit-and-die.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is wrong with this girl?</p><p>Beth relaxes back onto the bleacher. \u201cI\u2019ll ask again, what\u2019s the game, Jock Boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo game,\u201d I say too quickly and try to slow it down. The door to the locker rooms opens and I hear laughter as people enter the gym. I have seconds to impress her before the bleachers fill. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty, Beth.\u201d Suddenly it\u2019s hard to look at her. She is pretty. More than pretty. I stare at my shoes. Get a grip, Ryan.</p><p>She\u2019s a dare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty?\u201d Beth raises her voice and I glimpse the other students climbing the bleachers and taking their seats. Their chatter stops and they watch the two of us. This is not how this moment is supposed to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty,\u201d she repeats loud enough for the entire gym to hear. The evil sparkle in her eye informs me that she\u2019s enjoying the social lynching. \u201cIs that the best line you can come up with? Let\u2019s fast-forward this entire conversation so you can stop wasting my time.\u201d She holds up the palm of her hand and even though the word is gone, I still see my defeat: can\u2019t.</p><p>Tim Richardson imitates the whistle of a bomb dropping from the sky and uses his hands to create the explosion. \u201cCrash and burn, Ry. Good to hear that the new girl has some standards. When you\u2019re done playing with the ballplayer, Beth, you can come play with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Tim,\u201d I say in a low, clear warning. If Tim wants to cut me down\u2014fine, but he leaves Beth out of it. Girls will be treated with respect.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re trying to defend me.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed off that I\u2019m not falling at your feet in worship like the rest of this pathetic school.\u201d</p><p>More laughter from the crowd. Idiots. She also put them down.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep up,\u201d she whispers. \u201cStay the hell away from me.\u201d</p><p>Screw this. I can do anything.</p><p>Coach Knox blows his whistle and the entire class turns to face him. \u201cLast order of business for the day. We need one senior girl and one senior guy nominated for the homecoming court. We\u2019ll start with guys.\u201d</p><p>Several hands rise. I can\u2019t keep up? She\u2019s so wrong.</p><p>\u201cRaise your hand if you want Tim Richardson.\u201d Coach nods with each hand he counts.</p><p>I\u2019m the king at this school. I can win any dare, any time. Win any game. If she wants to play, we\u2019ll play. She doesn\u2019t want the world to know she\u2019s Scott Risk\u2019s niece. Skater Girl humiliated me and she\u2019s about to learn that turnabout is fair play.</p><p>\u201cNow for the girls,\u201d says Coach.</p><p>My hand rises in the air at the same time as everyone else\u2019s, but I\u2019m not giving anybody else the opportunity to supply another name.</p><p>\u201cBeth Risk.\u201d</p><p>Hands drop. All gazes flicker between me and Beth. Her feet fall off the seat, one right after another\u2014clomp, clomp. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say Risk?\u201d asks Tim. \u201cAs in Scott Risk? As in the baseball god who just moved back to our town?\u201d</p><p>A wave of whispers crashes among the students sitting on the bleachers, Beth\u2019s name the topic of each hushed conversation. Ignoring Tim, I face Beth. Her blue eyes blaze like twin flames from a blowtorch. Who\u2019s not keeping up now? \u201cI nominate you, Beth Risk, for homecoming court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I love winning. \u201cI can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI second it,\u201d says Gwen with a bright smile plastered on her face, and red flags rise. She\u2019s wanted the homecoming crown since she was three.</p><p>Beth jerks up and stamps her foot against the bleacher like a toddler throwing a fit. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Nominate yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d says Gwen, \u201cI was already nominated in first and second period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I.\u201d I waggle my eyebrows at Beth.</p> <p>\u201cWe could walk on the field together. Won\u2019t that be fun?\u201d</p><p>Beth stands completely still, mouth slightly slack, her hands held out to her sides with her fingers spread. I finally nailed the girl who\u2019s been nailing me for weeks.</p><p>Coach Knox claps his hands to get our attention. \u201cAll in favor of adding Beth to the football homecoming court raise their hands.\u201d</p><p>With every eye on Beth, the entire class raises their hands. Everyone except for Lacy. Her stare burns holes through me, but she keeps her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cAll opposed,\u201d says Coach Knox.</p> <p>\u201cMe,\u201d Beth yells. I smile. I love winning.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Coach Knox says in a bored voice. \u201cYou\u2019re on the homecoming court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you people?\u201d</p><p>Coach Knox points at her. \u201cTake a seat and watch your language.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings. Beth grabs her backpack and leans into my face. \u201cYou are so fucking dead.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p> <p>ARROGANT BOY\u2014he\u2019s going down. Blah. It\u2019s aggravating the way they worship him. Ryan this. Ryan that. Ryan\u2019s a god. Ryan\u2019s a goddamn moron. I\u2019ve met guys like him before. Hell, I screwed one. Rather, one screwed me over. I\u2019m not a stupid little girl anymore and I will no longer fall for things that look pretty.</p><p>Our Calculus teacher, with teased eighties hair, peers at us over her gigantic glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhen I call your name, come to the front and write out your work on the board.\u201d She scans the class. \u201cMorgan Adams, Sarah Janes, Gwen Gardner, and Beth Risk.\u201d</p><p>The back of my head hits the wall behind me. Damn. This is Scott\u2019s fault. The stupid guidance counselor told Scott I couldn\u2019t keep up in this class, but Scott insisted I be placed in the honors program. Scott explained to me later that night, over the tofu and green crap his wife insisted on calling dinner, that he was raising my expectations of myself.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s true,\u201d someone says from the front of class. \u201cYour last name is Risk.\u201d</p><p>Clank. Clank. The sound of the chains squeezing my lungs echoes in my head. Since Ryan\u2019s little performance in Gym, the entire school has whispered as I pass and this time it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m the school freak. No, they whisper for reasons way worse. Their envious, judging eyes survey me because they want to know me\u2014or rather, my uncle.</p><p>\u201cAre you related to Scott Risk?\u201d asks a girl with short brown hair.</p><p>Everyone in the class watches me. My hands start to sweat.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Risk?\u201d prods our teacher. I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s prodding me on: that I\u2019m the only one who hasn\u2019t come to the front or because I haven\u2019t answered the question. I stare at my empty notebook. Panic pushes my heart past my rib cage. What do I do?</p><p>My teacher\u2019s lips edge into a cheesy grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and satisfy the curiosity of your fellow classmates.\u201d On the first day of school, Scott met privately with my teachers to \u201censure I was in the best possible hands.\u201d The witch flirted with Scott until he gave her an autograph. She probably has his face tattooed on her ass.</p><p>Sweat forms along the hairline on my neck as the world sways. It\u2019s been too much: the changes. Losing Mom. Losing Isaiah. Losing my home. I\u2019ve tried. Really I have. I\u2019ve roamed the halls as the reclusive freak show.</p><p>This answer will change everything again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Whispers and comments rush through the class like wind from an oncoming thunderstorm. Our teacher becomes uncharacteristically cheery. \u201cI\u2019m sure Beth would love to answer your questions about her uncle outside of class. Now, Ms. Risk, would you please come and write out your solution to today\u2019s equation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say without thinking. No to both of her statements. I\u2019m not answering anyone\u2019s questions and I\u2019m not writing out a solution.</p><p>My reply silences the class.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look at my blank sheet again. There is no way in hell I\u2019m going to that dry-erase board and have the entire school witness the niece of the great Scott Risk fail because I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m not writing out my solution.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and my teacher\u2019s expression gives new meaning to the term wrathful. A couple more pounds of chains settle in my stomach. I\u2019ve gone and done it\u2014I\u2019ve broken Scott\u2019s rules in a very public fashion. How could I do this to Mom?</p><p>\u201cMs. Risk,\u201d she calls from her desk as the rest of the class files out. I go, knowing the level of shit I\u2019m in is too deep for her to allow an audience. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss a few rules.\u201d</p><p>She \u201cdiscusses\u201d for a long time, and when she finally lets me go, I race down the stairs.</p><p>Scott made it perfectly clear I was never to miss my bus. The idling buses greet me through the window when I reach the bottom floor. I have seconds before they leave.</p><p>A high-pitched whistle catches my attention.</p><p>Ryan leans against the last locker with a shit-eating smirk on his face. He lifts his right hand and shows me his palm. Written there is the word that makes me want to vomit: can.</p><p>The buses roll out of the lot. Ryan withdraws his hand, and strides out the door.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>DEEP, THROATY LAUGHTER fills the school\u2019s weight room when Chris rips off the Kick Me sign Logan planted on his back. The laughter grows when Chris wads the paper up, throws it at Logan, and flips him off.</p><p>\u201cAll right, girls.\u201d Coach bangs his hand against one of the lockers to gain our attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this week\u2019s study hall list.\u201d</p><p>The laughter switches to groaning. Coach is serious about our grades. Each week he pesters our teachers for a progress report and if he sees our grades slightly teeter, we end up in after-school tutoring. I wipe my hands on a towel and prepare to lie back to finish my reps. I\u2019m no Logan, but I keep my grades at a decent level.</p><p>\u201cAllen, Niles, and Jones.\u201d</p><p>Chris tilts his head back and moans. \u201cDamn science.\u201d</p><p>I snap the towel at him. \u201cHave fun.\u201d Nothing can lower this mood. I finally got the better of Beth. And it\u2019s about damn time. No one has bested me this long.</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Ryan.\u201d Without another glance, Chris leaves the room.</p><p>\u201cStone!\u201d calls Coach.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Coach stares at me oddly and hitches a thumb in the direction Chris just went. \u201cStudy hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d My grades are fine.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYour English teacher requested you.\u201d</p><p>Back talk will get me push-ups or laps, so I suck up any commentary and head out of the room and down the empty hallways. When I finally reach study hall, I\u2019m immediately greeted by Chris\u2019s chuckles. He leans back in his chair, ignoring the science book in front of him. \u201cMy life just got better.\u201d</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for the tutors and teachers in the room, I\u2019d tell him where to shove it.</p><p>\u201cOver here, Ryan.\u201d Mrs. Rowe waves at me as if I\u2019m across a stadium. Her hair has a green tint today. I acknowledge her with a movement of my chin and walk over to her desk.</p><p>I slide into the chair next to her. \u201cI passed the quiz and I\u2019ve turned in my papers.\u201d</p><p>Her hand flutters in the air. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not here because of your grades.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow as my muscles tighten.</p><p>\u201cThen why am I here?\u201d</p><p>She shuffles through a stack of papers, searching for something. Possibly her mind. \u201cYour coach said we could request you for any academic reason. It doesn\u2019t have to be a bad reason. Stop being so pessimistic.\u201d</p><p>Pessimistic? \u201cI\u2019m missing weight training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are,\u201d she says as she pulls my</p><p>George the zombie tale out of the stack. \u201cYou haven\u2019t turned in your paperwork for the writing competition. What you should be worried about is missing your opportunity at a college scholarship. If you win this competition, you\u2019ll receive money toward any Kentucky school of your choice. It\u2019s not a full scholarship, but it\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to college,\u201d I say plainly.</p><p>She freezes and stares at me as if I\u2019d announced her impending death. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I gesture at my shirt. Is this lady for real?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a ballplayer. I\u2019m going to play ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can play ball at college. Ryan....\u201d She falters, then places my story in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThis is the most magnificent piece of writing I\u2019ve seen from a high school student. Ever.</p><p>Have you considered that you\u2019re more than a ballplayer?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opens to respond, but absolutely nothing comes out and that shocks me into closing it. My mind\u2019s blank. I\u2019m a ballplayer. A damn good one. Isn\u2019t that enough?</p><p>\u201cDid you even read the information I gave you about the state competition? For three years I\u2019ve watched you obsess over winning. Aren\u2019t you interested in winning this too?\u201d</p><p>I say nothing as my face reddens. Mrs. Rowe just called me out and she has a right to.</p><p>I didn\u2019t read the paperwork. I haven\u2019t even considered the competition since the other night when she first told me I finaled.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling you enjoyed writing this. It\u2019s too good for you not to have.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right again. I did enjoy it. Finding those words, being in George\u2019s head...I stare down at the printed-out pages...it felt freeing. Just like when I step on the pitcher\u2019s mound before the game and the pressure begins. The moment when it\u2019s just me, a ball, and a mitt to throw into.</p><p>And he wondered what happened to the world around him. Did it also collapse into chaos? Had everything ceased to exist as it was, just like how his life spiraled into nothingness? Or had the rest of the world continued on like normal, because in the end his position within it never really mattered?</p><p>The words I wrote glare at me in accusation.</p><p>A nagging ache pulls at my insides. I\u2019m proud of those words and denying the competition is like denying part of me. In front of my computer, there were no secrets, no complications\u2014just a world that I could control.</p><p>\u201cIn order to be considered for the award,\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Rowe continues, \u201cyou need to complete a short story and turn it in a week prior to the event. Your attendance is still required that day, however, as that\u2019s when you\u2019ll get critiques of your work and meet with faculty members from universities across the state. It\u2019s one day. Just one Saturday.\u201d</p><p>I hear my dad in my head. \u201cI have games Saturdays.\u201d And I glance over at Chris, who\u2019s eyeing me warily. How much of this conversation can he hear? \u201cMy team\u2019s depending on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pats the pages resting in front of me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start off small, okay?

She drives fast on the backcountry roads and a couple of times my stomach drops like we\u2019re on a roller coaster.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like smoke.\u201d Allison wears a red business suit and black stilettos.

I hoped it would help me get over the fight I had with Ryan. I don\u2019t know why, but yelling at him made me feel like crap. Kind of like I do after I fight with Isaiah. \u201cMust be in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell like smoke when you come home from school. Scott may choose to ignore it, but he\u2019s not ignoring your little stunt in class.\u201d Allison pulls into the massive driveway surrounded by woods and notices when I glance at her. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Your teacher called.\u201d</p><p>Crap. I don\u2019t have any idea how to get myself out of this.</p><p>Scott and Allison live in a two-story white house with a wraparound porch. It resembles something you\u2019d see in a Civil War movie full of rich plantation owners. Part of the house is surrounded by woods. The other part faces an open pasture with a barn.</p><p>Allison parks the car outside the four-car garage and grabs my wrist before I have a chance to bolt. \u201cDo you have any idea how embarrassed I was to leave the meeting because you called? This is a small town. Your teachers belong to our church. How long do you think it will be before everyone knows what a menace you are? I won\u2019t permit you to ruin our life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off of me.\u201d My eyes flicker from her fingers on my wrist to her eyes.</p> <p>No one touches me.</p><p>She drops my wrist like she was handling fire. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave? Even Scott knows you\u2019re miserable.\u201d</p><p>I bet Scott knows she\u2019s miserable too. I\u2019d never have imagined him with someone like her. Manicured. Polished. Heartless. \u201cWere you surprised he wasn\u2019t hard to trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2014\u201d I do the mock quotation marks in the air \u201c\u2014\u2018told\u2019 him you were pregnant, were you surprised how quickly he proposed? Scott always had a soft spot for babies. Why else would he marry you?\u201d</p><p>Blood flushes her collarbone and her hands flutter up to her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even asking me.\u201d She clears her throat, obviously flustered. \u201cScott doesn\u2019t have a soft spot for babies.\u201d</p><p>Has she had a conversation with the man she married? \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my mom, he would have married half of the girls knocked up in our trailer park.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t even the daddy.</p><p>Her hands slowly lower to her lap and I swear she quits breathing. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twist into a snarl. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d I open the door to her car, slam it shut, and repeat the process with the front door of Scott\u2019s house. Before I can even reach the guest bedroom Scott declared as mine, Allison stalks in behind me, slamming the front door with as much, if not more, force than I did.</p><p>Scott opens the door to his office\u2014the room across the foyer from my bedroom. He wears his crisp button-down shirt. Shit. He came home early from his \u201csales job\u201d at the bat factory in Louisville. His eyebrows scrunch together. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Allison points at me. \u201cGet rid of her.\u201d</p><p>Scott places his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cAllison...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knocked up girls in trailer parks?\u201d</p><p>In my defense, that isn\u2019t what I said, but even I know when to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>Scott\u2019s face turns red, then purple. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Allison clutches the hair on her head and the perfect bun loosens. \u201cForget the trailer parks. I can\u2019t believe you told her. You promised you would never tell anyone.\u201d One hand descends to her abdomen.</p><p>Damn. I was right\u2014sort of. She did tell him she was pregnant, except she wasn\u2019t lying like I\u2019d assumed. She was pregnant, and then she lost it. If I\u2019d known, I never would have said those things. Guilt makes me nauseous.</p><p>\u201cWait. I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d Scott reaches out to Allison and his hand freezes in the air when she steps back. He extends his hand again and when she remains still he wraps his arms around her, pulling her close to him. Scott lowers his head to her ear and I can tell he\u2019s whispering to her. Allison\u2019s shoulders shake and I feel like a Peeping Tom intruding on this intimate moment.</p><p>I slip inside the bedroom and try to close the door without making a sound. Sun shines from the two walls of windows. Crawling onto the middle of the bed, I draw my knees up and curl into myself. I hate this house. There are too many windows. All floor-to-ceiling. All open.</p><p>All of them make me feel...exposed.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>IN THE GARAGE, I stand outside Dad\u2019s office and prepare myself for the impending conversation. The enrollment papers for the writing competition are rolled tightly in my left hand. I rap twice on the door and Dad tells me to come in.</p><p>Except for the chair he sits in, Dad made everything in this room: the chrome desk and matching cabinet, the printer stand, the large art table that displays the stack of blueprints for his current clients. He shot the two deer mounted on the wall. The central air kicks on and a couple of papers near the vent on the floor crinkle against each other.</p><p>Dad keeps the office neat, tidy, and controlled. His eyes flick to me then back to the bound manual on his desk. He\u2019s disposed of his tie, but he still wears his white work shirt. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>I sit in the chair across from him and search for words. Before Mark left, I never had a hard time talking to Dad. The words came easily.</p><p>Now words are hard. I stare at the papers bound together in my hand. That\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Since Mark left, writing words has made life slightly tolerable. \u201cDo you remember last year\u2019s short-story assignment?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a blank look and scratches the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou were upset because it was due during spring playoffs,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>The lightbulb goes on as he nods and returns to the manual. \u201cDidn\u2019t you write about a pitcher that came back from the dead or something?\u201d</p><p>Actually it was a pitcher that sold his soul to the devil in return for a perfect season, but I\u2019m not here to argue.</p><p>\u201cDid your English teacher give you a hard time? Too much gore?\u201d</p><p>My mouth grows dry and I swallow. \u201cNo.</p><p>I...uh...finaled in a writing competition.\u201d</p><p>That caught his attention. \u201cYou entered a writing competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mrs. Rowe entered the entire class in the state writing competition. It was open to any high school student not graduating that spring. They read the entries this summer and I finaled.\u201d</p><p>He blinks and the smile is slow to appear, but it finally manages to form.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. Have you told your mom? She loves it when you do well in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, not yet. I wanted to tell you first.\u201d I would have told them together, but since Mark left, they can barely be in the same room.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell her.\u201d The smile slips and he glances away. \u201cIt\u2019ll make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I suck in air. I can do this. \u201cThere\u2019s another round of the competition in a couple of weeks in Lexington. I have to be there to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Mrs. Rowe be providing transportation or will the school let you drive yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on a Saturday so I can drive myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Saturday,\u201d Dad repeats. \u201cWas Mrs. Rowe upset when you told her you couldn\u2019t make it? If so, I\u2019ll talk to her. There\u2019s no reason why she should hold this against you. Maybe one of her other students can take your place.\u201d</p><p>He relaxes in his chair and folds his hands over his stomach. \u201cI saw Scott Risk at your game yesterday. He didn\u2019t stay long because of family obligations, but he saw you pitch and he was real impressed. He mentioned a camp the Yankees may be doing this fall. I know what you\u2019re going to say\u2014\u2018not the Yankees,\u2019 but once you\u2019ve proved yourself you can trade teams.\u201d</p><p>My mind swirls. Scott Risk watched me play. Which is great and odd. Great because Scott knows people\u2014specifically scouts. Odd because I\u2019d have bet Beth would crucify me to her uncle.</p><p>Not important. Or it is, but not now. I came in here to discuss the writing competition. A competition Dad never considered. \u201cI think I should compete. I can play the Thursday game and let one of the other two pitchers on the team play for me on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s forehead wrinkles. \u201cWhy would you want to do that? The teams worth playing are scheduled on Saturdays.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMrs. Rowe said that a lot of college recruiters will be at the competition and that a lot of the finalists win scholarships. I figure I can get some sort of an athletic scholarship and combine that with whatever scholarship I could win from this writing event, and that way you won\u2019t have to pay much.\u201d</p><p>Dad lifts his hand. \u201cWait. Hold on. College recruiters and scholarships? Since when do you care about that?\u201d</p><p>Until my conversation with Mrs. Rowe, never. \u201cYou and Mark visited colleges. We haven\u2019t discussed it, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to...\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s face flushes red and he spits the next words. \u201cHe was different. You can\u2019t go into the NFL straight out of high school. He had to go to college first. You can go straight to the minors out of school. Hell, Ryan. You can go straight to the majors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mark said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not say that name in my presence again.</p><p>You\u2019re not doing the competition. End of story.\u201d</p><p>No, it\u2019s not the end of the story. \u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>Dad picks up an envelope off his desk and tosses it at me. \u201cA two-hundred-dollar-a-month car payment so you can make practices and games.\u201d</p><p>The envelope lands on my lap and my throat tightens.</p><p>\u201cYour insurance on the car, the booster fees, the uniforms, the travel costs, the league fees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d I want him to stop, but he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGas for the Jeep, the private coaching lessons...I have supported you for seventeen years!\u201d</p><p>The anger inside me snaps. \u201cI told you I\u2019d get a job!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your job!\u201d Dad pounds his fist against the desk, exactly how a judge ends all discussion in court. A stack of papers resting on the edge falls to the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence. We stare at each other. Unblinking.</p><p>Unmoving. A thick tension fills the air.</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes sweep over his desk and he inhales deeply. \u201cDo you want to waste four years of your life going to school when you could be out on that field playing baseball for money? Take a look at Scott Risk. He came from nothing and see what he\u2019s become?</p><p>You\u2019re not starting with nothing. You have a jump on opportunities he never had. Think of what you can make of your life.\u201d</p> <p>My fist tightens around the enrollment papers in my hand and they crackle. Is it fair? Is it fair of me, even if it\u2019s just for one game, to walk away from something that my parents have sacrificed and worked so hard for?</p><p>Besides, it\u2019s baseball. Baseball is my life\u2014by my choice. Why are we even arguing?</p><p>\u201cRyan...\u201d Dad\u2019s voice breaks and he rubs his hand over his face. \u201cRyan...I\u2019m sorry. For yelling.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThings at work...things with your mom...\u201d</p><p>My Dad and I\u2014we\u2019ve never fought.</p><p>Strange, I guess. I know plenty of guys who go rounds with their fathers. Not me. Dad\u2019s never given me a curfew. He believes I\u2019m responsible enough to decide what trouble I want to get in and says if I go too far, I\u2019m smart enough to dig myself out. He\u2019s encouraged me every step of the way with baseball. More than most parents ever would.</p> <p>Dad watches out for me and this... this is him looking out for me again.</p><p>I nod several times before speaking, agreeing to something, but I don\u2019t know what.</p><p>Anything to make this confusion stop. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s okay. This was on me.\u201d I crumple the papers in my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right. This...\u201d I lift the wadded paper. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Stupid, even.\u201d</p><p>Dad forces a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Go in and tell your mom. She\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>I stand to leave and try to ignore the emptiness in my chest.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d says Dad. At the door, I turn to face him.</p> <p>\u201cDo me a favor\u2014don\u2019t tell your mom about the last round of competition. She\u2019s been on edge lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d What would be the point of telling her? Mom has a way of knowing when I\u2019m untruthful, and I\u2019m not eager to discover that the words I just uttered to Dad are a lie.</p><p>Beth</p><p>THE CLOCK READS NINE FORTY-FIVE and Isaiah gets off work at ten. My finger, paused against the speed dial button, goes numb. The sun set a while ago, leaving the room dark. I haven\u2019t moved from my spot on the bed. Scott hasn\u2019t come in. Neither has Allison. Not to lecture me on school or to scold me for yelling at Allison or to call me to dinner.</p><p>I\u2019ve dry heaved twice. Scott\u2019s going to send Mom to jail. He probably already called the police. The ironic part of this whole nightmare? I tried. I tried and I failed. Imagine that.</p><p>At ten, I\u2019ll call Isaiah and tell him to come and get me. We\u2019ll go to the beach. We\u2019ll run away. Too bad I can\u2019t convince Mom to go with us. Isaiah and I could get her before the cops do.</p><p>I raise my head and a wave of hope floods my body, making me dizzy. I could convince Mom to go. We could go away\u2014 together.</p><p>Someone knocks on the door. I slip the phone under the covers. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>Scott enters the room and turns on the light.</p><p>He wears a black T-shirt and a pair of blue jeans. For the first time, I see a hint of the kid that took care of me when I was younger and, foolishly, my heart responds. I move off the bed. I have to tell him I\u2019m sorry. \u201cScott...\u201d</p><p>Focusing on the carpet, he cuts me off. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to hear you bitch. If you ever talk to Allison like that again, I\u2019ll make sure you regret it. She\u2019s my wife and I love her.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but Scott doesn\u2019t look at me to see it.</p><p>He pulls his wallet out and slaps a card onto the dresser. The name and number belong to Mom\u2019s probation officer. \u201cI talked to him this evening. Nice guy. Did you know your mom will serve a ten-year sentence if she screws up probation? Ten years. That\u2019s not even counting what they\u2019ll charge her with when I tell them what I know. Your choice, Elisabeth. Either way you\u2019re living here until you turn eighteen. Your actions decide if your mom goes to jail.\u201d</p><p>The relief sweeping through my body makes me weak. He hasn\u2019t sent my mom to jail. Not yet. I still can make this work. The possibilities have my mind racing. I\u2019ll have to find a way into Louisville, to convince Mom to leave with me, and then get Isaiah on board....</p><p>\u201cLast chance.\u201d Scott breaks into my thoughts. \u201cI want perfection this time.\u201d</p><p>He smacks his hand against the dresser and the last cigarette I bummed rolls out of a folder and onto the floor. Shit.</p><p>Scott crouches and stares at the cigarette before picking it up. He acts like it\u2019s a joint instead of tobacco. Crap. It might as well be a needle full of heroin. \u201cI can explain.\u201d Actually, I can\u2019t. But I heard Noah use that phrase with Echo once and it bought him time.</p><p>As he stands, his hand shakes. Dad\u2019s hands used to shake. \u201cThis is bullshit. I bring you to my home.\u201d He falters and I can see him trying to rein in the anger. It scares me that he won\u2019t look at me. \u201cI give you a home and you don\u2019t even have the decency to try to follow my rules.\u201d</p><p>Quiet anger frightens me. The drunks, the idiots, the ones that rage easily\u2014them I can handle. I know when to step out of their way.</p><p>It\u2019s the ones that hold the anger in, the men that think about what they do and how they do it, that scare me. They\u2019re the ones that cause damage. A small voice, a voice that sounds a lot like me when I was a child, sweetly murmurs that Scott would never hurt me. That he was our protector. Once. I don\u2019t know this man.</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Scott yells so loudly that the crystals on the lampshade tinkle. I flinch and step back. \u201cYou\u2019ve done everything you can to make Allison and me miserable.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. Mom\u2019s boyfriend, Trent, started this way. He walked into the apartment all calm and cool, with anger seething underneath.</p><p>Then he yelled. Then he hit.</p><p>Dad had this anger too. So did Grandpa. My heart beats wildly in my chest as Scott crushes the cigarette in his hand. For the first time, he looks at me. \u201cJesus, you\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>He moves toward me and I take a retreating step. My back hits the window and my hands fly out, searching for something\u2014anything\u2014to protect myself with. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>The anger\u2014it\u2019s gone, calls the little girl in my head, but I ignore her. She died along with my love of ribbons and dresses and life. She\u2019s nothing but a ghost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says slowly and places space between us. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I scared you. I was mad. Allison was upset. I hate to see her cry and your teacher called...but I\u2019m calm. I swear.\u201d</p><p>I tried. Really, I did. I tried and this is where it got me. Trapped in a room full of windows with a man who resembles my father. Dad also used to say he was calm, but he never was.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElisabeth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d My hands wave air in front of me, motioning for him to leave. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2019s eyes grow abnormally wide. \u201cI am not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault!\u201d I yell and I want to stop, but if I stop I\u2019ll cry. A strange wetness burns my eyes. My lip is so heavy it trembles. I can\u2019t cry. I won\u2019t cry. Embracing the anger, I open my mouth again. Damn him if he makes me cry. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that dragged me here. Is it not enough to take me away from home? You have to humiliate me at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumiliate you? Elisabeth, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not Elisabeth! Look at me!\u201d I grab at the clothes on my body with one hand and yank my Calculus book off the bedside table with the other and fling the book straight at his head. He ducks and the book makes a loud thud when it smacks the wall. \u201cYou want me to be somebody else. You don\u2019t want me to be me. You\u2019re just like Dad! You want me gone!\u201d</p><p>My chest is heaving and I gasp for air. The silence that falls between us is heavy and I\u2019m drowning under its weight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Scott pauses as if he\u2019s waiting for a reply. He picks up the textbook and sets it on the dresser. Right beside Mom\u2019s parole officer\u2019s card. \u201cGet some sleep. We\u2019ll talk in the morning.\u201d</p><p>No, we won\u2019t. He leaves for work before I wake for school. Scott gently closes the door. I race across the room, lock it, turn off the lights, then toss the covers off the bed, searching for the phone. My fingers shake as I press the numbers. My pulse beats in my ears in time to the name of the person I need: Isaiah. A heartbeat. Isaiah. The phone rings. Isaiah.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d At the sound of his easygoing voice I lean against the closet door. \u201cYou had me worried. It\u2019s five after ten. You\u2019re late for our one-minute talk.\u201d</p><p>Hoping my lip will quit trembling, I close my eyes and will the tears to stay away. It\u2019s all in vain. If I speak, I\u2019ll cry and I don\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d Worry creeps into his tone.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I whisper back and that one word is almost my undoing. Isaiah and I\u2014we don\u2019t do phone conversations. Never have. We watched TV. We partied. We sat next to each other\u2014existed. How do you just be on a phone? And that\u2019s what I need. I need Isaiah to just exist.</p><p>\u201cBeth...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cIs that Ryan guy messing with you again?\u201d</p><p>I swallow a possible sob. I won\u2019t cry. I won\u2019t. \u201cSort of.\u201d And Allison and my uncle and school and everything and I feel like the walls are caving in, an avalanche preparing to bury me.</p><p>Silence from Isaiah.</p><p>I bite my lip when one tear rolls down my face. \u201cDo you want me to let you go?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Just dammit\u2014I don\u2019t cry. \u201cBecause I know you don\u2019t talk. I mean us. We. We don\u2019t talk.\u201d I swear under my breath. My voice shook. He\u2019ll know I\u2019m upset. He\u2019ll know.</p><p>Silence again. Air crackling on the line.</p><p>When he lets me go, I\u2019ll fall apart. I\u2019ll have nothing to hold on to. Nothing to anchor me.</p><p>I\u2019ll be exactly what everyone wants me to be\u2014nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with silence, Beth.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still here in this house in the room with too many windows. I\u2019m still exposed\u2014raw\u2014and living in hell. But I have Isaiah and he\u2019s anchoring me. I slide down the wall until I can curl into a tight ball on the floor. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d And we sit in silence.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>SITTING ON MY BED, I read the text message.</p><p>First the fight with Dad, then, at ten at night, Gwen sends me this: Beth Risk???</p><p>She waits on the other end for my reply. At least when I play baseball, I can catch the balls beings thrown at me. Dad and Gwen? I\u2019m getting the hell pounded out of me.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t answer Gwen. I should pretend I never read the message. She loves drama. I love baseball. She hated my games and I hated hers. We stopped kissing and touching and dating, yet somehow, like that night at the dugout, we\u2019ve never stopped the games. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I text back: what about her?</p><p>The wait for her answer stretches into eternity. I glance away from the phone as if that will make her respond faster. This summer, after Mark left, Mom repainted my room blue.</p><p>She loves to redecorate as much as Dad loves to build. They used to work together on projects, but that was before our world fell apart.</p><p>Gwen: you tell me I hate texting. You never know what the person is really trying to say. I take a risk. One that will make me an idiot and her dangling monkey if she ignores my request.</p> <p>Me: call me</p><p>My heart picks up a few beats. Will she do it or will she leave me hanging? Since our breakup, when we play the text game, I call her.</p><p>My cell rings and I smile. On the third ring, I answer. \u201cGwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStone,\u201d she says without much emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d It\u2019s an awkward dance.</p> <p>One I despise. We used to spend hours on the phone talking and now we overanalyze every word and pause.</p><p>\u201cYou knew who she was the entire time.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a hint of accusation in her voice.</p><p>I work at staying nonchalant. \u201cAnd if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the posters of my favorite teams.</p> <p>Why would I have told her that Beth is Scott Risk\u2019s niece? They share classes together.</p><p>They went to the same elementary school. She could have talked to Beth herself.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you nominate her?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hear ruffling. The sound is Gwen lying back onto her pillows. She has five of them on her bed and she sleeps with every last one. I can picture her golden hair fanning out.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much homecoming queen means to me,\u201d she says.</p><p>I do. I used to listen as she rattled on about her dream of winning that sparkly tiara.</p><p>Actually, I faked interest, then pretended to listen. \u201cYou seconded the nomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d look like a sore loser if I didn\u2019t, and now I have to scramble for votes.</p> <p>This would have been a lot easier if you told me sooner she was Scott Risk\u2019s niece. Really, Ryan, I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care? No one knows her and she doesn\u2019t want friends.\u201d</p><p>Her frustrated sigh sets my muscles on edge.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an instant celebrity and for some insane reason certain people think she\u2019s cool. You nominated her and everyone at school knows you\u2019ve asked her out, so you give her credibility. If you had told me who she was from the beginning, I could have done some damage control. Befriended her or something. Because of you, she has a shot at winning.\u201d</p><p>We broke up and I shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. I go with the old standby answer:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for ruining your life, Gwen. The next time I do anything I\u2019ll be sure to get your permission.\u201d</p><p>Gwen blurts out, \u201cShe\u2019s not your type.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s a little, I don\u2019t know, freakish. I mean, she is kind of pretty if you like the weird my-life-is-a-dark-room sort of pretty. I guess I\u2019m saying you won\u2019t be able to give her the attention she needs. You know, because of baseball. I guess I\u2019m just saying... not her.\u201d</p><p>Not her. Anger strangles my gut. And we\u2019re back to the conversation from the dugout\u2014</p><p>baseball ruined our relationship. \u201cWe broke up and now you\u2019re with Mike.\u201d</p><p>I can hear Gwen\u2019s smile. \u201cBut you promised we\u2019d be friends. I\u2019m being a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Friends. I hate that word. \u201cYou\u2019re right.</p><p>Beth is pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a nose ring.\u201d Gwen\u2019s lost the smiling voice.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sexy.\u201d I do.</p><p>\u201cI heard she smokes cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to quit.\u201d Yeah, I made that up.</p><p>\u201cI heard she has a tattoo on the small of her back.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten that far, but I\u2019ll let you know if I do since we\u2019re friends and all.\u201d</p><p>An image plays in my mind of lifting the back of Beth\u2019s shirt to reveal her skin, my caress causing her to smile. I bet her skin is smooth, like petals. My fingers fidget with the desire to touch Beth and my blood warms with the idea of her whispering my name. Damn.</p><p>The girl really does turn me on. I run a hand over my head, trying to rid my mind of the thought. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cRyan. I\u2019m not kidding. She\u2019s not your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me who is.\u201d I say it with more anger than intended, but I\u2019m tired of the game.</p><p>\u201cNot her, okay?\u201d Gwen pleads.</p><p>The image of touching Beth taunts and confuses me. Three quick raps on my door and Mom enters. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201c`Night,\u201d Gwen says with disappointment.</p><p>Mom wears a matching blue blazer and skirt. She attended a women-only dinner with the mayor\u2019s wife this evening. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I toss my phone onto the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cYou sounded a little upset.\u201d Mom walks over to my dresser, appraises her reflection in the mirror, then readjusts her pearl necklace. \u201cI could hear you in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cJust Gwen.\u201d</p><p>Her hands freeze on her necklace and a smile curves her lips. \u201cAre you together again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mom loved Gwen and I think the breakup was hardest on her.</p><p>She continues her grooming. \u201cYou should consider it. I heard that both you and Gwen were nominated for homecoming court.\u201d</p><p>News travels at lightning speed in our town.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, your father and I were nominated for homecoming courts. Both fall and winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She mentioned it. A million times.</p><p>They won both times too. If her continued retelling of the events didn\u2019t refresh my memory, the pictures hanging in the family room of them dancing with crowns on is a good reminder.</p><p>\u201cI also heard that Scott Risk\u2019s niece was nominated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d If Mom knows everything, then why is she bothering me?</p><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts on the niece? Her aunt, Allison Risk, has asked to be nominated for the empty seat on the church event committee.\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s my answer. Respectability. If Beth is an outcast, then Beth\u2019s guardians will be considered bad parents. Mom wants the prestige of nominating Scott Risk\u2019s wife, but she doesn\u2019t want the scandal of nominating the guardian of the \u201cbad girl.\u201d Both Mom and Dad\u2019s families have been members of this community since the first foundations of home and church were laid hundreds of years ago.</p><p>The Stones are a legacy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>Mom turns. \u201cInteresting. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. It means that Beth\u2019s in the way of my winning a dare. It means she tries my patience. It means I want to see her tattoo.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Mom rubs her forehead in frustration. \u201cFine.</p><p>She\u2019s interesting. If you discover another word, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>Yep, I do. If in public, she\u2019ll be right next to Dad. In private, the exact opposite of where Dad will be. Mom pauses at the door frame.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ryan, I talked to Mrs. Rowe this evening.\u201d</p><p>I dip my head and briefly close my eyes. Not good. Not good at all. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s curious as to when you\u2019ll be turning in your paperwork for the final writing competition in Lexington.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I raise my head, but my shoulders stay slumped as I look at Mom. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it. It interferes with ball.\u201d</p><p>Mom stiffens. \u201cWas that your father\u2019s decision or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d The word comes out fast. The last thing I want is for them to get into another twelve-round fight, especially over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was.\u201d Mom gives a dismissive wave.</p><p>Something inside me snaps. \u201cLogan saw Mark in Lexington a few weeks ago. He asked about us.\u201d</p><p>Mom becomes uncharacteristically still.</p><p>\u201cLogan knows, Mom. So does Chris.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashes over her face. \u201cIf your father finds out you told anyone...If anyone in town finds out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes for a second as she releases air. \u201cPlease remember what happens in this house stays in this house. Chris and Logan are your friends. They are not family.\u201d</p><p>A simmering anger settles at the bottom of my stomach. How can she shut out her emotions for her oldest son? \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her immediate answer catches me off guard. \u201cBut there\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Mom scans my room. Her eyes linger on my posters. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to redo your room.</p><p>Blue isn\u2019t your color.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. My eyes flash open and my heart pumps in my ears. The cops. No, the boyfriend. Sometimes he knocks in the morning to confuse me into opening the door. I blink when I see the shadow of curtains against a window. Curtains. I\u2019m not home. I inhale and the fresh oxygen mixes with the adrenaline in my bloodstream. Old habits die hard.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d Scott says from behind the door. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Six in the morning. Why can\u2019t he leave me alone? The bus doesn\u2019t arrive until seven-thirty. A half hour is plenty of time to get ready for school. I roll out of bed and pad on bare feet to the door. The bright light from the foyer hurts my eyes so I squint and barely comprehend that Scott\u2019s shoving a bag into my hand. \u201cHere. I got your stuff.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the sleep from my eyes. Scott wears the same T-shirt and jeans from last night. \u201cWhat stuff?\u201d</p><p>He drops his I-mean-business glare and my lips tug up. It\u2019s a look he gave me when I was little, especially when I wouldn\u2019t eat my vegetables or when I begged him to read to me.</p><p>Scott\u2019s answering smile is hesitant. \u201cI went by your aunt\u2019s and picked up your clothes.</p><p>That Noah guy was there last night and he showed me what was yours. I\u2019m sorry if I left anything behind. If you tell me something specific maybe I can swing by one day after work.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the bag. My stuff. He got me my stuff and he talked to... \u201cHow\u2019s Noah?\u201d</p><p>The hesitant joy on his face fades. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a heart-to-heart. Elisabeth, this doesn\u2019t change any of my rules. I want you to settle here in Groveton and let your old life go. Trust me on this one, okay, kid?\u201d</p><p>Okay, kid. It\u2019s what he always said to me, and I find myself nodding without realizing it.</p><p>A habit from childhood\u2014a time when I believed that Scott hung the moon and commanded the sun. A bad habit for a teenager.</p><p>I stop nodding. \u201cI can wear my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkin has to be covered and no rips in indecent places. Push me on this and I\u2019ll burn every stitch in that bag.\u201d Scott inclines his head toward the kitchen. \u201cBreakfast in thirty.\u201d</p><p>I cradle the bag in my hands like a newborn.</p><p>My stuff. Mine. \u201cThanks.\u201d The gratitude is stiff and awkward, but give me credit\u2014I said it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I SLIDE THE LOW-RISE, faded blue jeans to my hips and a contented sigh escapes my lips.</p><p>How I missed you, old friend. Jeans that hug a little too tight. Small rips on the thighs. The other pair, the pair I really love that has rips right below my ass, Scott would soak in gasoline. I carefully fold them on a hanger and store them in the closet.</p><p>For the first time in two weeks, I feel like me. Black cotton tee that clings to my waist.</p><p>Silver hoop earrings in my ears. I change the hoop in my nose for a fake diamond stud. As I check myself out in the mirror, I revel in the lightness because I know the moment I step into that kitchen, I\u2019ll grow heavy again.</p> <p>Right at six-thirty, I enter the kitchen. The red breaking of dawn splatters across the sky.</p><p>Scott fries bacon at the stove and the smell makes my mouth water. Allison is perfectly absent.</p><p>I take a seat at the bar that has a glass of orange juice and a plate. I assume the other place setting is for him. In between the plates is a stack of buttered toast and sausage patties.</p><p>\u201cIs it turkey or tofu or whatever you try to pass off as food?\u201d</p><p>Everything in this house is healthy. I pick up the toast and smell it. Hmm. White bread and it smells like butter. I stick out my tongue and barely lick it to see if it is. Scott laughs.</p> <p>Embarrassed, I roll my tongue into my mouth and close my eyes in ecstasy. Mmm. Real butter.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not turkey. It\u2019s real. I\u2019m tired of watching you not eat.\u201d He places a plate of bacon and eggs between us as he sits. \u201cIf you\u2019d try Allison\u2019s cooking, you\u2019d see it\u2019s not half-bad.\u201d</p><p>I bite into the toast and talk between bites.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. Food shouldn\u2019t be half-bad. It should be all good.\u201d</p><p>Scott assesses my outfit before spooning some scrambled eggs onto his plate. \u201cI like the stud. When did you pierce your nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I turned fourteen.\u201d I help myself to bacon and sausage while staring at the eggs.</p> <p>Scott made great eggs when I was a kid. Too bad I told him I hate them.</p><p>\u201cYour mom wanted one. She talked about driving into Louisville to get one several times.\u201d Mom liked to talk to Scott while Scott raised me. She moved into Grandpa\u2019s trailer when Dad knocked her up and her mom kicked her out. Scott was twelve when I was born.</p><p>My heart sinks. Mom never told me she wanted a nose ring. She never even noticed when I pierced mine. Why it bothers me, I don\u2019t know. Mom doesn\u2019t tell me a lot of things. I tap my fork against the counter. Screw it. I\u2019m eating the eggs. Who knows when I\u2019ll get another decent meal. Scott flashes a smug smile when I fork eggs on my plate.</p><p>\u201cIs that a baseball thing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan has that same I-know-everything smirk when he thinks he\u2019s one-upped me.\u201d</p><p>Scott sips his orange juice. \u201cHave you and Ryan been hanging out at school?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Hanging out. Annoying the piss out of each other. Same thing. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, Elisabeth. It would do you good to make more friends like him.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s a good guy. Isaiah is the best, but Scott doesn\u2019t want to hear that. \u201cI go by Beth.\u201d</p><p>As if I hadn\u2019t said anything, he asks another question. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fail.\u201d</p><p>He stops eating and I shove food into my mouth. I\u2019m beginning to hate these silences.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I contemplate my answer while savoring a piece of bacon. On my last bite, I decide to go with the truth. \u201cYes. But I don\u2019t expect you to believe me.\u201d</p><p>He tosses his napkin onto his empty plate and stares at me with sincere blue eyes. We both have Grandma\u2019s eyes. Dad did too, except Dad\u2019s never looked kind. \u201cI\u2019m not smart. I can throw a ball, catch a ball, and hit a ball. It made me a rich man, but it\u2019s better to be smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad for me, I can\u2019t do any of that.</p><p>Smart included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2019s smart,\u201d he says and he holds up his hand when I roll my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s real smart. Has a master\u2019s in English. Let her help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates me.\u201d</p><p>Scott falls into one of his long silences again. \u201cLet me handle that. You focus on school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I glance at the clock: six forty-five. We managed to have a conversation without yelling for fifteen minutes. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be heading to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working from home today. We\u2019re going to do this every morning. I want you up at six and out here for breakfast by six-thirty.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019s going to cook, I\u2019m not going to argue.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Scott gathers his dishes and goes to the sink.</p><p>\u201cAbout last night.\u201d</p><p>And things were going so well.... \u201cLet\u2019s not discuss last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were shaking.\u201d</p><p>I stand, feeling suddenly fidgety. \u201cI should get my backpack together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas someone hurt you? Physically?\u201d</p><p>The dishes. The dishes should go in the dishwasher. I pick them up. \u201cI really need help with Calculus. I want to drop it.\u201d Why am I telling him this?</p><p>Scott takes the dishes from me and I don\u2019t like being empty-handed. He places them on the counter and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat happened after I left town? My dad was dead and buried. Did my brother take his place as residing bastard?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking again. It\u2019s either that or we\u2019re having an earthquake. My head jerks back when the reality of what I let happen smacks me head-on like a Mack truck. I\u2019m an idiot. He maneuvered expertly around my walls. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>I expect Scott to yell at me or reprimand me.</p><p>Instead, he chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re still as stubborn as you were at four. Go get your stuff ready for school. I\u2019ll drive you in today.\u201d</p><p>I hate him. \u201cI\u2019ll take the bus.\u201d</p><p>Scott turns his back to me and loads the dishwasher. \u201cI\u2019m making pancakes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cYes, you will. Allison\u2019s making goat cheese\u2013tofu casserole tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I PULL MY JEEP into the student lot and park behind Chris\u2019s car. He leans against the bumper while Lacy stands a good three feet away from him near the hood. She holds her books close to her chest and snubs me by angling her body toward the school when I shut off the engine. Not a good sign. I take a deep breath and ready myself. Lacy has a hell of a temper. My ears rang for two days after the last time I ticked her off.</p><p>Chris greets me when I open the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pissed at you, dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>Before I can reach her, Lacy wheels around.</p><p>\u201cA dare? You humiliated Beth in gym yesterday over a dare? I\u2019m trying to make friends with her and you and Chris and Logan have made her the target of a dare?\u201d</p><p>Dammit all to hell, Chris. \u201cYou sang like a little girl with her hand caught in the cookie jar, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, repentant. \u201cHer tactics are brutal. The Marines could employ her.\u201d</p><p>Lacy rushes between us, her hand waving in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t you laugh this off. You don\u2019t know Beth. You don\u2019t know what life was like for her. You don\u2019t know what type of friend she was to me. You are ruining everything!\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, shocked. Tears swim in her eyes. She\u2019s not just angry. She\u2019s upset. \u201cIt\u2019s only a dare, Lace. I asked her out. She has the choice to say yes or no. I\u2019m not hurting anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d She glances away. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d The girl I consider one of my best friends bolts into school.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go after her,\u201d Chris says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I want him to.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wrong about this. Don\u2019t worry though, I think she\u2019s PMS-ing.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Lacy is emotional at times, but a nagging in my gut tells me that she could be right.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>Chris and I both turn to see Beth. My heart stops. It\u2019s her. Skater Girl from Taco Bell.</p><p>Gone are the trendy clothes. Back is her own style. Skin-hugging black shirt, jeans with holes. All knee-dropping curves. She looks every bit as sexy as she did the first night I met her.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk for a second?\u201d Sweet and seductive, her voice purrs over my skin and I\u2019m absolutely hypnotized. The girl must be a magician.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I wait for Chris to remember that he needs to go after his own girl, but he\u2019s too busy admiring Beth\u2019s ass to notice that Beth and I want him to leave. I give the blatant reminder.</p><p>\u201cLacy needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Chris like he\u2019s waking from a dream. \u201cLacy. See you later, dawg. You too, Beth.\u201d</p><p>She drums her fingers against her thigh as a dismissal. Chris wanders into the building while I try to understand Beth\u2019s attitude switch.</p><p>Yesterday, the girl would have been the main suspect in my murder. This morning, she\u2019s hot and friendly. Talk about mood swings.</p><p>Guilt becomes a whisper in my brain. I humiliated her at school. Time to make amends. \u201cYesterday, in gym\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Beth cuts me off. \u201cI was thinking that you\u2019re right. I should make friends and I\u2019d really like you to be the one to help me.\u201d</p><p>Can.</p><p>I suppress the smile edging onto my face.</p><p>No need to rub it in. Why couldn\u2019t Lacy be here to see this? \u201cYou\u2019ll go with me to the party on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat type of catch?\u201d I should be focusing more on the word catch, but I can\u2019t when Beth nibbles on her bottom lip. I love those lips.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle is a little control-freakish and he\u2019ll want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>This day keeps getting better. I win the dare and I get to talk to my hero. Plus, I get to spend time with Beth. Maybe Lacy\u2019s right. Maybe there is more to her. \u201cSure. I can come by early on Friday.\u201d</p><p>Beth readjusts the pack hanging on her shoulder. \u201cActually, I was wondering if you could come over tonight and meet him. Maybe we could hang out after.\u201d</p><p>I love my life. The girl is asking me out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Damn. My mind becomes chaos as I remember my plans. \u201cWait. I would love to, but I have ball practice with the team and then pitch practice in Louisville tonight.\u201d</p><p>She lowers her head. \u201cOh. Okay, I guess. If you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t, but tonight\u2019s the only night Scott\u2019s going to be home.\u201d</p><p>I am not blowing off this change of heart. If she\u2019s anything like Lacy, she could have a total mood reversal in three minutes. \u201cI can come over after ball and meet your uncle and then you could ride with me into Louisville. We could go out to eat after practice. That is, if you\u2019re okay with sitting through an hour of me pitching.\u201d</p><p>She raises her head and flashes this glorious smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Mind? I can\u2019t think of anything I want more.</p><p>I just won the dare.</p><p>STANDING ON SCOTT RISK\u2019S front porch, I yank the bill of my baseball hat and wipe my hands on my athletic pants. This is it. I\u2019m about to walk into my hero\u2019s home. Two knocks and the door swings open. Staring back at me, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, is Scott Risk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood afternoon, Ryan.\u201d His eyebrows rise to give the impression he\u2019s surprised.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d I rub the back of my head when the tension starts to form in my neck. \u201cIs, uh, Beth here?\u201d</p><p>An easy grin spreads across his face. \u201cShe\u2019d better be, but I did just piss her off. It might not be a bad idea to check to see if she snuck out the window.\u201d</p><p>Having no idea what to say back, I shove my hands in my pockets. He laughs. \u201cElisabeth and I don\u2019t work well together on her homework. Come on in. She said you two made plans, but I have to admit I was wondering if she was messing with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she ready, Mr. Risk?\u201d Amazed and starstruck, I walk in. This place is huge.</p><p>\u201cCall me Scott,\u201d he says, then hollers, \u201cElisabeth!\u201d</p><p>Something hard smacks the door to our right. \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily and a knot forms between my shoulder blades. The pendulum swings on the mood spectrum. Guess we\u2019re back to crazy.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait to see what Friday night will bring.</p> <p>\u201cYou have company!\u201d</p><p>Silence. The door squeaks as it slowly opens.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ryan.\u201d Beth rests her hip against the door frame and my heart stutters. She changed from the T-shirt to a black tank top, exposing a hint of beautiful cleavage. \u201cSee. I told you he stares.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I do. And I did it right in front of Scott Risk.</p><p>Scott claps my back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. But try not to stare too hard in front of me. At some point I\u2019ll stop finding it amusing and might have to kick your ass. And Elisabeth? Fuck isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, clearly not caring what\u2019s allowed.</p> <p>\u201cGet yourself together,\u201d Scott says to Beth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Ryan for a bit, then you can go.\u201d</p><p>Beth glances at her clothes. \u201cI am together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see skin. Lots of it. Come back out when there is less skin.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and does this slow pivot. As she walks into her room her hips have this easy sway that makes me stare\u2014once again.</p><p>\u201cI received something yesterday that you\u2019ll appreciate.\u201d Scott crosses the foyer to the room opposite Beth\u2019s and motions for me to follow.</p><p>The moment I enter the large office I\u2019m in awe. Baseball. Everywhere. Jerseys in glass frames. Balls. Bats. Cards in display cases.</p><p>Scott pulls out a see-through box and hands it to me. My mouth gapes. \u201cBabe Ruth. You have a baseball signed by Babe Ruth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Scott flashes a smile, the kind I understand; this office is hallowed ground. The phone on his large mahogany desk rings. \u201cGive me a sec.\u201d</p><p>I start to head out when Scott stops me.</p><p>\u201cStay. This won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>I love this man. I could spend hours in this office drooling over his stuff. Speaking in correct grammar and a business voice, Scott chats on the phone. I hover over a bat signed by Nolan Ryan. This could be my office someday. Hell no. This will be me.</p><p>Across the room is a table of framed pictures. Scott and Pete Rose. Scott and Albert Pujols. The picture frames are angled slightly toward the center of the table. Each person in the frame more important than the last.</p><p>When I get to the middle, I see a wedding picture of Scott and his wife and my respect for the man grows. He values his family.</p><p>I frown when I spot the small 4x7 photograph. It\u2019s of a child and Scott. At least I think it\u2019s Scott. I pick it up. He\u2019s young and looks dorky wearing the old-school version of the Bullitt County High baseball uniform. He holds a girl. Barely out of toddler years. Maybe five. Entwined and pinned everywhere in her long blond hair are pink ribbons. The white fluffy dress makes her look like a princess. She has her arms squeezed tight around Scott\u2019s neck. Her smile is contagious and her eyes are the deep blue of an ocean, almost exactly like...</p><p>\u201cElisabeth loved ribbons,\u201d Scott says behind me. \u201cBought them for her every chance I could.\u201d</p><p>No way. \u201cThis is Beth?\u201d</p><p>He takes the frame from me and gently places it back as the very center picture on the table. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He says it with the heaviness of a man mourning. Hell, I guess he is grieving. Beth is a far cry from the happy child in that photo.</p><p>Scott\u2019s lighthearted tone returns. \u201cI picked Allison up from a dinner last night and ran into your mom. She said you finaled in a state writing competition.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicker away. Dad must love that everyone in town now knows. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad said you\u2019re bent on going pro out of school, but there are a lot of colleges that would die to have a pitcher with your potential.</p><p>Especially if you have academic talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I don\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what\u2019s going on with you and my niece?\u201d</p><p>I freeze. And that is what I call throwing a changeup. Scott loses his easygoing grin and I notice he shares Beth\u2019s eyes. He doesn\u2019t blink either. Time to man up. \u201cI asked her out.\u201d</p><p>Because of a dare. \u201cAnd she said yes. She said that you\u2019d want to meet me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking her tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my pitch-coaching lesson, then to wherever she chooses to eat. There\u2019s a...\u201d Taco Bell\u2014I should skip that one. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s and an Applebee\u2019s nearby.\u201d</p><p>Scott nods as if he\u2019s processing how to perform brain surgery. \u201cWhere are you taking her Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far. Actually, it\u2019ll border your property and my dad\u2019s. My best friend lives on the other side of you and we invite friends over to hang out.\u201d</p><p>Scott fights amusement and tenses at the same time. \u201cYou\u2019re taking my niece to a field party.\u201d</p><p>I swallow.</p><p>\u201cI grew up fifteen miles from Groveton,\u201d</p><p>says Scott. \u201cI know what a field party is, having attended more than a few myself.\u201d</p><p>Busted. \u201cI thought it would be a good opportunity for her to spend time with my friends.\u201d</p><p>Scott rubs his jawline. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I have to give him more. Lots more. \u201cI like Beth. She\u2019s pretty.\u201d Yeah, she is. \u201cShe\u2019s more than pretty. She\u2019s not like any girl I\u2019ve ever met before. Beth keeps me on the edge. With her, I have no idea what\u2019s coming next and I find that...\u201d Amazing. Thrilling. \u201cFun.\u201d</p><p>Scott says nothing back and I\u2019m glad. Until I said the words\u2014words I thought I was creating to impress him\u2014I had no idea they were true.</p><p>A sexy voice, one I know all too well, causes my stomach to levitate like I\u2019m at the top of a roller coaster, then plummet. Beth heard every word. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impolite to eavesdrop.\u201d Scott keeps his back to her and his eyes glued on me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say fucking kidding,\u201d she responds.</p><p>He inclines his head to the right as if to agree that was a major concession. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you picking her up on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her home by nine tonight. Midnight on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Scott turns to Beth. \u201cWhat are you going to do while he\u2019s practicing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>Scott dips his head in disbelief.</p><p>Beth sighs heavily. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do homework.</p><p>I\u2019ll become studious and add \u2018big fat dork\u2019 to my \u2018freak\u2019 label. It\u2019s what you want, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I dream about. Go on. Enjoy yourselves.\u201d He enters the foyer and Beth\u2019s lips twist into that evil smirk. What the hell did I walk myself into?</p><p>Beth</p><p>EVERY NOW AND THEN, FATE SMILES in my favor. Yes, I know, hard to believe, but today is one of those rare days. Last week, Lacy told me Ryan drove into Louisville for coaching lessons on Wednesdays, and yesterday she told me that the facility is located in the south side of Louisville, sweetly tucked away a half mile from my home.</p><p>Outside of a large metal warehouse, Ryan plucks a bag full of his baseball crap out of the back of his Jeep and I do my best to keep from fidgeting. My nerves make it difficult to stay still. I\u2019m so close to my mom that I can almost taste the cigarette. Be cool, Beth. This is a hand you have to play carefully. \u201cHow long is practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour. Maybe a little longer.\u201d Ryan slings his bag over his shoulder. I swear, this guy has the broadest shoulders of any high school kid I have ever met. He wears a tight Tshirt and my stomach performs tiny flips when his shirt rides up, exposing his abs.</p><p>I sigh and push the thoughts away. The characteristics of gorgeous and decent don\u2019t mix with wanting me. And while Ryan can be a jerk, he is...decent. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that what I\u2019m doing to him is wrong.</p><p>Wrong but necessary.</p><p>Besides, whatever is going on between us is a game of some sort. I just haven\u2019t guessed his angle yet. Not that it matters. By the end of the night, Ryan will hate me and so will Scott. I won\u2019t feel bad about Scott though. He\u2019s the one that dragged me into this mess and he\u2019ll be much happier without me. In an hour I will have reached Mom, contacted Isaiah, and we\u2019ll be out of town. The schedule is tight, but doable.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go to dinner?</p><p>There\u2019s an Applebee\u2019s close by and a T.G.I.</p><p>Friday\u2019s. Hopefully our dinner conversation will be a lot better than the silence on the way in.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWe can do fast food if you prefer. I know how you love tacos.\u201d</p><p>The first cool breeze of fall blows across the parking lot and goose bumps rise on my arms.</p><p>In an hour, I\u2019ll be heading to the beach.</p><p>\u201cI said tacos, Beth. Where\u2019s the \u2018eff you\u2019 that typically follows?\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him and blink. I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>I\u2019m actually going to run away.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyebrows furrow together and he comes closer to me, blocking the breeze, or maybe it\u2019s the heat radiating from his body warming me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d He\u2019s taller than me.</p><p>Gigantically. I\u2019m not going to see him again so I let myself notice Ryan as he really is. He\u2019s sexily hot with his broad shoulders, curved muscles, cute mess of sandy-blond hair kicking out behind his baseball cap and adorable warm brown eyes. I pretend for a second that the sincerity in them is real\u2014and for me.</p><p>The wind blows again, harder this time, and several strands of my hair move across my face. Ryan focuses on them. His fingers whisper against my cheek, then down the sensitive skin on my neck as he brushes the strands over my shoulder. His touch tickles and burns at the same time.</p><p>Heat races to my face and my hands immediately cover my cheeks. What the hell?</p><p>I\u2019m blushing. Guys don\u2019t make me blush. Guys don\u2019t want to make me blush. Confused by my reaction, I step away and reach into my back pocket to pull out a cigarette I bummed from stoner boy at school. \u201cGive me a few, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get bored in the waiting area and you want to watch, I\u2019ll ask Coach if you can...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ryan presses his lips together and heads toward the entrance. I sneak a peek at his retreating form and my heart drops. Whatever messed-up moment we just experienced doesn\u2019t change anything. Ryan goes for girls like Gwen and screws over girls like me. You can\u2019t change destinies already written. That only happens in fairy tales.</p><p>I do feel sorry for him. Scott\u2019s going to kill him by the end of the night. \u201cRyan?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder. What do I say?</p> <p>You\u2019ve been fun to mess with, but I have to save my mom. I\u2019m sorry that when you return to Groveton tonight without me, my uncle will rip off your balls and my aunt will serve them for dinner with a side of seaweed?</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The word tastes weird in my mouth.</p><p>He removes his baseball cap, runs his hand through his hair, and smashes it back into place. I look away to keep the guilt from killing me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>I blink, unsure what he\u2019s apologizing for, but I don\u2019t ask for an explanation. I said my piece.</p> <p>He said his. We\u2019re even.</p><p>A teenage boy leaves the building and holds the door open for Ryan. He goes in while the other boy jingles his car keys. Thank you, fate, for lending me a hand. I tuck the cigarette into my back pocket and smile in a way that makes the boy assume he has a chance. \u201cCan I bum a ride?\u201d</p><p>NERVES VIBRATE IN MY STOMACH and I keep taking deep breaths. No matter how many times I inhale, I still have a hard time filling my lungs with air. Please, God, this one time, please let the asshole be gone. And please, please, please let Isaiah agree to my crazy plan once I show up with my mom in tow.</p><p>I thought about telling him about my plan beforehand, but, in the end, I knew he wouldn\u2019t agree to Mom tagging along. He blames her for the problems in my life, but I know Isaiah. When I show up with her, begging to leave, he won\u2019t let me down. He\u2019ll take us\u2014both.</p><p>The Last Stop is empty, but give it another hour or two and the bar will be filled. Even in daylight, the place is as dark as a dungeon. In his typical jeans and flannel shirt, Denny sits at his bar and hovers over a laptop, giving his face a bluish glow. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots me. \u201cHeard your mom lost custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>He sips a longneck. \u201cSorry, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow has she been?\u201d My mouth dries out and it takes everything I have to act like his answer doesn\u2019t matter to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d</p><p>No. I don\u2019t. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>He closes the laptop. \u201cNothing. Go back to where you came from. Anywhere has to be better than here.\u201d</p><p>I go out the back. It\u2019s the fastest way to Mom\u2019s apartment. At night, the place is creepy in the shadows. During the day, the run-down apartment complex just looks sad and pathetic. Management spray-painted parts of the 1970s orange brick white to hide the graffiti. It\u2019s a useless effort. The elementary kids paint their swear words back on the next night.</p><p>Since most of the windows are broken, the residents use cardboard and gray tape to cover the glass, except for the windows with the roaring air-conditioning units that leak water like faucets. Mom and I never had one of those. We were never that rich or lucky.</p><p>Asshole Trent lives in the complex across the parking lot from Mom. The only thing sitting in his parking spot is the large pool of black oil that seeps from his car when it\u2019s parked. Good. I inhale again to still my internal shaking. Good.</p> <p>After Dad left, Mom moved us to Louisville and we officially became gypsies, moving into a new apartment every six to eight months.</p><p>Some were so bad we left voluntarily. Others kicked us out after Mom missed rent. The trailer in Groveton and my aunt Shirley\u2019s basement are the only stable homes I\u2019ve ever known. The apartment near Shirley\u2019s is the longest Mom has ever stayed in one place and it sucks that Trent is the reason why. I knock softly.</p><p>The door rattles as Mom unlocks the multiple dead bolts and, like I taught her to, she leaves the chain on when she opens the door an inch. Mom squints as if her eyes have never seen the sun. She\u2019s whiter than normal, and the blond hair on the back of her head stands upright as if she hasn\u2019t brushed it in days.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she barks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her eyes. \u201cElisabeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me in.\u201d And let\u2019s get you out.</p><p>Mom closes the door, the chain jiggles as she unlocks it, and the door flies open. In seconds, she wraps her arms around me. Her fingernails dig into my scalp. \u201cBaby? Oh, God, baby. I thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p><p>Her body shakes and I hear the familiar sniffling that accompanies her crying. I rest my head on her shoulder. She smells like a strange combination of vinegar, pot, and alcohol. Only the vinegar seems out of place. Part of me is thrilled to see her alive. The other part beyond annoyed. I hate that she\u2019s high. \u201cWhat did you take?\u201d</p><p>Mom pulls back and runs her fingers through my hair in very fast successive motions. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I note her red eyes and dilated pupils and tilt my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, just some pot.\u201d She smiles while a tear runs down her face. \u201cDo you want a bowl?</p><p>We have new neighbors and they\u2019re into sharing. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Snatching Mom\u2019s hand, I push past her and into the apartment. \u201cYou need to pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElisabeth! Don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The place is trashed. Not like normal trashed. This is beyond dirty dishes, mud-caked floors, and fast-food wrappers on the furniture. The cushions of the couch lie on the threadbare carpet, both ripped open. The coffee table could now be used as kindling. The insides of Mom\u2019s small television lie exposed near the three-foot kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke in.\u201d Mom shuts the door behind her, locking one of the dead bolts.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d I turn and face her. \u201cPeople who break in steal shit and you don\u2019t have shit to steal. And what the hell is that stench?\u201d</p><p>I dyed Easter eggs with Scott once and our trailer smelled like vinegar for days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleaning,\u201d Mom says. \u201cThe bathroom. I got sick in there earlier.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit me hard. Puking can mean an OD. My worst nightmare for my mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you take?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and nervously laughs.</p><p>\u201cI told you, pot. A little beer. I\u2019m barely buzzing.\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I hate it when she has to think for an answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I\u2019m taking those pills. It\u2019s good you found a way to have them sent to me in the mail.\u201d</p><p>Kneading my eyes with my palms, I gather my wits. None of this matters. \u201cGet your stuff together. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I haven\u2019t received an eviction notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gypsies, remember?\u201d I say, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cWe never stay still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elisabeth. You have the gypsy soul, not me.\u201d</p><p>Her statement stops me short and I wait for her to explain. Mom sways from side to side. Whatever. She\u2019s high and I don\u2019t have time for this. I step over the shredded coffee table. \u201cIsaiah offered to take me to the beach and you\u2019re coming with us. We\u2019ll lay low until I turn eighteen next summer and then we\u2019ll be home free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Trent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe beats you. You don\u2019t need that asshole!\u201d</p><p>I spot a couple of plastic shopping bags in the corner. Those will do. Mom owns few items worth packing.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth!\u201d Mom kicks the remains of the coffee table as she bolts after me. She grabs my arm. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop? Mom, we have to go. You know if</p><p>Trent comes back and finds me here...\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off and runs her fingers through my hair again. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Her eyes pool with tears and she sniffles again. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you,\u201d she repeats. \u201cI can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>My entire body bottoms out like a fast sobering from a high. \u201cYou have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I can\u2019t go now. Give me a few weeks. I got some business to take care of and then we\u2019ll leave together. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Business? \u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Now.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curl in my hair and tighten, yanking to the point of pain. She leans down and places her forehead to mine. The stench of beer rolls off her breath. \u201cI promise. I promise I\u2019ll go with you. Listen to me. I have to clean some stuff up. Give me a couple of weeks, then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>The doorknob wiggles and my heart kicks into high gear. He\u2019s back.</p><p>Mom grips my hand painfully. \u201cMy bedroom.\u201d She drags me through the apartment and loses her balance as she trips over the pieces of broken furniture. \u201cGo out the window.\u201d</p><p>Bile rises in my throat and I begin to shake.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not without you.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Mom here is like watching sand run out of an hourglass while I\u2019m chained to the wall, unable to flip it back over. Someday, Trent will go too far and it won\u2019t just be a bruise or a broken bone. He\u2019ll take the life out of her body. Time with Trent is an enemy.</p><p>\u201cSky!\u201d Trent shouts when he enters the apartment. \u201cI told you to keep the door unlocked.\u201d</p><p>Mom hugs me tightly. \u201cGo, baby,\u201d she whispers. \u201cCome and get me in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>She rips the cardboard off the glass and I jump back when a hand shoots through the already open window. \u201cGive her to me.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah pokes his head in and both of his hands latch onto my body. I stop breathing and realize one way or another, one of these guys is going to kill me.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I SNAP MY ARM FORWARD. With a thump, the ball hits outside the orange box taped onto the black tarp bag that serves as a target. My mind\u2019s not in it today and I need it to be.</p><p>Placing my pitches is the priority. If Logan calls inside\u2014I need to hit inside. If Logan calls outside\u2014I need to hit outside. If he calls straight down the plate\u2014I need to smack that mother too.</p><p>I keep thinking about Beth. She looked so damn small and lost that I wanted to gather her in my arms and shield her from the world.</p><p>Definitely not a reaction I ever thought I\u2019d have with Skater Girl. I slap my glove against my leg. I\u2019ll find out what\u2019s going on with her at dinner. Silence will no longer be accepted.</p><p>I roll my shoulder in an effort to find some life in it, but I come up empty. I\u2019ve pitched for the past hour and the muscles in my arm are as useful as jelly.</p><p>The training facility isn\u2019t much, just a warehouse with green turf carpeting and an air conditioner welded to the ceiling. The unit buzzes overhead and every few seconds a bat cracks.</p><p>My coach, John, pushes off the metal wall.</p><p>\u201cGood, but you\u2019re still throwing with your arm. Your power and consistency are going to come from your legs. How\u2019s the arm?\u201d</p><p>Tired. Beth must hate this place. A warehouse full of guys hitting balls into nets and pitching into bags. Part of me is disappointed. She hasn\u2019t stood once to watch.</p><p>\u201cI can throw a couple more if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been resting your arm like we\u2019ve discussed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Not as much as I should. I can pinpoint the exact location of my rotator cuff: approximately two inches down from the top of my shoulder and, right now, it aches.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a night.\u201d</p><p>I roll the ball over my fingers. Beth isn\u2019t the only issue that\u2019s plagued me this practice and no matter how I try to ignore the thoughts, they keep returning. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you had to choose between playing college ball and playing pro out of high school, what would you choose?\u201d</p><p>John scratches his cheek as he stares at me with a mix of wonder and confusion. \u201cDo you want to go to college?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. \u201cIf you had the choice, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have that choice. College ball was my only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have gone pro.\u201d</p><p>I slam the ball into my glove. Exactly.</p><p>Everyone with their college talk and writing competitions is screwing me up. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question isn\u2019t what I would have done.</p><p>The question is what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>Beth</p> <p>ISAIAH WRAPS HIS ARM TIGHTLY around my waist and heaves me out the window. Mom\u2019s hollow blue eyes have a haunting hurt as she stares at me one last time before slamming the glass pane shut and placing the cardboard back over the window.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I\u2019ve left her behind. Again.</p><p>His grip becomes steel and the more I try to scramble back to the window, back to Mom\u2019s apartment, the more he pulls me away. My heart\u2014it\u2019s literally breaking. It has to be, because the pain in my chest slices as if glass is ripping through it.</p><p>My legs tangle with Isaiah\u2019s. He keeps a firm hold on my hip bones and forces weightlessness by lifting me and moving me in the opposite direction of my mom. I struggle back to earth, kicking his shins, knocking my knees against his. \u201cIsaiah, Trent\u2019s in there. He\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d His growl rumbles against my ear.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d He couldn\u2019t have. Isaiah would never leave me to die, so he could never leave my mom. The one person I need.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He presses against me and my smaller body yields to his. No. My elbows bend back and with open palms I shove at his chest. My heart convulses with the smack of my hands against his body. I hit him\u2014my best friend.</p><p>I\u2019ll do it again if he doesn\u2019t let me go. \u201cI hate you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says. His nostrils flare as he lightly shakes my hips. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t feel bad when I toss you over my shoulder and throw you in the damned car.\u201d</p><p>My palms, still stinging from hitting him, rest on his chest. His heart beats wildly, matching the crazy glare in his eyes. Isaiah means what he says.</p><p>So do I. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the car before I force you into it.\u201d</p><p>His hands tighten. A warning. A threat. My chest constricts, making it impossible to breathe. Impossible to think. \u201cHe hits her.\u201d</p><p>I say it like it\u2019s a secret. Because it is. My secret. The secret I hide from everyone. The secret that leads to my worst secret: he hits me.</p><p>Isaiah knows this already, but it\u2019s different. I\u2019m saying it out loud. I\u2019m making it real. And I\u2019m asking him to save me. I\u2019m asking him to save her.</p><p>Isaiah presses his face unimaginably close to mine. \u201cHe will never touch you again.\u201d</p><p>My throat swells and my voice comes out small. \u201cI\u2019ll let him if it saves her.\u201d</p><p>A visible shiver runs through his body and his hands release my waist. Becoming a brick wall, Isaiah plants his feet on the ground and crosses his arms over his chest, practically daring me to move past him.</p><p>I step to the left. Isaiah steps with me. I step to the right. He mirrors the movement. \u201cThe car, Beth. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d He doesn\u2019t and I feel like a cat trapped in a box. I claw at his chest.</p><p>Push. Hit. Scream. Yell. Curse. Until my hands pound against him again and again and again.</p><p>Frustrated. Angry. Betrayed.</p><p>His arms weave through my attack, placing warm palms against my face. He strokes away the wetness on my cheeks. A wetness I don\u2019t understand. I smack his arms off me. \u201cIf you were my friend...if you cared, you\u2019d help me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Beth, I\u2019m doing this because I love you!\u201d</p><p>My heart beats once and stalls as the world becomes horrifyingly still. I see it, in his eyes\u2014the sincerity. I shake my head. \u201cAs a friend,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou love me as a friend.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. Our chests rising and falling rapidly. \u201cSay it, Isaiah. Tell me you love me as a friend.\u201d He\u2019s silent and my mind feels like it\u2019s on the verge of fracturing. \u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to deal with this. I don\u2019t have time for this. I step around him. \u201cI\u2019m getting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d he hisses as he bends. His shoulder makes contact with my waist and in seconds my head dangles over his back, my feet kicking him. I scream and watch through blurred vision as he creates more distance between me and Mom.</p><p>A car door clicks open. Isaiah slides my body from over his shoulder, covers my head, and uses his strength and size to push me into the backseat while keeping me from bolting out of it. The door slams shut and Isaiah has a death grip on my wrist. My head snaps to the left. The other door. It\u2019s locked. I pull at my wrist to gain freedom, to open the other door, but Isaiah retains his hold.</p><p>The car whips into reverse and the engine whines when it accelerates.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking, Beth?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. Noah leans against the passenger door, one hand on the wheel. He doesn\u2019t even wait for an answer. \u201cIsaiah said you\u2019d come back for your mom, but I thought maybe you\u2019d have enough sense to stay away.</p><p>Jesus, at least you\u2019re predictable. Did you think we wouldn\u2019t remember that you\u2019d check the damn bar before you checked out the apartment? Isaiah, remind me to pay Denny extra for calling us so damned fast.\u201d</p><p>Denny. Traitorous asshole. He told Noah and Isaiah I came for Mom.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get to Louisville?\u201d Isaiah asks in an eerily calm voice.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d He told me he loved me. A cold sweat breaks out on my skin and my body begins to tremble. My best friend told me he loved me. And my mom. He forced me to leave my mom.</p><p>\u201cDid you convince that Ryan bastard who\u2019s been messing with you to bring you?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Isaiah and he swears. I yank at his hold on my wrist. \u201cGet off of me.\u201d</p><p>Anger blazes from Isaiah\u2019s dark eyes and if the anger wasn\u2019t coming from him, it would frighten me. He has the calm anger. The controlled anger. The type that breaks if pressed too hard for too long. \u201cNot until I know you\u2019re done thinking like an idiot and doing stupid things. You could have gotten yourself killed. Trent\u2019s been bragging at the bar for weeks on how he\u2019ll tear you limb from limb if he sees you again. He blames you for the cops coming to his apartment the week after you went to Groveton. He forgets, though, that he has enemies everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I hear the snap inside my head and my entire body flinches. I\u2019ve talked to Isaiah every night and he never mentioned this piece of local gossip. Gossip that would have led me to act faster. If Trent blames me, then he\u2019ll blame Mom, and he already loves hitting her for no reason. Isaiah took me away from Mom and left her there with that asshole.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s hand still holds my wrist and I don\u2019t want a backstabbing Judas touching me.</p><p>Pulling my foot off the floorboard, I kick at him, again and again. \u201cLet. Go. Of. Me!\u201d</p><p>He releases my arm to shove my foot off him. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left her there to die!\u201d</p><p>Isaiah punches the back of Noah\u2019s chair and collapses into the seat. His head falls back and he places his thumb and forefinger over his closed eyes.</p><p>The flat and bitter notes of a Nine Inch Nails song play on the radio and I sink into my corner of the car, pulling my legs into my chest. My heart aches with the lyrics. It\u2019s a phrase embedded in my soul, a lyric that talks about people you love and how in the end...they go away.</p><p>Isaiah took me away from Mom; he won\u2019t help me save her....he told me that he loves me. What used to be my best, strongest relationship has become a leaf withering and dying on a decaying vine.</p><p>I guess everything in life really does end.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>TEN MINUTES AGO, I LEFT PRACTICE and found her gone. While I stood here losing my mind, deciding what to do, Beth was out having fun with her friends. I panicked, wondering if I should call Scott, the police, my dad. I imagined Scott\u2019s grief and thought about how angry my father would be when he learned I lost the niece of our town hero.</p><p>Mostly, I worried about Beth. Terrified someone took her. Praying she wasn\u2019t hurt or scared. Now I feel like a fool.</p><p>A few minutes ago, they pulled in and now Beth argues with the overrated tattooed punk I\u2019ve seen before. I don\u2019t dare move a muscle, because I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll rip every single black hair out of Beth\u2019s head. Planting myself firmly next to my Jeep, I watch as Beth and her punked-out friend continue their heated discussion.</p><p>Beth played me like I\u2019ve never been played before. I made a terrible mistake. I tried to like her. Screw Beth. Let her tank her life. She agreed to go to the party with me Friday. I won the dare. Deal done.</p><p>Beth bolts from the shitty car.</p><p>\u201cBeth!\u201d Tattoo Guy snags her by her belt loop. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>I flinch, but force myself to stay still. She wants this guy. She left me to be with him.</p><p>\u201cThen keep the promise you made to me, Isaiah. Take me. Tonight.\u201d Her eyes search him and the desperation clawing at her face makes watching the scene uncomfortable. Whatever answer she\u2019s looking for, he doesn\u2019t have. He turns his head away with his eyes cast down.</p><p>The other guy closes his door to the car and slowly approaches them, yet keeps his distance.</p><p>Great, I\u2019m back to the odds of two against one. That is, if I cared enough to step in.</p><p>Which I don\u2019t.</p><p>Isaiah glances at the other guy. \u201cYou always said you wanted a home and now you\u2019ve got one.\u201d</p><p>Beth blinks. \u201cNot this home.\u201d</p><p>I straighten. The attitude that makes her larger than life evaporates. She\u2019s small. Very small. Especially when standing in front of two menacing guys. Not only does she appear small, but she seems very...lost.</p><p>\u201cWait until you graduate. Just a couple more months. Noah and I talked and...\u201d</p><p>With the name Noah, Beth\u2019s head jerks and anger blazes from her blue eyes. \u201cYou promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d The other guy, who I\u2019m guessing must be Noah, uses a calm tone that even I know will send her over the edge. \u201cYou belong in Groveton.\u201d</p><p>In a flash of black, Beth races over to Noah.</p><p>Her hand darts out, and she strikes him across the face. The sound echoes against the walls of the warehouse. Beth\u2019s chest heaves as she gasps for air. \u201cFuck you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I push off the Jeep. What the hell? Noah gingerly touches his cheek, then inclines his head as if to release tension. \u201cI was starting to feel left out after your little show back at the apartment complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault!\u201d she screams. \u201cYou and Echo and your new life. You turned Isaiah against me because you\u2019re too scared to be real. You want to be fake. Just like your girl.\u201d</p><p>Tattoo Guy\u2014Isaiah\u2014places his hand on Beth\u2019s arm and yanks her away from Noah.</p><p>Hell no. Punk or no punk, a girl is in serious trouble if she hits a guy and a guy should never touch a girl. My fingers tighten into a ball as I stalk over. \u201cGet away from her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGroveton,\u201d Isaiah says as he ignores me.</p><p>\u201cWith your uncle. That is exactly where you need to be.\u201d He points south, away from</p><p>Louisville, toward home. \u201cThat world can give you what I can\u2019t. Not now. Just wait until graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you meant what you said,\u201d she says in a low growl, \u201cyou\u2019ll keep your promise now.\u201d</p><p>A dark shadow seems to encompass the guy and I quicken my pace. \u201cI said get away from her.\u201d My heart pounds in my chest. Two against one. The odds are bad, but I\u2019ll take them.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw that in my face,\u201d</p><p>Isaiah says to her, then rips his stare from Beth to focus on me. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t involve you, man, so fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it doesn\u2019t. She came here with me and she\u2019s going home with me. Anything that happens to her in between is my business.\u201d</p><p>He angles his body toward me. \u201cYou say that like she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Beth whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With only two feet between us, I take another step with every muscle prepared for a fight. \u201cShe became mine the moment you laid a hand on her.\u201d</p> <p>He closes the gap and we\u2019re standing toe-to-toe. His face inches from mine. Anger pulsates from his body. \u201cShe\u2019s not yours. She\u2019s mine and I don\u2019t like how you treat her.\u201d</p><p>A petite arm slides between our bodies.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d says Beth. \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I treat her?\u201d Is this guy high? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan, stop, please.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard Beth plead before and I want to look at her and confirm those words actually fell out of her mouth, but I don\u2019t dare. I keep solid eye contact with the asshole in front of me.</p><p>An insane smile tugs at his lips. \u201cYou think she wants you? Is that what you think? That you\u2019re some type of real man because you torture her at school? Because you spill her secrets? Because you humiliate her? You think she wants a guy that makes her cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah!\u201d yells Beth.</p><p>His arm snaps back and so does mine. A large figure surges from my left and instead of the hit I\u2019m prepared to take as I throw, Noah pushes Isaiah into a car. \u201cBack off, bro.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could you!\u201d I expect to see Beth\u2019s frigid, accusing stare in my direction. Instead, it\u2019s fixed on Isaiah. Her entire body shakes and she rubs her left arm with her right hand. A continuous motion over and over again. \u201cHow could you tell him that?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah blinks and the anger drains out of him. \u201cBeth...\u201d</p><p>She rushes to the Jeep. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to tell me twice. I shove the keys in the ignition before I shut the door and roar out of the parking lot. Hitting the freeway, I click on my seat belt as Beth rests her head against the passenger window.</p><p>I search for the anger I felt earlier and try to find a way to blame her. She was the one that left. She was the one that spent time with those two guys. But the only thought turning in my brain is the accusation Isaiah spat at me: I make her cry.</p><p>Beth</p><p>LIVING IS LIKE BEING CHAINED at the bottom of a shallow pond with my eyes open and no air. I can see distorted images of happiness and light, even hear muffled laughter, but everything is out of my reach as I lie in suffocating agony. If death is the opposite of living, then I hope death is like floating.</p><p>I\u2019ve never fought with Isaiah and Noah like that. I never thought Isaiah would betray me, but he has. I trusted my best friend with secrets\u2014secrets I\u2019ve never told another living soul. He knows about my father, he knows about my mother, he knows how many times a man has slapped a hand across my face...he knows that Ryan, the way he offers friendship when I know he\u2019s only playing me, hurts.</p><p>Resting my forehead against the glass of the passenger-side window, I watch the multiple white lines in the middle of the road speed by. On the two-lane road leading to my uncle\u2019s house, Ryan passes a tractor trailer, easily doing sixty in a forty-five. I sort of wish I had the courage to open the door and fall out.</p><p>It would hurt, but then the pain would be over when I died. All the pain. The indescribable ache in my chest, the heaviness in my head, the hard lump in my throat\u2014it would all be gone.</p><p>We\u2019ve ridden in silence. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been an uncomfortable silence as I am on the verge of numb. I\u2019m striving for numb. I crave numb. I want to be high.</p><p>The Jeep veers to the left and we begin the trip down the long driveway. My stomach growls. We never ate.</p><p>When he reaches the house, Ryan places the Jeep in park and immediately turns off the engine. I hate the country. With no lights, the woods and fields become the playground of my nightmares. My skin pricks at the thought of the devil waiting in the darkness to snatch me up and expel me into nothingness.</p><p>There are so many things Ryan can do. He can yell. He can go inside and tell Scott everything. The latter would make him the upstanding kid that Scott wants me to be. It would also crush the remains of my life. Scott will send Mom to jail.</p><p>And me? I\u2019ll want to die.</p><p>Four hours ago, pride would have never let me say the words, but there\u2019s nothing left inside me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Frogs croak near the creek that borders Scott\u2019s farm. Ryan says nothing back and I don\u2019t blame him. There really is nothing for him to say to a girl like me.</p><p>He examines the keys in his hands. \u201cYou played me for a ride into Louisville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And if my plan had worked, I would be gone, and my uncle would have blamed him.</p><p>\u201cYou planned to meet with that guy instead of spending time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He deserves honesty and that is as honest an answer as I can give him.</p><p>He twirls the keys around his finger. \u201cFrom the moment you walked into Taco Bell, you were nothing more than a dare. Chris and</p><p>Logan dared me to get your phone number and then I was dared to take you on a date.\u201d</p><p>The words sting, but I struggle to keep the pain from surfacing. What more should I expect? He\u2019s everything that\u2019s right with the world. I\u2019m everything wrong. Guys like him don\u2019t go for girls like me.</p><p>\u201cI almost got into a fight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And I say those rare words again:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sticks the key into the ignition and starts the engine. \u201cYou owe me. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven on Friday. No games this time. A simple night. We go to the party. We hang for an hour. I win my dare, then I take you home.</p><p>You go back to ignoring me. I\u2019ll ignore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I should be happy, but I\u2019m not. This is what I thought I wanted. Behind the numbness is an ache waiting to torture me. I open the door to the Jeep and close it without looking back.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>STATE LAW KEEPS ME from pitching more than fifteen innings a week. I\u2019m only brought in on Thursday games if our other two pitchers dig us a hole. Three innings ago, when Coach put me in, we were so far deep we couldn\u2019t see daylight. Not that the rain helps.</p><p>It\u2019s rained for two weeks. Two weeks\u2019 worth of games have been called. Two weeks\u2019 worth of parties have been canceled. Two weeks of me and Beth ignoring each other.</p><p>Everyone is anticipating that the rain will end tonight and the field party will finally take place tomorrow. I\u2019m ready too\u2014eager to win the dare and have Beth officially out of my life.</p><p>Bottom of the seventh with the score tied, I need to hold this last batter to send the game into extra innings. Light rain cools the heat on the back of my neck. Pooled droplets drip from the brim of my hat. The ball\u2019s slick. So is my hand. I hate playing in the rain, but guys in the majors do it all the time.</p><p>The intensity of the rain increases. I can barely read Logan\u2019s signal. Out of habit, I peek at the runner on first, but I can\u2019t see a damn thing. I wind back and the game-changing sound of nature intervenes: thunder and lightning.</p><p>\u201cOff the field!\u201d the umpire shouts.</p><p>My cleats sink in the mud as I walk to the dugout. This is the third rain delay of the game.</p><p>There won\u2019t be another. The game is done.</p><p>\u201cGreat job, guys.\u201d Coach claps each one of us on our soggy backs as we enter. \u201cDrive home safely. Severe weather is moving through.\u201d</p><p>Rain beats against the roof. I don\u2019t see the point of a roof if everything underneath it is wet. The seats. The equipment. Our bags. I quickly change shoes, tying my Nikes harder and faster than normal.</p><p>Knowing me better than anyone else, Chris wedges his large body onto the bench beside me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>Rain cancellations don\u2019t count. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have pulled us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I stand and sling my bag over my shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the team chatters, changes shoes, and waits in the dugout for the worst of the rain to end. I\u2019m not in the mood for company and I\u2019m already wet. The rain hammers my back as I head to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Chris runs to catch me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, dawg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit,\u201d he yells over the rain. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a walking mood for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>I open the door to my Jeep and toss my bag into the back. Beth. That\u2019s what happened, but I can\u2019t tell Chris that. I\u2019m ending my losing streak tomorrow when the rain moves out and Beth comes with me to the party.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll tell me.\u201d Standing next to</p><p>Chris, Lacy looks like a drowned rat with her hair plastered to her face. When the rain began an hour ago, she sought shelter in Chris\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cTake me home, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>The last thing I want is to be trapped in a car with her. \u201cI\u2019m not your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she yells as another clap of thunder vibrates in the sky. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>Lacy kisses Chris\u2019s cheek and runs to the passenger side. I glance at Chris and he nods.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be mad at you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I hop into the Jeep and start it up. In Lacy-like style, she goes to work turning on the heat and switching the radio to her favorite country station before lowering the sound. \u201cDid you and Beth have a fight?\u201d</p><p>The windshield wipers whine at a fast rate as I pull out of the parking lot. I wonder what Lacy knows. I didn\u2019t tell anyone that Beth and I went into Louisville. \u201cIs that what she said?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I finally scored her home number the other week and her uncle told me you guys were out.\u201d</p><p>I calculate how this affects the dare. \u201cDid you tell Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my business to tell. Did you take her into Louisville because of the dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the dare\u2019s done. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been ignoring her?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Why is Lacy making me feel like a dick? Beth\u2019s the one that screwed me over. She owes me this. \u201cShe treats you like crap, Lace. Why do you care?\u201d</p><p>Lacy doesn\u2019t live far from the community ballpark. I ease into her drive and watch the hanging ferns on the front porch blowing in the wind.</p><p>\u201cShe was my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas! She was...\u201d</p> <p>Lacy holds both her hands out. \u201cStop. Listen to me. I\u2019m not you. I\u2019ve never been you. You walk into any situation and it\u2019s automatically perfect. I\u2019m not perfect. I never have been.\u201d</p><p>What is she talking about? If Lace only knew how broken my family is; how since Mark left we\u2019re slowing dying. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up?! God, I can\u2019t get you guys to say crap half the time and then anytime I try to actually SAY something worth saying, one of you interrupts me. So shut up!\u201d</p><p>I gesture with my hand for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cNo one liked me, Ryan. Daddy moved us to Groveton when I was four and I knew then nobody liked me. My mom tried playdate after playdate and put me in preschool and no matter what, I was considered the outsider. I\u2019m not you. I\u2019m not Logan. I\u2019m not Chris. I can\u2019t trace my roots to the founding fathers. I can\u2019t eat Sunday chicken with my grandma after church because she doesn\u2019t live on the next property over, but three states away.\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my head, unsure if I should speak and if I do, what to say. Lacy never seemed to care what people thought of her.</p> <p>\u201cWe never treated you different.\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavily. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve hung out with you since sixth grade? Do you think I love baseball that much?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t let Chris hear you say you aren\u2019t a diehard fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d she says, and I understand that means that she also loves anything he loves.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the whole point is, Beth liked me. When Gwen was mean to me...\u201d</p><p>My mouth opens to protest. She points at me and narrows her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word. One, I told you to shut up. Two, this is my monologue and not yours. Three, she\u2019s a bitch.</p><p>As I was saying, when Gwen played to her true self and dropped the I\u2019m-pretending-to-be-perfect-so-the-whole-world-will-love-me act, she made my life hell. I was labeled weird before I entered kindergarten, yet Beth liked me.</p><p>\u201cWhen Gwen made me cry, Beth held my hand and told me that she loved me. When Gwen\u2019s friends told me I couldn\u2019t play on the swings, Beth pushed them off and told me the swings were mine. Beth taught me what it meant to have friends. I don\u2019t know what the hell happened to her between third grade and now, but I owe her. Here\u2019s the thing\u2014I love you and I love her, but I swear to God I\u2019ll kick your ass if you hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>Lacy has thrown out too much to process, so I focus on what I know. \u201cYou\u2019ll kick my ass?\u201d</p><p>She cracks a smile. \u201cOkay, maybe not, but I will be pissed off and I don\u2019t like being pissed off at you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like her being pissed off at me either.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming with me to the party.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment clouds her face. \u201cDare or date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare.\u201d I don\u2019t lie to friends. \u201cBut Beth knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she knows, doesn\u2019t that break the rules?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a rule book.\u201d</p><p>The porch light flips on and the front door opens. Through the pouring rain, I barely see Lacy\u2019s mom. I wave at her. A second later, she waves back.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks all Chris and I do is make out in cars.\u201d Lacy\u2019s hand flutters away any further discussion about her and Chris making out in cars, which is fine by me.</p><p>I\u2019d rather think about Beth. Who is she? The girl Lacy swears is a true friend? The girl with blond hair who loved ribbons and fancy</p><p>dresses? The girl who crawls underneath my skin and stays? The girl strong enough to tell me what she really thinks of me? The girl who looks so small and defenseless at times that I wonder if she can survive in the world on her own? Lacy may hate me for these words, but they have to be said. \u201cMaybe Beth isn\u2019t who you think she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cI was about to say the same thing to you.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>RYAN SWITCHES GEARS when the pavement ends and the Jeep\u2019s wheels hit gravel. The wind whips my hair into my face and neck, stinging me like the tiny tentacles of a jellyfish.</p><p>He turns on the headlights when the sun sets lower in the west, causing the woods surrounding us to fall into shadows.</p><p>Besides the forced happy hellos we exchanged under my aunt\u2019s watchful eye, Ryan and I have said nothing to each other since he picked me up. The things he uttered to me two weeks ago still hurt\u2014I was nothing more than a dare.</p><p>The offers of friendship, the smiles, the nice words\u2014all games. Deep down I always knew it, but part of me hoped for more. I allowed hope. Stupid Beth making another stupid mistake. Story of my life.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s rude to text while you\u2019re out with someone else.\u201d Ryan rests one hand on top of the steering wheel and leans cockily toward the door. \u201cEspecially when I saved you.\u201d</p><p>I ignore Ryan and stare at my cell. Owing him, I agreed to spend one hour with him at the party. I never agreed to conversation.</p><p>The constant dipping and bobbing in his Jeep makes reading Isaiah\u2019s texts nearly impossible. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had the courage to open them. Every message says the same thing: I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>So am I. I\u2019m sorry I trusted him. I\u2019m sorry he betrayed me. I\u2019m sorry I thought I could read his texts without my heart throbbing as if a swarm of bees attacked it. I want the heaviness to go away. I want the hurt to go away. How can I forgive him for telling Ryan my secret? How can I forgive him for forcing me to leave my mom?</p><p>And even worse, how can I talk to him now that I know he loves me and I know, beyond words, that I don\u2019t feel the same way? My throat tightens. Isaiah\u2019s my safe. He always has been. He\u2019s that place where I fall when the world tumbles into chaos. There were times I thought maybe we could be more, but then...I\u2019d freeze up entirely. Isaiah and I were meant to be friends and now I\u2019m losing my only friend.</p><p>The phone vibrates in my hands. It\u2019s as if he senses I\u2019m finally on the other side. Call me.</p><p>Text me. Please.</p><p>I toss the cell onto the floorboard of Ryan\u2019s Jeep. Texting Isaiah back will only increase the pain\u2014for both of us.</p><p>Ryan concentrates on the road, looking deep in thought. I wish I had his life. No pain. No problems. Only lightness and freedom.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ryan catches me staring. I remind myself that the sincerity melting in his brown eyes isn\u2019t real. Jocks are good at pretending. His hair sticks out behind the baseball cap he wears backward. He shifts gears again and the muscles in his arms ripple with the motion. It\u2019s kind of sexy. Not kind of\u2014Ryan is sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we on a dirt road? Did we officially reach the end of civilization?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gravel road,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThis is the way to my house.\u201d</p><p>His house. Please. That bastard Luke from my old school \u201cshowed\u201d me his house too. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you talk so pretty. You must have had all the guys dangling from your fingertips in Louisville.\u201d He flexes his fingers and regrips the steering wheel before speaking matter-of-factly. \u201cThis is the fastest way to the party.\u201d</p><p>Ryan hates me and I don\u2019t blame him. I hate me. What I hate more in this moment is that part of me likes Ryan. He stood up for me like the prince does for the princess in the fairy tales Scott used to read to me as a child. I\u2019m not a princess, but Ryan is a knight. He just belongs to someone else.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I hate how sharp the words come out. Fabulous. I yelled at him. Now I can feel like crap for that too.</p><p>Ryan breezes past what I assume is his house, a large one-story with a massive garage next to it, and switches gears again when we hit the grass. The Jeep jolts forward, tossing me in the seat like I\u2019m on a roller coaster. I grab hold of the passenger grip on the ceiling and Ryan laughs. A crazy smile brightens his face and once again, I find myself drawn in.</p><p>No longer leaning away from me, Ryan sits straight, one hand on the steering wheel, another shifting gears as we hurtle down a hill to a creek. The Jeep accelerates as if it were a snowball on the verge of an avalanche. I can see the possibilities. The crashing. The water.</p><p>The jostling. The dirt. My heart pumps faster in my chest and for the first time in weeks I feel alive.</p><p>The engine roars and he presses harder on the gas. The Jeep hits the rocks. Ryan and I both whoop and yell as water sprays the truck and smashes onto the windshield, making us blind. He pushes the Jeep forward, faster, past the creek, over the rocks. Daring to continue even when I have no idea what\u2019s on the other side.</p><p>The windshield wipers spring to life, clearing our view, and Ryan jerks the wheel to the right to miss a sprawling tree. He enters a clearing and kills the engine. I hear laughter and suck in a breath when I realize it\u2019s mine...and his. Together. It sounds nice. Kind of like music.</p><p>Ryan has that smile again. The genuine one that makes my stomach flip. He had it at Taco Bell. He had it when Scott introduced us.</p><p>He does it with such ease and for a second I believe his smile is for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d he says.</p><p>I absently touch my face as if I\u2019m surprised by the news.</p><p>\u201cYou should do that more. It\u2019s pretty.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty.\u201d</p><p>My heart does this strange fluttering. Like it\u2019s stopping and starting at the same time. Heat creeps up my neck and flushes my face. What the hell? I\u2019m blushing again?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ryan keeps the enduring smile, but it turns a little repentant and his eyes cast down in a shy way.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was fun.\u201d The most fun I\u2019ve had in weeks. The most fun I\u2019ve had sober in...my mind ticks back and I come up empty. Life sucks sober.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His eyes become distant and the grin stays on his face, but I can tell it\u2019s a little forced. He blinks and the smile becomes natural again. \u201cYeah. The creek. I should have told you that was coming. Or slowed down.\u201d</p><p>Why I can\u2019t hold eye contact with him for longer than a second, I don\u2019t know. The uncharacteristic bashfulness causes me to feel inadequate and a little...girly? I lace my hands together and focus on them. \u201cReally. It\u2019s okay.</p><p>I had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth?\u201d He hesitates. \u201cCan we start over?\u201d</p><p>I eye him\u2014head to toe. No one\u2019s offered me a do-over before. I guess no one thought I was worth it. A strange tugging inside me lifts my lips and causes a floating sensation for about three seconds. Well aware that everything in life is short lived, I feel the smile drop and the heaviness return. Still, I accept the offer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a guy shouting catches our attention. Further into the clearing is a circle of trucks with headlights on and a bonfire in the middle. Kids from school are everywhere.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>No, but I screwed everything up when I tried to run away. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m not a party virgin, a party in the woods with a bonfire is a first for me. A group dances in front of a large rusty Jeep. Others hang near the bonfire or on the tailgates of trucks. The whole setup has a Lord of the Flies quality. At least the movie version of the book.</p><p>Ryan and I wade through the knee-deep grass and it crunches beneath my wannabe</p><p>Chuck Taylors. Some of the longer blades swat at me, slashing at the bare skin exposed by the rips in my jeans. I hate the country.</p><p>The closer we get to the party, the slower I walk and Ryan matches my pace. With each step, he bridges the distance between us and a couple of times his fingers skim against mine.</p> <p>Butterflies flutter through my blood and the stupid little girl part of me wants him to touch me.</p><p>The other part would slug him if he did.</p><p>\u201cParties make you uncomfortable?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhen they make me feel like Daniel stepping into the lion\u2019s den.\u201d</p><p>I try to suck in my smile when I hear the surprise in his voice. \u201cYou know the story?\u201d</p><p>Thanks to my short stint in VBS with Lacy, I can recite the books of the Bible, New and Old Testament, and a few other random verses.</p> <p>\u201cEven the devil knows who God is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the devil, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>That sweet smile graces his lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. It\u2019s a good laugh. The type that digs deep down into my toes and tickles my insides.</p><p>What feels even better is the sound of him laughing right along with me.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I promise they won\u2019t eat you.</p><p>Half the girls here claim they\u2019re vegetarians and I can take the guys.\u201d He does the one thing I hoped for and dreaded: his hand tangles with mine and he tugs gently for me to follow.</p> <p>I like the touch of his hand. It\u2019s warm.</p><p>Strong. And I let the part of me that loved ribbons live for a few seconds and entwine my fingers with his. If I learned one thing from Vacation Bible School, it was that resurrection of the dead is possible.</p><p>Ryan walks toward a truck where Chris and Logan sit on the tailgate. They laugh loudly, then stop when they see me. Tucked between Chris\u2019s legs, Lacy offers me a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cDid the mud call to you again, Ryan?\u201d asks Lacy.</p><p>Ryan chuckles. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Mud? How did Lacy know...I glance down at my outfit. Mud\u2014everywhere. Just great.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d says Chris. \u201cYou actually convinced her to show. Did you give him your phone number too?\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding his damn hand.\u201d</p><p>Right. I am. Stupid me. The bet. First the phone number. Then the date. The Jeep ride disoriented me into momentary forgetfulness.</p><p>Hurt pricks at my heart and I shove the little girl with ribbons into the dark recesses of my mind. Some things should never be reborn. I break free from his hand. So much for Ryan\u2019s offer of starting over.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him snow you,\u201d Chris says while running a finger down Lacy\u2019s arm. \u201cRyan\u2019s a charmer.\u201d</p><p>Noah touches Echo like that. It\u2019s obvious from school that Chris is in love with Lacy.</p><p>Some guys touch girls they love. Others touch girls they use. The worst touch girls they hurt. I stare at Chris and consider telling him to go fuck himself. Yet I can\u2019t find the anger. I\u2019m the moron that walked into this situation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Chris get to you,\u201d Ryan retorts.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pissed because crap comes out of both ends.\u201d</p><p>Chris gives a hearty laugh. Ryan slings an arm around my shoulder and leads me from the group. Um\u2014no. I may have fallen for the hand-holding before, but I\u2019m not falling for anything else. \u201cGet your arm off of me before I rip it off and beat the shit out of you with it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re heading for the bonfire. I feel small underneath his massive arm, like a girl, and such vulnerability makes me uncomfortable.</p><p>Instead of letting go, Ryan effortlessly tucks me under his shoulder. \u201cWhen you kiss guys, do they drop dead from the venom that spews out of your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish, because I would have kissed you days ago. I\u2019m not kidding, get the hell off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>No? \u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201d</p><p>Ryan strides past the bonfire, and panic sweeps through me when he guides me into the thick crowd of people dancing. \u201cYou owe me one hour. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Rap pounds so loudly from a truck that the ground beneath us vibrates. Around us people dance. Shimmy. Shake. Laugh. They move in hypnotic rhythms. Skin against skin. Body against body.</p><p>My stomach heaves and I\u2019m overwhelmed with the urge to vomit. \u201cScrew you. I\u2019m not doing this.\u201d</p><p>Ryan bolts in front of me, stopping my retreat. \u201cHow about a deal? One dance and your debt is paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dance.\u201d True\u2014I don\u2019t. Truer? I\u2019ve never danced with a guy.</p><p>He raises a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The firelight flickers against Ryan\u2019s tan, giving his face a beautiful bronze glow. Gold shines in his hair. He\u2019s gorgeous. Honestly he is, and he wants me to dance. Could this day get any worse?</p><p>Ryan steps closer and flashes an all-knowing smile that makes him adorable and me weak. I hate him and I hate myself for wanting him to touch me again.</p><p>The music changes from superfast to a bit slower. Its strong beat mimics the frantic pounding in my chest. Ryan rests a hand on my hip and his heat seeps into my skin and creeps into my bloodstream. He lowers his lips to my ear and his breath tickles the nape of my neck.</p><p>\u201cDance with me, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m definitely learning impaired. I whispered the reply. I might as well have screamed yes. This is a mistake, Beth. A huge, glaring mistake. Just run!</p><p>Ryan places his other hand on the small of my back and molds his strong body to mine. I inhale and welcome the scent of warm earth and summer rain. Ryan smells... delicious.</p><p>\u201cThis works better if you touch me,\u201d he says.</p><p>I loosely lay my hands on his shoulders. Sort of like what I saw Echo do once when Noah swept her off the bed to dance. My skin tingles.</p><p>Touching Ryan, oh God, it\u2019s too much...too intimate. \u201cI\u2019m only doing this because I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d On rhythm, Ryan moves his hips from side to side. His hand slides an inch lower and the gentle pressure he exerts on my thigh stirs my body to sway in time with his.</p><p>Our feet never leave the ground, but, I swear, I\u2019m flying.</p><p>Ryan whispers to me again, \u201cI\u2019m dancing with you because I love the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>Figures. \u201cLove watching me make a fool out of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I love seeing the girl Scott and Lacy say you can be.\u201d He stares at me as if he\u2019s seeing beyond my skin and my heart pounds out of my chest so violently that he has to feel it. My nerve endings become raw. Somehow, Ryan\u2019s seeing me and I\u2019m exposed\u2014as if I\u2019m standing naked in front of a large open window. My hands slip from his neck, but as I try to step back, he clutches my waist, rejecting my escape.</p><p>\u201cRyan! I wondered when you\u2019d get here.\u201d</p><p>The sound of an all-too-familiar voice creates the same electric shock as when I stuck my finger into a wall socket when I was four. My body seizes, then moves in warp drive away from Ryan.</p><p>Gwen wears a red sundress with printed white flowers. Her lip curls at my wannabe Chuck Taylors, worn jeans, and black T-shirt.</p><p>She links her arm with Ryan\u2019s. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind if I steal Ryan for a moment, would you?</p><p>There are some things we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>They look nice together. Well matched. Like a couple should. \u201cHe\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>SECONDS AGO,</p><p>BETH AND I SHARED something... a moment, a connection. I saw it in her eyes. Something real. Now it\u2019s gone.</p><p>Beth turns from me and heads in the direction of Lacy, Chris, and Logan. \u201cBeth. Wait.\u201d</p><p>She faces me again, but walks backward\u2014away from me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says with a hint of bite. \u201cI\u2019m not disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d says Gwen. \u201cYou can chat with her later.\u201d</p><p>I let Beth go, but only because I remember how persistent Gwen can be. She\u2019ll follow me until she completes her mission. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be snippy,\u201d she chides.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Near the tree line, I notice Tim Richardson and Sarah Janes. Sarah sways and laughs a little too loud.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>Useless conversations. That\u2019s another reason we broke up. \u201cIs Sarah wasted?\u201d</p><p>Gwen glances over her shoulder at Sarah and refocuses on me. \u201cYeah. She was trashed before we arrived. So, I was thinking, we should walk onto the football field together for homecoming. The crowd likes couples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a couple.\u201d Tim places a hand on Sarah\u2019s ass and she stops laughing. \u201cAre Sarah and Tim an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She thinks he\u2019s dirt, but she\u2019s drunk and, well, he\u2019s Tim. Back to me and you. We were a couple and maybe we should try it again. You know, when you\u2019re done experimenting with Beth. I mean, you don\u2019t have to go to all of your practices, do you?</p><p>Ryan...Ryan? Why do you keep staring over my shoulder?\u201d</p><p>Sarah puts her hands on Tim\u2019s chest and pushes him. He doesn\u2019t move, but I do.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I mumble to Gwen.</p><p>She blocks my path and I halt, irritated she\u2019s still here. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>Something about homecoming and Beth.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about this later?\u201d Sarah pushes Tim again. \u201cYour friend needs help.\u201d</p><p>Gwen steps to the side and I advance to the tree line. Tim becomes touchier and Sarah keeps smacking him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tim,\u201d I say. \u201cI think Sarah wants to head back to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Tim responds.</p><p>Sarah swats his hands away. \u201cGet off of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTim,\u201d I say in a low tone. I\u2019ll back up my words with action and he knows it.</p><p>Tim releases Sarah and his chest puffs up as he watches her stumble back to the party. I ready myself by widening my stance. Tim owns a reputation for his dedication to the football team and his anger when he\u2019s drunk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one as long as you give Sarah her space.\u201d</p><p>He sloppily points at me, then sways. \u201cYou made her think she wanted space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tim. Let\u2019s go back to the party.\u201d</p><p>Tim rolls his shoulders back. He\u2019s looking for a fight. I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI think we should head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got a problem with girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My back straightens. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>His lips turn up into a smirk. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a problem with girls. You dumped Gwen and she\u2019s hot. You gay, man?\u201d</p><p>Rage ignites inside me and as my muscles tighten to rush forward, delicate fingers wrap around my arm. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it,\u201d Beth says in a smooth voice.</p><p>Chris and Logan slide in between me and Tim, a barrier of skin, muscle, and bone between me and the guy I want to pound.</p> <p>Tim continues to taunt me. \u201cReal men aren\u2019t saved by girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d Logan announces to him in a bored voice.</p><p>From the other side of Logan, Tim holds out his hands. \u201cCome and get me, Ryan. Prove that you\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>My fists curl and I step closer. \u201cI\u2019m game, Tim. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Chris pushes against my chest, but the pressure does nearly nothing to hold me back.</p> <p>He yells at Beth, \u201cGet him out of here!\u201d</p><p>Her fingers intertwine with mine and that soft, feminine voice breaks through the anger.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick over to her. \u201cRyan,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her one please breaks through the chaos disorienting my brain long enough to propel me in the opposite direction of Tim. I tighten my grip on Beth\u2019s hand and lead her back to my Jeep, but not before snagging a six-pack of beer from a cooler.</p> <p>Her fingers still clutch mine as we walk through the tall grass without saying a word. I release her when we reach the Jeep and we both hop in. My heart bleeds and anger courses in my veins. I turn on the engine and peel out of the clearing.</p><p>My brother left.</p><p>My brother is gay and he left and he\u2019s never coming back. My father acts as if he never existed. My mother is miserable. My parents\u2014people who once loved each other\u2014hate each other.</p><p>Driving alongside the creek, I wait for a shallow part before crossing. I\u2019ve tortured Beth enough. With this Jeep. With my presence.</p><p>Isaiah said I made her cry. My fingers tighten on the wheel. Beth\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019m a jerk.</p><p>I\u2019ll take her home, then ride to the back field of my house. And drink. By myself.</p><p>Drinking may not undo history, but it will cause me to forget for a few hours.</p><p>I jerk the wheel to the left when the rushing of the creek slows to a trickle. Water barely laps the tires as I cross, but the moment I hit the other side, I know I\u2019m screwed. Mud.</p> <p>Too much mud. Deep mud. I press on the gas and pull the wheel to the right to try to force the front tires on solid ground before the back ones sink, but it\u2019s too late. The back tires whine and halt all forward progress.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I slam my hand on the steering</p><p>wheel. Knowing that fighting will drag us deeper, I cut the engine. I\u2019m stuck. I yank the hat from my head and throw it to the floorboard. That sums everything up\u2014I\u2019m in deep and I\u2019m stuck.</p><p>My leg sinks a foot into the mud. Beth will be full of colorful words when I tell her we\u2019re going to have to walk. The mud acts like slow-drying concrete, making each step nearly impossible. My jeans rub and slosh in the filth.</p><p>I\u2019m a complete mess, but I don\u2019t have to let Beth get this dirty.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been much of a gentleman to her. In fact, I\u2019ve been the opposite. Not that her shining personality has made it easy. I open her door and hold out my arms. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead furrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to carry you out of the mud.\u201d</p><p>She lifts an incredulous eyebrow. \u201cThe show\u2019s over, Bat Boy. You don\u2019t have to be nice to me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Not in the mood for her mouth or an argument, I slip my arms underneath her knees and lift her out of the seat. She won\u2019t be bitching me out the entire walk home because I ruined her shoes.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Beth wiggles in my arms and reaches for the Jeep.</p><p>Can\u2019t she permit me one nice act? \u201cDammit, Beth, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, Beth leans into the passenger side. The back of her shirt hitches up, exposing her smooth skin and Chinese symbols tattooed along her spine. My eyes follow the path of the symbols until they disappear into her jeans.</p><p>Way too quickly for me, she leans back into my arms, two six-packs of beer cradled against her chest.</p><p>My eyes flicker from the beer to Beth.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSix wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>For me, it\u2019s plenty. I don\u2019t want a drinking partner tonight and if I did, it wouldn\u2019t be her. I kick the door shut and wade out of the mud.</p><p>Beth\u2019s light. Weighs one hundred; maybe one-o-five wet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with touching me,\u201d she says.</p><p>I jostle Beth to shut her up. The beer cans clank together as she juggles them to prevent them from falling out of her lap. \u201cReadjusting\u201d</p><p>Beth did shut her up, but it positioned her head closer to mine. I stare straight ahead and try not to focus on the sweet scent of roses drifting from her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou are obsessed with touching me. You could have put me down forever ago.\u201d</p><p>Withdrawn into my own head, I hadn\u2019t noticed that we\u2019d entered her uncle\u2019s woods.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I place Beth on her feet, snatch both six-packs from her hands, and stalk in the direction of her house. Scott all but bought billboard signs announcing that alcohol was off-limits for Beth.</p><p>Lucky for her, I drove along the creek toward Scott\u2019s property. Otherwise, it could have been one hell of a walk\u2014for her.</p><p>Something tells me she\u2019s not the outdoorsy type.</p><p>She stays a few steps behind and I appreciate the silence. Fall crickets chirp and a slight breeze rustles through the leaves on the trees. Right over the next hill is Scott\u2019s pasture and his back barn. A twig snaps behind me as Beth rushes to my side. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>A light grip pulls on my biceps. \u201cThe hell you are.\u201d</p><p>I stop, not because Beth\u2019s touch halts me, but because I find her attempt to physically stop me amusing. \u201cYou\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation. You came to the party, now I\u2019m taking you home. We\u2019re done. I don\u2019t have to look at you. You don\u2019t have to look at me.\u201d</p><p>Beth bites her lower lip. \u201cI thought we were starting over.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Isn\u2019t this what she wanted\u2014 to be left alone? \u201cYou hate me.\u201d</p><p>Beth says nothing, neither confirming nor denying what I said, and the thought that my words are true causes my heart to clench.</p><p>Screw it. I don\u2019t have to understand her. I don\u2019t need her. I turn my back to her and push forward\u2014through the tall grass of the pasture, toward the red barn.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever drunk alone?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I freeze. When I don\u2019t answer, she continues, \u201cIt sucks. I did it once\u2014when I was fourteen.</p><p>It makes you feel worse. Alone. My friend...\u201d</p><p>She falters. \u201cMy best friend and I agreed that we\u2019d never drink alone again. We promised we\u2019d have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s weird to hear Beth talk so openly and part of me wishes she\u2019d go back to being foulmouthed and rude. She seems less human then. \u201cIs there a reason why you\u2019re telling me this?\u201d</p><p>The grass rustles as she fidgets. \u201cSix of those beers are mine and I have a little more than four hours to curfew. I guess I\u2019m saying we could call a truce for tonight and neither one of us have to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour uncle Scott would crucify me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder and watch as she weaves through the flowing grains to reach me.</p><p>\u201cI swear I have more to lose than you do.</p><p>He won\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Mud spots her face, cakes in her hair, and stains her clothes. Half of that mud Beth gained on our trip in. I should have told her what she looked like before we went to the party, but Beth was laughing. Smiling. I selfishly held on to the moment.</p><p>On top of that, Isaiah said I made her cry. I assess the small beauty in front of me. There\u2019s more to her, I know there is. I saw it in her eyes when she laughed with me in the Jeep.</p><p>Felt it in her touch as we danced.</p><p>I must be losing my mind. \u201cOne beer.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>STRAW IS SOFT TO LIE ON.</p><p>Sort of scratchy.</p><p>Comfortable.</p><p>Great for weightlessness.</p><p>It smells musty and dusty and dirty. The corners of my lips flinch in a moment of joy.</p><p>Musty. Dusty. And dirty. Those words flow well together. Staring at the shadows from the light created by the camping lantern Ryan found in the corner of Scott\u2019s barn, I inhale deeply. I\u2019m finally high.</p><p>Not pot high. Ryan\u2019s too straitlaced for that.</p><p>Airy in alcohol would be a better description.</p><p>Three beers. Isaiah would laugh his ass off.</p><p>Three beers and I\u2019m floating. Guess that\u2019s what happens when you stay sober for a couple of weeks in a row.</p><p>Isaiah.</p><p>My chest aches.</p><p>\u201cMy best friend is pissed at me and I\u2019m pissed at him.\u201d I\u2019m the first to break the silence beyond the crack and hiss of beer cans popping open and the rustle and cooing of birds in the rafters. \u201cMy only friend.\u201d</p><p>In slow motion, Ryan rolls his head to look at me. He sits on the ground with his torso sloppily supported by a stack of baled hay. A glaze covers his light brown eyes. I give him major props. At six beers, the boy has drunk me under the table. Correction\u2014under bales of hay. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d I say and my heart twists. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy with the tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the other one your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I mean to chuckle. Instead it comes out more of a snort and a hiccup. Ryan laughs at me, but I\u2019m so weightless I don\u2019t care. \u201cNoah? No, he\u2019s helplessly in love with some insane chick.</p><p>Besides, Noah and I aren\u2019t friends. We\u2019re more like siblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The disbelief oozes from Ryan.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t resemble each other.\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand frantically in the air. \u201cNo. We\u2019re not related. Noah can\u2019t stand me, but he loves me. Takes up for me. Like siblings.\u201d</p><p>Love. I purposely knock the back of my head against the ground in frustration. Isaiah said he loved me. I search the cobwebbed corridors of my emotions and try to imagine loving him back. All I find is a hollow emptiness. Is that what love is? Emptiness?</p><p>Ryan narrows his eyes for a deep-in-thought expression, but six beers in an hour tells me he probably spaced out. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Ryan cracks open another beer. I start to protest as he has infiltrated my stash, but decide against it. I want weightless, not puking. I have to return to Scott\u2019s in three hours and coherency will be required.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Isaiah mad at you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHe loves me,\u201d I say without thinking, and immediately regret it. \u201cAnd other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him back?\u201d That\u2019s the fastest Ryan has responded since his second beer.</p><p>I sigh heavily. Do I? \u201cI\u2019d throw myself in front of a bus to push him out of the way.\u201d If it would save him. If it would make him happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s love, right?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do that for most people, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Oh. Then I have no idea what love is.</p><p>\u201cWhat other things?\u201d he prods.</p> <p>Other things? Oh yeah, Ryan asked why Isaiah is mad at me. I shake my head back and forth, causing the straw to crackle. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. My problems...\u201d My mom. \u201cMy family isn\u2019t perfect. We have problems.\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckles and sips his beer.</p><p>I rise on my elbows. \u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d</p><p>Ryan tilts back the beer and I watch his throat move as he swallows. He crushes the empty can in his hand. \u201cPerfect. Family. Problems. Gay brothers.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re obviously not talking about me and Isaiah anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Even inebriated, the ache I saw earlier while he was carrying me out of the Jeep darkens his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you got defensive with the football asshole?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause you have a gay brother?\u201d</p><p>Ryan tosses the can near the other empty ones and rubs his eyes. \u201cYes. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer not to talk about it. Or talk at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I can do silence. My arms fall over my head as I plop back onto the straw. Isaiah would let me talk. I could rattle on about anything...ribbons and dresses, and he\u2019d placate me when I questioned whether I was too harsh with Noah. Sometimes I think about what life would be like if I gave Echo a break.</p><p>I mean, she does make Noah happy and Isaiah likes her. Sometimes she\u2019s cool.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019ve been talking since you finished your first beer.\u201d</p> <p>I blink and close my mouth, not having realized that I had verbalized a thing.</p><p>A black bird flaps its wings overhead, creating a shadow on the ceiling. Images of a deadly archangel coming to destroy us all enter my mind. The bird grows more agitated and the other birds fly to a beam on the opposite side of the barn. He takes off into the air and smacks the wall, dips down, flies across the barn, and rams into the opposite wall. My heart thunders with every hit. I watch with wide eyes and shaking hands. \u201cWe have to help him.\u201d</p><p>I jump up and stumble toward the barn door. Struggling for balance, I force one of the doors open with a loud creak. I lean against the frame and wait for the bird that\u2019s damaging itself over and over again to escape. \u201cGo! Get out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the door,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cBirds are stupid. If you want it out, you\u2019re going to have to trap it and drag it out.\u201d</p><p>I gesture wildly into the open night. \u201cBut the door is open!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bird\u2019s so panicked that it\u2019ll never see the opening. All you\u2019re doing is inviting your uncle to come in here and find us. Unless you\u2019re ready to go home, close the door.\u201d</p><p>The bird smacks itself into the wall again and flutters to a nearby beam. He ruffles his feathers over and over again, then finally draws in his wings to rest. My stomach rolls in torture. Why can\u2019t the bird see the way out?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Echo?\u201d asks Ryan.</p> <p>\u201cBut the bird...\u201d I say, ignoring his question.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t understand you\u2019re trying to help. If anything, it sees you as a threat. Now, tell me, who\u2019s Echo?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and close the door. I want the bird to find freedom, but I\u2019m not ready to go back to Scott\u2019s. Thanks to my impaired state, I half walk, half trip back to my bed of straw. Damn bird. Why can\u2019t something be easy? \u201cNoah\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a screwed-up name,\u201d he says.</p><p>I giggle. \u201cShe\u2019s a screwed-up girl.\u201d I stop giggling and remember how Noah looked at her: as if she was the only person on the planet, the only person that mattered. \u201cBut Noah loves her.\u201d</p><p>That must be love: when everything else in the world could implode and you wouldn\u2019t care as long as you had that one person standing beside you. Isaiah has it all wrong. For many reasons. He doesn\u2019t love me. He can\u2019t. For starters, he doesn\u2019t look at me like Noah does Echo. Besides, I\u2019m not worthy of that type of love.</p><p>The bird hides its head under its wing. I understand that feeling of wishing the world would go away. If I had wings, I\u2019d hide underneath them too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bird, Beth. It\u2019ll find its way out eventually.\u201d</p><p>Something deep and dark and heavy inside me tells me it won\u2019t. The poor bird will die in this damn barn and will never see blue sky again.</p><p>Straw rustles and Ryan drops beside me, stirring dust into the air. He clumsily rolls onto his side to face me. His warm body touches mine and his eyes have a strange intensity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>My heart trips over itself. Ryan kept his hat off and I like it more than I should. His hair kicks out crazily in the back and it gives a boyish charm to a face that belongs to a man.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I ask, ashamed that my voice comes out a little breathless.</p><p>His eyebrows inch closer together and he moves his hand near my face. He stops and so does my breathing. Ryan stares at my lips and then caresses my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou do that a lot.\u201d His finger slides steadily to the tip of my mouth. My skin tingles under his touch. \u201cLook sad. I hate it. Your mouth turns down. Your cheeks lose all color. You lose everything about you that makes you...you.\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips and I swear he watches. His finger pauses before tracing another teasing path across my cheek. My pulse quickens and heat spreads through my body. His touch\u2014oh God\u2014feels good. And I want good.</p><p>So much.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want him. At least, I don\u2019t think so. \u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d</p><p>His lips burst into a bright smile and he withdraws his hand. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Ryan does it again\u2014his smile. The one that makes my stomach flip.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. He must have snorted some crack earlier, or maybe he\u2019s doing that steroid crap. What do they call it? Juicing.</p><p>Yeah. The kid is definitely juicing. And drunk.</p><p>\u201cYou like me?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and it\u2019s a strange clumsy mix of yes and no at the same time. Ryan is sloshed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The way you talk. The way you act. I know what I\u2019m going to get from you, but then I don\u2019t. I mean, you\u2019re unpredictable, yet I know whatever reaction you\u2019re going to give me is real, you know?\u201d</p><p>Officially cutting him off, I slide the few remaining beers from him and conceal them in the hay while trying to keep his eyes on me.</p><p>His declaration of \u201clike\u201d has placed him in the category of beyond intoxicated and there\u2019s no way I can lug him home. \u201cYou mean you like knowing that our conversations will end with me telling you to go fuck yourself?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He has me there.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t pierce?\u201d Ryan stares at my belly button. My shirt must have ridden up, exposing the red jewel dangling on my stomach. On my sixteenth birthday, Isaiah paid for my belly button piercing. At seventeen he paid for the tattoo. Both times he came up with the \u201cconsent.\u201d Isaiah is crafty like that.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes flash to mine and I see he understands the innuendo. I laugh when his cheeks turn red. \u201cWhat are you, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just ask what I am?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWhy would a jock be holed up with me in a barn, drinking beer, when he could be screwing half the female population at school? You aren\u2019t fitting the profile.\u201d</p><p>His eyes search my face and he ignores my question. \u201cWhat\u2019s your tattoo mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder.\u201d It means freedom.</p><p>Something I\u2019ll never have. My destiny was built for me before I sucked in my first breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again,\u201d says Ryan. And he touches me again. This time on my stomach, yet his eyes hold mine. His finger lightly explores the edges of the jeweled ring. Tickling me. Entrancing me. Taking my haze higher.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly where I want to go\u2014higher.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say, Ryan, if I said I didn\u2019t want to be alone?\u201d</p><p>His fingers slip to my side and his warm palm clings to the curve of my waist, inching me and my body slowly toward heaven. \u201cI\u2019d say I don\u2019t want to be alone either.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>THE LANTERN LIGHT FLICKERS, creating shadows over Beth\u2019s face. There\u2019s no mistaking the suggestion in her smoky-blue eyes or the invitation of her fingertips as they trace the curve of my biceps. With her black hair sprawled out against the golden hay, she reminds me of a modern-day version of Snow White\u2014lips as red as roses, skin as white as snow.</p><p>Would a kiss bring Beth to life? Tonight she\u2019s shown me brief flashes of the girl hidden behind the facade. Maybe I can draw her out more. Maybe if I kiss her...no, not kiss. I\u2019m no prince and this isn\u2019t a fairy tale.</p><p>Attempting to find sanity, I rub my head.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. The thoughts in my brain crest and dip like waves in the ocean. Each thought harder to hold on to than the one before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Beth\u2019s voice becomes smooth, as if she\u2019s casting a spell. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should talk,\u201d I say in a rush before the thought drifts away, but my hand draws another lazy circle on her stomach. Her muscles come alive under my touch, a shudder of pleasure, and I crave to please her.</p><p>\u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she answers. \u201cTalking is overrated.\u201d</p><p>And I nod in agreement, but the thought floats back to the surface: we should talk. I\u2019ve fought it all night; hell, I\u2019ve fought it since I met her, but I like it when Beth talks because she becomes real\u2014she becomes more. I like more. I like her.</p><p>What I really like is how her smooth skin glows in the lantern light, how soft it feels against my fingers. Beth licks her lips again and my head tilts in expectation. Her mouth glistens now and I memorize the perfect shape while imagining her lips brushing against mine.</p><p>The hay rustles beneath Beth as she lifts her head. My senses are flooded with the scent of roses.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she says.</p><p>Just one kiss and her black spell, the one that she\u2019s woven, the one that\u2019s constantly weighing her down, will be broken.</p><p>Beth</p><p>MY TANK RIDES UP further when Ryan strokes the bare flesh of my stomach. He angles closer to me and I\u2019m immediately overwhelmed by the size of his body. My blood tingles with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019re soft,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I knot my fingers in his hair, guiding his head to mine. \u201cYou talk too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he agrees and his lips finally meet mine.</p><p>It\u2019s an innocent kiss at first. Soft lips meeting; a gentle pressure that creates a slow burn. The type of kiss you give to someone that means something. This isn\u2019t the type of kiss to be wasted on me. But still, I prolong it by taking his lower lip into mine and I touch his smooth face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For this one second, I\u2019ll feel. I\u2019ll let myself pretend that Ryan cares for me. That I\u2019m the girl worthy of this type of kiss, and right as I sense the emotion becoming stronger, gaining traction, I break away.</p><p>Ryan swallows and stares down at me. I press my lips to his innocently one last time, then slide my tongue between his lips. Sparks sizzle in the air as we immediately part our mouths, hungry for more. It\u2019s a lightning storm of fiery kisses and sounds of bliss. Each of us feeds off the other, only building a greater storm\u2014a thunderhead on the verge of explosion.</p><p>My hands roam over his back, clawing for the hem of his shirt, eager to explore the glorious muscles underneath. Ryan follows my lead and picks up the pace. Cooler air pricks at my back as he sweeps an arm beneath me and pulls my tank over my head.</p><p>Ryan pauses for a second. His hesitant eyes meet mine and I quickly reclaim his lips. He responds, but barely. He\u2019s thinking again and if he follows his thoughts, then I\u2019ll lose my chance at higher.</p> <p>I trail my hand down his spine\u2014a light touch, a dance that crosses to the side of his waist, over his hip, and right as my fingers circle lower, Ryan moans and rejoins the game. My mouth slants up under his kiss.</p><p>I love the sound of his moan. I love how his hands memorize the small of my back and dare lower to my thighs. I love how we\u2019ve both moved beyond coherent thought. I love floating.</p><p>We roll and I help Ryan lose his shirt. In seconds, our legs tangle. My hands curl into his muscles as Ryan generously trails hot kisses along the nape of my neck. He grows bold, inching my bra strap off my shoulder. I reward bold.</p><p>We lose control\u2014quickly, so fast we\u2019ve broken beyond floating to flying. I inhale and all I smell is Ryan: the sweet scent of summer rain. I\u2019m so giddy I could almost laugh\u2014I\u2019m finally high. Higher than I\u2019ve ever been without drugs, higher than I\u2019ve ever been with another guy, higher than... Ryan\u2019s hand slides to cradle my face, his warm palm touching my cheek. His head follows and we both gasp for air as he rests his forehead against mine. He\u2019s pausing and I don\u2019t like pausing. Pausing means thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he says. His hands still explore; his lips still exert gentle pressure against my skin. Maybe he\u2019s not pausing.</p> <p>Maybe he\u2019s...what? What is he doing? His body says one thing, but his mouth says another.</p><p>\u201cNo talking.\u201d I don\u2019t want talking. I want higher. I want further.</p><p>Ryan brushes the hair away from my face and my heart flutters. \u201cI like you,\u201d he says in my ear. \u201cI like you, Beth.\u201d</p><p>All movement stops as the corners of my lips tug up for a shy smile. He likes me. He likes me and I like him and...All the air rushes out of my body, leaving my lungs in a painful struggle for air. My fingers curl into fists and I push at Ryan\u2019s chest. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>Instead his hold on me tightens. His eyes clear of their haze and dart over my face, searching for the problem. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d I scream and he immediately releases me. On my hands and knees, I wrestle away from him...away from me...just away.</p> <p>I\u2019m stupid. So stupid. Ryan doesn\u2019t like me. He doesn\u2019t. How could I let my emotions get involved? Why couldn\u2019t I just use him for higher?</p><p>I grab my shirt and bolt for the door.</p><p>From behind me, I hear the hay crunch as Ryan battles his impaired state to stand. \u201cBeth\u2014wait! I\u2019m sorry! Please.\u201d</p><p>At the door, I hesitate. The other guys, the ones I\u2019ve used to feel something physical, they\u2019ve never apologized. They\u2019ve never asked me to stay. I risk a glance over my shoulder and my stomach twists when I see the agony etched on his face.</p><p>Ryan holds a hand out to me. \u201cPlease. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Talking\u2014it\u2019s what got me into this situation.</p><p>It\u2019s what turned what should have been nothing into something. Part of me begs to stay\u2014to talk. Instead, I flee into the dark night. Staying will hurt and running is my only option.</p><p>Ryan</p> <p>WE WON TODAY and I have no idea how.</p><p>Throughout the game, the sun hurt my eyes.</p><p>My head pounded in an annoying painful rhythm. Twice, I puked between innings.</p><p>Playing with a hangover took hell to another level. Even now, I fight the urge to pull the Jeep over on the side of the road, let my head hit the steering wheel, and rest, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I like her. I really like Beth. The moment she smiled at me in the Jeep after we drove through the creek, I knew. Yeah, she\u2019s hard-core, but at the same time, she\u2019s not. Last night, her walls cracked.</p><p>Holding her while we danced, I saw her\u2014</p><p>the beautiful girl who loved ribbons. When she entwined her fingers with mine to stop me from fighting Tim, I saw the girl who protected Lacy in elementary school. In the barn, I listened to her ramble about her life: Isaiah, Noah, Echo, and beaches. By listening, I found a person loyal to those she loves. It was the first unedited glimpse into a girl that holds everything inside.</p><p>I\u2019m falling for her. Hard. And I messed everything up the moment I touched her. How could I be so stupid?</p><p>The evening sunlight filters through the thick trees lining Scott Risk\u2019s long driveway. I replay the words I\u2019ll say when Scott answers his door. I don\u2019t have much of an excuse to see Beth. The truth won\u2019t help: Hi. I took your niece out last night, got drunk, made out with her until she bolted from the barn, and I\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to apologize to her and convince her to give me a shot.</p><p>Yeah. I see that conversation going well.</p><p>Bent forward with her head in her hands, Beth sits on the front porch stairs. My stomach drops to the floorboard of the Jeep. I did this to her. Beth peeks at me through her hair as I park in front of the garage. She straightens and wraps her arms around her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say as I approach. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike shit.\u201d She\u2019s barefoot and wears a deep purple cotton shirt that hugs her waist and a pair of overly ripped jeans. Her shirt slips off her shoulder, exposing her black bra strap. I force my eyes to glance away. I became way too familiar with that tantalizing bra last night.</p><p>I stop at the foot of the stairs and shove my hands into my pockets. Does she feel like shit because she\u2019s also hungover, or because she regrets making out with me? \u201cMy head\u2019s hammered all day.\u201d</p><p>Beth slowly sucks in air and releases it, blowing a few strands of her hair from her face. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left in a rush last night.\u201d Images of our night together flash in my mind. Her hands tugging off my shirt, hot on my skin, messing through my hair. I remember my lips on her neck and the sweet taste of her skin. The curve of her body against my hands. Her fingernails teasing my back. \u201cI wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says.</p><p>Beth retreats behind her brick wall. Closed off. Emotions cemented in. I stare at her. She stares at me. I have no idea what to say. Last night, we weren\u2019t really on a date. It was an agreement. She wasn\u2019t my girlfriend who I slowly worked through the bases with. She wasn\u2019t a girl I took to dinner a couple of times and kissed a little too much for too long. With Beth, I crossed lines a real man wouldn\u2019t cross.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Her glare makes me feel like I\u2019m standing in front of a firing squad, awaiting my sentence.</p><p>\u201cFor...\u201d What am I sorry for? Taking off her shirt? Kissing her until I thought I was going to lose my mind? Touching her? Feeling her? Of all the things I may be sorry for in my life, I\u2019m honestly not sorry for any of that. \u201cFor taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>The right corner of her mouth struggles up, then down, then slowly back up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex last night.\u201d</p><p>Heat runs up my neck and I focus on my shoes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Part of me is thankful she left when she did.</p><p>The moment my lips found her body, we quickly became an erupting volcano. Hot and fast. Very fast. Fast enough that I would have given her my virginity.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you apologizing for?\u201d</p><p>I gather my courage and face her. \u201cYou left.</p><p>In a hurry. And what I did...we were drunk. I don\u2019t get drunk and I don\u2019t take advantage of girls. You left upset. I crossed lines, and the way you left...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Beth clears her throat. \u201cRyan.\u201d She stretches out my name, as if giving herself time to think.</p><p>\u201cI was the one who took advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>I still. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. Girls don\u2019t take advantage of guys. Guys take advantage of girls.\u201d</p><p>Her lips bunch and twist to the side as she shakes her head. \u201cNope. I distinctly remember telling you I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the moment I should have walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should have. It\u2019s what an honorable guy does. Especially for a girl he likes.\u201d</p><p>Beth points a finger. \u201cSee, that\u2019s where you\u2019re confused. You don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Why is she making this apology complicated? Why does she make everything complicated? \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re telling yourself you like me.\u201d</p><p>She drives me insane by finding a way to slink underneath my skin. \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel guilty for hooking up with me so you\u2019re trying to make yourself feel better by convincing yourself that you like me, when you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha...\u201d The more she talks, the more my mind becomes a cluttered mess. \u201cI like you. I.</p><p>Like. You. I\u2019ll admit, you\u2019re annoying.</p><p>Sometimes you agitate me to the brink of insanity, but you can throw it back at me like no one else. When you laugh, I want to laugh.</p><p>When you smile, I want to smile. Hell, I want to be the one to make you smile. And you\u2019re pretty. No, you\u2019re sexy, and last night was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Beth holds out her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a good guy and you don\u2019t want to think you could have done something not good, okay?</p><p>What we did wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t wholesome, but it wasn\u2019t bad. Don\u2019t read anything more into it.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s beautiful blue eyes are pleading with me. Pleading! She wants me to agree with her.</p><p>\u201cIf you really feel that way, then why did you bolt last night?\u201d</p><p>The front door opens and, with narrowed eyes, Scott glares at me from the other side of the storm door. Beth glances at him over her shoulder and holds his gaze. He walks away, leaving the front door open. A knot forms between my shoulder blades. Not good.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d says Beth.</p><p>Probably, but I can\u2019t. Not with Beth telling me that I don\u2019t like her. Not when she honestly believes it. \u201cGo out with me again\u2014a real date this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I climb the three steps and sit next to her. We were so close last night. Skin against skin.</p><p>She\u2019s inches from me, but it feels like miles.</p><p>My hand becomes heavy with the need to touch her, comfort her. I raise it. Put it down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Come on, I had no problems touching her last night.

Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cDate me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike friends...\u201d Beth scrunches her face in disgust \u201c...with benefits?\u201d</p><p>I can almost feel her body under mine again and I shake away the memory. I\u2019m not going to prove to her I like her if we have a repeat performance of last night. \u201cNo. Friends who go out together. I pay. You smile. Sometimes we kiss.\u201d</p><p>She raises a skeptical eyebrow on the word kiss and I immediately backtrack. \u201cBut we date first\u2014for a while. Friends who like each other and want to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I liked you.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and a warm tingle enters my blood when she gives that small, peaceful smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said you hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends who date,\u201d she says as if she\u2019s trying to find the hidden meaning in the phrase.</p><p>\u201cFriends who date,\u201d I repeat and squeeze her fingers.</p><p>Beth tenses and withdraws her hand. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She pads down the stairs on bare feet. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t the way things work. Guys like you don\u2019t date girls like me. What angle are you playing? Is this about the dare?\u201d</p><p>Her words cause me to flinch, but they aren\u2019t a surprise. Last night, I pushed her too far. I showed her no respect. She has no reason to believe me, yet I want her to. \u201cNo. The dare is done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you won last night?\u201d</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t. The dare required that Beth and I stay at the party for an hour. We barely lasted fifteen minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Beth. I don\u2019t play people I care about.\u201d</p><p>Myriad emotions cross her face, as if she\u2019s wrestling with God and the devil. \u201cYou could be playing me. If this is the dare, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you. The dare is over.\u201d I told Lacy that no one gets hurt on my dares. Especially in this one. How could I be so blind? I thought Beth walked away from the trust fall because she wanted to hurt me. I thought she wanted to watch my team lose. Wrong. Beth didn\u2019t jump because she doesn\u2019t trust and, because of this dare, I\u2019ve ruined any trust she could have had in me.</p><p>\u201cDid you win then?\u201d Beth stubbornly holds on to the dare. \u201cWere you dared to make out with me?\u201d The hurt gives way to panic. \u201cYou fucking asshole, you did play me, didn\u2019t you? Does everyone at school already know? Are you here for bonus points? Try to fuck the girl, tell your friends, then convince her you want more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shout, then remind myself to rein it in. I created her doubt when I accepted the dare. \u201cNo. What happened between us last night wasn\u2019t about any dare. I didn\u2019t plan it and I would never tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m a secret. We\u2019ll date in private, but not in public. No thanks.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I can\u2019t win. I rub my hand over my head. \u201cI want to be with you. Here. At school. Wherever. I didn\u2019t play you. Just trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Beth angles her body away from me. Trust must be the ugliest word in her vocabulary.</p><p>Desperate to make everything right, I blurt out, \u201cAsk me for anything and I\u2019ll do it. Trust me with something. I\u2019ll prove to you I\u2019m worth trusting.\u201d</p><p>She assesses me: Nikes first, blue jeans, Reds T-shirt, then my face. \u201cWill you take me into Louisville again?\u201d</p><p>The nausea I fought all afternoon returns.</p><p>Anything but that. \u201cBeth...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t disappear again. I need you to drop me off someplace and I swear I\u2019ll be at the same exact spot you left me at the exact time you tell me to show. You\u2019re asking me to trust you, well...you\u2019re going to have to trust me first.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t seem fair, but fair went out the window the moment I touched her last night. It possibly went out the window the moment I accepted the dare at Taco Bell. \u201cI did trust you.\u201d My mouth shuts and everything inside me hardens. The words taste bitter on my tongue. \u201cI told you about my brother.\u201d</p><p>Beth bites her lower lip. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret?\u201d</p><p>I nod. I really don\u2019t want to discuss Mark.</p><p>Worry lines clutter her forehead. \u201cDrunken admissions don\u2019t equate to trust.\u201d</p><p>I sigh heavily. She\u2019s right. \u201cFine. I have a game two weeks from Saturday in Louisville, but you\u2019re sitting through it. I\u2019m not budging on that requirement. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s face explodes into this radiant smile and her blue eyes shine like the sun. My insides melt. This moment is special and I don\u2019t want to let it go. I\u2019m the one that put that look there. \u201cReally?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Do I want her to come to my game? Do I want the opportunity for her to see that I\u2019m more than some stupid jock? \u201cYes. Don\u2019t play me, Beth.\u201d Because I\u2019m falling for you, more than I should, and if you betray me again, it will hurt like hell.</p><p>The smile fades and she solemnly answers, \u201cI won\u2019t. When we go into Louisville, I just need an hour to myself.\u201d</p><p>An hour. To do what? See Isaiah? I guess she could. I only asked her to date me. She\u2019d probably bolt if I said the word relationship, even though I have no interest in seeing anyone else. I went too fast with her last night.</p><p>This time, I\u2019ll go slow. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an hour alone in Louisville. Then we\u2019re going on a real date, even if it kills us.\u201d</p><p>Beth rejoins me on the steps. Her knee rests against mine and we lapse into silence.</p><p>Typically, silence with girls makes me uncomfortable, but this one doesn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have anything to say. Neither do I.</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to leave and it appears she\u2019s not ready for me to go. Beth, out of anybody, would tell me what she really wanted or thought.</p><p>She finally breaks the silence. \u201cHow do I take my name off the homecoming list? Does it require a two-thirds vote of the student population or do I have to ask someone in the front office?\u201d</p><p>Panic flickers through me. \u201cStay on the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it with me. I\u2019ll be right by your side the entire time.\u201d Putting her on the court was my way of pissing her off, but now I want her on it\u2014with me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your world. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>But it could be her world if she tried.</p><p>\u201cNothing will happen with homecoming for another month. How about this\u2014if I can find a way to completely wow you by then, you agree to stay on the court and if I can\u2019t, then I\u2019ll help you remove your name.\u201d</p><p>Silence as she contemplates. \u201cAre you asking me to dare you to wow me?\u201d</p><p>Even I see the irony. \u201cGuess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I remind you that you have a lousy track record with me in regards to dares?\u201d</p><p>I sit up straighter. \u201cI don\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>Scott knocks on the door and points at his eyes then points at me. He leaves again.</p><p>Hell. \u201cDid you come home drunk last night?\u201d</p><p>The last time Scott and I talked, we were on good terms. Something\u2019s changed.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you did leave this.\u201d Beth flips her hair over her shoulder and reveals a red-and-blue spot on her neck. Everything within me wants to disintegrate and hide beneath the porch. I gave her a hickey. I haven\u2019t done that to a girl since middle school.</p><p>\u201cHe hates me,\u201d I say.</p><p>Beth laughs. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>I PUMP MY HANDS HARDER INTO HIS CHEST and ignore the world around me. My wrists hurt, but I must keep the heart going. I must.</p><p>Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.</p><p>\u201cBreathe!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Lacy tilts the head back and blows into the mouth. The chest moves up, then back down.</p><p>Lacy begins to pull away.</p><p>\u201cNo, Lacy, check the vitals.\u201d She puts her ear near the mouth and nose. I wait. She places her fingers against the artery in the neck. I wait again. Lacy shakes her head. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I tell her. I\u2019m frightened that I won\u2019t be able to give the heart enough pressure if I go another round. Lacy scrambles toward his chest and I slide my body near the head.</p><p>She counts out loud with each compression.</p><p>A long beeping noise comes from the team next to us. \u201cFlat line,\u201d says Mr. Knox.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Chris. \u201cThis is ours!\u201d</p><p>Of our entire health class, it\u2019s down to me and Lacy against the combo of Ryan and Chris.</p><p>With his hands clasped together, Ryan pumps his dummy\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cBreathe!\u201d says Lacy.</p><p>I blow air into the mouth, check vitals, and freeze. With my fingers against the neck, I feel something. It\u2019s faint, but there. Lacy gestures for me to pump, but I shake my head. Our dummy\u2014he\u2019s alive!</p><p>The boys start compressions again and a wretched noise blares from their machine. Mr. Knox unplugs it. \u201cYou boys forgot to check vitals.\u201d</p><p>Chris swears and Ryan falls onto his ass.</p><p>Suck it up, boys. Get used to losing.</p><p>Mr. Knox glances my way.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Lacy and Beth. You\u2019re the only two who kept your patient alive. Good call on the vitals, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Good call on the vitals. Mr. Knox walks away as if this isn\u2019t the most amazing moment of my life. I did something. I saved a life. Well, not really, but I saved the dummy. But I did something right. This unspeakable, overwhelming sense of...I don\u2019t know...I\u2019ve not experienced it before...this feeling of...joy? Anyhow...it floods me. Every part of me.</p><p>I\u2014Beth Risk\u2014did something good.</p><p>Lacy points at Chris, then at Logan standing over his dead dummy. \u201cWe won.\u201d In her sitting position she moves her shoulders in a crazy little dance. \u201cWe won. We won. We won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour girl is a sore winner.\u201d Logan edges closer to us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda hot though,\u201d says Chris. \u201cNow that you experienced the rush, are you going to take on more dares from us, baby?\u201d</p><p>Lacy laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t take the dare. Beth did.\u201d</p><p>Logan and Chris nod at me in appreciation. I shrug in return. For the past week, we\u2019ve been feeling each other out. Lacy talks to me. Ryan talks to me. Sometimes, I talk back. On Monday, I caved to their brow-beating and began sitting with them at lunch. When Ryan\u2019s feeling bold, he takes my hand. When I\u2019m feeling bolder, I hold his hand back.</p><p>At the mention of the dare, I fish a black marker out of my pack. Ryan\u2019s last words before we started CPR were that Lacy and I couldn\u2019t hold out; that we were too weak to outlast the combination of him and Chris. I write the four most beautiful letters on my palm and turn it for Ryan to see: can\u2019t.</p><p>As he leans against the wall, that brilliant smile spreads across Ryan\u2019s face and he shakes his head. Warm fuzzies race through my bloodstream. I love that smile. Maybe a little too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wowed,\u201d I say to him. It\u2019s been four days since our agreement and Ryan\u2019s done nothing to \u201cwow\u201d me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile turns cocky and, I have to admit, I like that smile too. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ISLAND, Scott watches as I scoop another spoonful of Lucky Charms into my mouth. I talk through the crunches. \u201cAnd then I felt a pulse and Lacy thought we should pump again and I shook my head no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d asks Scott.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m going to burst out of my skin.</p> <p>\u201cWe won. I mean, we saved the dummy and Mr. Knox said I did good.\u201d I did something right. I still can\u2019t get over it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. Isn\u2019t it, Allison?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock at night. Allison sits at the opposite end of the bar and doesn\u2019t bother glancing up from the latest toy Scott bought her last week: an e-reader. \u201cFantastic,\u201d she echoes in a voice that tells me she doesn\u2019t actually think so.</p><p>Shoving another spoonful of cereal into my mouth keeps me from muttering my exact thoughts. I should have waited to tell Scott the story over breakfast, when it\u2019s just the two of us, but I was too excited.</p><p>\u201cIs that what it\u2019s like to be a nurse?\u201d I ask Scott. \u201cTo feel all powerful and in control.\u201d</p> <p>And to have someone tell me that I did good?</p><p>My mind races with the possibilities. Maybe I could be a nurse. Blood doesn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>Neither does puke. Too worked up to sit still, I drum my hands on the counter\u2014I could really do this.</p><p>\u201cYou need to excel at science to be a nurse,\u201d says Allison in her bored voice. \u201cAnd your grades on your last progress report suggest that might be a problem for you.\u201d</p><p>My face reddens as if she slapped me. I wish I could think of something wittier, but at times, the plain truth is good enough. \u201cYou really are a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Elisabeth,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd Allison, her grades are improving.\u201d</p> <p>Well, screw me, Scott reprimanded the wench. Huh. Allison tears her eyes from the e-reader. I could bask in the glory of this moment, but I decided weeks ago that she\u2019s not worth my time. I turn to Scott. Daydreaming is over. I have real problems. \u201cI need black hair dye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Scott asks.</p><p>Is he blind? I shake my hair and lower my head so he can see my roots. My roots. The blond pokes out from my jet-black hair like annoying rays of sun. I flip my hair back over my shoulder. \u201cWill you buy me some?\u201d</p><p>If I buy anything with the cash Isaiah gave me, Scott would be all over me like flies to crap. I\u2019m not ready to tip my hand that I have cash. Besides, he\u2019s always wanting to do something for me\u2014now he can.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says.</p><p>Um...did I misunderstand him? \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a blonde.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s who you are. Why do you have to change something so beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo only blondes are beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Scott closes his eyes. \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen buy me the dye.\u201d</p><p>He reopens them and studies me during one of his patented long silences. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you something that will match your original hair color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be blond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a good reason why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>I purposefully gawk at Allison. \u201cI hate blondes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not good enough.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest and redirect my gaze to him. I can also do long silences.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Elisabeth? You want to have black hair. Just because. You have no reason. You want what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I don\u2019t like his tone or the way his blue eyes look right through me.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first dye it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cEighth grade.\u201d My instincts yell at me to run.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>My throat becomes tight and I glance away.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause why, Elisabeth?\u201d</p><p>Because one of Mom\u2019s boyfriends thought I was her in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Scott keeps staring right through me. \u201cTell me why you dyed your hair.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah knows. I told him once when I was too high to keep secrets. Mom\u2019s boyfriend stumbled out of our only bedroom in the middle of the night. He sat on the floor next to where I slept on the couch. He lifted my hand, kissed it, and called me my mother\u2019s name. He smacked me when I screamed and he smacked me again when he realized I wasn\u2019t my mother.</p><p>The memories rush forward and I can\u2019t shove them away. They need to go away. I need someone to ground me. I need someone to erase the bad memories. I haven\u2019t forgiven Isaiah yet for betraying me. I haven\u2019t talked to him in weeks and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to.</p><p>Even if there wasn\u2019t our recent past between us, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d want Isaiah. For some reason, I crave someone else...and that scares me, and being scared only gives power to the memories.</p><p>In my head, I can hear the bastard\u2019s voice. I can feel the bastard\u2019s touch. My fingers claw at my head. Get out, get out, get out! I stand so abruptly the stool wobbles, then crashes to the floor. \u201cFuck you, Scott. I\u2019ll buy the dye myself.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>...and George looked at the girl with new eyes. No\u2014not with new eyes, but maybe with eyes he had possessed in another life. With eyes that belonged not to his head, but to his heart. Her smile caressed him as if her fingers had slid up his arm. She constantly amazed him\u2014a human willingly befriending a zombie. The opposite of him somehow gave this horrifying new life meaning. But what really amazed George was that she granted him the grace of a second chance.</p><p>Pleased with myself, I lean back in the chair and fold my hands over my stomach. Turns out George\u2019s life was more confusing than he could have imagined. First he wakes up a zombie. Then he discovers that the other zombies expect him to be a leader, and then he shocks himself by loving his newfound power.</p><p>And then comes the girl.</p><p>Girls always complicate things. My lips turn up as I think of Beth. Yeah they do, but in a good way.</p><p>My phone vibrates and I glance at the caller ID. It\u2019s an unknown number so I let it go to voice mail. Seconds later the phone chimes, telling me I have a text. I grab the phone and smile: Friends, right?\u2014Beth</p><p>Me: Yes</p><p>\u201cThen let me in.\u201d Beth\u2019s sexy voice drifts from the other side of my open window.</p><p>I check the clock\u2014eleven. Mom and Dad would be in bed. To be safe, I lock the door to my bedroom before I raise the pane and pop the screen out. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Beth swings one leg into my room, followed by the other, with such ease that I believe she\u2019s done this before. \u201cI got bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have called.\u201d Popping the screen in isn\u2019t nearly as easy as popping it out.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Beth assesses my room. She picks up a baseball on my dresser, tosses it into the air, and barely makes the catch. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called thirty seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>She drops the ball back onto my dresser.</p><p>\u201cBut I did call.\u201d</p><p>The reality of the moment smacks me when she leans over and taps the lava lamp that stopped working a year ago. Her smooth skin and tattoo peek out when her top rides up. I inhale and focus on anything but touching her.</p><p>\u201cDoes your uncle know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beth walks over to the computer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA creative writing assignment.\u201d</p><p>She pinches her lips as her head falls back.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Do we have one? When is it due? Ah hell, Scott is going to rip me on this. And here I thought I was finally keeping up.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Until now, I didn\u2019t have to tell anyone.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a class assignment. It\u2019s something...extra...yeah. Something Mrs. Rowe asked me to do.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s shoulders relax like she received a pardon from a death sentence. \u201cCan I read it?\u201d</p><p>Besides my teacher, no one\u2019s asked to read my stuff before and I pause...long enough that Beth raises her eyebrows. If anyone\u2019s going to read this, I\u2019d prefer it to be her. Something tells me she\u2019d understand. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrint it out for me.\u201d Beth plops on my bed and curls up around the pillows.</p><p>Her blue eyes survey me as she teases me with a slumberous look. My jeans get tight and I want to join her on the bed, badly, but I\u2019ll show restraint even though she\u2019s going to kill me in the process. \u201cPlan on staying for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have other plans?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep soon. We do have school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shared a bed way smaller than this for the past two years. Trust me, I\u2019m the queen of not touching if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about. Go on, print it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot touching and sharing with who?\u201d</p><p>Beth chuckles and shakes her head at the same time. \u201cJealous much? I think you were printing something out for me.\u201d</p><p>Just go with it, Ryan. Like other predators, Beth can smell fear. Without another word, I print out the pages and she snatches them from my hand. I stare at her. She stares at me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to read it with you watching me.</p><p>That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my room, Beth. You walked a half mile to get here. On a Wednesday. In the middle of the night. Uninvited.\u201d I should define for her what weird is.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t. Somehow nothing has ever felt more right.</p><p>That evil smile slips onto her face. \u201cAm I the first girl to be in your bed?\u201d</p><p>Yes. I take a deep breath and return to the computer. I\u2019ve dated girls. Been exclusive with a few and I\u2019ve been respectful enough to proceed slowly to each base. There are some bases I have yet to reach. A girl in my bed being one of them. If she\u2019s determined to be here, I\u2019m determined to be okay with it and not let the nerves show. I guess my zombie found a girl he likes and wants to throttle at the same time.</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS GOOD, RYAN.\u201d Beth\u2019s distant voice snaps me out of the story and my hands stop tapping on the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. Beth lies on her stomach, propped up on her elbows. Her cleavage is beautifully exposed. My eyes avert to the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. It\u2019s good. Like this could be in a bookstore good. I totally get this guy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, so do I. \u201cI finaled in a state writing competition.\u201d The words come out naturally, as if I normally tell the world this sort of thing.</p><p>Beth flips through the pages. \u201cI can see why.</p><p>Whoever judged the winner must have been on meth not to choose you.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the room, waiting for the lightning to hit. Did she pay me a compliment?</p><p>\u201cThe winner hasn\u2019t been announced. There\u2019s another round of competition in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><p>My stomach hollows out as I turn off my computer. Yeah, I\u2019m writing the short story, but I still haven\u2019t signed up for the competition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How can I?

Would the rush of winning the writing competition be the same as winning a baseball game or a dare?</p><p>Guess I\u2019ll never know.</p><p>When I turn back, Beth is stretched out on her back with her head against the pillows.</p> <p>She\u2019s kicked her shoes off and folded her hands on her stomach. The belly button ring sparkles in the light. She stacked my story neatly on the bedside table.</p><p>We\u2019re dating. Friends who are dating and who will eventually kiss. Four days could be considered eventually...yeah, I\u2019m not stupid enough to believe that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d I say, giving her the opportunity to leave.</p><p>\u201cDo you normally sleep in all your clothes?\u201d she asks.</p><p>No. I usually take off my shirt. \u201cThis is safer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I flip off the light and climb into bed.</p><p>Taking a cue from Beth, I stay on top of the covers. The heat from her body warms mine.</p><p>She\u2019s right. She can lie in bed without touching. I inhale and her sweet scent envelops me.</p><p>Last year, our science teacher dispelled the myth that sex crosses the minds of guys every seven seconds. I\u2019m going to have to disagree with him on that. My fingers itch with the need to caress Beth\u2019s soft skin. I want my lips whispering against hers.</p><p>\u201cSo, I have this friend,\u201d she says into the darkness. \u201cIsaiah. You\u2019ve met him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My muscles tense and the images of her body moving against mine disappear. I understand that dating means I\u2019m leaving open the possibility that she can see other guys, but I\u2019m not fond of her discussing said guys while she\u2019s lying in my bed.</p><p>\u201cHe betrayed me and I don\u2019t know what to do. In Louisville, he was the only friend I had and when I came here he bought me my phone.</p><p>We talked every night or texted or both and he still calls every day and texts me a million times. I refuse to answer him and I think our friendship is over and then I talked to Scott tonight and the conversation didn\u2019t go as I planned and I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>My skin prickles. It\u2019s more than Beth being so close to me. It\u2019s more than the need and attraction raging in my body. Beth is on the verge of telling me something. On the verge of stepping outside her wall. I urge her on. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was so much easier in Louisville,\u201d she says softly. The sadness in her voice is hard to miss. \u201cI miss easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my game, I\u2019ll drop you off.\u201d I hate the thought of it, but I\u2019m determined to win her over. \u201cThen afterwards, we\u2019ll go to dinner and then maybe a movie. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I hear her swallow. \u201cI think I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>I inhale. The clean, full intake of air feels as if it\u2019s the first breath I\u2019ve taken in days.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she says, then pauses. It\u2019s a heavy pause and her struggle for words makes me want to comfort her. \u201cSometimes I just want...\u201d</p><p>What does she want? I know what I want: for her to trust me, for her to feel what I feel.</p><p>But what I really want right now is for her to be okay. I extend my arm across the bed in Beth\u2019s direction, careful not to touch her. \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>One heartbeat. Another. Beth stays so perfectly still in the darkness that part of me wonders if this entire evening was a dream.</p><p>Her body scratches against the comforter as she moves. One inch in my direction. A hesitation. Then another inch. My blood tingles with anticipation. This moment is huge\u2014no doubt. I\u2019m asking her to lean on me and Beth is actually considering it.</p><p>Come on, Beth, you can trust me. Finally, in a swift movement, she lays her head on my chest and curls the rest of her body around me.</p><p>Needs slams into me and if her hand shifts down three inches, she\u2019ll know. I want to touch her, but do I dare? Her breath tickles my chest as she whispers, \u201cI like you, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and celebrate the words. She likes me. \u201cI like you too.\u201d A lot.</p><p>I want her, but I refuse to let my lower body make the decisions. Slowly, purposefully, I wrap one arm around her and lay my other hand on my stomach right next to hers. This is my best attempt at friends-who-date touching.</p><p>Parts of me want to caress the warm blush that appears on her beautiful skin when I look at her with desire. Those same parts imagine me placing a hand on her chin and tilting her head up so I can kiss her. Those parts are currently trying to talk \u201clogic\u201d to my brain.</p><p>Kissing could be good. I loved kissing her full lips and I loved her soft moans. I could kiss her until she forgets Isaiah. I could kiss her until I forget that I\u2019m a virgin. My grip on her shoulder tightens. She\u2019s killing me. I\u2019m killing myself. \u201cSandy Koufax was left-handed like you. He was the youngest pitcher inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possibly the most screwed-up thing I\u2019ve ever heard you say,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>True, but it keeps my mind off kissing her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one that talks in code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me there.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s body relaxes and molds into mine.</p><p>The silence stretches from seconds to minutes to longer and I wonder if she fell asleep. Part of me wishes I could sleep. Then I wouldn\u2019t fantasize about touching her or kissing her or touching her some more. But then I also want to stay awake. I like this\u2014holding her.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay? I set your alarm for four so I\u2019ll be back before Scott misses me.\u201d</p><p>I absently rub my hand up and down her back and she shifts closer to me. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Beth nuzzles her head against my chest like a cat curling into a ball for sleep. Her arm presses into me and I let myself cheat for one second when I bunch her hair in my hand and kiss the top of her head. I could tell myself that friends who date do this, but it\u2019s way too late and I\u2019m way too tired for lying.</p><p>Beth</p><p>THIRTY MINUTES OF observing Ryan squirm on the couch across from Scott was enough to atone for allowing Ryan to drag me to the marathon game at the ballpark. Scott finally let me go with Ryan only after he threatened to kill Ryan if he returned me with any marks on my body.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever admit it to Ryan, but this has been my best Saturday since being sentenced to hell. On the drive into Louisville, Ryan explained baseball. Most of it I knew, but Ryan somehow made it interesting. The sport came alive when he described a game that\u2019s more than a bat and a ball and some bases. He said it involved teamwork and trust.</p><p>As I sit on the bleachers and watch the game, I appreciate the gracefulness of his team\u2019s movements. A network of signals and glances and unsaid understandings.</p><p>What I really find amazing is Ryan. The raw intensity in the way he moves. The strength of his broad shoulders and the power that explodes from his body when he throws the ball. Ryan is a force all his own. A force that pulls me in. An attraction that curls warmth into my body. He possesses a simple touch that\u2019s strong enough to hold me together yet soft enough to make me shiver.</p><p>We\u2019re friends. Just friends. I sigh. Even as a friend, he deserves better than me. He seems hell-bent on liking me. Hell-bent on dating me.</p><p>Why? What does he gain by being with a girl that everyone else has thrown away?</p><p>Chris pops a ball into left field and the other team catches it for the third out. Ryan stands in the dugout and winks at me before taking the field. My answering smile forms in spite of myself. You\u2019re setting yourself up for a world of hurt, Beth. Like when I set myself up with Luke at fifteen. Luke called me pretty. Luke said all the right words. Then again, Luke never brought me to a place as public as this.</p><p>Maybe Scott is right. I have a clean slate.</p><p>Maybe I should take advantage of it. Maybe I should enjoy the ride while it lasts. After all, I\u2019ll be leaving with Mom soon. Each day that she remains with Trent is one day closer to her death. Today, after the game, Mom and I will work out a plan to leave, but until then, maybe I should enjoy what\u2019s in front of me.</p><p>Ryan likes me or at least he thinks he does.</p><p>Why am I in such a rush to move on to the next guy who\u2019ll treat me like Luke did or the way Trent treats Mom?</p><p>I can be the girl who shows Ryan a few things. The girl who doesn\u2019t laugh when he blushes. I can be the girl who, in the future, when he\u2019s been married to the good girl and has three babies clinging to his leg, he can remember and smile at the memories. Then</p><p>he\u2019ll look at his wife and be grateful I left when I did. Grateful he didn\u2019t end up with me.</p><p>\u201cAre you Ryan\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d A tall guy plops next to me on the bleachers and watches as Ryan throws the ball. This dude is close.</p><p>Super close. Not touching close, but he has broken the unspoken barrier of how close complete strangers should be to each other.</p><p>The skin on my arm prickles. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>He turns his head and gives me a smile that reminds me of Ryan\u2019s. In fact, he looks a lot like Ryan, just a little older. \u201cMark. I\u2019m his older brother.\u201d</p><p>Hello. Could this be the brother Ryan was all torn up over in the barn? But curiosity gives way to nerves. I\u2019ve never met a guy\u2019s family and I don\u2019t know a thing about etiquette. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d There, isn\u2019t that what proper girls say?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019ve seen worms on hooks happier than you.\u201d</p><p>My lips twist up. \u201cI\u2019m Beth and we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Friends who are dating, but I don\u2019t need to broadcast my insecurities.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he drawls. \u201cRyan doesn\u2019t bring friends to games. He calls people distractions.\u201d</p><p>Not sure how to respond, I focus on the game. Mark lowers his voice. \u201cAm I making you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>I might as well be honest. It\u2019s not like I could pass as respectable for long. \u201cGuys who invade my personal space generally make me uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t blame you. Ryan has space issues too. Must be genetic.\u201d</p><p>Mark laughs and it\u2019s a boisterous laughter that causes people to stare\u2014even Ryan from the mound. Ryan\u2019s eyes flicker between his brother and me. A shadow crosses his face as he focuses on Mark. Not liking the hurt he\u2019s wearing, I give him a halfhearted wave and he gives me his heart-stopping smile in return.</p><p>Heat creeps along the back of my neck and marks my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Mark. \u201cYou two are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your opinion,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Mark laughs again, but not as loudly. \u201cMy mother must hate you.\u201d</p><p>I should be insulted, but I\u2019m not. If she ever met me, she probably would. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>Mark gestures to the scoreboard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few more innings to rectify that. So, tell me, how did you meet my brother?\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>UNLACING MY CLEATS, I STARE at the bleachers.</p><p>Mark is here and he\u2019s talking to Beth. Actually, he\u2019s laughing with Beth. Jealousy lurches inside me and I\u2019m pissed at both of them. I\u2019ve texted and called Mark for months and I got shit. Beth smiles once and he\u2019s rattling like he\u2019s on a talk show. And to top it all off, Mark\u2019s talked to her for a whole twenty minutes and Beth\u2019s already laughing. It took me weeks to get her to laugh with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slam my cleat against the bench to knock the dirt off. Mark is my brother, therefore he wouldn\u2019t steal my girl. Not to mention that he likes men. Several of the guys glance at me when I hammer my cleat against the bench again. Logan raises a brow. I shake my head to stop him from speaking to me.</p><p>Resting my arms on my knees, I try to suck it up. Beth\u2019s not really my girl. We\u2019re just friends who date because I screwed everything up with her from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d Coach waves me over to him. I shove my feet into my Nikes and toss my bag over my shoulder. He probably has plenty to say to me. I pulled the game out, but I cost us two runs in the last inning. Mark and Beth\u2019s friendly interaction distracted me.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Coach nods to a man in his thirties and a woman standing next to him. They\u2019re dressed in Sunday casual\u2014jeans and nice shirts. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Pete Carson and his wife, Vickie.\u201d</p><p>I shake the extended hands\u2014Mr. Carson first, then his wife. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete is a scout with the University of Louisville.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Coach and try to keep the surprise off my face. He knows how Dad and I feel about playing pro ball after I graduate. Mr. Carson clears his throat. \u201cRyan, I\u2019ve been scouting for the early draft and your name is the one on everyone\u2019s lips. I was wondering if you\u2019ve given any thought to our school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I plan on joining the pro draft after graduation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a waste.\u201d The words rush out of his wife\u2019s mouth. The three of us look at her and she laughs nervously. \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s the truth. I should introduce myself appropriately\u2014I\u2019m Dr. Carson, dean of the English Department at Spalding University.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d A very un-grammatically-correct response. Why do I feel cornered?</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rowe, your English teacher, is a good friend of mine. She\u2019s shown me some of your writing. You\u2019re very talented. Both on the field and off. Spalding University offers a wonderful course study in Creative Writing and many of our students go on to pursue their master\u2019s in Fine Arts....\u201d</p><p>Mr. Carson puts his hand on his wife\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re recruiting him. I thought I won the coin toss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t talking fast enough.\u201d She pats the hand he just placed on her. \u201cSpalding has a baseball team too.\u201d</p> <p>I fake laugh because everyone else does, but my uneasiness builds. Standing here listening to them makes me feel like I\u2019m betraying my father.</p><p>Mr. Carson lets go of his wife. \u201cSpalding is a Division Three school. The University of Louisville is Division One. Several of our players went on to be drafted into the pros. You have talent that can\u2019t be taught, but you\u2019ve got some tells on your pitches and some issues with your placement. My coaches can work with you and take your pitches to another level.</p><p>We\u2019ll prepare you for the pros plus you\u2019ll be walking away with a degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you offering me a scholarship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpalding will,\u201d says Mrs. Carson. She smiles unrepentantly when her husband grimaces.</p><p>Mr. Carson exchanges a wary look with Coach. \u201cI need to know if you\u2019re interested. I have room for a pitcher on my team and I\u2019m looking to offer a scholarship to someone during the early signing period in November.\u201d</p><p>November, which means if I want to go to college, I have a little more than a month to decide. No pressure. Mr. and Mrs. Carson describe college life while I pretend to listen.</p><p>What will Dad say if he finds out? They both hand me cards, to Mr. Carson\u2019s dismay, and say their goodbyes, leaving me and Coach alone.</p> <p>I wait for the Carsons to be out of earshot before I ask the question bugging me. \u201cHave you been talking to Mrs. Rowe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked last month. I think it\u2019s in your best interests to explore all of your options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can make pros?\u201d This is the man who has encouraged me almost as much as my dad.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI believe you can, but I also know that your father isn\u2019t presenting you with everything on the table. Your father\u2019s a good man, but I consider you one of my own sons and I wouldn\u2019t be helping you if I didn\u2019t make that introduction.\u201d</p><p>My world tips. Coach and Dad have always seen eye-to-eye. Why the change? \u201cI\u2019m not doing the writing competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Coach says with an exasperated sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later. You have company.\u201d His gaze wanders over my shoulder and dread settles in my gut.</p><p>Mark waits for me at the bottom of the bleachers while Beth remains in her seat at the top. I make a sweep of the area to be sure no one from town is around to see this reunion.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mark says. \u201cYou played a hell of a game.\u201d</p><p>I inhale deeply, attempting to find a center.</p><p>Mark left. Dad looked him straight in the eye and asked him to choose. My brother didn\u2019t choose me. I asked him to stay and fight and he didn\u2019t. I asked him to come home and he didn\u2019t. And now he thinks he can show up here and everything will be fine. Guess what? It\u2019s not fine. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Mark plays linebacker for the University of Kentucky. In his freshman year, he gained twenty-five pounds of muscle. He\u2019s a big son-of-a-bitch. \u201cI want to talk, Ry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your silence since this summer said everything.\u201d I walk past him and gesture for Beth to come off the bleachers.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to contact you, but each time I tried I couldn\u2019t. I kept thinking about Mom and Dad and I needed space.\u201d</p><p>Space. Why didn\u2019t he just knee me in the groin? I throw out my arms. \u201cYou got what you wanted, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Mark says loud enough for the few remaining spectators to hear.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I keep walking. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>In lethargic steady strides, Beth\u2019s feet plunk against the metal of the bleachers as she wanders down. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go. You need an hour, remember? And then we\u2019re going out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have time. Go talk to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Beth.\u201d Mark responds for me in a tone that indicates an apology. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got a chance to meet you. Don\u2019t let Groveton smother you to death.\u201d</p><p>She gives him one of her rare genuine smiles and I want to hit something\u2014hard. \u201cGood luck with your game next week.\u201d</p><p>Mark shoves his hands into his jeans as he leaves. \u201cYou know where to find me when you\u2019re ready, Ry.\u201d</p><p>Beth watches him until he\u2019s out of sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d I stalk off to the parking lot and toss my stuff into the Jeep.</p><p>Beth slams her passenger door shut and I answer her anger by slamming my own. \u201cTell me where I\u2019m supposed to be taking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strip mall a half mile before your pitching facility.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks. That place is a step above ghetto. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your approval. You made a deal with me. It\u2019s your decision if you want to keep it.\u201d Her frozen blue eyes pierce into me.</p><p>I yank hard on the bill of my hat and peel out onto the main road. She\u2019s angry. I\u2019m angry.</p><p>We stay silent as I drive the thirty minutes to the other side of town. There\u2019s enough electricity in the air to propel the car without gas. One word from either of us could cause an explosion.</p><p>Beth obviously likes playing with fire. \u201cIs your brother one of those guys that can be awesome to strangers, then turn into a complete dick in private? Did he piss in your Cheerios every morning before you went to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I grit out. \u201cHe was a great brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is wrong with you? He said you guys haven\u2019t talked in three months and that he was here to see you. What\u2019s so damned important that you couldn\u2019t take three seconds out of your day to say hi?\u201d</p><p>I turn on the radio. She turns it off. I pound my hand against the wheel. \u201cI thought you were in a hurry for your one hour of freedom in Louisville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting fifteen minutes so you can talk to your brother isn\u2019t going to ruin my one hour.</p><p>Let\u2019s try this again. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>Beth blinks. \u201cYou already told me that.</p><p>Catch me up on the you being an asshole part.\u201d</p><p>I am not an asshole. The whole reason for this day was for her to see that I\u2019m not an asshole. \u201cHe left, okay? He left and he\u2019s made it clear he\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>She angles her body toward me. \u201cTell me that\u2019s a self-imposed decision Mark made.\u201d</p><p>Beth doesn\u2019t tell me squat about her family, yet she expects perfection from mine. \u201cMy dad threw him out and Mark didn\u2019t even try to see what would happen if he attempted to stay. Are you happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. So your dad\u2019s a homophobic bastard.</p><p>What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p><p>The anger bursts out of me. \u201cWhat did you expect me to do? Go against my dad? He told me and Mom that we weren\u2019t allowed to talk to him anymore. He\u2019s my dad, Beth. What would you have done?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother telling her that I tried reaching out to him or that Mark didn\u2019t respond to me...until now. Now when it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cGrown a pair of balls, that\u2019s what I would have done. God, Ryan, you are an asshole. Your brother is gay and you toss him out of your life because you\u2019re too much of a pansy to stand up to your father.\u201d</p><p>I pull into the strip mall and park in the back of the lot. This place is a shithole. Down by the Laundromat, a guy in a wife-beater screams at a girl with bleached-blond hair holding a diaper-clad baby on her hip. Guys my age smoke cigarettes while purposely skateboarding into girls coming in and out of the stores. Someone needs to teach them respect.</p><p>Beth hops out of the Jeep. Her hair blows in the breeze behind her as she strides toward the shopping center. Why is this girl always walking away from me? I jump out after her, catch her hand, and turn her to face me. I thought I pissed Beth off by nominating her to homecoming court. The fire blazing out of her eyes tells me this anger is on a completely different level. She needs to hear me out and understand my dad\u2014to understand my family.</p><p>\u201cMark abandoned us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You abandoned him.\u201d She rams a finger into my chest. \u201cYou and me. We\u2019re a mistake. You\u2019re a leaver. My father left me, Saint Scott left me, and I will never be left again.\u201d</p><p>Yet Beth is the one who leaves. She retreats to the shopping plaza and disappears into the grocery store. She told me on the way into Louisville to drop her off and come back for her later. I never intended to let Beth walk away, but her words rock me. Is she right? Did I abandon Mark?</p><p>Beth</p><p>I CUT IN THE SUPERMARKET, duck back out, and beeline it for the Last Stop, avoiding the group of skateboarders. I\u2019m careful, guarding Echo\u2019s money that burns the back pocket of my jeans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More pickpockets hang here than people with high school diplomas.</p><p>Denny slaps his hand on the counter when I step into the bar. \u201cGet out, kid.\u201d</p><p>Pool balls click against each other as a guy in jeans and a leather vest plays solo. Two older men in blue factory uniforms slouch over beers at the bar. My heart drains of any shred of hope I had gained in Groveton when I see the blond-haired mess at the table in the corner.</p><p>Holding myself proud, I glide to the bar.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever Isaiah is paying you, I\u2019ll pay you double to keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles darkly. \u201cThat\u2019s the same offer he gave me concerning you. Go play with your boyfriend and stay out of my bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah isn\u2019t my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Wearing a smart-ass smile, Denny grabs a wet shot glass out of a tub and dries it with a towel. \u201cHave you told him that?\u201d</p><p>When I say nothing back, Denny gestures to Mom. \u201cShe\u2019s been crying today. Trent was arrested by the cops last night for drunk driving and they impounded her car. Get her out and spend some time with her.\u201d</p> <p>Yay and damn. Without Isaiah on board, I need a car and Mom\u2019s piece of crap is our only way out of Louisville. On the rare good side, I don\u2019t have to worry about Trent beating the shit out of either one of us today.</p><p>\u201cNext time you come into my bar, I\u2019m calling Isaiah to drag you back out,\u201d Denny says. \u201cEven if she\u2019s crying.\u201d</p><p>Next to a half-empty bottle of tequila,</p><p>Mom\u2019s head lies in her folded arms. She\u2019s thinner. The rush of emotions creates a light-headed sensation. This poor, pathetic creature is my mom and I\u2019ve completely failed her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t stir. I sweep the hair from her face. Several of the strands fall to the floor and stick to my hand. God, has she eaten at all?</p> <p>Yellow-and-brown patches litter the left side of her face. On her right wrist, Mom wears a black brace. I nudge her with a tender touch.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flutter open and her hollow blue eyes have a sunken quality. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Mom reaches out as if I\u2019m a ghost. Her fingertips barely brush my leg before her arm drops to her side. \u201cAre you a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>With her head still on her arms, she surveys me. \u201cYou used to buy food for me and make it, didn\u2019t you? Ham and cheese on white with mustard tucked in the fridge. That was you.\u201d</p><p>My insides wither like a plant without water.</p> <p>Who did she think took care of her? I close my eyes and search for my perspective. Being at Scott\u2019s has made me soft. I need to be more aware for both me and Mom. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I place an arm around her shoulder blades and yank at her body. \u201cCome on. You need to stand. I can\u2019t drag you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you yell, Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t yell.\u201d But I\u2019m being a bitch.</p><p>Like most toddlers, Mom obeys a strong reprimand. Also like most toddlers, she often obeys the wrong person.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d she mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re always angry.\u201d</p><p>Even with me holding her up, she still sways from side to side. The door to the back room is shut. Hell. This means we\u2019ll have to go out the front. Baby steps are a struggle for her and I calculate how long it will take me to get her home at this rate. So many things to do before I meet Ryan\u2014grocery shop, figure out how to get the car out of impoundment, and nail down the date to leave.</p><p>Mom stumbles when we meet daylight. She tries to shield her eyes, but it affects her already fragile balance and I have to use both of my hands to keep her upright. She\u2019s right. I am always angry, because right now a volcano is stewing inside of me. \u201cWhat else are you taking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she says too quickly.</p><p>Right. Nothing. \u201cThat bottle of tequila wasn\u2019t empty. Are you becoming a lightweight?\u201d</p><p>She says nothing and I let it go, reminding myself that there are things better left unknown. I drag her forward and occasionally she lifts her feet to help with the progression on the sidewalk. Several guys I used to go to school with fly past on skateboards. Two whistle at me and ask if I\u2019m back to stay. The other...</p><p>He flips up his skateboard and takes a ten-dollar bill from his pocket. \u201cRun out of money again, Sky? I\u2019ll take a blow right now.\u201d</p><p>Shame heats my face, but I force myself to stand taller as I haul my mother toward her home. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed seeing you around, Beth, but your mom\u2019s more fun without you babysitting.\u201d He drops the board and rolls away. Yes, being at Scott\u2019s has softened me and it makes this experience a million times worse.</p><p>I wish Scott would have left me alone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move to Florida.\u201d We slowly pass the pawnshop. \u201cWhite sandy beaches. Warm air.</p><p>The sound of water lapping against the shore.\u201d</p><p>My mom\u2019s not a whore. She\u2019s not. Please God, please let her not be. \u201cWe\u2019ll sober you up and we\u2019ll get jobs....\u201d Doing? \u201cSomething.\u201d</p><p>Because Scott has custody of me we\u2019ll have to be careful. I\u2019ll be labeled a runaway. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the ocean. Give me a date and we\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to bail Trent out first,\u201d Mom whispers. \u201cThen unpound the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck Trent. Let him rot in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Mom pulls on my hair to stay upright and the pain makes me want to scream.</p><p>Instead, I bite my lip. Screaming will draw more attention to us.</p><p>We reach the end of the sidewalk. Mom falls forward when she misses the step, and collapses onto the pavement. \u201cCome on,</p><p>Mom!\u201d I want nothing more than to sit on the ground and cry, but I can\u2019t. Not with people watching. Not with Mom right here. \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her.\u201d The deep, smooth voice causes my heart to still and my lungs to freeze.</p><p>Isaiah effortlessly scoops my mother into his arms. Without waiting for me, he heads right for Mom\u2019s apartment building.</p><p>Isaiah.</p><p>I blink.</p><p>My best friend.</p><p>My heart beats twice and both beats hurt.</p><p>Mom slips in and out of coherence as Isaiah carries her. When we reach her door, I slide the string of keys I used to wear as a necklace in elementary school from around Mom\u2019s neck.</p><p>I briefly catch Isaiah\u2019s gaze and I cower from the pain in his eyes. He wears his uniform shirt for the garage he works at. Grease and oil stain the blue material. Every day for three weeks, Isaiah has texted and called and I haven\u2019t answered him. I bury the guilt. He\u2019s the one that betrayed me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about not responding to him now.</p><p>A horrible rancid odor slaps me when I open the door. I\u2019m dizzy with dread. I don\u2019t want to know. I just don\u2019t. We\u2019re going to Florida.</p><p>We\u2019re running away.</p><p>Isaiah follows me in and swears. At the smell, the damage, or the trash, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Nothing has changed from the last time I was here, except the refrigerator door hangs wide open.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget to pay the cleaning lady?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah asks.</p><p>I half smile at his attempt to defuse the situation. He knows I hate for anyone else to see how Mom lives. \u201cShe only accepted cash and Mom was insistent that we use the credit cards for the frequent flyer miles.\u201d</p><p>I step over trash and broken pieces of furniture and lead Isaiah to Mom\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He gently lays her on the bed. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s helped me with Mom. When we were fourteen, Isaiah helped me pick her up from the bar. He\u2019s used to the cracks in the wall, the worn green carpeting, and the picture of me and her taped over her broken mirror.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go grocery shopping.\u201d</p><p>He gruffly nods. \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the living room.\u201d</p><p>I remove Mom\u2019s shoes from her feet and sit on the bed next to her. \u201cWake up, Mom. Tell me what happened to your hand.\u201d As if I don\u2019t already know.</p><p>Her eyes barely open and she curls into the fetal position. \u201cTrent and I had a fight. He didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>He never does. \u201cThe faster we get away from him the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. You two just don\u2019t know each other real well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough.\u201d I know he wears a ring that hurt like hell when he punched me in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving with me, right? Because if not, I can\u2019t take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I want her to say yes and say it quickly. The pause feels like someone ripping my intestines through my belly button. Finally, she speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re a gypsy.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019s high. \u201cAre you going to leave with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do we need to get the car out of impoundment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need five hundred to get Trent out of jail.\u201d</p><p>Trent can die in jail. \u201cThe car. How much to get the car out? I can\u2019t find regular rides into Louisville and I can\u2019t take care of you if we don\u2019t leave town.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cCouple hundred.\u201d</p><p>Mom begins to sing an old song Grandpa used to sing before he drank himself to sleep. I rub my forehead. We need that damn car and I need a damn plan. Mom and I should have been gone weeks ago, but Isaiah ruined that. My windows of opportunity keep closing and I\u2019m not sure how much longer Mom will last on her own.</p><p>I pull out Echo\u2019s cash and place half of it on Mom\u2019s bedside table. She stops singing and stares at the cash.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Mom. You need to sober up and get the car out of the impound lot. I also want you to pay the phone bill. We\u2019ll be leaving soon. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Mom keeps her eyes on the money. \u201cDid Scott give you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I yell and she flinches. \u201cRepeat what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>Mom produces an old stuffed animal of mine from under her pillow. \u201cI sleep with this when I miss you.\u201d</p><p>I slept with that stuffed animal every night until I turned thirteen. It\u2019s the only thing my father ever gave to me. The fact that she kept it rips me into pieces. I can\u2019t focus on that now. I need Mom to remember what she needs to do.</p><p>Her life depends on it. \u201cRepeat what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the car. Pay the phone bill.\u201d</p><p>I stand and Mom grabs my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone again. I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>The request feeds on my guilt. We all have our fears. Those things that exist in the dark corners of our mind that terrify us beyond belief. This is hers. My fear? It\u2019s leaving her. \u201cI need to buy you food. I\u2019ll make some sandwiches and put them in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she says. \u201cStay until I fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>How many nights as a child did I beg her to stay with me? I lie on the bed next to her, run my fingers through her hair, and continue the song where she left off. It\u2019s her favorite verse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One that talks about birds, freedom, and change.</p><p>I SLICE THE LAST sandwich in half and place the full plate in the fridge, along with the remains of the ham and cheese Isaiah bought while I sang Mom to sleep. Isaiah busies himself by putting the boxes of cereal and crackers in the pantry. He bought food Mom can easily fix for herself.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you punished me long enough?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah asks.</p> <p>The chains that permanently weigh me down become heavier. \u201cAre you going to sling me over your shoulder and force me to leave again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone knows Trent\u2019s in jail. The worst thing that\u2019s going to happen to you here...\u201d He glances over at the closed door of my old bedroom. \u201cMaybe I should toss you over my shoulder again. This place is no good for you, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And that is exactly why I want to leave...with my mom. A small part of me is curious as to what Isaiah knows that I don\u2019t. I could open the door to my old room and find out, but I shake away the thought. I don\u2019t want to know. I really, really don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou should go back to work,\u201d I say. He changed from his work clothes to his favorite black T-shirt and jeans, which means he intends to stick around. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for him losing a job he loves. The garage he works for is across the street from the strip mall, which explains why he reached me so quickly.</p><p>\u201cI got off an hour ago. I stuck around to bullshit and to tinker with a newer Mustang someone brought in. She\u2019s real pretty. I think even you would like her.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve missed this. Isaiah telling me about his day and his excited tone when he talks about cars. With his gray eyes, Isaiah looks me over. I\u2019ve missed him. His voice. The tattoos covering his arms. His constant, steady presence. The last is what I miss the most.</p><p>Isaiah is that one relationship I\u2019ve never had to question. The one relationship where I don\u2019t wonder if it\u2019ll change when I wake in the morning.</p><p>I take the two steps and wrap my arms around his chest. One arm at a time, Isaiah embraces me. I love the sound of his heart. So steady. So strong. For a brief few seconds, the chains lift. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Isaiah rests his head against the top of mine. One hand reaches up and cups the back of my head. His fingers graze my cheek and my spine straightens.</p><p>We\u2019ve touched many times over the past four years. All those times we touched we were high. Since my arrest, Isaiah has touched me way too much sober.</p><p>One night last year, we pushed too far when we were high. Sort of like me and Ryan.</p> <p>Unlike me and Ryan, Isaiah and I pretended it never happened. If it weren\u2019t for Ryan, I probably would have forced amnesia on our night together in the barn.</p><p>And then I remember...Isaiah told me that he loved me.</p><p>\u201cWhen we graduate, Beth, I promise I\u2019ll take you away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, knowing I\u2019ll be long gone before graduation. I slip out of his grasp and wonder if I misunderstood Isaiah. Maybe he didn\u2019t tell me he loved me. Maybe he did and once again we\u2019re ignoring things. \u201cDenny call you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he\u2019ll keep calling me. Do all of us a favor and just call me first. If you have to see your mom, let me be by your side when you do it. I\u2019ll kill Trent if he touches you again and I\u2019d rather not go to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Even though I won\u2019t call. The next time I come into Louisville, it\u2019ll be to collect Mom and leave town for good.</p><p>\u201cRico\u2019s throwing a party tonight,\u201d Isaiah continues. \u201cNoah\u2019s going to be there. I promise the two of us will have you back at your uncle\u2019s before you can be missed.\u201d</p><p>A sinking hollowness dwells in my soul. I hit Noah. \u201cIs he mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>Isaiah shakes his head. \u201cMad at himself.</p><p>Same way I am. We should have approached everything different with you, but we arrived right after Trent. Noah and I were terrified Trent was going to hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>I pull out my cell and check the time. I have five minutes to get back to Ryan. Running a hand through my hair, I consider my options. I want to see Noah and I want to spend time with Isaiah. I\u2019d like to push Ryan in front of a bus for what he did to his brother. My heart trips over itself. What I really crave is for Ryan to give me his gorgeous smile and tell me he made a terrible mistake.</p><p>What is wrong with me?</p><p>I bite my bottom lip and face Isaiah. \u201cI need to talk to Ryan first.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>BETH WALKS OUT of the shabby apartment complex, Isaiah on her heels. The same mantra circles in my brain: I\u2019m not losing Beth. I\u2019m not giving up on us.</p><p>I could have approached her earlier, but I decided to respect Beth and stick to our original plan: go shower and change at the pitching facility, then pick her up an hour later.</p><p>I modified one part of her request\u2014I\u2019m picking her up where I last saw her. An hour ago, I watched as Beth followed Isaiah into this building with a grown woman passed out in his arms.</p><p>Giving Beth her space\u2014knowing she was with him and not me\u2014was one of the hardest damn things I\u2019ve ever done. But I\u2019m going to keep Beth. Regardless of the words I say to her, she is my girl.</p><p>Beth stops when she sees me leaning against the passenger door of my Jeep. Her eyes widen and her face pales. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have dinner plans.\u201d</p><p>She blinks and Isaiah stiffens behind her. He may be looking for a fight, but I\u2019m not. \u201cCan we talk for a second, Beth?\u201d I stare at Isaiah.</p><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go only if she tells me to go.\u201d Isaiah has a cool demeanor, almost friendly, but all of it is forced.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d says Beth. \u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>From behind her, Isaiah places a hand on her shoulder, kisses the top of her head, and stares straight at me. Bile rises in my throat. The only thing keeping me from punching him is Beth\u2019s expression. Her striking eyes become too large for her face. Good girl. I like that she didn\u2019t expect a move like that from him.</p><p>Isaiah hops in an old Mustang and glares at me as he starts the engine. It turns over immediately with an angry rumble. He backs out and leaves the lot.</p><p>Beth kneads her fists against her eyes. A million questions float in my brain, but right now I\u2019m only interested in salvaging us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She slowly lowers her hands. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>That this run-down shithole is her previous life. That she doesn\u2019t trust me enough to let me help her with her problems. That I\u2019ve been stupid enough to think she was nothing more than a spoiled brat who freeloaded off her uncle. For being the ass she told me I was weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cMark was my best friend,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhen he left, I felt like he took part of me with him. When my Dad threw him out, I couldn\u2019t understand why he wouldn\u2019t stay and fight\u2014if not for him, then for me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never told anyone that before. Not even Chris or Logan. Beth\u2019s the first person to ever call me out on something so major\u2014so personal. I deserve whatever wrath will come next.</p><p>With a weighty sigh, Beth deflates to the crumbling parking curb. \u201cI get it.\u201d She looks small and lost again and my heart rips from my chest.</p><p>I sit on the curb and everything in my world becomes right when she rests her head on my shoulder. Wrapping an arm around her, I briefly close my eyes as she inches her warm body next to mine. This is where Beth belongs\u2014tucked in close to me.</p><p>\u201cYou were still an asshole to Mark,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The regret eats at my stomach. \u201cBut what do I do? It\u2019s him or my dad. The two of them have drawn battle lines. I\u2019m supposed to choose one or the other, but I need them both.\u201d</p><p>Silence. A balmy breeze dances across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mom,\u201d Beth says with the same heaviness I\u2019d heard in Scott\u2019s voice when he talked about Beth as a child. \u201cIn case you were wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t ready to push her. My fingers lightly trace her arm and I swear she presses closer to me. I\u2019d love to kiss her right now. Not the type of kiss that makes her body come alive. The type of kiss that shows her how much I care\u2014the type that involves my soul.</p><p>Beth lifts her head and I drop my arm. She needs her space and I need to learn how to give it.</p><p>\u201cWe suck at dating,\u201d she says.</p><p>I chuckle. We do suck at it. Hoping for a perfect moment, I was going to wait until after dinner to give her what I\u2019ve brought with me, but the one thing I\u2019m learning with Beth is that perfection will never happen. I shove my hand into my pocket, pull out the thin satin strip of material, and dangle it in front of her. \u201cThis is my gift to you. This is my wow.\u201d</p><p>Beth blinks once and her head slowly inclines to the left as she stares at the ribbon.</p><p>How do guys do it? How do they give gifts to the girls they have feelings for and stay sane? I want her to be wowed so she\u2019ll stay on homecoming court, but more...I want this gift to prove that I know her and that I see beyond black hair and nose rings and cut-up jeans. I see her as she really is\u2014I see Beth.</p><p>\u201cYou bought me a ribbon,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>My mouth is dry. \u201cI saw a picture of you when you were young in Scott\u2019s office and you talked about it...in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Her words were hypnotic. \u201cRibbons,\u201d she said in a whimsical voice. \u201cI still love ribbons.\u201d</p><p>In a dawdling, methodical movement, Beth holds out her wrist. \u201cPut it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy. I don\u2019t know how to put ribbons in a girl\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s lips break into a smile that\u2019s part wicked and part laughter. \u201cTie it on my wrist.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if you noticed, but I\u2019m not exactly the hair-ribbon kind of girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>As I wrap the long strip of material around her wrist and do my best to tie an acceptable knot, I suck up the courage to ask, \u201cAre you wowed?\u201d</p><p>Her pause is debilitating. \u201cYes,\u201d she says a little breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019m wowed.\u201d</p><p>Beth offers me a rare gift: blue eyes so soft I\u2019m reminded of the ocean, a smile so peaceful I think of heaven.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to dinner,\u201d I say.</p><p>Beth\u2019s expression grows too innocent. She bites her lower lip and my eyes narrow on those lips. I ache to taste them again. In the back of my mind, red flags rise, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d do anything to keep her looking at me like that forever.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she says, \u201cI have another idea.\u201d</p><p>TWO BLOCKS FROM THE STRIP MALL, we enter well-defined gang territory. I\u2019ve heard rumors about the south side of the city, but never believed them. I thought they were urban legends created by girls at sleepovers. I\u2019ve been on the main roads of this area a hundred times with my friends. I ate at the fast-food restaurants and shared sit-down meals with my parents. I never knew that behind the bright colors and manicured landscaping off the main strip sat tiny boxed houses and freeway overpasses littered with graffiti. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the front stoop, Isaiah laughs with two Latino guys, then nods to my Jeep parked on the street behind his Mustang. They stop laughing. I agree. I\u2019m not seeing an ounce of humor in this scenario. \u201cThis place is no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my friends,\u201d Beth says. \u201cScott ripped me away and I never got a chance to say goodbye. You can stay in the car. Just give me twenty minutes, thirty tops. And then we\u2019ll go out. I swear.\u201d</p><p>No way in hell is she going in there alone. I register the threat level of the neighborhood and the guys on the porch. \u201cI can\u2019t protect you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to. You said you\u2019d wait\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I cut her off. \u201cWhen you said you wanted to stop by and say goodbye to some friends. That guy is wearing gang colors.\u201d</p><p>She hits the back of her head against the seat. \u201cRyan. I\u2019m probably never going to see any of them again. Will you please just let me say goodbye?\u201d</p><p>Those words, never going to see again and goodbye, are the only reasons I\u2019m saying this.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hops out and I follow. She can live under whatever delusion she wants, but she\u2019s no safer here than I am and I\u2019ll go down swinging before anyone hurts her. We reach the front stoop and I see that Isaiah has disappeared. Is it too much to hope that he\u2019s called it a night? The inside of the house is smaller than I expected, and I expected cramped.</p> <p>The kitchen and living room are really one room put together and separated by the angle of furniture. Teenagers sit everywhere\u2014on the furniture, on the floor. Others lean against walls. A haze of smoke lingers in the room.</p><p>Cigarette smoke. Other types of smoke.</p><p>I draw the stares of most everyone, but they continue their conversations. The guys size me up. The girls\u2019 eyes wander to my chest. Some outright gawk lower. Beth entwines her hand with mine, then caresses her soft fingers against my cheek, enticing me to drop my head to hers.</p><p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t</p><p>talk and don\u2019t stare. Things will be better in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>For days, I\u2019ve dreamed of Beth being this close to me again, but right now I can only focus on the multiple sets of eyes watching our every movement. Beth turns, holds tighter to my fingers, and leads me through the living room and out the back door of the kitchen.</p> <p>Several strings of Christmas lights hang between three trees scattered in the narrow yard. A patch of grass grows in the far corner.</p><p>The rest of it is a mix of weeds and dirt. In the middle of a ring of worn lawn chairs, Isaiah talks to Noah, a redheaded girl tucked close to Noah, and one of the Latino guys from the stoop.</p><p>Noah breaks from the group when he sees Beth. She releases me and falls into his waiting arms. They whisper to one another. I don\u2019t like how he holds on to her and don\u2019t like how long he\u2019s holding. That doesn\u2019t look like brotherly love to me. I stare at his girl. Why is she so damned happy to see her guy hugging someone else?</p><p>When he lets her go, Noah extends his hand to me. \u201cS\u2019up.\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and squeeze extra tight.</p><p>\u201cNothing. You?\u201d</p><p>The moment I squeeze, Noah grins and squeezes back. \u201cChill, bro. Beth says you\u2019re good, so that makes us good.\u201d</p><p>Beth hugs the Latino guy and laughs as he playfully talks in Spanish. \u201cThat\u2019s Rico,\u201d says Noah. \u201cRelax. We\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Beth I\u2019m worried about. She shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Noah loses the easygoing front. \u201cNo, she shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Beth glances over her shoulder and flashes me that joyous smile\u2014the one I\u2019ve only seen a handful of times.</p><p>\u201cIs she wearing a ribbon?\u201d Noah asks in clear disbelief.</p><p>Feeling proud, I answer, \u201cI gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking wonderful,\u201d Noah mumbles as he eyes Isaiah. \u201cDon\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>Noah returns to the group and pulls his girl onto a hammock strung along two posts in the ground. The hammock swings gently back and forth as they lie together. Propped up on an elbow, Noah focuses on her. \u201cEcho, that\u2019s Ryan. Ryan, this is my girl.\u201d</p><p>Message received. Screw with his girl and he\u2019ll screw with me. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Echo sits up, but Noah snakes an arm around her waist and drags her back down.</p><p>\u201cBeth brought a guy who has manners,\u201d Echo teases him. \u201cSee, it\u2019s not so hard.\u201d</p><p>Noah pushes her hair over her shoulder, then runs a finger along her arm. \u201cI\u2019ve got manners, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She swats at his hand and laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Disgust weaves through me as I register what I\u2019m seeing. Scars cover Echo\u2019s arms. I rub a hand over my face. What the hell happened to her? Noah continues to tease Echo and she continues to laugh, yet his tone as he addresses me is a menacing threat. \u201cStare any longer, Ryan, and I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d Echo reprimands. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Beth returns to me. \u201cWhat did I say about staring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d I say directly to Echo.</p><p>Echo smiles. \u201cSee? Manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d says Beth. \u201cLet\u2019s get you a beer before you give them a good reason to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>I MISS LAUGHING.</p><p>Most days I can find something amusing to make my lips flinch up. Sometimes it will be funny enough to make me chuckle. But I miss laughing. Really laughing. Laughing to the point that my insides hurt, my chest aches, my face is exhausted from holding the smile.</p><p>For effect, Rico stands in the middle of the circle of lawn chairs and in slow motion reenacts how Isaiah and I kept him from being busted for underage drinking this summer by distracting a pair of cops with a very bad mime routine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hiding in the bushes and if the police step back, they\u2019d be on top of me. Beth\u2019s just standing there,\u201d Rico chokes out between laughs. \u201cHer arm stiff at the shoulder and her forearm dangling back and forth like a pendulum. The cop asked if she needed medical help. He thought she was having a seizure.\u201d</p><p>Everyone, including me, bursts into laugher.</p><p>Rico composes himself to spit out the rest.</p><p>\u201cAnd she breaks her self-imposed silence and says, \u2018I\u2019m a mime, you moron. Why do you think I\u2019ve been doing all these retarded moves?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughs harder and as our group gasps for air Rico glances at Ryan. \u201cIncluso el nino blanco se esta riendo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not fluent in Spanish, but I know enough to pick out the words white boy and laughter.</p><p>My heart shivers when I catch Ryan at the tail end of a chuckle. He\u2019s always cute, but he\u2019s breathtaking when he laughs.</p><p>Rico lifts his beer to his lips, then tosses it across the yard. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah tips the cooler. \u201cWe\u2019re all out, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah, help me snag some of Antonio\u2019s stash, then we\u2019ll hit the mota.\u201d</p><p>Mota. Weed. The layer between my skin and muscles itches. I want a hit. More like I crave a hit\u2014the smell surrounding me, the smoke burning my lungs, the feeling of freedom and floating. Oh God, I want more than anything to float.</p><p>Isaiah stands and Rico kicks my foot as he passes. \u201cYou\u2019re in, right, Beth?\u201d</p><p>It kills me to shake my head. \u201cCurfew.\u201d</p><p>I peek at Ryan. Does he know what mota is?</p><p>The smile falls from my lips as I flip through the stories we\u2019ve told. Oh crap, I feel sick. The drinking. The drugs. The parties. He heard it all. My stomach sways. He knows what I am.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d says Isaiah. He waits until I look at him. \u201cThe stuff is mild. You\u2019ll be sober by curfew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Noah warns.</p><p>Isaiah would never steer me wrong. If he says I\u2019ll be sober in an hour, then I will be. He knows how much I long for weightlessness. A loud crashing noise comes from the house. I know these people. Ryan doesn\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave him defenseless. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Rico heads into the house.</p><p>Isaiah stares at me and I don\u2019t understand the gleam in his eye. Abruptly, he follows Rico.</p><p>In the hammock, Noah begins to kiss Echo.</p><p>The two of them will be lost in their own world for the rest of the night and Isaiah will easily be gone ten minutes. The night has been fun, but it\u2019s also made me the rope in a strange invisible tug-of-war. Ryan sat on one side of me. Isaiah the other. It felt weird to be next to both my best friend and the guy I really like.</p><p>Why can\u2019t Isaiah see that we\u2019re just friends?</p><p>Friends only. I need to talk to him before I leave. I need to straighten this whole mess out.</p><p>Honestly, I just need to hear him say that he didn\u2019t mean it and that he\u2019s still my best friend.</p><p>Ryan stands, stretches, and walks over to the tree on the opposite side of the yard. I glance over my shoulder at the house. I\u2019ve been careful not to rub Ryan in Isaiah\u2019s face, but I need to make sure Ryan\u2019s okay too. Yeah, Isaiah will be gone for a while. Rico\u2019s a slow tripper.</p><p>I follow after Ryan. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to move for Noah and Echo\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Hundreds of Christmas lights hang from the tree. His sun-kissed skin is beautiful under their glow. \u201cI didn\u2019t move because of them.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cThen why did you?\u201d</p><p>Ryan inclines his head and his eyes roam my body as if savoring the sight. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful when you laugh.\u201d</p><p>Warmth blazes on my cheeks and I break eye contact. Ryan reaches out and touches me.</p><p>His fingers linger on my neckline and the whisper of his caress on my skin heats my blood.</p><p>\u201cYou should laugh more,\u201d he says.</p><p>I swallow. \u201cLife hasn\u2019t given me much to laugh about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could change that.\u201d Ryan invades my personal space and every part of him connects with a part of me.</p><p>I inhale and smell the delicious scent of earth after the rain. \u201cYou smell good,\u201d I say.</p><p>His hand glides along the curve of my spine and into my hair. Chills energize my body. \u201cSo do you. You always smell like roses.\u201d</p><p>I giggle at the thought of me smelling sweet and bite my lip to stop the girlish reaction. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever said that to me before.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s lips form that glorious smile with dimples and my blood tingles straight to my toes. This smile is for me and me alone.</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of things I want to say to you, Beth, and I want to be the first to say them to you.\u201d</p><p>Intense hunger glazes his eyes. I\u2019ve seen the same look on other guys, but on Ryan it\u2019s different. That stare has more depth\u2014more meaning\u2014as if he\u2019s seeing inside me.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cDo you want to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>My heart beats faster. Oh, Ryan can kiss.</p><p>I\u2019ve stayed awake at night and replayed his lips against mine. His kisses are strong like him, possessive and demanding. Ryan said beautiful things to me in the barn and he touched me in ways I only dreamed someone could touch me.</p><p>My fingers burrow into his thick hair. \u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan lowers his head and I close my eyes.</p><p>The anticipation of this moment creates an energy that sizzles in the autumn air. I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m going to kiss Ryan\u2014sober.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Beth.\u201d From behind me, Isaiah spits out the words.</p><p>I whirl around and barely catch sight of him bolting out the back gate into the alley. Noah falls out of the hammock and heads after him. I need to go after Isaiah, not Noah. I take several steps, but laughter from the house stops me. I can\u2019t leave Ryan. \u201cNoah!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo home, Beth,\u201d he says as he strides toward the alley. \u201cBack to Groveton and don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the deal we made. When we hugged and apologized to each other, Noah promised to let me stay and enjoy my evening if, when it was over, I left and never looked back. It wasn\u2019t a hard promise to make. In a few weeks, I\u2019ll be gone for good. \u201cI can\u2019t leave knowing he\u2019s upset.\u201d Because after tonight, I may never see him again.</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d says Noah.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I grab Noah and fling myself in front of him. \u201cHe\u2019s mad at me. I know he gets upset when I make out with guys, but Ryan isn\u2019t some random guy. I have to explain that to him.\u201d I have to explain to Isaiah that he is not in love with me. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go after Isaiah and leave Ryan here. You know what will happen if some of Rico\u2019s friends see Ryan without you or me.\u201d</p><p>Noah rubs his eyes. Yes, he does know. Ryan isn\u2019t a part of our circle and is fair game for a good beating. Noah gestures for me to go after Isaiah. \u201cFifteen minutes, Beth. I mean it. You need to go back to Groveton and finish out your life there.\u201d</p> <p>I turn and flinch to find Ryan standing close with his hands shoved into his pockets.</p><p>Hurt wounds the brown eyes that glowed with promise moments before.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d I stutter out. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend and he\u2019s upset and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo after him.\u201d Ryan crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cBut don\u2019t string me along if it\u2019s him you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shake my head. Ryan misunderstands. \u201cIsaiah and I...we\u2019re not like that.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to waste time standing here arguing with Ryan over stupid jealousy issues when my best friend is upset. I push past Noah and run into the alley. A few steps into the darkness, strong hands grab my arms.</p> <p>I suck in air to scream and I\u2019m silenced by a familiar deep voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201d As if to prove his point, Isaiah shoves my wrist in front of my face and shows me Ryan\u2019s pink ribbon.</p><p>\u201cSo have you. The Isaiah I knew would have run away with me and Mom when I asked. You left my mom with Trent and he broke her wrist! It\u2019s like I don\u2019t even know you anymore.</p><p>You used to take care of me!\u201d My pulse thuds in my ears as I shove away from Isaiah.</p><p>The streetlamp attached to an aging utility pole flickers on and off. With each flash of light, a mix of anger and sadness crosses Isaiah\u2019s face. \u201cYou used to let me take care of you. Now you\u2019ve got some asshole jock doing your bidding.\u201d</p><p>White-hot anger flashes through me. \u201cLeave Ryan out of this. You\u2019re the one PMS-ing like a girl. First you want to run away with me.</p><p>Then you don\u2019t want anything to do with me.</p><p>Then you want to run away with me after graduation. Then you keep telling me to live my life in Groveton. Then you go and tell me that you love me when we both know you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumps out of my chest when he punches his curled fists into the chain link fence behind him. The metal of the fence vibrates. \u201cDammit, Beth.\u201d</p> <p>Isaiah clutches the fence and he bends over as if he\u2019s ready to vomit. Not once in four years have I seen him this emotional. My hands shake with adrenaline. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah swears softly under his breath. \u201cI am in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Ice freezes my muscles. He said it\u2014again.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah spins and cups my face with his hands. I don\u2019t feel warmth. I only feel cold.</p><p>Cold and confused. He lowers his head so that his face is close to mine. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since I was fifteen. I wasn\u2019t man enough to tell you, so Luke swooped in. You were so hurt after he used you that I swore to protect you until you could listen to what I had to say. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>My lungs tighten. God, I can\u2019t breathe. Help me breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re mine. I want more from you and I\u2019m begging you to please give me more.\u201d</p><p>My throat becomes raw and slowly swells.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>His fingers gently move against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou want to leave, I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll take you now.</p><p>We\u2019ll get in my car, find your mom, and we\u2019ll never look back. Your terms. Not mine.</p><p>Whatever you want. Whatever you need. Just say the words. Please say them.\u201d</p><p>I love him.</p><p>Those words. My hand presses against his chest. His heart continues in the same steady beat I\u2019ve come to depend upon. Isaiah is my rock. The string that holds me together when I\u2019m ready to fall apart. He\u2019s the anchor that keeps me from floating away when I go too far. His heart has been the one constant rhythm in my life and I don\u2019t want to let it go.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah tucks his chin toward his chest and I force air into my lungs when he clears his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to mean it.\u201d</p><p>I try to physically shake the tears forming, but his hold on my face makes it impossible.</p><p>We haven\u2019t talked for weeks, but I knew, in the deep recesses of my mind, that our separation was temporary. This somehow feels too real and that means this goodbye could be concrete.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose him. I can\u2019t. \u201cI mean it. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Like a friend. Like my best friend. Before Groveton, I never understood love and now...I still don\u2019t understand it. But I know that it\u2019s not emptiness, I know it\u2019s not letting a guy use me, I know there are different types and what I feel for Isaiah...it\u2019s not how I feel when I\u2019m with Ryan.</p><p>Isaiah rests his forehead on mine. \u201cLike you love him. Tell me you love me as much as you love him.\u201d</p><p>Ryan. Am I in love with him? The thought causes panic. Just the sound of his name causes my heart to trip over itself. I love the way Ryan makes me feel. I love his words. I love his hands on my body. I love the way his gaze causes me to blush.</p><p>But I have to leave Ryan soon in order to protect my mom. If I say the right words, Isaiah will go with me. \u201cIsaiah, I...\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time, I wondered if I was falling in love with Isaiah. Echo had hugged him and he happily hugged her back. The pain and jealousy that shot through my body surprised even me. But I wasn\u2019t falling for him. I was scared of Echo. Scared of the changes she was bringing to our lives. Changes that would have happened even if she had never existed.</p><p>I stare into his gray eyes. Isaiah\u2019s wrong; he doesn\u2019t love me. Not in the way he thinks. The truth is there\u2014in his eyes. He doesn\u2019t look at me the way Noah does Echo or how Chris does Lacy. He doesn\u2019t look at me the way Ryan does....</p><p>\u201cI love you...\u201d</p><p>I love Isaiah\u2019s safety and I love his calm. I love his voice and his laughter. I love his constant, steady presence. But if the world were coming to an end, he\u2019s not the person I\u2019d want at my side. I love him. I love him so much that I know he deserves to have a girl who falls apart at his touch. He deserves to have a girl whose heart stops working every time he glances at her. He deserves someone who is \u201cin\u201d love with him.</p><p>\u201c...as a friend. The same way that you love me.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah shakes his head, as if doing that will make my words less true. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips against my forehead. My lower lip trembles as I ball the material of his shirt into my hand. I\u2019m losing him. I\u2019m losing my best friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd someday you\u2019re going to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind...\u201d There\u2019s a heaviness in his voice, and a part of me dies at the thought of him in so much pain. He touches his lips to my forehead once more, the caress lasting longer, the pressure more intense.</p><p>Isaiah walks away from me and fades into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I whisper as I close my eyes and wish that one day, he\u2019ll change his.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>BETH ASKED FOR TIME. How long does she need? A day? A week? Hours? Any amount is too long when the girl I\u2019m falling for had tears in her eyes. Any amount is too long when I wonder if she cares for me. I won\u2019t see her until Tuesday. Tomorrow is parent\u2013teacher conferences. Today is Sunday and my parents are hosting a barbecue for the mayor, the town council, and a few other friends of our family.</p><p>I\u2019m dressed up and playing the perfect part.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>It\u2019s what Lacy called me when she explained why she would never fit into Groveton.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>It\u2019s what Beth spat at me when she refused the trust fall.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>It\u2019s the word Gwen just used when discussing how she wants the two of us to walk onto the football field together for homecoming.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Looking out on our back patio, I see nothing but boring perfection. The grass trimmed perfectly to three inches. The shrubs perfectly edged in the shape of round balls. The pots of fall chrysanthemums lining the edging of the patio perfectly placed one foot apart. Perfect people who grew up in this town and perfectly filled their parents\u2019 shoes.</p><p>At the other end of the table, my mother inclines her head toward Gwen. I take the nonverbal cue and turn my attention to my \u201cdinner partner.\u201d Gwen gives me a smile that\u2019s one more perfect thing in the backyard.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be awesome, Ryan?\u201d</p><p>No, walking onto the field with her on my arm at homecoming wouldn\u2019t be awesome. I want to share that moment with Beth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we get to decide who we walk with.\u201d</p><p>Gwen ignores my comment. \u201cCould you pour me some more water?\u201d</p><p>I reach for the pitcher in front of me and do as she asks. This is my obligation to my parents. My job is to fill Gwen\u2019s drink when it\u2019s empty, remove her dishes when she\u2019s done, and to entertain her. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu sets in and my head swims with a sinking revelation. This same exact moment is how Gwen and I started dating.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s mother sips her wine. Her face is tighter than it was last fall. \u201cWe need to make a decision regarding Allison Risk and the event committee at church.\u201d</p><p>Mom fidgets with her pearl necklace. She hates uncomfortable decisions. \u201cAllison is a sweet young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in favor of her joining, Miriam?\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s mother asks.</p><p>Uncharacteristically, my mother pours wine into her empty water glass. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The Risks were dreadful people. Do you remember Scott\u2019s parents? The man was a mean drunk and the woman wasn\u2019t much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Scott\u2019s not his parents,\u201d I say and everyone at the table glances at me. My mother shoots me a warning glare, but my father puts a hand on my mother\u2019s arm to back her off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom removes her arm from under his touch. I continue, \u201cHe became the best baseball player the Yankees have seen in twenty years.</p><p>Why should his wife be punished for his parents\u2019 mistakes?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes narrow on the last sentence. His own private warning to me that I may have gone too far.</p><p>\u201cI have to be honest,\u201d says Gwen\u2019s mother.</p> <p>\u201cI am fond of Allison, but it\u2019s the niece I\u2019m concerned with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d asks my mother as I stiffen.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard she smokes, was disrespectful to a teacher, and swears. All traits we cannot condone, and putting Allison on the committee will reflect upon our church. Which is so sad, since Allison is a dear and the niece is...\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s mother flitters her fingers in the air.</p> <p>\u201cSavage. It\u2019s obvious that the girl didn\u2019t go with Scott like we hoped after the incident with her father.\u201d</p><p>My mind awakens. The people at this table know what happened to Beth. I\u2019m torn in two.</p><p>Part of me wants to defend Beth. The other half wants to know what happened to her as a child. If I speak now, I\u2019ll lose my opportunity to learn the truth.</p><p>\u201cLiza,\u201d Gwen\u2019s father interjects. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for that child to be gossiped about.\u201d</p><p>Red in the cheeks, Mrs. Gardner forces a smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m not gossiping and she\u2019s hardly a child anymore. The event committee is an offshoot of a bigger issue. I\u2019m concerned with the girl\u2019s influence. I\u2019m scared everyone will be so wrapped up in who her uncle is that they won\u2019t see the threat in front of them. Do you want your daughter swearing and smoking and talking back to teachers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Gardner replies.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she argues. \u201cThe senior class already nominated Beth for homecoming court and Ryan is dating her.\u201d</p><p>I become rock. This isn\u2019t how I wanted my parents to find out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My mother\u2019s fast and irritated question silences the group. My eyes flash to Gwen. Wide-eyed and pale, Gwen sits perfectly still and stares at the remains of her chicken cordon bleu.</p><p>Her mother poorly hides her smugness behind her wineglass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miriam, I assumed that Ryan told you.\u201d She places a hand over Gwen\u2019s. \u201cI apologize to you too, sweetheart. I didn\u2019t know that what you told me was a secret.\u201d</p><p>Mom places her napkin on the table. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for dessert?\u201d</p><p>I stand, needing to get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>Mom deflates in her chair with a nod. What I don\u2019t expect is Gwen hopping up and volunteering, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to look at her, I pivot and head for the kitchen. The rapid click of Gwen\u2019s heels informs me she\u2019s right behind me.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she says the moment the door is closed to any eavesdropping ears. \u201cRyan, I\u2019m sorry. I had no idea my mom would humiliate you like that. But it\u2019s not my fault. How was I to know that you were keeping Beth a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I snap. Gwen looks like a stranger to me in this kitchen. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still not used to the gray walls or the granite counters or the mahogany cupboards. Or maybe it\u2019s because I never really knew her to begin with.</p><p>She crosses her arms over her chest and her red sundress swirls with the motion. \u201cCould have fooled me. I mean, come on, Ryan, your parents will hate her\u2014and for good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know Beth.\u201d The irony of this conversation is not lost on me. Lacy once said those same words to me.</p><p>Gwen loses the perfect glow about her and does a very uncharacteristic thing\u2014she sags against the counter. \u201cI know more than you think. I\u2019d bet I know more than you.\u201d She pauses and nervously fidgets with her hands.</p><p>What the hell? Gwen is never nervous.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I notice the bare spot on her finger. Mike\u2019s ring is gone.</p><p>\u201cI love you. In fact, I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>Gwen stares at the gray tiled floor. \u201cAnd for some stupid reason you care about her. I think you were right in the dugout\u2014I wasn\u2019t clear on what I needed from you. Maybe the reason we aren\u2019t together now is because I didn\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d</p><p>My forehead furrows. If she had said those words six months ago...I shake my head. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered. What I feel for Beth is a hundred times stronger than what I ever felt for Gwen. \u201cWe would never have worked.\u201d</p><p>Gwen straightens and lifts her chin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing everything all wrong. Me.</p><p>Beth. Everything. I think you\u2019re aware that you and Beth don\u2019t belong together and that\u2019s the reason you never told your parents. But don\u2019t worry, Ryan. I know what I did wrong and I don\u2019t make the same mistakes twice.\u201d</p><p>In one graceful movement, Gwen swoops the cake off the counter and ushers it out the kitchen door. I inhale and let my head fall back. I don\u2019t know what the hell just happened, but every cell in my body screams it\u2019s bad and I\u2019m going to hate the consequences.</p><p>MY GRANDMOTHER LEFT MY MOTHER her pendulum clock. It hangs on the wall behind Mom. With each swing, the clock ticks. It\u2019s nine o\u2019clock at night. The last of the guests left an hour ago. I should be wondering why my parents called me in here, especially since they\u2019re voluntarily in the same room. Instead, I\u2019m wondering what Beth is thinking.</p><p>Mom sits across from me at our kitchen table while Dad leans against the door frame leading to the formal dining room. The temperature, like always, is frigid.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rowe is under the impression you\u2019re still participating in the writing competition,\u201d says Dad.</p><p>I glance up at him. \u201cI\u2019m considering it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to consider. You\u2019re playing Eastwick that weekend and that game will decide rankings going into the spring season.\u201d</p><p>Eastwick is the only team that beat us during regular season play last spring. \u201cWe\u2019re playing Northside that Monday and they\u2019re undefeated this year. Coach may want me to pitch that game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says Dad. \u201cBut you\u2019ll still be able to play a couple of innings on Monday. They\u2019ll need you to close the game out.\u201d</p><p>Mom takes off her pearl necklace. \u201cI talked to Mrs. Rowe last week. She said that Ryan has a rare talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d says Dad. \u201cBaseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d bites out Mom. \u201cWriting.\u201d</p><p>Dad rubs his eyes. \u201cExplain to your mother you\u2019re not interested in the writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan, tell your father what Mrs. Rowe told me. Tell him how much you enjoy her class.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders curl in with the anger. I hate their constant fighting. I hate that I\u2019ve caused them to fight more. I hate that they\u2019re fighting over me. But what I hate more is the feeling that everyone else is controlling my choices. \u201cI love baseball.\u201d</p><p>Dad releases a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love writing. I want to go to the competition.\u201d</p><p>Dad swears under his breath and heads for the fridge. I turn in my chair to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never let me walk away from a competition before and I don\u2019t like the feeling of giving up. I\u2019ll miss one game. And this is recreational league play. It would be different if this was spring season.\u201d</p><p>Dad pops open a bottle of beer and takes a swig. \u201cWhat happens if you win the writing competition? Are you going to give up pitching against the best team in the state for a piece of paper that says congratulations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know if I\u2019m any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ryan. Why? What difference would it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been offered the chance at a college scholarship\u2014to play ball.\u201d</p><p>Dad stares at me and the dishwasher enters the rinse cycle. \u201cHave you been talking to college scouts behind my back?\u201d</p><p>Yes. No. \u201cThe recruiter made sense. He said their pitch coach can help me with my placement issues and teach me to break the tell on my pitches. They\u2019ll pay for me to go to school and I can get free coaching. I can train with them for four years and then go for the pros.\u201d</p><p>Beer sloshes from the bottle when Dad throws out his arms. \u201cWhat happens if you get injured? What happens if instead of improving, you lose your edge? You\u2019re a pitcher. There is no better time for you to go after your dreams than now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if...\u201d</p><p>He stalks across the kitchen and slams the beer down in front of me. \u201cDo I need to remind you how much money we\u2019ve pumped into you? Do you think the coaching we\u2019ve paid for over the years is cheap? Do you think the equipment, the Jeep we bought you were free?\u201d</p><p>My gut aches as if he punched me. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think they were free. I\u2019ve offered to get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for you to get a job, Ryan.</p><p>I\u2019m looking for you to do something with your talent. I\u2019m looking for you to make a name for this family. I want to know that the years your mother and I have sacrificed financially, emotionally, with our time are not in vain.\u201d</p><p>Mom calmly folds her hands on the table.</p><p>\u201cHe does have talent, Andrew. You\u2019re angry he doesn\u2019t want what you want. You\u2019re angry he\u2019s choosing something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaseball is what he wants!\u201d Dad\u2019s knuckles turn white as he grips the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what anyone in this family wants.\u201d</p><p>His voice shakes as he talks. \u201cWhat do you want, Miriam? What will finally make you happy? You always wanted me to run for mayor and I\u2019ve agreed to it. You wanted me to expand the business and I am. I have done everything to make you happy. Just tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my family back!\u201d Mom screams.</p><p>Over the past months, my mother has been sarcastic and rude to my father. But in seventeen years, I\u2019ve never known her to scream.</p><p>The shock wears off Dad\u2019s face. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it all! Do you want your friends to know that your son is gay? Do you want your church to know your son is gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could talk to Mark. Maybe if he agreed to keep it a secret\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d my father roars.</p><p>I lean back in my chair, disgusted with them.</p><p>Disgusted with myself. Since Mark walked away, I\u2019ve been so obsessed with the fact that he left that I never really listened to what my parents were saying. It makes me realize that I probably never really listened to Mark either.</p><p>No wonder he left. How could anyone live with so much hate?</p><p>A sickening nausea strikes and I grow dizzy.</p><p>Does Mark believe I feel the same way as my parents?</p><p>Dad rams the chair into the table, then stalks away. \u201cMark made his choice. You wanted to talk to Ryan tonight\u2014talk to him. I\u2019ll be in my office.\u201d</p><p>Mom stands. \u201cHe should hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>In the door frame, he pauses and looks back at me. \u201cI\u2019ll be running for my party\u2019s nomination for mayor in the spring. Your mother and I don\u2019t want you dating Beth Risk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Be her friend at school, but we can\u2019t risk the bad publicity if she\u2019s trouble. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>My mind races to process. Dad\u2019s running for mayor. Mom wants Mark back in the house.</p><p>I\u2019ve let down my brother. They both want me to dump Beth. \u201cYou said that you never wanted to be mayor.\u201d</p><p>But Mom has wanted him to. Her dad was mayor. Her grandfather was mayor. It\u2019s a tradition she\u2019s always craved to continue.</p> <p>Neither Mom nor Dad will look at me or at each other, and neither appears to want to discuss his nomination. \u201cAbout Beth...\u201d I say.</p><p>Dad cuts me off. \u201cThe girl is off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should date Gwen again,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cHer father is going to back your father.\u201d</p><p>The seat jerks under me when I stand and my sudden movement causes Mom to flinch. I stare at them both, waiting for one of them to make sense of anything they\u2019ve said. When they remain silent, I finally understand why Mark left.</p> <p>Beth</p><p>I DON\u2019T OWN A JACKET. Never have. I always told Isaiah and Noah my body temperature runs hot when actually it runs low. In Kentucky, autumn weather can be a bitch. Hot in the afternoons. Cold at night. This morning, the slick dew covering Ryan\u2019s pasture permeates past my worn shoes to my socks.</p><p>Few things suck more than cold, wet feet.</p><p>I stop in my tracks. Losing my best friend sucks. I let myself feel the ache, then continue forward. One day Isaiah will realize that we\u2019re just friends. One day he\u2019ll find me\u2014even if I\u2019m at the ocean. Friendships like ours are too strong to die.</p><p>Today is parent\u2013teacher conferences and I can\u2019t think of a better way to spend a day free from school than with Ryan. Actually, I can\u2019t think of a better way to spend any day. My time with Ryan is dwindling and I want to make the most of every moment with him.</p><p>Thump. I first heard that sound when I came out of the woods. Every few seconds, the sound repeats. Thump. Instead of heading straight for Ryan\u2019s house, I decided to follow the thumps and I\u2019m glad I did when I see beautiful, glistening, sun-kissed skin. Wearing only a pair of nylon athletic pants, Ryan winds back then hurls a ball toward a painted target on a piece of plywood. Thump. The ball hits square in the middle.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you wonder why people think jocks are stupid,\u201d I say. Ryan whirls around with wide eyes and I continue, \u201cIt\u2019s fifty degrees outside and you aren\u2019t wearing a shirt.\u201d</p><p>A cold breeze blows through the open pasture, causing goose bumps to prick my arms. Okay, possibly not the smartest opening line since rubbing my arms would be the definition of both hypocrisy and irony.</p><p>Ryan grabs his shirt off the ground and walks over to me. The early-morning rays highlight the curves of the muscles in his abdomen. My heart flutters like a bird shaking water from its wings. God, he\u2019s gorgeous.</p><p>Sexy. A vision. Too perfect for someone like me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cooling down,\u201d Ryan says. Caught up in staring at his body, I have to pause to remember what I last said. Ryan gives me a cocky smile and to my mortification, I blush.</p><p>What is with me and all this blushing?</p><p>Ryan caresses my burning cheeks, and my heart trembles again.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you do that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Pull it together, Beth. This is not why you\u2019re here. Ryan has dealt with enough of my crap over the past two months and for some reason he insists on looking at me like I\u2019m the princess to his prince. He is a prince. I\u2019m not a princess, but I can help with his happily-ever-after before I leave his life for good.</p><p>Ryan withdraws his hand, but remains annoyingly close\u2014with his shirt still off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever get tired of baseball?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ryan finally pulls his shirt over his head. \u201cI wake up every morning at six, run two miles, then pitch. There\u2019s not a morning it gets old.\u201d</p><p>His routine fits him. Perfectly. But then I think of him at his computer. His fingers flying over the keyboard. His eyes seeing a world beyond the one his body belongs to. \u201cDo you write every night?\u201d</p><p>Ryan combs his fingers through my hair and my roots flip over. What normally is a motion that sends tingles down my spine instead brings a sense of dread. His eyes narrow at the roots and I know what he sees: a half inch of golden-blond hair.</p><p>He tears his eyes away and does a good job of pretending the malformation doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cWith that short story due? Yeah, I write every night.\u201d Ryan shrugs and stares at the ground.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I might keep it up when the story is done. I don\u2019t know, maybe start another.\u201d</p><p>Good. It\u2019s the image I\u2019ll take with me when I go: Ryan pitching balls in the morning and lost in his beautifully written words at night. I kick at the ground. \u201cDo you have plans for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do if they include you.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide my smile, but I can\u2019t. \u201cGet cleaned up and pick me up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Tickling my skin, Ryan\u2019s fingers graze the pink ribbon still tied to my wrist. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE A WUSS.\u201d My little black-haired threat flips through the University of Kentucky student directory. \u201cYou can move a car across a pasture, but you can\u2019t see your own brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I say. \u201cI moved the car on a dare.\u201d</p><p>Outside the guys\u2019 athletic dorms, I attempt to stand in front of Beth as she searches for my brother\u2019s room number. Beth wears a cotton Tshirt that hugs her slim form and ends a half inch short of her low-rise jeans. With her smooth skin tempting me in very right, yet wrong, places, I would bet my Jeep that the outfit doesn\u2019t have Scott\u2019s seal of approval.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love it, and so does every guy walking in and out of the dorms.</p><p>She\u2019s my girl and I prefer to be the only one looking at her.</p><p>My girl. We\u2019re not official\u2014not yet\u2014but</p><p>Beth said four critical words when she climbed into my Jeep this morning: \u201cI let Isaiah go.\u201d</p><p>Which means she\u2019s with me and not him. Later today, I\u2019m asking Beth to make us exclusive.</p><p>Beth stabs her finger into the book.</p><p>\u201cJackpot.\u201d She scribbles the room number onto the palm of her hand. \u201cI double dog dare you to talk to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know nothing about dares?\u201d I ask while giving the evil eye to some guy who stares at the contours of Beth\u2019s waist. \u201cYou can\u2019t double dog dare unless I turn down the initial dare.\u201d</p><p>She arches a brow. \u201cAre we really going to talk semantics?\u201d</p><p>I place a hand on her hip and back her against the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s a big word, Beth.</p><p>Maybe you should explain it.\u201d</p><p>A wicked smile touches her lips and raw hunger settles in her eyes, but instead of melting into me as I am into her, Beth pushes me away and ducks underneath my arm. A guy walks out of the building and Beth catches the door before it has a chance to lock behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re an idiot if you think I\u2019m going to let you talk your way out of this.\u201d</p><p>She gestures for me to enter the lobby and I do. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk. I was going to kiss my way out of it. Do you have any idea how long it\u2019s been since we kissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you talk to your brother, we\u2019ll kiss. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we skip this and move straight on to kissing?\u201d</p><p>She ignores me and studies the large map of the dorm layout on the wall. \u201cI officially dare you to talk to your brother.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest as my back straightens. Beth officially threw down the gauntlet. \u201cFine. What do I get if I win?\u201d</p><p>Her raven hair cascades like a waterfall as she inclines her head toward me. A sexy glint lights her eyes. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>You. But that isn\u2019t what I permit to come out of my mouth. \u201cI want you to spend the rest of the day with me. No cell phones. No friends.</p><p>Nothing but me and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>BETH EXPERTLY MANIPULATES our way past the RA guarding the entrance to Mark\u2019s floor.</p><p>I\u2019d call him an idiot, but I\u2019m well aware that she used the same manipulation skills to convince me to drive to Lexington. To my horror, Beth knocks on my brother\u2019s door without asking if I\u2019m ready. Any hope Mark would be in class ends when the doorknob jiggles and Mark\u2019s large, looming figure stands in the door frame.</p><p>Beth flashes a wicked smile. \u201cS\u2019up, Mark.</p><p>How was the game against Florida?\u201d</p><p>He hesitantly grins as his eyes flicker between me and Beth. \u201cI sacked the quarterback twice. Don\u2019t you watch the news?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretending to care about football in order to break the ice. I\u2019ll be in the lobby.\u201d Beth nonchalantly walks off the way we came. Even when the door at the end of the hallway shuts, I still watch. After dragging my ass here, I never thought she\u2019d leave me to do this on my own.</p><p>Mark steps away from the door and forces cheerfulness. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I mimic his tone. Mark and I never forced anything before this summer.</p><p>Mark\u2019s dorm room is the same as it was last year. I can tell he has the same roommate by the posters of Star Wars hanging on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Greg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClass. Do you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>He opens a small fridge. \u201cGatorade, water?\u201d</p><p>My mouth tastes like the desert, but I don\u2019t want to prolong this. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mark closes the fridge and sits on the bottom bunk. His fake smile vanishes and I shove my hands in my pockets. The Band-Aid method sucked for both of us. I wish I could make our relationship strong again. Mark was the first person I told when I pitched a no-hitter, made my first all-star team, and kissed a girl. Now, I don\u2019t even know what words to stutter out next.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re Mom and Dad?\u201d he asks.</p><p>How\u2019re Mom and Dad. I can answer that. I take a seat on the two-seater couch next to the bunks. \u201cOkay. Dad\u2019s busy. He\u2019s expanding the construction business and he plans on running for mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Wow.</p><p>\u201cAnd Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrapped up in her social clubs and events like normal. Lunches. Dinners. Teas.\u201d I pause, wondering if I should say what I\u2019m about to.</p><p>\u201cShe misses you.\u201d</p><p>Mark leans forward and holds his hands together between his bent knees. \u201cDoes Dad ever mention me?\u201d</p><p>The hope fighting to surface on Mark\u2019s face makes looking at him painful. If I answer with a plain yes, I create false hope, or I could tell him the truth. None of the answers are ones I want to give. \u201cDid you ever want to do anything besides football?\u201d</p><p>Mark scrapes his knuckles against his jaw before snatching a book off his bed and tossing it to me. I catch it in midair. \u201cQuality Lesson Plans for Secondary Physical Education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an education major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince....\u201d Mark drums the fingers of his clasped hands once. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Faking interest in the pages, I flip through the book. \u201cI thought you were pre-med.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad wanted me to major in. College for Dad was nothing more than a step toward the NFL. The pre-med was if I got injured. Mom wanted one of us to be a doctor. That was Dad\u2019s way of making her happy.\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s organized his desk the same as last year: laptop, iPod dock. After Mark\u2019s first college football game, Mom had someone take a family picture on the field. He\u2019s taped the photograph on the wall next to his practice schedule. Some things are the same. Others are not. \u201cDo you hate football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I love football and want to play. In fact, I want to become a high school football coach.</p><p>Dad knew that. He didn\u2019t agree with me, but he knew it. I thought if I played along, that if I pretended that\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off.</p> <p>I came here. I brought this up. I can finish the statement for him. \u201cThey\u2019d accept who you are?\u201d</p><p>Mark nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The two of us sit in silence. My stomach twists and turns like I\u2019m on a boat on the verge of capsizing. My life was perfect and I enjoyed every second. Mark\u2019s two little words \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d tipped my world. Maybe I get why he left. Maybe I don\u2019t. Either way, anger still festers, and if I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>\u201cYou left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me to do?\u201d Resentment thickens his tone. \u201cI can\u2019t change who I am.\u201d</p> <p>I need to move. Hit something. Throw something. I stand instead. \u201cNot leave. You said you pretended before. Why couldn\u2019t you pretend again? Or you could have stayed and fought and, I don\u2019t know, convinced Mom and Dad to let you stay.\u201d</p><p>Mark calmly watches as I pace the length of the narrow room. He clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cSomeday, you\u2019re going to see how Mom and Dad controlled and manipulated our lives.</p><p>You\u2019re going to notice how they made us believe that their dreams were our dreams.</p><p>They dictated our every breath. Think about it\u2014do you have any idea who you are without them?\u201d</p><p>Mom sat me next to Gwen last night and she specifically asked me to take care of Gwen\u2019s needs during the evening. Just like she asked me to take care of Gwen when I was fifteen.</p> <p>After that first dinner, Mom encouraged me to ask her out and I did.</p><p>But baseball is my choice. It always has been. Dad understands baseball. Because of that, he\u2019s managed every part of my baseball career: the coaches, the leagues. Hell, he even stands up to umps. He does it all for me.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Mom and Dad\u2019s concerns, all of their pushing, they do it because they love me. But they flat-out told me not to date Beth, regardless of my feelings for her, and they expect nothing less than compliance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear a hole in my carpet,\u201d Mark says.</p><p>No, Mark\u2019s wrong. He has to be wrong. \u201cI\u2019m a good ballplayer.\u201d I am. The best.</p><p>\u201cYou are. Dad did that right. He didn\u2019t force us into a sport we had no talent in. He took his time and found the one sport each of us was good at. The question is\u2014who are you playing for, Ry? You or Dad?\u201d</p><p>Between the door and bunk beds, I freeze.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad wants perfection. Scratch that. Dad wants perfection on the outside so everyone else can see it. Mom too. They could care less if we\u2019re torn up on the inside as long as the rest of the world envies us.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in Groveton assumes Mom and Dad have the perfect marriage. The homecoming queen married the star quarterback. Behind closed doors, Mom and Dad hate each other. I thought they\u2019d get over it. Now...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot playing college ball,\u201d Mark says. \u201cWhat you do in high school doesn\u2019t mean shit. You can be the best ballplayer in your high school. The best in the county or state, but when you get to college, you\u2019re going to meet fifty other guys who can brag the same thing. You\u2019ll meet guys better than you, stronger than you, faster than you, and then you\u2019re up against better teams. The world changes when you leave Groveton.\u201d</p><p>When I leave Groveton. Decisions need to be made before that can happen: pros, college, literary competitions, scholarships. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish someone would have told me, but I had to figure it out on my own. You\u2019re not alone, Ry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d And my eyes burn. I close them quickly and suck in a breath. He left. And Mom and Dad\u2019s marriage is falling apart and everything I have ever known and loved is disintegrating into ashes.</p><p>\u201cI never left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t come home. You never answered my texts.\u201d The voice falling out of my mouth isn\u2019t my own. It\u2019s strained. Tight.</p><p>On the verge of breaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have to understand, until Mom or Dad reach out to me, I can\u2019t go back.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit, I left them. But I get it now. I should have tried harder when it came to you. I should have called. I should have visited. I messed up, but I swear, I never left you.\u201d</p><p>I pull off my cap and run my hand through my hair. He never left me. Beth\u2019s right\u2014I left him. My throat thickens. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d I shake my head, trying to find a way to say the next words. \u201cI never cared that you\u2019re gay, but I cared that you...that you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice becomes gruff. \u201cI know.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, Ry. Me and you, we\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He stands and the action takes me off guard.</p><p>We\u2019re Stones and Stone men don\u2019t touch, but the moment he puts his hand on my arm, a tentative offer, I accept and allow him to pull me into his body. Our arms wind tight around each other for one brief second. I squint my eyes to combat the tears and when we release, we both retreat to opposite sides of the room.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Mark clears his throat and claps his hands together. \u201cTell me about Beth.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>I DID GOOD. Me, Beth Risk\u2014I did a good deed.</p><p>I would have made a great fucking girl scout and I so would have scored the Reunite Your Jock-Sorta-Boyfriend with His Jock-Gay-Brother badge. If they don\u2019t make those, they seriously should. Ryan will look back in twenty years and not think of the girl that left in the dead of night. Nope, he\u2019ll remember the girl that gave him back his brother.</p><p>I stare up at the gray clouds moving across the sky. Ryan and I lie on the banks of a large pond located on the back end of his father\u2019s property. Just like everything else about Ryan, this spot is perfect. This day is perfect.</p><p>Propped up on an elbow, Ryan tucks a stray hair behind my ear, causing a warming tickle to caress my neck. I\u2019m going to enjoy myself today. I\u2019m going to laugh. I\u2019m going to smile.</p><p>I\u2019m going to drop the chains that drag me down. Ryan\u2019s a great guy and for some reason, he\u2019s really into me. Or better, he\u2019s really into the mirage he\u2019s created.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d He truly is. I reach up and take the baseball cap he\u2019s been wearing backward off his head. He\u2019s hot with his hat on. He\u2019s gorgeous with it off. His mop of sandy hair blows with the breeze.</p><p>When I release the cap from my grasp, Ryan twines his strong hand with mine. Strong is an understatement. This hand can make a ball fly faster than most cars will ever go. His hand on my skin can make warmth curl in very private areas of my body.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Ryan says as he glances away and attempts to look nonchalant. I know what\u2019s eating him. On the way back from Lexington, he gave me more of his zombie story to read.</p><p>Waiting for my thoughts drives him insane. \u201cI think George and Olivia will end up together.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes. He couldn\u2019t go five minutes outside his Jeep without asking. I try to keep from smiling, but I fail miserably. He catches it and his forehead furrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it about you.\u201d I like everything about Ryan. \u201cThe story was fabulous. Really. I\u2019m sucked in when I read it, but I have to disagree with you. George and Olivia will not end up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey live in two different worlds and they\u2019re sort of two different creatures. I mean\u2014he\u2019s a zombie and she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he loves her,\u201d he says doggedly. \u201cAnd she loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge is going to walk away from becoming the leader of his zombie friends for her?\u201d I ask. \u201cCome on, you have him wanting to be the leader so badly that he crossed his best friend for the title. And do you honestly believe Olivia is going to walk away from her family for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer family sucks.\u201d Ryan grins as if he won.</p><p>My stomach hurts like someone stabbed me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still her family. I don\u2019t think I could like her if she walked away. What does that say about a person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it says she\u2019s willing to live her own life.\u201d</p><p>Overhead, honking Canadian geese fly in a V formation and head south for the winter.</p><p>That\u2019ll be me soon, but will I feel as free as they look? \u201cI think it says she\u2019s selfish. How can she walk away from her dad? He needs her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe uses her,\u201d says Ryan.</p><p>I shrug again, not a fan of conversations that go nowhere. Ryan loosens his grip on my hand and begins to trace the ribbon tied to my wrist.</p><p>He\u2019s nervous and something deep within me nudges that it\u2019s not about the story. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>My anxiety level increases as Ryan continues to outline the ribbon.</p><p>\u201cI want us to be permanent,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you dating other guys.\u201d</p><p>Panic seizes my chest and I feel suddenly claustrophobic. I\u2019m leaving. Soon. As soon as Mom gets the car out of impoundment. A clamminess invades my hands and I immediately roll away from Ryan. I need air.</p><p>Lots and lots of air.</p><p>I stumble to the edge of the pond and catch myself before I plummet down the two-foot ledge into the water. Catfish swim near the surface. I can\u2019t get rid of the chains, no matter how hard I try. Today was supposed to be the one day I didn\u2019t feel like I was drowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ryan asks from behind me.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d He stops, then starts again. \u201cI really care for you and I was hoping you felt the same way.\u201d</p><p>A single drop of rain hits the pond and ripples break onto the smooth water. He can\u2019t have feelings for me. He can\u2019t. Liking me is one thing\u2014feeling is another. It doesn\u2019t fit with the plan. No. This isn\u2019t how it was supposed to go.</p><p>I knead my hands against my eyes. Fuck, Beth, how did you think this was going to go?</p><p>You knew you were falling for him, but he wasn\u2019t supposed to fall for you. His words make everything real. Too real. I spin around and spit out the accusation that has become my mantra. \u201cGuys like you don\u2019t fall for girls like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t fall for pretty girls with smart mouths?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cI\u2019m a whore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan\u2019s head flinches as if I slapped him.</p><p>Pretending I don\u2019t care what he thinks about me, I jut out my chin. Fairy tales happen, just not to me. Time to tell the prince he rescued the wrong girl.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, the guy every girl dreamed about spent an entire summer making me feel special. A week before school started, he told me he loved me, and I gave him my virginity.</p><p>When school began, he told his friends I was a slut.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan reaches out and I lean away. Some pain isn\u2019t meant to be shared. I was the idiot who believed Luke. I was the one who honestly thought I was special enough to be loved.</p><p>\u201cHe took advantage of you.\u201d An undercurrent of anger surges in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you a whore, that makes him an asshole.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s missing the point. \u201cI drink. I smoke pot. Before I came to Groveton, I was high all the time. I am not the girl you want to be permanent with. You don\u2019t see me for who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you turned down the chance to smoke pot on Saturday. I know the rumors at school say you\u2019ve turned down the guys who smoke that shit endlessly. I know that you walk a straighter line than most of the kids at school.</p> <p>This is a small town, Beth. You can\u2019t breathe without someone knowing. I don\u2019t know who you pretended to be in Louisville, but I see the girl you really are now.\u201d</p><p>The way he stares at me\u2014it\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t even see the outside anymore. His eyes pierce me as if he can see my soul and the thought terrifies me. He can\u2019t fall for me. He can\u2019t. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re the only guy I\u2019ve made out with because I wanted to feel something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was different,\u201d he says with confidence.</p><p>I swallow, look away, and lie, \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ryan steps toward me and I step back. He\u2019s not reacting like he should. Ryan should be disgusted by me. He should be walking away, not coming closer. Hope lights his face. \u201cYou are the one person who can have an entire conversation with someone and stare straight into their eyes and never blink. That is, unless you\u2019re lying. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. You fell for me that night in the barn.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart to his and I curse internally when he smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s why you bolted.\u201d</p> <p>How can someone experience so much joy when I\u2019m in so much agony? Doesn\u2019t he understand we aren\u2019t going to work?</p><p>\u201cYou felt something for me and you didn\u2019t want to. You wanted a mindless hookup, but it blew up in your face.\u201d</p><p>I can see the memory of the night playing in his eyes, and my chest aches. He\u2019s on the verge of figuring it out. His eyebrows shoot up. \u201cYou bolted when I whispered your name. You felt something for me right then, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>My head shakes back and forth as I whisper, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Relief softens his face and a hint of hope lifts his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re falling for me like I\u2019m falling for you. That\u2019s why you\u2019re pushing me so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Filled with the need to flee, I turn. If I run fast enough, I can leave behind the awful memories of my past and Ryan\u2019s beautiful words can never wind their way into my soul. I step into air. My heart races to my throat as I fall forward. The pond.</p><p>Terrified of the water, I scream. Strong arms weave around my waist and pull me to solid ground.</p><p>I lean my back into Ryan\u2019s chest and clutch his arms. My fingernails dig into his skin like hooks. If I fall in, I\u2019m going to drown. The weights upon me are too heavy to stay afloat.</p> <p>My only option is to sink.</p><p>I suck in a few breaths and after I take one longer one, Ryan lowers his head to my ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking. Fine doesn\u2019t mean you shake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t swim, but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t swim,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A drop of rain lands on my head and slithers down my scalp. \u201cWe should go.\u201d The day is ruined. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rain.\u201d</p><p>Ryan loosens his grip on me and within seconds, he sweeps me into the air and cradles me against his chest. My face is devastatingly close to his. I blink several times. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he jumps into the pond.</p><p>Dizziness overcomes me and my blood pressure tanks. Water rises and smacks my face, my hair, my clothing. My arms strangle his neck. I\u2019m going to drown. \u201cRyan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he says in a calm tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He wades deeper into the cold water.</p><p>Gravity calls for me to slide out of his arms and become constrained by the water below.</p><p>I\u2019ll suffocate with my eyes open. My hold on him tightens. \u201cTake me back!\u201d</p><p>Water penetrates my shoes, my jeans, the back of my shirt. It pours over my stomach and I grow heavier and heavier. Cold wetness teases my skin\u2014calling out a hateful, mimicking laugh. I bury my head in the crook of his neck. I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t.</p><p>He stops and whispers into my ear, \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have the strength to lift my head.</p><p>Instead, I ease it to his shoulder and open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to float.\u201d</p><p>I tighten my grip. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I whisper. I trusted Scott, my mother, and my father. I trusted Luke, my aunt, and Isaiah. All people who left me. All people who faded into darkness. My heart has been ripped multiple times and each time I repaired it on my own. I know my limits and if someone rips me apart again, I\u2019ll never find the strength to pick up the pieces.</p><p>An intensity warms his brown eyes and he gently hugs my body to his. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath. Ryan\u2019s doing it. He\u2019s giving me the same look Chris gives Lacy. The same look Noah gives Echo. Maybe I can. My heart thunders as I reach up and grab the hair curling near the base of Ryan\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t drop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice is so soothing\u2014so confident\u2014I almost believe him. Maybe I can believe him. He won\u2019t drop me. He\u2019ll hold me.</p><p>He swore it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to let go,\u201d he says.</p><p>One breath. Another. He won\u2019t let me go. I loosen my grip and Ryan immediately lowers his arms. Water floods over my body and laps against his chest. My head snaps up and I kick and splash to stay above water. Panic commands my lungs. He\u2019s taller than me, which means I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand in the water. \u201cTake me back.\u201d</p><p>Ryan lowers his forehead to mine. His warm breath fans over my face. \u201cI will never let you go.\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t let me go. He won\u2019t. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ryan skims his nose along my cheek and goose bumps rise on my neck. He pulls his head back. I fight the urge to cling to him.</p><p>Ryan said he wouldn\u2019t drop me and he won\u2019t.</p><p>He won\u2019t.</p><p>My hair becomes weightless in the water and licks my cheeks. Ryan\u2019s strong arms reaffirm his promise to me. \u201cTilt your head back,\u201d he says.</p><p>I inhale and do as he asks. Water enters my ears and my muscles flinch with fear. Ryan keeps his firm hold. \u201cSpread your arms to your sides and arch your back. Let your legs float.\u201d</p><p>As I slowly follow instructions, Ryan steps from me. I jerk toward him. \u201cRyan!\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not letting go. I\u2019m giving you room. Keep your head tilted back.\u201d</p><p>Head tilted back. Arms and legs spread out.</p><p>My pulse throbs in my ears. Ryan\u2019s voice is muffled, but I can read his lips. \u201cRelax. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>Relax. Head tilted back. Arms and legs spread out. Breathe. I stare at the clouds overhead and the trees hanging over the pond.</p><p>Relax. Head tilted back. Arms and legs spread out. Breathe.</p><p>A pair of birds circle in the sky. It\u2019s a playful dance. They spread their wings and let the gentle wind pull them up and over. Down and around. God, I wish I was free. I wish I was a bird floating in the breeze. I close my eyes and pretend I\u2019m a bird. My muscles melt. The water makes a rhythmic swishing melody in my ears. Away and near. Away and near.</p><p>I\u2019m a bird\u2014floating on the breeze. A gentle nudge in the back of my mind whispers that I know this feeling. I\u2019ve owned this feeling for years. This feeling of drifting, swaying, floating. I\u2019m floating. Through the water I hear Ryan\u2019s sweet muffled voice: \u201cYou\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and see that glorious smile on his lips. The smile that is for me. Me alone. I go to smile back and I realize I already am. I\u2019m smiling. My stomach clenches and the chains return. Oh God, no. I\u2019ve fallen in love with him. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve given him power over me.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>BETH IS A BEAUTIFUL FLOATING VISION. Her black hair drifts on the surface of the water and the peaceful smile I love graces her lips. Her eyes no longer have their glazed guard. They are as calm and deep as the ocean. For the first time ever, Beth is letting me see her soul and if I had any doubts before, they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m in love with Beth Risk.</p><p>Beth blinks and the smile fades. Several raindrops plop into the pond and the sound of the incoming storm taps against the trees. Beth sinks and I catch her before her head goes under.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Her grip isn\u2019t nearly as tight as I carry her onto the shore. The light rain becomes steady and quickly saturates my hair.</p><p>I place Beth on her feet and my heart plummets. She\u2019s slammed shut her walls.</p><p>She pivots on her feet and darts toward Scott\u2019s tree line. Beth trusted me in the water.</p><p>She cares for me. I know it. The promise I made to her is forever\u2014I will not let her go. I chase after her and grab her by her waist before she steps into the woods. \u201cDammit, Beth! Stop running from me!\u201d</p><p>My pulse hammers through my body. She\u2019s been running from me from the moment I met her. No matter how hard I try to hold on to her, she finds a way to slip out of my grasp.</p><p>Not anymore. Not today.</p><p>Water streaks down her cheeks and her hair clings to her head. She shivers violently in the warm fall storm. I rub my hands up and down her arms.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she again yells over the rain.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I move my hand to her cheek. Those eyes that looked so peaceful moments before are crazy with panic. I want her to trust me. I want her to feel what I\u2019m feeling. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Please. Just don\u2019t!\u201d Her lower lip trembles and she unsuccessfully smacks at the hand holding her waist.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re fighting me. What are you scared of?\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s fingernails dig into the skin of my arm. \u201cI\u2019m scared of nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say again and Beth\u2019s panic rises in intensity. She pushes at my arms. The words scare her. She\u2019s scared of love. \u201cI love you, Beth.\u201d</p><p>She raises her face and fire rages in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Without meaning to, I shake her gently. I want her to say it back. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you. Tell me why I can\u2019t say it to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ll leave!\u201d she screams.</p><p>Beth\u2019s chest heaves as if she ran a race. My hold on her tightens. Rain beats against the pond and the trees, creating a strange deafness from the world surrounding us.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d Never. Leaving her would be like tearing off my own arm. I\u2019ve never been in love before. I thought I had been, but I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>This overwhelming, encompassing feeling is love. It\u2019s not perfect and it\u2019s messy as hell. And it\u2019s exactly what I need.</p> <p>She steps back and the pouring rain makes it impossible to keep my grip on her slick arms, but I do my best to hold on. My heart aches.</p><p>Beth\u2019s doing it again. She\u2019s walking away.</p><p>Desperation seizes my muscles. If she leaves, I\u2019ll lose her for good and I can\u2019t. Not when I just found her. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gypsy soul.\u201d Beth yanks her hands out of my grasp and stumbles backward. \u201cWe won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Why is she always slipping through my fingers? \u201cYou\u2019re the one leaving me. Not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>She wraps her hands over her stomach as she continues to walk backward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Anger erupts from deep inside and takes control. I don\u2019t lose and I won\u2019t lose her. Beth turns and runs for the forest. She\u2019s fast, but I\u2019m faster. I grab Beth by the waist, yank her to face me, tunnel my fingers into her hair, and kiss her.</p><p>She tastes like fresh rain and smells like crushed roses. I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s not kissing back. I move my lips against hers and hug her body to mine. I love Beth and she needs to know that. Know it in her head. More importantly, know it in her heart.</p><p>Her fingers lightly tickle my neck as I taste her warm lips. She answers by hesitantly kissing my lower lip. Beth tilts her head and we both open our mouths. Her tongue meets mine and I swear the world explodes around us. Her hands tangle in my wet hair and she presses her body into me. She roams my back, and my fingers hungrily touch the soft contours of her waist, then drift lower, gliding along the curves of her thighs. I won\u2019t let her go. I won\u2019t.</p><p>I love her.</p><p>Beth gasps for air as she pulls my head closer to her body. My lips trail kisses down her neck and I savor each delicious taste of her skin.</p> <p>Her hands slide to my chest, curl into fists, and she pushes me away as she takes a step back. \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d And she runs off into the rain.</p><p>I\u2019VE STARED AT THE COMPUTER since ten. At eleven, I\u2019m still staring. The cursor blinks on and off. I\u2019ve got no words. The decision has to be made. Do George the zombie and Olivia the human fall in love and stay together, or is Beth right? Am I forcing my characters into something so unrealistic that no reader would ever believe it?</p><p>My cell vibrates again. I glance at it in anticipation. Maybe it\u2019s Beth. I sink lower in my chair. It\u2019s Gwen. Again.</p><p>Gwen: why aren\u2019t you answering?</p><p>Because I\u2019m not in love with you. She\u2019s not used to being denied. I\u2019m not used to denying her and her constant barrage of texts and calls throughout the night shoves the knife further into my windpipe. I\u2019m in love with a girl who doesn\u2019t love me back.</p><p>Part of me wants to answer Gwen and go back to my previous life. Nothing was complicated then. Nothing hurt too much or seemed confusing. Everything was planned.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>On the outside, that is. How did I miss that everything internal was a mess? My parents.</p> <p>Mark. Me and Gwen. Lacy. Is Chris a mess?</p><p>Logan? How many more of us are faking the facade? How many more of us are pretending to be something we\u2019re not? Even better, how many of us will have the courage to be ourselves regardless of what others think?</p><p>I flip off my computer screen and the overhead light, yank off my shirt, and lie down in bed, even though I know sleep won\u2019t come.</p><p>The problem with feeling too much is how the hurt consumes every part of me. A slow agonizing throb aches in my head.</p><p>Rain continues to beat against the roof. A storm front that was supposed to hit tomorrow flew into the area today and stalled out over town. Part of me doesn\u2019t want the storm to pass. This was our rain\u2014mine and Beth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>I jerk up at the sweet sound of Beth\u2019s voice coming from the other side of my open window. My fingers fumble with the screen and it bangs against the house as it falls to the ground. I hold my hand out to her and help as she swings one drenched jean-clad leg over the frame, then the other.</p><p>The dim light from my alarm clock casts a strange blue shadow over Beth as she shakes uncontrollably next to the window. Her wet hair clings to her head and her clothes cleave to her body. Drops of rain slither down her face and her teeth chatter. \u201cI hhaadd ttoo sseee youu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, use this to towel off.\u201d I drape a blanket around her shoulders, stare at her to convince myself she\u2019s really here, then rummage through my drawer. I pull out a T-shirt and a pair of cotton sweatpants and hand them to her. In one quick motion, I turn.</p><p>\u201cChange. I promise I won\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>Though I want to. She\u2019s here and I\u2019ll do anything to keep her from running. Beth feels like this storm. Constant and persistent as a whole, but the more I get close and try to clutch the individual drops of rain, the more the water falls out of my hands.</p><p>I hear the sound of wet material stubbornly moving against her skin and then the sound of cotton being tugged over her head. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says in a small voice.</p><p>I suck in a breath and suppress the groan.</p><p>She\u2019s absolutely killing me. My T-shirt ends at the middle of her bare thighs. \u201cAre you going to put the pants on?\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019ll just fall off.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I force my eyes to her face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d About us.</p><p>Beth fidgets with the hem of my T-shirt. \u201cI can\u2019t say it back.\u201d</p><p>And she crushes me into nothing.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d</p><p>Hope. A single thread exists and it keeps Beth and me alive. \u201cBecause you want to love me or because you do?\u201d</p><p>She straightens out the shirt and runs her fingers through her hair. \u201cWhat if I do? Feel that way?\u201d</p><p>I let her words sink in. Beth loves me. My heart settles and I swallow to find my bearings.</p><p>\u201cBecause if I do...\u201d She stalls and I start to wonder if her trembling is from the cold or from her emotions. \u201cAnd you...\u201d Beth sucks in air, then lifts her head so that her eyes plead with mine. \u201cI can\u2019t say it, but I...I want to be here...with you.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re still on shaky ground\u2014Beth and I. If I do the wrong thing, she\u2019ll bolt. The rain picks up and patters harder against the roof. My ribbon clings to her wrist. Beth doesn\u2019t believe in the unseen. She needs a physical reminder that I mean what I say.</p><p>My eyes dart around the room and discover the perfect object on my dresser. I brush past Beth, grab the clear bottle, and pour the scant remains of cologne out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks as if I lost my mind. Who knows, I probably have.</p><p>I hold the bottle out into the rain and watch as the steady flow slowly fills it. When there is enough, enough that Beth can clearly see, I close the bottle and hand it to her.</p><p>She raises a skeptical eyebrow, but accepts the bottle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our rain, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Her head barely shakes to show her confusion while I rub the back of my neck and search for my courage. \u201cI told you I loved you in this rain and when you doubt my words, I want you to look at this bottle.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s forehead wrinkles and she stares at the gift I\u2019ve given her. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d she starts. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d I answer. \u201cIt\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tighten around the bottle. \u201cI still can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Beth crawls onto my bed and I join her by lying like we did the first night she came to my room. If she needs space, I\u2019ll give her space.</p><p>This time, Beth immediately places her head on me. The bare skin of my chest screams in protest of her cold, wet hair. I focus on not flinching or shivering. I won\u2019t give her a reason to turn away.</p><p>Her arm relaxes over my stomach and, in her hand, she clutches the bottle of rain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she says.</p><p>Are her running days over? Am I handing my heart to a girl who\u2019s going to break it? I choose not to think about it and instead wrap my arms tighter around Beth and bring her closer to me. \u201cSo am I. But we\u2019ll be okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could really hurt me if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d she whispers, and there\u2019s heartfelt sincerity in her voice that tells me everything I want to hear. My heart explodes and a surging, powerful warmth rushes through my bloodstream. She loves me. I know she does.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I kiss the top of her head, never feeling so complete in my life.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She willingly molds her body to mine. We snuggle closer together and I shut my eyes, welcoming sleep. Beth\u2019s here and she\u2019s mine and I silently promise to never let go.</p><p>Beth</p><p>SITTING ON THE BED of Logan\u2019s truck, Ryan keeps me tucked close between his legs and his hands rest on the sides of my hips. Ryan\u2019s sweatshirt wraps around me like a minidress and the heat from his body protects me from the chilly autumn Friday evening. He\u2019s enveloped me in a small, warm bubble. Wood in the bonfire crackles and snaps and creates a rich scent that relaxes me. I cuddle against him, and the deep rhythmic vibrations of his voice lull me into a sense of ease. Ryan has created the sensation of comforter-out-of-the-dryer warmth.</p><p>He runs his hand through my hair and whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re falling asleep. Do you want me to take you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d I pretend that he will hold me forever. Today, I called Mom before gym. Like always, good news comes with bad. She got the car out of the impoundment lot, but she also bailed Trent out of jail and she was somehow shocked that jail hadn\u2019t changed his thunderstorm disposition. She asked me to come get her a week from Monday\u2014after her social security check comes in. I have ten days left with Ryan.</p><p>Ryan kisses the top of my head and returns to the same discussion he and his friends have had every day at lunch\u2014baseball playoffs.</p><p>Lacy sits next to me in the same exact position with Chris. She drinks from a longneck. \u201cI\u2019m happy you and Ryan are together. It\u2019s nice to be around someone else who never says the word baseball.\u201d Lacy takes another drink and shakes her head. \u201cI take that back\u2014not someone else. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s buzzing. I\u2019m not. It\u2019s strange to be at a party and not be blitzed. The past two weeks have been strange. Now that Ryan has done whatever popular people do to announce their commitments, his friends treat me like one of their own and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it.</p><p>I mean\u2014they\u2019re jocks. All the guys standing around or sitting on this truck are big, huge, can\u2019t-stop-talking-about-baseball jocks. None of them has made me feel inconsequential or like a freak. They\u2019re nothing like Luke and his friends, who drank every chance they got. Not one of these guys has touched alcohol tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ryan and his friends have an early-morning game and they want to be at one hundred percent.</p><p>Lacy holds out her hand and waves it until I take it. \u201cI\u2019m happy I have a best friend again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Chris swings Lacy into his arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s talking sentimental, which means it\u2019s time to dance.\u201d With her laughing uncontrollably, he carries her to the crowd dancing near the bonfire.</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s lips graze my earlobe, sending seductive shivers through my body. \u201cWalk with me?\u201d</p><p>Anywhere. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ryan jumps off the bed of the truck and when I scoot to the end of the tailgate, he places his hands on my hips to help me down. I don\u2019t need the help. I\u2019m perfectly capable of getting myself down, but I enjoy the feel of his hands on me. His warmth burns through my clothes and onto my skin.</p><p>He lifts me and my body slowly slides against his. I want to kiss him and from the hunger smoldering in his eyes, he feels the same way. He takes my hand in his and leads me away from the bonfire, away from other people, into the woods, and into a world of our own.</p><p>The moon creates a silvery glow and the babble of the creek gives the moment a mystical quality. The darkness isn\u2019t so frightening with Ryan. With him I can believe that I am a princess with a wreath of flowers and ribbons crowning my head and he is my prince sworn to protect me from the evils in the night.</p> <p>Ryan releases my hand and turns his baseball cap to wear it backward, a sure sign he\u2019s going to kiss me. My insides flutter. The enduring cockiness that exudes from Ryan fades and he shoves his hands in his pockets while shifting. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do the writing competition, but I am now. I talked to Coach today and told him I\u2019m not playing next Saturday\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you have done the competition?\u201d I\u2019m confused. Ryan has a gift. Why wouldn\u2019t he use it?</p><p>\u201cMy dad, he didn\u2019t want...\u201d Ryan shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not important. You\u2019ve opened my eyes to a lot of things and I wanted to let you know that you\u2019re a big part of this. A huge part.\u201d He shrugs and for the first time I see Ryan unsure of himself. It\u2019s an odd thing to watch from someone who is always nothing less than perfection.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d Some lives are blessed.</p><p>His is. Mine isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure how I helped, but at least he\u2019ll have another good memory of me. I have ten days to tuck in as many good memories as I can for the both of us. I don\u2019t want him to hate me forever. I want him to look back on our time together and smile.</p><p>Ryan sucks in a deep breath and his continued track down the path of uncomfortable makes me restless. \u201cMy parents are going to be out of town for a week starting tomorrow. They won\u2019t be back until next Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>Awesome. \u201cI get to use the front door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If you want. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want you to come...I mean I want you to sleep with me...I mean.\u201d Ryan swears under his breath. \u201cI want you at my house if you want to be there.\u201d</p><p>If it was anyone else stumbling through that awkwardness, I\u2019d laugh, but it\u2019s Ryan, so I choke on the chuckles. \u201cAre you asking me to have sex?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen. \u201cNo. I would never ask that.</p><p>I mean, I would. Someday. Now if I could. But no. No. We\u2019ll wait. Ah hell, Beth, can I screw this up any more than I already have?\u201d</p><p>I smile at the word screw and Ryan catches it. He says a word I thought only pops out of my mouth. Ryan\u2019s cheeks turn red and the blush on his face makes me blush. God, we\u2019re standing here acting like two virgins.</p><p>In fact, this whole week we\u2019ve acted like virgins. We do this uncomfortable dance when I slip into his room and climb into his bed. He waits forever to kiss me, no matter how many signals I give. And when we do kiss\u2014the fire between us is hotter than flames in hell. Then we reach certain points where neither one of us seem to want to cross the line. I\u2019m used to guys pushing forward. I guess I could cross the lines, but the thought frightens me. Such a squeamish-little-girl feeling makes me want to slap myself. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never seen a guy\u2019s penis before.</p><p>Ryan readjusts his hat and I tilt my head as I understand the agony marring his beautiful face. \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin,\u201d I say.</p> <p>I curse internally when Ryan flips his hat back and yanks the bill hard over his face. Go ahead, Beth, embarrass the boy a little more.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you ask him if he has a small dick, too? Talk about screwing things up. This is not the memory I want Ryan to have of me, but the knowledge he\u2019s supplied will ensure I can give him something he\u2019ll never forget: his first time.</p><p>I close the distance between us. He\u2019s stiff when I wrap my arms around him and press my cheek against his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t care. In fact, it makes you more perfect.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sighs loudly, but his body relaxes under my touch. His strong hands caress my back and weave through my hair. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d Chris yells close to the tree line.</p><p>\u201cGet your sorry ass over here. Logan took on a dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d mumbles Ryan. He keeps his arm around my shoulder and leads me back into the pasture.</p><p>Logan stands beside Chris and wears a crazy grin on his face. \u201cDo you still have those bungee cords in your Jeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ryan answers hesitantly.</p><p>An excited gleam that frightens even me sparkles in Logan\u2019s eyes. \u201cGreat. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chris and Logan head toward the parked cars. I nudge Ryan when he stays still. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>He traces circles on my arm. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me if you want to hang with your friends.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity swims in his eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure if you noticed, but sometimes I prefer to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Ryan flips his hat back around, leans down, and his kiss warms areas that sweatshirts can\u2019t touch. The second his lips leave mine, he pulls his baseball cap off and places it on top of my head. He laughs as the bill falls forward and covers my face. Not wanting him to take it back, I spin it and wear it backward. \u201cYou have a big head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just small.\u201d</p><p>With pride, I watch Ryan stride across the pasture. He\u2019s a natural athlete with his broad shoulders and strong arms. My heart dances.</p><p>For the next ten days\u2014he\u2019s mine.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you let Ryan put that hat on your head. He sweats in it.\u201d Gwen emerges from the darkness and I immediately think of my fear of demons waiting in the shadows, ready to grab me in the dead of night.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was you I\u2019d want to hide my hair too,\u201d she says, standing unusually close to me.</p><p>I\u2019m going soft if she thinks she\u2019s safe speaking to me that way. Allison would love this chick. They share the same awful taste in clothes. \u201cI remember pushing you to the ground and making you cry in elementary school for fucking with Lacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you wearing the same damn dress with holes and those pathetic ribbons.\u201d</p><p>She stares at my wrist, then at my jeans. \u201cI see your tastes haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cBut Ryan\u2019s have.\u201d</p><p>Her face reddens and I smile. Damn, I really enjoy being me. I give her credit\u2014Gwen quickly rejoins the game. \u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to be helpful. Rumor at school says Ryan is only with you over a dare. Ryan and his friends take dares very seriously and he\u2019d string you along in order to win. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a good guy, but he\u2019s a guy, you know? I would hate to see you take a fall once the dare\u2019s complete.\u201d</p><p>My entire body tenses. It\u2019s the truth. He did ask me out on a dare, but I\u2019m not a dare anymore. I\u2019m not. \u201cWow, Gwen. Thanks for your concern. Is this where you ask me to braid your hair and then we\u2019ll giggle about getting to first base with a boy?\u201d</p><p>Gwen twines her golden hair around a finger. I should bring her over to Scott as Exhibit B for why I hate blondes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be your friend, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to be my friend, you wouldn\u2019t have tried to slip your tongue in Ryan\u2019s mouth last Tuesday when you cornered him after baseball practice.\u201d</p><p>Blood drains from her face and I darkly chuckle to rub in her embarrassment. She didn\u2019t think he would tell me. \u201cDo I sound like a dare now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you dropped out of the homecoming court yet? They\u2019re going to take yearbook pictures next week, so this would be the time to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dropping out.\u201d I\u2019ll be leaving soon, but I won\u2019t drop out. Ryan wowed me and I lost the dare. I have ten days to keep my word to him.</p><p>Gwen eyes me coolly. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want the nomination.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to win,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>My spine straightens. \u201cDo I look like I give a fuck what people think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause Ryan does. If you cared for him, you\u2019d walk away.\u201d</p><p>Gwen doesn\u2019t wait for me to reply. She tosses that sickening yellow hair over her shoulder and struts away like she\u2019s queen.</p><p>Unwanted demons race into my mind, taunting me with her words. I\u2019m only a dare. Ryan doesn\u2019t love me. I\u2019m no good for him.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe she\u2019s wrong.</p><p>None of it matters. I\u2019m here for ten days and even if that wasn\u2019t the case, I have a bottle of rain to prove her wrong.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>CHRIS AND I BYPASS a woman with three screaming children and an old guy guarding the shopping carts. It\u2019s Tuesday evening and at Chris\u2019s insistence, I drove the two of us into Louisville so we could shop at the Super Wal-Mart.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why we\u2019re here?\u201d I ask. We have a Wal-Mart near the freeway back in Groveton, but it\u2019s a much smaller version and thirty years older.</p><p>\u201cWe know the people who work at our WalMart. More importantly, our parents know the people who work there.\u201d Chris swings to the right, away from the food section and toward the pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep Beth a secret from your parents, right?\u201d</p><p>I cringe when he says it that way, but in the end, it\u2019s the truth. I want Beth to be my girl in every aspect of my life, but I need to pick my battles. I\u2019m going to nail the writing competition, make the decision regarding going pro or going to college, then own up to keeping Beth. \u201cWhat does that have to do with Wal-Mart?\u201d</p><p>Chris cuts into an aisle and waves his hand at the merchandise in front of him. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Condoms. Everywhere. I scratch the back of my neck and try to think of anything to say, but there isn\u2019t a statement that could make this moment less uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou need condoms,\u201d says Chris.</p><p>Chris and I engulf the entire cramped aisle in front of the pharmacy. The middle-aged woman with the three kids eyes us as she walks past. \u201cI\u2019m taking it slow with Beth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSlow wasn\u2019t the position I caught the two of you in yesterday. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy, but none of us are going to be happy if little Ryans and Beths pop out of that girl.\u201d</p><p>Point taken. Sex may not be in the plan, but it\u2019s best to be prepared. \u201cWhat do you use?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cThe normal shit. Are you going to do it? The writing competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The normal shit. That narrows it down. I survey the assortment before me.</p> <p>Colored, ribbed, lubricated, and because this experience isn\u2019t God-awful enough\u2014they have sizes.</p><p>\u201cWe need you against Eastwick,\u201d Chris says flatly. \u201cWe\u2019re a game behind Northside so we need two wins in order to move into first place.</p><p>If we don\u2019t win against Eastwick on Saturday, then it doesn\u2019t matter if we win or lose against Northside on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t play fully for both games anyhow.</p><p>There\u2019s a state law about how many innings I can pitch, remember?\u201d How the hell am I supposed to know what size I am? I don\u2019t go around staring at guys\u2019 dicks. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m small and I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t buy small even if I was. A guy has to have some pride.</p> <p>\u201cBut you could guarantee us the win on Saturday against Eastwick, then play the later innings against Northside. You\u2019ve dug us out of a hole before in later innings and if we get low on Monday, you could dig us out. Get the glow-in-the-dark ones. I bet Beth\u2019s into freaky shit.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenches. \u201cBeth is not into freaky shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her tattoo. She\u2019s a freaky shit kind of girl. Look, I get that you don\u2019t want to back out of a competition, even if it is writing, but I\u2019m not going to lie. You\u2019re scaring the team.</p><p>You\u2019re the leader, dawg, and what does it say when our leader walks from a game? The guys are starting to question if you\u2019re losing your edge.\u201d</p><p>I zero in on Chris. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Chris meets my glare and I discover he\u2019s one of the \u201cguys.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you walk from a dare in my life and you walked from the one with Beth. You just gave up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give up. I fell for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. You could have bagged the dare by bringing her to the next party, but you threw down the white flag the moment you hooked up with her. She\u2019s got her hooks in you and I want to make sure she\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>Not liking the tone or turn of this conversation, I fold my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s muscles ripple as he inches near me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed since she\u2019s come to Groveton and I\u2019m not sure I like it. It was us and baseball\u2014what you used to care about. Then she comes around and it\u2019s me, you, Beth, writing, and sometimes baseball. You never once talked about going to college and now you want to walk from the pros. Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Who the hell am I? Who the hell is the guy in front of me? I step within swinging distance and, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m willing to hit my best friend. \u201cI\u2019m the same damn guy who\u2019s led this team year after year and I\u2019m the same damn guy who encouraged you to date our best friend. I can\u2019t help it you never looked close enough to see I could be more than a man with a ball and a bat.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. Unblinking.</p> <p>Unmoving. Until Chris flexes his fingers and gestures to a box of studded condoms. \u201cThat\u2019s some freaky shit too.\u201d</p><p>I pull on the bill of my hat. What the hell?</p><p>Part of me wants to punch him. Part of me wants to ask what just happened between us. I go the easy route and let Chris off the hook.</p><p>\u201cShow me what you get.\u201d</p><p>What if she is into freaky shit? What if she wants ribbed? When do you need lubricated? I don\u2019t even want to think about the kind that says they\u2019ll make her tingle.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have a latex allergy? That could suck if she does. I\u2019ve heard stories of girls puffing up like blowfish and having to be rushed to the emergency room.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I\u2019m messing with you, but I\u2019d ask about the latex allergy before you put it on.\u201d</p><p>Two teenage girls walk down the aisle. One sips on a slushy and twirls her hair. They glance at each other and giggle. Heat rises on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not you, Ry,\u201d Chris says after they round the corner. \u201cI\u2019m not going to college and I don\u2019t have the pros knocking on my door.</p><p>Winning state this year, that\u2019s my dream, and I need you in order to complete it. Promise me that you won\u2019t let anything get in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>Since I was seven years old I\u2019ve glanced to my right and seen Chris backing me up between third and second. He saved plays I screwed up because of my pitch. My insides twist with the startling revelation\u2014regardless of the path I choose, come graduation,</p><p>Chris isn\u2019t going to be the guy on my right anymore. \u201cYou guys can take Eastwick without me and you know it. Northside is the team with the hitters. In the spring, we\u2019re going to state.</p><p>The only game I\u2019m missing is Saturday and I wouldn\u2019t walk away if I didn\u2019t believe that you guys have it covered.\u201d</p><p>Chris studies me and I silently urge him to be okay with this. He\u2019s my best friend and I need us to be okay. He offers me his hand and I exhale.</p><p>\u201cSwear it, dawg.\u201d</p><p>I clasp it. \u201cSworn.\u201d</p><p>An easy grin spreads across his face. \u201cPick something out and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I try one more time. \u201cTell me what you get.\u201d</p><p>Chris places his hands on his hips. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought condoms before. Lacy wants to wait until we graduate.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>IT\u2019S FRIDAY NIGHT and I inhale deeply before I knock. I have three days left until I leave. Ryan deserves better than me, but tonight I can pretend I\u2019m good enough. The door opens and my heart starts, stops, and skips over itself when Ryan flashes that glorious smile with the right mixture of warmth and dimples.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. His voice alone creates pleasing goose bumps on my arms.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I\u2019m going to make love to you tonight. Feeling shy, I glance away and I want to kick myself. Where\u2019s the girl who could frighten football players with one look?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Ryan closes the door and I move straight for his bedroom. Twice, Ryan tried to convince me to hang in another room, but being anywhere else in his perfect house reminds me that I can never measure up.</p><p>\u201cScott and Allison went to bed early.\u201d I lean against the door frame to his room and try to calm the thousands of feathers swirling in my stomach. \u201cChris isn\u2019t stopping by, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He knows I\u2019m seeing you tonight and that I have to be up early for my writing competition.\u201d Ryan cups my waist with his hand. His thumb sneaks underneath my shirt and draws circles onto my skin.</p><p>I notice a bundle of papers tied together with two pink ribbons on the middle of his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Ryan places some space between us, but slides his fingers into mine. \u201cA finished copy of \u2018George and Olivia.\u2019 It\u2019s yours. So are the ribbons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Because it is. Ryan will do well at so many things when he graduates.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at the title page.\u201d Ryan releases me and I immediately miss his touch.</p><p>I plop on the bed, untie the bow, and blink\u2014</p><p>Dedicated to the girl I love: Beth Risk. My fingers skim the page as if caressing the words will make them more real. George was a short story for class. Olivia came to life because Ryan couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the story. He dedicated it to me because... because he actually loves me.</p><p>A twinge of pain flashes in my chest. I could be happy here in Groveton. Scott\u2019s not so bad.</p><p>In fact, I kinda enjoy waking in the morning and telling him about school. I appreciate how Scott nods while I talk and when I stop, how he asks questions to show he heard what I said. I adore sitting in class next to Lacy and listening to her ramble about useless gossip. I love health class and despite what Allison said, I\u2019m becoming fond of science. I like watching Logan, Chris, and Ryan one-up each other. I like...I like...</p><p>I run my hand over the paper again. I love Ryan. I\u2019m in love with him. I love how he smiles. I love how he moves. I love his hands on my body and his lips on mine. I love how he laughs. I love how he makes me laugh. I love how he can smooth away the roughness and make me feel like someone worth loving.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BED, Beth touches the title page for a third time. She likes the gift.</p><p>The queasy anxiety I\u2019ve had all day fades. The mattress sinks when I sit beside her. Crimson stains her cheeks as I brush my fingers against her skin. It\u2019s hard to believe she\u2019s the same girl from Taco Bell. Beth was hard and shut down that night. The girl on my bed is open and soft.</p><p>The physical differences are obvious. I run my hand through the sleek, silky strands and she edges away. She hates what I see, but I don\u2019t. One inch of golden-blond stretches from her roots. The blond highlights the blackness of the rest of her hair. I love the black. I love the blond. I\u2019d hate to see either one of them go.</p><p>Somehow both suit her.</p><p>I take the manuscript from her and place it on the nightstand. Her hands shake and she bites her lower lip. She\u2019s nervous and I don\u2019t know why. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods but refuses eye contact. \u201cI wish I was perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>Beth rests her hand on my inner thigh and her fingers slowly trace the seam of my jeans.</p><p>Fire races through me and flames lick areas very close to her fingers. Beth starts again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wish...\u201d and stops.</p><p>Even though part of me wants nothing more than for her to keep touching me, I force my hand over hers. When Beth struggles with words it means she\u2019s on the verge of saying something worth hearing. Her emotions confuse her. Maybe tonight, she\u2019ll finally find the courage to say the words I\u2019m longing to hear.</p><p>\u201cI wish...\u201d She sighs. \u201cI wish I never had sex with Luke. I wish I could take back so many things, but I can\u2019t. I wish I could be someone worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>Beth is on my bed. Her body is close to mine and her fingers hold on to me, but something in her voice makes me feel like she\u2019s slipping away again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not perfect,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re exactly who I want you to be\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy,\u201d she says and even though she\u2019s physically near me, I look into her eyes and see the glaze creating a wall.</p><p>Beth slides a leg over my body and straddles me. Her parts are right on top of mine and the fire within threatens to become an inferno. She knots her fingers in my hair, sending chills along my neck and down my spine. Her lips graze my earlobe, followed by a gentle tug with her teeth. Warm breath tickles my ear.</p><p>\u201cLet me make you happy.\u201d</p><p>My mind\u2019s a mess and a small voice yells at me that she\u2019s leaving. But she can\u2019t be. She\u2019s here, in front of me, driving me insane by pressing her body against me. My hands grasp her moving hips, physically keeping her near. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grabs hold of the hem of my shirt and I let her ease it over my head. Her fingernails whisper against the muscles of my abs and clear thought no longer exists as she explores downward.</p><p>We fall backward onto the bed and Beth continues to move with me. I moan when her hair brushes my chest and her lips kiss my neck. Against my skin, her mouth tilts into a smile. My hands wander underneath her shirt.</p><p>Her body is burning hot under my touch and I want her skin brushing against mine. I yank her shirt over her head and kiss that blessed spot right between her breasts.</p><p>Beth gasps and I no longer want her to be in control. I want this. I want to be the one to make her happy. I want to make her feel good.</p> <p>Wrapping my arm around her stomach, I twist both of us and flip her onto her back on my bed. I love the feel of her underneath me.</p><p>She tangles her leg with mine and her fingers lace in my hair, tempting me down again. My hand glides along the curve of her waist and I want to touch places I know will make her move in rhythm with me. My fingers drift against her stomach and I hesitate when I come into contact with her belly button ring.</p><p>Our first night together in the barn creeps into the forefront of my brain. I asked her a question that night and she never answered. I slip off her even though her hands pressure me to stay. \u201cWhat\u2019s your tattoo mean?\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>WHAT DOES MY TATTOO MEAN? Five seconds ago my body was blazing and five words freeze me like an arctic wind. Ryan brushes my hair off my shoulder and tilts his head as he waits for an answer.</p> <p>I keep eye contact as the devil inside me fights with my desire to tell Ryan something I\u2019ve never told anyone before. \u201cIt means freedom.\u201d</p><p>Ryan readjusts so that his body touches mine. His abs ripple as he moves. Oh my God, he\u2019s incredible and I\u2019m shirtless on his bed and he wants to have a conversation. Ryan can be so...so....frustrating.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you choose that tattoo?\u201d</p><p>I glance away and blow out air through my lips. There are some secrets that are mine and mine alone. Why can\u2019t Ryan work with me?</p><p>Why can\u2019t he let me give him this night? I lean up and kiss his lips. Ryan presses back, but he keeps the exchange short. I flop back on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re straight, right?\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckles. \u201cVery.\u201d And to prove his point he makes my toes curl when he skims a finger in the narrow valley between my breasts, down my stomach, and plays with the edge of my low-rise jeans. \u201cI\u2019m dying right now.\u201d</p> <p>I refuse to give him the satisfaction of closing my eyes in pleasure. There should be another badge in that for me. \u201cThen why are we talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me some of it.\u201d</p><p>Oookaaay. \u201cYou love baseball and writing. Your gay brother can kick most guys\u2019 asses.\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughs and I smile. I love his laughter.</p><p>It reminds me of music.</p><p>An ache darkens his eyes and his hand stops flirting with the elastic of my underwear. \u201cYou know a lot more than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d I link my fingers with his and wish I could take his pain. I know his parents hate each other and that this trip is an attempt to save their marriage. They won\u2019t divorce, but it\u2019s an attempt to rekindle the flame. I also know that watching his family fall apart is killing Ryan.</p><p>More importantly, beyond all the hurt that pricks at him, I know that I bring a smile to his face and I know that he loves me.</p><p>\u201cI know very little about you and I want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019re done. \u201cYou know plenty.\u201d He knows enough. I roll away and reach for my shirt on the pillow beside him. Ryan snatches it and tosses it across the room. \u201cYou\u2019re not running from me anymore, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Hot anger courses through my bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running. I thought we were going to enjoy each other tonight and obviously you\u2019re not up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your dad.\u201d Ryan stays lazily stretched on the bed while I straighten my spine by his pillows. How can he be so arrogant as to think he deserves answers from me?</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your business.\u201d That\u2019s no one\u2019s business.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Tell me something. Tell me about your mom.\u201d His voice becomes taunting and I curl my legs into my chest.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Sky.\u201d There, I gave him something.</p><p>\u201cYou can do better.\u201d Anger creeps into his patient tone. \u201cTell me why Scott won\u2019t let you see her. Tell me something. Anything. You told me once that you aren\u2019t scared of anything.</p><p>Right now I see a liar, because you\u2019re terrified.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan doesn\u2019t flinch. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re back in Groveton. Why aren\u2019t you still in Louisville with your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was arrested, all right?\u201d My pulse thunders at every pressure point in my body.</p><p>Will this be it? The final blow that pushes him from me? Three days. I have three days until I leave and this is not how tonight was supposed to go.</p><p>Not expecting that answer, Ryan\u2019s eyebrows furrow together. Nausea spins in my stomach.</p><p>He\u2019s judging me. I know it. Ryan grabs hold of my ankle before I can step onto the floor. \u201cYou already know my opinion on running. What were you arrested for?\u201d</p><p>Sweat breaks out on my skin. I can imagine the thoughts in his head and his impending judgment. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>He loosens his grip as his fingers slowly slide up my leg and massage my calf through the material of my jeans. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you were in Louisville because I\u2019m in love with the girl you are now.\u201d</p><p>Love. That word from him makes my heart flutter and my head hurt. \u201cThen why do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Blah. Trust. \u201cI\u2019m half-naked on your bed. We could be doing so many other things.\u201d</p><p>The right side of Ryan\u2019s mouth quirks up.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you tell me, maybe we\u2019ll get around to those things.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hair forward. What do I tell him?</p><p>The official story or the real story? He told me about his brother and his parents. I can trust him with this. \u201cMy mom broke out the windows of her asshole boyfriend\u2019s car after he hit her. He was going to hit her again, so I picked up the bat and was swinging it over my shoulder to hit him when the cops showed.</p><p>Mom is on probation, so I took the fall for the destruction of property. My aunt called Scott to bail me out so...\u201d I wave my hand in the air. \u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I hate silence. Silence means thinking and thinking means judgment.</p><p>Ryan edges closer to me and flips my hair from my face. \u201cYou let the police arrest you instead of your mom?\u201d</p><p>Missing my shirt, I draw my knees back up.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d I hear the tense hesitation in his voice. \u201cWhat you did is admirable, but it\u2019s not normal. You shouldn\u2019t have to take the fall for your mom. You shouldn\u2019t have to pick up a baseball bat to defend her...or anyone.\u201d</p><p>He straightens and I watch as our trip into Louisville clicks into place. \u201cIn fact, you shouldn\u2019t even be taking care of your mom.</p><p>You knew she would be at the bar, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>You knew what you would be up against. This is screwed up. Your mom should be taking care of you. Not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens. There is no way he could ever understand. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. She needs me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan runs a hand over his face and shifts off the bed. His body pulsates with a dangerous energy as he paces the floor. \u201cWhat were you fighting about with Isaiah that night outside the coaching facility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I give the answer too quickly, and the pointed glare from Ryan tells me he knows I\u2019m hiding the truth.</p><p>He continues his circle of the room. \u201cI heard him tell you that you belonged in Groveton, and that\u2019s when you went nuts. You were going to run away that night, weren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you were mad at him. He stopped you from going.\u201d</p><p>Panic surges through my body and I hop off the bed. Where did he throw my shirt? I have to go before he figures it out. A black blob lies in the corner. I take two steps and strong arms grab my waist.</p><p>\u201cI already said you aren\u2019t running.\u201d Ryan\u2019s light brown eyes bore into mine. \u201cFrom the moment I began to care for you, I\u2019ve always felt like you were slipping away. Sometimes when you kiss me I feel like you\u2019re saying goodbye. I kept telling myself that was in my head. That you\u2019re scared to love me so you retreat. It\u2019s more than that, isn\u2019t it? Scott won\u2019t let you near your mom so you\u2019re planning to run away with her.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes ago, I wanted nothing more than his body close to mine. Now his closeness is too much. I need space and I can\u2019t move.</p><p>His fingers press tight into my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>My mouth becomes dry and I stare at the floor. This isn\u2019t how tonight was supposed to go. Ryan raises his voice and yells, \u201cWhen?!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to lie to him. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Ryan moves his hands off my hips and curls me into his body. A body that a few seconds before stood solid in anger. My heart breaks from the desperation of his defeat. His forehead rests against mine and his hand grips my hair. \u201cStay, Beth.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and wrap myself around him. I\u2019m going to miss this: Ryan\u2019s strength, his warmth, his love. \u201cI love you, Ryan,\u201d I whisper, half hoping he doesn\u2019t hear it. Why does everything hurt so damn bad?</p><p>His body stiffens and my heart stops. Maybe he did hear me. Ryan places his hands on my shoulders and gently pushes my body from his.</p><p>His eyes dart over my face. \u201cI don\u2019t lose.</p><p>Do you hear me? I don\u2019t lose and that includes losing you. I\u2019m done being kept in the dark.</p><p>I\u2019m done feeling like you\u2019re slipping right past me. You are not saying goodbye to me. I\u2019m in love with you and you love me back. You\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>Ryan says it as if it\u2019s an easy decision. Like I could forsake my responsibilities. Like these chains that have been strangling me for years can easily be cast off. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The anger and confusion drains from his face and the calm and control I\u2019ve only seen while he\u2019s on the pitcher\u2019s mound take command. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>I blink. As if he could stop me. \u201cYou won\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t let you go. You\u2019re mine and I don\u2019t lose.\u201d He rests his hands on his hips and I see the same cockiness from Taco Bell, as if telling me to leave my mother to die is no different than asking for my phone number.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game to be won or lost. There are things in my life that were set in motion before I took my first breath. I don\u2019t have a choice in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. Everyone has choices and I\u2019ve made mine. There is no way you\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so confident that part of me believes him. \u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Three months ago you had no roots here, but now, you\u2019ve got them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoots,\u201d he repeats. \u201cYou\u2019re on the homecoming court and starting to do well at school. My friends love you. You\u2019re closer to Scott. You have a best friend in Lacy.\u201d</p><p>My mind races and so does my breathing. I made a life here\u2014in Groveton. A life I enjoy. A life I could keep. Ryan draws me into him. He lowers his head as his fingers leave a burning path across my cheek. \u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>The pure emotion in his voice causes me to shiver. I could try to build a wall, but the intensity of his gaze tells me he\u2019d see through anything. The seconds stretch between us. His lips come dangerously close to mine, yet he keeps them away. With his hand warm on my face, his nose skims my jawline and I try to inhale to steady my pulse.</p> <p>Ryan tugs at the loops on my jeans and guides me back onto the bed. Taking my hand, he urges me to stretch out beside him.</p><p>His jeans hang right along his hip bones and I swallow.</p><p>I\u2019m in love with him. Tonight I was going to give him a memory of me. I found the confidence and I was in control. My heart stutters. I lost my control. I lost my confidence.</p><p>My hand shakes as I touch his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cI want you to trust me.\u201d Ryan brushes his hand down my arm and I tremble. The signals he sends are unmistakable. There are times when you stand on the cusp of moments so huge, you know you\u2019ll remember them forever.</p> <p>This is that moment for me and for Ryan. I\u2019m not seducing him. He\u2019s not seducing me.</p><p>Instead, we\u2019re choosing to be together.</p><p>I suck in a breath and rush out the words before I lose the courage to say them. \u201cI trust you.\u201d And please, please don\u2019t use that against me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared?\u201d I ask him. Because I am.</p><p>Terrified. Earlier I was anxious, but not frightened. This isn\u2019t me giving him a memory.</p> <p>This is me giving him my heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Tell me if I do and we\u2019ll stop.\u201d Ryan slides his thumb over my lower lip. The warmth he creates melts the fear.</p><p>Unable to speak, I nod. In painfully slow movements, Ryan lowers his head closer and edges his body over me. His lips press gently against mine and as I gasp for air I whisper the words to him again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I\u2019VE NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE to a person. Skin touching skin. Legs and arms wound tightly around one another. Lying on my bed, Beth\u2019s tucked close to my chest and she slowly runs her fingernails up and down the inside of my arm.</p><p>I kiss her head again, revel in the scent of roses, and fight the urge to shut my eyes. Every single muscle has fallen asleep and my mind wanders lazily, but I want to hold on to this moment a little longer. \u201cAre you sure I didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s answered before, but the anxiety still creeps deep inside. Beth glances at me from under long dark eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>The anxiety level increases. We went from fine to okay. \u201cI hurt you. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt burned some, but I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s not like you were...\u201d and she drifts off.</p><p>Heat scorches my face and neck. It\u2019s not like I was in for that long. \u201cI\u2019ll get better. It\u2019ll take some practice and then we\u2019ll both feel good.\u201d</p><p>Beth giggles and her happiness eases the anxiety. \u201cPractice? Do you ever turn off the jock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should create a schedule. Maybe stretch beforehand.\u201d</p><p>She laughs loudly and the sweet sound squeezes my heart. Beth rarely lets happiness overwhelm her and as if on cue she releases a weighty sigh. Her body grows heavier against mine and I pull her tighter to me. Beth is dead wrong if she thinks she can leave me.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking...\u201d Her fingers begin tracing my arm again, but this time her touch is stiff and apprehensive. \u201cMaybe I could talk to Scott about my mom. Maybe he could help me help her.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her head again, close my burning eyes, and clear my throat. I get to keep her. My Beth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to sleep,\u201d she groggily murmurs into my chest. \u201cThe writing competition is tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper into her ear. She cuddles closer to me and I realize what a dick I am. I\u2019m telling my parents about Beth as soon as they come home and I\u2019m walking out on that homecoming field with her on my arm.</p><p>Screw what Mom and Dad think. Screw the rest of the town. Screw perfection. This girl is mine.</p><p>Beth</p><p>I AWAKE TO THE SOUND of birds chatting happily and beams of sunlight highlighting the dancing dust particles in the air. A cardinal rests on a bush outside the window of my room in Scott\u2019s house. The bird flaps its wings and rises into the sky\u2014into freedom. I wonder if the bird in the barn ever escaped.</p><p>The scent of bacon and onions drifts in the air. Scott promised to cook hash browns this morning. I hop out of bed and I\u2019m surprised by the image in the mirror. I\u2019m smiling. It\u2019s more than that\u2014I\u2019m different. Last night made me different. My eyes shine like Scott\u2019s do when he\u2019s around Allison. In fact, my entire face glows and I\u2019m hungry. Starving. For more than food. I want to ask Scott if he can help Mom.</p><p>Hope floods my body and makes me feel high.</p><p>I can get used to hope.</p><p>I toss my hair into a bun and go out into the kitchen. Scott glances at me as he hovers over the stovetop. \u201cGood morning, Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Scott.\u201d I almost giggle at how cheerful I sound. Me\u2014giggling. That\u2019s funny in itself.</p><p>He does a double take as I sit at the counter and the annoying I-know-everything grin stretches from ear to ear. \u201cWhatever side of the bed you rolled out of this morning is the one you should roll out of every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>From the other side of the island, Allison studies me, but not with nearly as much contempt as normal. She looks like she\u2019s on the verge of saying something, then focuses on the newspaper in front of her.</p><p>Scott\u2019s cell rings. He reaches into his back pocket and holds the phone against his shoulder to answer as he flips the hash browns in the pan. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>His face darkens and he pushes the pan onto an unlit burner before switching off the stove.</p><p>He turns and his troubled blue eyes find me.</p><p>My hope slithers away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he says.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>THERE\u2019S A LOW BUZZ of conversation as the auditorium fills. Today\u2019s been both exhilarating and torturous. I\u2019ve met college professors who gave me incredible feedback on \u201cGeorge and Olivia.\u201d I listened to lectures on writing, learned new techniques, and I\u2019ve spent the whole day sweating this upcoming moment.</p><p>I\u2019d take a cold rainy day on the mound over this\u2014wearing my Sunday best while waiting to hear whether or not my story is good enough.</p><p>I hunch forward in the folding auditorium chair with my hands clasped together. My feet won\u2019t quit moving. The only things keeping me halfway sane are my memories of last night. The moment I get out of here, I\u2019m buying two dozen roses and I\u2019m heading straight to Beth. I want to show her I\u2019m nothing like the bastard who broke up with her the next day. I\u2019m the guy that will be around forever.</p><p>Mrs. Rowe yanks the placeholder off the seat next to me and plops down. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>I glance at her in response and rub my hands together. It\u2019s scary how much I want this. It\u2019s even more terrifying to think what happens if I do win. If I lose, then I know my path: pro baseball. If I win...it opens up possibilities.</p><p>Possibilities that I\u2019m good at more than just ball, that I\u2019m good at writing too. Then I\u2019ll have choices to make.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad your parents couldn\u2019t be here for this,\u201d she says. \u201cI bet it\u2019s killing them to be away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Possibly killing them to be near each other. My hopes aren\u2019t high that a week\u2019s vacation will fix the issues between them.</p><p>Divorce isn\u2019t an option on the table, especially since Dad\u2019s considering the run for mayor.</p><p>Maybe I should be grateful, but I\u2019m not sure how much more frozen silence I can take.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re proud of you,\u201d she continues.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Even though they have no idea I\u2019m here.</p><p>Through the squeal of feedback, a woman in a black business suit asks the audience for silence. As she thanks us for our entries, Mrs. Rowe leans over to me. \u201cRegardless of what the results are, Ryan, it was a huge honor to final.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but what she doesn\u2019t understand is that I don\u2019t like losing.</p><p>\u201c...so, with that, we are ready to announce the winners.\u201d</p><p>I inhale deeply to calm the nerves. Fifty of us made it to the last round. All of us entered the final, only three spots left for a win and, to be honest, I\u2019m only interested in first.</p><p>\u201cThe third place winner is Lauren Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>The crowd applauds and I lean back in my seat, antsier than I was before. The girl walks unbelievably slowly and it takes even longer for the people on stage to hand her the award.</p><p>The announcer clears her throat before beginning again. \u201cThe second place winner is...\u201d</p><p>Part of me craves to hear my name and the other part doesn\u2019t. First is the best. First is what I desire, but for the first time in my life, I think I could be happy with second.</p><p>\u201c...Tonya Miles.\u201d</p><p>Everyone applauds again. At least this girl is faster. I hunch forward again, wondering what a loss like this would feel like. I could have been happy with second. Possibly third. And, I finally realize, I don\u2019t want the easy path...I want the choice. I want to possibly go to college.</p><p>Or not. I don\u2019t know. But I do know that I want this win.</p><p>\u201c...and our first place winner is...\u201d She pauses for dramatic effect. I lower my head as my gut tightens. What if I\u2019m not good enough?</p><p>\u201cRyan Stone.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline rushes through my veins as I lift my head to stare at the stage. The crowd claps and Mrs. Rowe gestures for me to go onstage, saying words I don\u2019t understand. I stagger forward, wondering if I heard it right. Is this happening? Did I really win?</p><p>Onstage, the lady shakes my hand and offers me a plaque and a certificate. They feel heavy in my hands\u2014heavy and amazing. I did this. I won a writing competition.</p><p>Mrs. Rowe is on her feet. So are a few of the college professors who had read my story. And while their applause is appreciated, a lump forms in my throat and drops. My parents aren\u2019t here. And even if they did know about the competition, they still wouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>I nod to the crowd, then turn toward the stairs. The applause dies except for a loud clapping in the back of the room. A deep booming shout gains my attention and the part of me that was sinking suddenly flies higher.</p><p>I pause on the stage and Mark smiles. He cups his hands to his mouth and yells, \u201cWay to go, Ry!\u201d</p><p>How could I have been so blind? He never left me. My brother\u2014he never left.</p><p>Beth</p><p>THERE ARE MEMORIES that exist in my mind that are so clear that if I focus on them enough I could practically relive them. The sky was ocean-blue and two doves sat on the roof of Grandpa\u2019s trailer when Scott taught me how to throw a ball. Lacy\u2019s dad\u2019s callused hand was cold the day he led me to the back of his police cruiser. Mom bought me a Hostess cupcake the first night we spent alone in Louisville. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What ingrained those moments was that when I lived them, I knew I would remember them always. When Scott taught me to play baseball, time lost all meaning. I held the ball in my hand longer than needed so I could remember the feel of the threading. I hesitated when Lacy\u2019s dad told me to hop in the car so I could take a mental snapshot of our trailer. I spent a half hour nibbling at the icing of the cupcake before taking a bite, knowing that Mom gave all her money to our new landlord.</p><p>The emergency room takes on the same slow-motion quality as I run through the sliding doors. Scott brushes past me and talks to a nurse at the station. My heart beats loudly in my ears. An orderly passes by and stares at my head. I didn\u2019t brush my hair. I didn\u2019t do anything.</p><p>The nurse looks up from her computer and motions toward the closed doors of the emergency room. Large letters on big signs warn me to stay out, but if that\u2019s where my mother is, no one can stop me. My hand aches as I slam on the swinging door and I barely register my name being called behind me. Both sides of the corridor are filled with curtained areas. Machines beep and people softly whisper.</p><p>Walking in the hallway, the hulking figure that torments my dreams turns a corner. I chase after him. Trent. Anger courses through me and propels me forward. Past the beds. Past the nurse asking if I need help. Past anything that is sane or rational.</p> <p>At the end of a long, desolate hallway, he enters a room. The other rooms surrounding it are empty. No nurses or doctors are on guard.</p><p>Trent stands near my mother\u2019s bed. He doesn\u2019t see me, nor does he see the fist that strikes out and punches him in the jaw. \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>My knuckles throb and pain shoots through my wrist, but it doesn\u2019t stop me. Everything is a blur. My hands hit again and again. Trent slaps me across the face, yanks at my hair, and I cry out when a knee hammers my stomach.</p><p>He tosses me like a rag doll and air slams out of my lungs when I crash into the wall.</p><p>I try to refocus and go after him again. If I give him enough time he\u2019ll hit me and I\u2019ll go down. On the floor with Trent is a bad place to be. He prefers to kick. I hear a smack followed by the sight of Trent stumbling across the floor.</p> <p>\u201cElisabeth, are you okay?\u201d Scott keeps his back to me. He holds his arms slightly out to his sides waiting for retaliation. \u201cElisabeth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shake away the stupor. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Blood seeps from Trent\u2019s nose. Good for Scott. He broke it. Trent glares at me, causing Scott to step toward him. \u201cTouch my niece again and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Trent ignores Scott and the bald asshole keeps staring at me. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to take what\u2019s mine. Put those thoughts in her head again and the paramedics won\u2019t be able to save her next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking son-of-a-bitch.\u201d I leap toward him and Scott wraps his arms around my waist, practically lifting me off the ground to prevent me from mauling Trent. \u201cI should have hit you with that bat when I had the chance.\u201d I wish I had taken the swing. \u201cI wish you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here before I call security!\u201d</p> <p>Scott yells at Trent.</p><p>Trent\u2019s eyes go flat and he half smiles as he walks past. Scott tightens his hold as I try to go after him again. Trent won\u2019t forgive me for trying to run away with Mom. He\u2019ll want revenge and if he can\u2019t extract his revenge on me then he\u2019ll use Mom as payment.</p><p>Scott releases me and blocks the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>My hand snaps out and points into the hallway. \u201cHe hits her. He hits me. He\u2019s a fucking drug dealer who uses my mom and if it weren\u2019t for you and your stupid rules and your stupid blackmail she wouldn\u2019t be here because I would have been there to protect her.\u201d</p><p>A nurse appears in the doorway and I turn from both of them.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d she asks quietly, quickly, and in a tone that indicates she knows everyone in this room is fucked up.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d Scott says.</p> <p>He talks some more, but his voice and the nurse\u2019s become muffled as I stare at the pathetic creature on the bed. A few hours ago, my entire world was right. Ryan held me in his arms and I convinced myself that everything was going to be okay. This is what happens when you believe in hope. Karma comes around to destroy it.</p><p>I sit on the bed and touch Mom\u2019s cold fingers. This is what death feels like. \u201cDid she die?\u201d</p><p>The chatter behind me stops.</p><p>\u201cShe stopped breathing,\u201d says the nurse.</p><p>\u201cBut the paramedics gave her naloxone and it counteracted the affects of the heroin.\u201d</p><p>Heroin. My heart stops and my lungs ache.</p><p>Heroin.</p><p>My fingers follow the line of her IV, but I purposely skip the track marks that dot her arms. \u201cHow long has she been using?\u201d</p><p>The blood pressure cuff swooshes as it releases. The nurse clears her throat. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can she go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep now. The doctor will check her when she wakes and as long as she\u2019s still fine, they\u2019ll let her go.\u201d She whispers something to Scott. Scott whispers back.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to go fill out some paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he\u2019ll pay her bills. For now. How could I have not noticed the marks on her arm before? \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The room becomes very still except for the steady beat of Mom\u2019s heart monitor. From the moment my aunt Shirley called Scott, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve been spinning in the Gravitron from the fair. If I could, I\u2019d crawl right into oblivion and disappear. I\u2019m tired and all I want is to get off this damn ride.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you punched Trent?\u201d Shirley asks behind me.</p><p>\u201cBoth of us. Nice job taking care of your sister.\u201d I knot my fingers with Mom\u2019s. Does she know I\u2019m here? Probably not. Mom doesn\u2019t even notice I\u2019m with her when she\u2019s somewhat coherent. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoke break.\u201d Shirley hacks her smoker\u2019s cough and Mom flinches in her sleep. \u201cWho do you think found your mom and dragged her ass into the alley before I called nine-one-one? If the police went into your mom\u2019s apartment we\u2019d be in a bigger shit pile than we are now.\u201d</p><p>Mom stirs and I wish she\u2019d wake up and tell me she\u2019s sorry. \u201cThanks for calling Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got money. Make sure he uses it to pay the bills.\u201d Shirley\u2019s light footsteps come closer to the bed and she rests a hand on my shoulder. I keep my eyes on Mom, terrified if I glance away she\u2019ll disappear.</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago your mom told me a funny story. It was the type that could start with once upon a time,\u201d says Shirley. \u201cShe said you were coming soon to take her away. Sad part was she also told the whole bar and someone there told Trent. He got a little pissed.\u201d</p><p>A little pissed? Fresh bruises cover the right side of Mom\u2019s face. Knowing her, she took the heroin to forget the beating, to relieve the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t believe in fairy tales.\u201d I should never have left Mom. Never. I should have found a way to leave weeks ago. This is my fault.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I would have paid to see that one.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my head to look at her.</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d says Shirley. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to last much longer the way she\u2019s been going. The decision is yours. She\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Shirley walks out of the room. I try to inhale, but it\u2019s virtually impossible with the burden weighing me down. Ever since I was eight years old, the responsibility of my mother has been on me. I\u2019ve taken care of her. Moved her. Fed her. Made sure she went to work or helped her find jobs. But right now, what I want more than anything is for my mom to take care of me. I\u2019m done being the grown-up.</p><p>For a few minutes I want to be the kid. I want my mom. I just want my mom.</p><p>A light touch moves across my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Elisabeth,\u201d my mother mumbles.</p><p>I sniff. \u201cI\u2019m not sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of you. You and your daddy. I miss him.\u201d Her fingers lightly grasp my wrist.</p><p>\u201cI miss you. You were a beautiful baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A tangle of anger and sadness and happiness weaves around my soul and strangles the scream fighting to leave my throat. She\u2019s alive, but she almost died. \u201cWhy do you have to make everything so fucking hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here. I like you better sad. I hate it when you\u2019re angry.\u201d She tugs on my wrist and ignores my question. \u201cI want to hold my baby.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m five as I crawl on the bed and rest my head between the crook of her arm and her chest. Her fingers weakly pick at my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou were born on a Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and will the hurt to leave, but it doesn\u2019t go away. It stabs at me over and over again. I\u2019m so tired. So damned tired. I don\u2019t want to think about Trent or heroin or running away or about the responsibility I thought I could abandon.</p><p>\u201cIt was an awfully hot day. You were so beautiful, but so tiny. The doctor wouldn\u2019t let me hold you for three weeks because you were early. Your daddy loved you then. He came by the hospital twice before your grandma brought us home. Scott was excited to hold a baby for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Her bony fingers relax against my head and I wish she\u2019d tell me she loves me, because I love her. She may be a drug addict and an alcoholic and she\u2019s probably a whore, but she\u2019s my mom. My mom.</p><p>\u201cI loved to take you to the mall. People would stop me and tell me what a beautiful baby you were. I\u2019d let them hold you and they\u2019d try to guess your name. You were so cute and you never cried. You were my own personal baby doll.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arm around her and cringe when I feel her ribs poking through her skin. Mom sighs and continues, \u201cI named you after my momma, hoping if I did she\u2019d change her mind and love us both. My momma left me, Elisabeth, but I never left you. Never.\u201d</p><p>No, my mother never left me and that is the reason why I owe her. I grew up knowing the sacrifice she made on my behalf. I hold my breath to keep my body from shaking with sobs. My mom needs me and I can\u2019t be soft any longer. I did this to her. I left her behind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still coming for me, right, Elisabeth? On Monday?\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>IN A WRINKLED POLO and a pair of jeans, Scott leans against the wall at the end of the emergency room. He raises an eyebrow when he spots me, but then lowers it as if he\u2019s too tired to care. \u201cHow did you know she was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife told me.\u201d I came straight from the competition to Scott\u2019s house so I could share my news and give Beth the roses. My world came crashing down when Allison said those three words: Beth\u2019s mother overdosed.</p><p>I glance into the room and immediately look away. The sight of Beth curled up on the bed with her mother is too intimate for anyone to witness\u2014including me. \u201cHow long has she been in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while.\u201d Scott kneads his eyes with his fists, just like Beth does when she\u2019s had all she can handle. I see a lot of Beth in Scott. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did the writing competition go?\u201d</p><p>And just like Beth, he\u2019ll avoid the bleeding elephant in the room. \u201cI won.\u201d</p><p>If he weren\u2019t so tired, the smile on his face would appear natural. \u201cCongratulations. How did your team do against Eastwick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won too.\u201d Just like I knew they would. They\u2019re a great team and I\u2019m proud to be a part of them.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Difference between me and the Risks? I have no problems discussing elephants. \u201cHow is Beth\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cHow\u2019s Beth?\u201d</p><p>Scott shakes his head. Silence falls between us, but we both jerk our heads toward the room when we hear a muffled sob. Beth is breaking my heart and from the pain tearing across Scott\u2019s face, she\u2019s doing the same to his. More silence between us. A sniff comes from the room and my fingers itch to hold Beth and somehow right her world. I won\u2019t let her use this as an excuse to run. I\u2019ll talk to her and make her realize that now is the time to involve Scott.</p> <p>\u201cElisabeth says that you\u2019re trying to decide between college and pro,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod. The choice is harder now that I\u2019ve won the competition.</p><p>\u201cCan I give you some unsolicited advice?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I tilt my head up. \u201cI\u2019d love your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecide what baseball means to you, because if you\u2019re playing to make money, then you\u2019ll be sadly disappointed. Only a small percent of drafted players ever play a day in the majors and you\u2019d make more working at McDonald\u2019s than you will playing in the minors.\u201d</p><p>A nurse passes between us and I let the back of my head hit the wall. \u201cYou went pro.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was eighteen, baseball was my only option. From what Elisabeth says you have several options. If baseball is what you want more than anything, then it will be worth the sacrifice. If going pro is a means to an end, I\u2019m telling you the odds are against you.\u201d</p><p>Then Scott gets that crazy gleam in his eye.</p><p>The gleam I understand. \u201cIf baseball is what you live by, breathe in, and die for, I\u2019m telling you that you\u2019ll need the rush of running out onto that field. I\u2019ve never experienced anything else like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I tell him. His comments are well received, but not helpful. I\u2019m nowhere closer to making a decision. Out of the corner of my eye I peek into the room. Beth\u2019s eyes meet mine.</p><p>\u201cSpend time with her,\u201d says Scott. \u201cBut Elisabeth goes home with me.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>SCOTT\u2019S HAND ON MY BACK urges me forward as I watch my aunt Shirley drive away with my mom. It\u2019s late, I guess. The sun has set. Stars twinkle in the sky. Ryan has come and gone, though I could tell he didn\u2019t want to leave. He loves me. I know that. I somehow wonder if his love is the only thing that\u2019s kept me from losing my mind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Scott says.</p> <p>Home. My room with my clothes and my box of Lucky Charms in the pantry. Home. It can be my home if Scott will help my mom.</p><p>The red taillights of Shirley\u2019s car disappear as she turns left onto the main street.</p><p>I exhale all the air out of my body and turn to Scott. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement as he hooks an arm around my shoulder. Three months ago, I would have decked him for touching me.</p><p>Now, I welcome the embrace. With exhaustion weakening my knees, I lean into my uncle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d Scott continues to lead me to his car. \u201cYou\u2019re dead on your feet.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re halfway to his car when a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hits me. Like I\u2019m seeing something that I\u2019ve seen before\u2014a memory in slow motion. I jerk my head to the right and realize that it\u2019s not a memory, but reality.</p><p>I flinch to a stop and Scott halts along with me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d I say not to Scott, but to myself.</p><p>My best friend is here.</p><p>Leaning against the hood of his black Mustang, Isaiah watches Scott and me from a distance. He dips his head when he spots me looking at him. I step toward him and Scott grabs my arm. \u201cNo, Elisabeth.\u201d</p><p>My head whips. \u201cJust for a second. Just one second. Please.\u201d</p><p>His grip loosens at the word please. When he finally releases me, I sway. I\u2019m worn out\u2014physically, emotionally, but I dig for strength. I have to talk to Isaiah.</p><p>Isaiah stays where he is, not even bothering to me meet me halfway, and speaks before I reach him. \u201cShirley told me about your mom. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>His question stops me about a car\u2019s distance from him. Hurt pours out of his eyes, and every muscle in my abdomen clenches. My close proximity actually causes him pain and that fact slaps me in the face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer, then think about it. \u201cNo. She\u2019s addicted to heroin.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah glances away and a lead ball drops into my stomach. \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p><p>He meets my eyes again. \u201cShe\u2019s bad news, Beth. You\u2019re not going to change her.\u201d</p><p>She will change. Scott will help me. I know it. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surviving.\u201d Isaiah surveys the night sky, then pushes away from his car. \u201cHave a nice life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah...\u201d I say, unsure of how to make us better. \u201cThis isn\u2019t goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers as he unlocks his driver\u2019s-side door. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believed that you wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d I\u2019m energized by a second wind as my words sink in. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. For life.\u201d</p><p>He rubs a hand over his face before sliding into his car, shutting the door, and turning over his engine with an angry growl.</p><p>The brief burst of energy drains from me, starting in my head and seeping out through my toes. It hurts to know that I\u2019ve caused Isaiah pain, but someday he\u2019ll really fall in love and discover that all we\u2019ve ever been is friends.</p><p>I OPEN MY EYES AND CURSE. This is twice I\u2019ve gone pathetic, fallen asleep, and Scott has had to carry me in. Just like the first night in this house, the blanket is tucked around me and my shoes are neatly placed near the bed. It\u2019s dark and I don\u2019t bother looking at the clock. I toss aside the blanket, climb out of bed, and head into the foyer.</p><p>In the kitchen, Scott sits at the island and stares at the countertop. I flop onto the cushy leather couch. I\u2019ve lived in this house for three months and I\u2019ve never sat here. \u201cNice couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you tried it out,\u201d Scott says.</p><p>He wears a Yankees T-shirt and a pair of jeans.</p><p>Scott acts so grown-up at times I forget that he\u2019s not even thirty yet. He slips off the stool and joins me in the living room. \u201cWant to fill me in on Trent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase. Fill me in on Trent.\u201d</p><p>Scott did hit the bastard. I wipe the sleep from my eyes and try to find the simplest and fastest explanation. \u201cThe fucking asshole is the spawn of Satan and someone needs to stake the bastard in the heart, shred him to pieces, then set the pieces on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr take a swing at his head with a baseball bat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr that.\u201d I smile weakly and Scott gives the same weak smile back. I told Ryan I\u2019d stay. I finger the smooth material of the ribbon tied around my wrist. \u201cWhy did you leave us? You didn\u2019t just leave me. You left Mom too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to discuss this calmly or are you looking for a screaming match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk.\u201d I think.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left Groveton, I meant what I said. I fully intended to come back for you. I know I was young, but I loved you as if you were my own.\u201d</p><p>I loved him like he was my father. I draw my knees up and wrap my arms around them.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He starts and stops several times as the words catch in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t have made it out if I did. I couldn\u2019t take you on the road with me and if I chose you then I would have had to quit baseball.</p><p>\u201cIf I stayed in Groveton, I have no doubt I would have become my father. Your dad swore to me he\u2019d never be Dad, and the day he graduated from high school he turned into the same bastard our father was. I didn\u2019t want trailer parks and I didn\u2019t want girls hooked on drugs and I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life hurting the people I said I loved. If I stayed, I would have become my father and one day I would have hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Scott would never have hurt me. He wasn\u2019t capable of it.</p><p>\u201cI was so damned scared that when I began to run, I couldn\u2019t stop. I was scared to face you again. Scared if I saw you, I\u2019d stay and turn into my father.\u201d</p><p>Scott swears and holds his hands together as if in prayer. I bite my lip when his voice cracks. \u201cWhen you first moved here\u2014every time I looked at you I saw the old man. I saw his anger coming out of your eyes. I saw your father\u2019s bitterness wrapped up inside of you. As much as I\u2019ve hated myself for leaving you behind, I don\u2019t regret it. If I\u2019d stayed I would have never broken free and all of that anger and bitterness I see in you would have been inside of me.\u201d</p><p>I know the anger and bitterness he\u2019s talking about. They\u2019re the chains that weigh me down and threaten to drown me daily\u2013at least until I found Ryan. But those chains returned with one phone call from Shirley and they\u2019re slipping tighter around my throat. \u201cYay for you. You broke free and I got screwed.\u201d</p><p>Scott leans forward. \u201cI know it seems that way, but I broke free for you, too. I fucked up.</p><p>I should have come back when I signed with the Yankees and dragged you to New York with me. I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m here now and this...\u201d He holds his hands out and motions at the house. \u201cThis is your break, kid.</p><p>This is your baseball. All you have to do is trust me and take it. Whatever you want, it\u2019s yours, but you have to let the past go.\u201d</p><p>Scott is talking about hope and hope is a myth. He acts like it would be easy to leave Mom. As if I could effortlessly hand over the demons in my nightmares and somehow with the swish of a magic wand, everything would be okay. \u201cWhat about Mom?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer immediately. Instead he stares at a thin scar on his right hand where he told me Grandpa had cut him with a knife when he was a kid. \u201cShe\u2019s not my responsibility and she\u2019s not yours either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Mom is my responsibility. It\u2019s my fault that she\u2019s miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ve been thinking, maybe you could give her some money. We could put her in one of those rehab places and when she\u2019s clean we could move her someplace nicer.</p><p>Mom used to work and we could get her another job. She\u2019s been down for so long and I know she keeps Trent because he has money. If you help her, I\u2019m sure she can get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps back as if he slapped me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t?\u201d I did it. I came to him for help. I\u2019m trusting him and he\u2019s throwing it back in my face? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI made myself and Allison a lot of promises when we moved to Groveton and more importantly when I brought you back into my life. Your mother is a line I can\u2019t cross.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no, no. NO! This isn\u2019t how our talk was supposed to play out. \u201cBut you have to.\u201d</p><p>The room becomes suddenly restrictive and I stand. I need to get out. Everywhere I turn there\u2019s a window or an entrance to another room. There\u2019s not a damn door to the outside in this huge fucking room.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d says Scott real slowly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit back down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to help her!\u201d Because I can\u2019t, and the realization cracks my sanity. \u201cSend her to a rehab. Get her clean. She\u2019ll be better then. You don\u2019t understand. She never had a shot. We never had anything. No one ever helped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent her money,\u201d Scott says softly.</p><p>There\u2019s a roaring in my head and I freeze midstep. I\u2019m in the kitchen and I have no idea how I made it here. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Scott walks over to the island. \u201cI sent your mother money every month. I opened a bank account for her and every month she drained it.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t man enough to call you, but I was man enough to pay for my mistakes. Allison found the account a couple of months ago and thought I was having an affair. I brought her here, to Groveton, to prove to her that I wasn\u2019t lying about you or your mother and when I got here I didn\u2019t like what I found. So we stayed, but I promised Allison I would cut off your mother. She obviously wasn\u2019t using the money to help either one of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d I slam my hand against the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying!\u201d He has to be.</p><p>\u201cI can show you the statements if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t.... I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d says Scott. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>I try to suck in air, but my lungs won\u2019t expand. Grabbing on to the side of the counter, I bend over in my search for oxygen. Scott\u2019s wrong. He has to be wrong. Mom would never have done this to me. Never. Why can\u2019t I fucking breathe?</p><p>\u201cElisabeth!\u201d Scott shoves a stool out of the way and catches me as I fall to the floor. He sits beside me as I lower my head into my hands.</p> <p>\u201cJust breathe,\u201d he commands.</p><p>My intake sounds like a wheeze and I feel as if my mind is splitting into halves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Scott tells me.</p><p>But it\u2019s not. Nothing is okay.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>BETH DIDN\u2019T SHOW LAST NIGHT. I\u2019m not surprised. My parents are back in town, plus Beth spent the whole day and into the evening at the hospital Saturday and needed a day to rest. I hoped she would come though. I only saw her for a few seconds on Saturday and that was in front of Scott. She seemed so broken. I need to hold her and tell her I love her and I need to hear the words back.</p><p>I\u2019ll catch her before school begins and spend the day trying to put a smile on her face. Lacy, Chris, and Logan will want to help. Between the four of us we can distract her.</p><p>I open the fridge, pull out a Gatorade, grab my keys from the counter, and swerve to avoid steamrolling my mother. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll see you at the game later.\u201d</p> <p>And officially introduce Beth as my girl to my parents. There is no way either of them would make a scene in public.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early. Sit down.\u201d Mom brushes past me.</p><p>She\u2019s polished for the day. Dress pants.</p><p>Sweater set. Pearls. Mom will be on the social club prowl by lunch. Dad walks into the kitchen from the formal dining room and barely glances at Mom. The vacation was supposed to save their marriage. Last night they slept in separate bedrooms.</p><p>My keys jingle in my hand. \u201cI have some stuff to take care of before school. Can we talk later?\u201d</p><p>Mom eases into a seat at the table and gestures for me to follow. I cock my hip against the frame of the door instead.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Mom opens her right hand and like an accordion my condoms fly onto the table.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to explain?\u201d</p><p>My keys dig into my hand as I try to keep my anger in check. \u201cYou went through my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re your parents. We have the right.\u201d</p><p>I survey Dad and he patiently stares at me from the other side of the room. Panic combines with nausea and adrenaline, but I\u2019ll be damned if they see it on my face. How much did they go through? Did they find my plaque from winning the writing competition?</p><p>Did they turn on my computer? Did they find my stories? This is exactly how they treated Mark when he first came home from college this summer. Right before he told them he was gay.</p><p>\u201cI counted them,\u201d Mom says. \u201cThere\u2019s one missing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never hated my mother before and, right now, I do. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d Not when Mom is going to downgrade Beth to the girl I used a condom with. Mom will take something that was beautiful and twist it into something dirty.</p><p>\u201cIs it a girl?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>My grip on the Gatorade tightens. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Dad pushes away from the door frame with muscles tensed. Mom hops out of her seat and directly into the path of me and Dad. \u201cWe heard a rumor yesterday when we went to dinner. I know it has to be untrue because you would never go against our wishes. I would have discussed it with you yesterday, but you were out. I did what I had to do to get some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait for me, Mom. You don\u2019t go through my stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dating Beth Risk?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cOr is she the girl you\u2019re experimenting with?\u201d asks Dad.</p><p>Mom spins. \u201cAndrew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome girls you date. Others you have sex with. Boys do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of your behavior in high school,\u201d Mom says. \u201cBut my son will not be sleeping with one girl and dating another in public. Gwen deserves better than that. I deserved better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I\u2019m tired of the fighting.</p><p>\u201cIt was one night, Miriam!\u201d Dad yells.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five years ago.\u201d</p><p>I throw the Gatorade in my hand across the room. Glass shatters in the china cabinet and Mom holds her hands over her head. \u201cDo you guys even hear yourselves anymore? Did you even bother listening to Mark? Do you even hear me? I\u2019m not dating Gwen and leave Beth out of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d Dad bellows, but Mom puts her hand up to silence him.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she says slowly. Her hand plays with the pearls around her neck. \u201cBeth Risk isn\u2019t who you think she is. Gwen grew concerned when you continued to date Beth at school even after we forbade you to see her, so she went to her parents...again.\u201d</p><p>I swear under my breath. Gwen doesn\u2019t even understand the destruction she\u2019s created.</p><p>Mom continues, \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at Gwen.</p><p>She cares for you and she did the right thing.</p><p>See, her father knows the truth about Beth. She didn\u2019t move to New York with Scott all those years ago. Her father went to prison and her mother moved herself and Beth to Louisville.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s mother knows the attendance clerk at Beth\u2019s old school in Louisville.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ryan, but sometimes children are destined to become nothing more than their own parents. Beth is a drug user. She\u2019s been arrested and her reputation with boys at her old school...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait to hear anything else. \u201cDoes Gwen know any of this?\u201d Because she didn\u2019t before. Otherwise, she would have told me in order to break Beth and me up.</p><p>\u201cYes. She was there when her parents told us yesterday.\u201d</p><p>With my keys tight in my hands, I turn my back to her.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d Mom calls from the kitchen. \u201cCome back!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s too late. I race out to the garage, start the Jeep, and peel out of the driveway. If Gwen knows, then that means she\u2019ll tell the rest of the school.</p><p>Beth</p><p>SCOTT PULLS INTO A SPOT next to the front entrance of school and places the car in park.</p><p>We\u2019re early. Neither one of us said much during breakfast. I didn\u2019t eat. Neither did he.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to go today?\u201d he asks for the tenth time. \u201cI\u2019m okay if you stay home. Allison and I heard you pacing downstairs so I know you didn\u2019t sleep the past few nights. She\u2019s worried about you and so am I.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too damned tired to even roll my eyes at the lie of Allison being concerned over me.</p><p>Mom and I were supposed to leave today. I was going to cut school and take a cab into Louisville. Then Mom and I would have left.</p><p>My insides feel tormented, battered, and bruised. Sort of like if Trent was allowed free rein over my organs. The worst sensation is the tightness in my lungs, the feeling of drowning.</p><p>I touch the ribbon on my wrist. \u201cNo. I want to go to school.\u201d I need to see Ryan. He said I had roots here. I need to hear him say it again.</p><p>I need to laugh with Lacy. I want to smile when Logan and Chris egg each other on. I want to nail the anatomy quiz in science. I want to know that I\u2019m not making the worst mistake of my life by leaving my mother behind.</p><p>My backpack sits on the floorboard and I hold my science book to my chest. I\u2019m good at science. Really good. My teacher likes me.</p><p>Instead of yelling at me when I accidentally cursed while giving an answer, she laughed and winked. After class she told me to watch my fucking language. I earned a B on my last progress report and last week my teacher told me that I\u2019m close to an A. Me, Beth Risk\u2014I could get an A.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to tell you about the money.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and Scott stops talking. I\u2019d rather not think about that. It still hurts too much. I try to wipe out the thoughts of Mom and money and how I\u2019m leaving her behind with Trent. Instead I try to focus on Lacy. She called me her best friend and she asked me to stay the night next weekend. Since I left Groveton at the age of eight, I\u2019ve never had a sleepover with a friend. She said we\u2019d eat frosting and watch movies. I have a best friend who\u2019s a girl.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look good, kid.\u201d</p><p>I hit Trent Saturday, which means he\u2019ll hit her. I choke as I attempt to breathe. How can I do this? I can\u2019t leave her behind. \u201cMom swore to me she\u2019d never do heroin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says in a simple way. Kind of like when a child finds out that Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny doesn\u2019t exist. He\u2019s sorry that the fantasy is over, but happy I\u2019ve entered reality.</p><p>Mom doesn\u2019t fight back when Trent hits her.</p><p>I should go into Louisville. \u201cDad shot up heroin. He sold it too.\u201d</p><p>Scott turns off the car. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m leaving Mom behind, but I owe her. She never left me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t bad when he shot up.</p><p>Mostly he slept. The needles scared me. Mom got real nervous if I played too close to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Mom tell him? Or Shirley? Why do I have to do it? \u201cDad didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad was young. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted. It had nothing to do with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True. Dad was seventeen when I was born.</p><p>Mom was fifteen. Dad knew he wanted her. He took her and made me. But Scott is missing the point. \u201cHe told me that himself because I, uh...made a mistake.\u201d I am a mistake.</p><p>Scott stares at me with those blue eyes that are much gentler than Dad\u2019s and much more full of life than Mom\u2019s. I don\u2019t want anger and bitterness in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in third grade, a guy came to the trailer and at first everything was fine, but then he and Dad began to argue. The guy reached to the back of his jeans and he pulled out a gun.\u201d A shiver runs through my body. My eyes dart in front of me. I see my backpack, the floorboard, the stereo in the car, but my body reacts like I\u2019m back in the trailer.</p> <p>\u201cHe pointed it at Dad and when Dad laughed he pointed the gun at me. It was so close.\u201d</p><p>Very close. Close enough I could feel the metal on my forehead. Mom screamed and warm urine streamed down my legs onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d Scott softly urges.</p><p>\u201cThey argued some more and he cocked the trigger.\u201d It made a frightening sound\u2014click, clitch. I rub the goose bumps forming on my arms. I knew I was going to die and I remember praying to God that it wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Mom screamed and screamed and screamed.</p> <p>\u201cDad threw a sack of money at him. He uncocked the gun and lowered it.\u201d I ran. Past Mom, who collapsed on the floor crying. Past Dad, cursing the man out. Past the bathroom and into Mom and Dad\u2019s bedroom. \u201cI hid under the bed and I called the police.\u201d</p><p>Scott shakes his head as he stares out the windshield to the entrance of my school. \u201cHow much heroin was in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whisper. \u201cMom found me on the phone and she realized what I had done.</p><p>Dad was still trying to flush the heroin down the toilet when Lacy\u2019s dad placed the handcuffs on his wrist.\u201d They cuffed Mom too and she cried so hard that her body shook.</p><p>While they searched the house, Mom and Dad were on their knees in the living room.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth.\u201d It\u2019s a plea, but I\u2019m not sure what he expects from me.</p> <p>\u201cElisabeth is dead, Scott. Please stop calling me that.\u201d I remember my father\u2019s glare as Lacy\u2019s dad walked me past them. I died to him in that moment. \u201cMom was put on probation.</p><p>Dad served six months. After he got out, he drove into Louisville to see me. He got down on his knees, looked me in the eye, and told me I was the worst thing that ever happened to him.\u201d He stood. Faced my mother and asked if she was coming with him. Mom decided to stay with me. \u201cAnd he left.\u201d</p><p>And Mom didn\u2019t leave, because she chose me. Even though she loved my father, she stayed. I owe her.</p><p>Scott turns the car back on. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I need to get an A in science. I need to see Ryan, go to his game, and know I\u2019m making the right decision. I have a life here in Groveton and I need to be okay with letting my mom go. \u201cI have a test today, then Ryan\u2019s game after school. Let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, fine. But we\u2019re talking about this when you get home.\u201d</p><p>Home. I have no idea what that word really means.</p><p>THE BELL RINGS as I slip into the building and I weave through the hallway filled with students. My own skin feels strange on my body. Almost like it\u2019s too tight and needs to be shed. For years I focused on skipping class and today I fought to go to school. What is wrong with me?</p> <p>A girl runs into my shoulder and laughs the moment she sees who she\u2019s collided with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d her friend loudly whispers.</p><p>The hair on the back of my neck stands on end. It\u2019s me. What does that mean? I continue down the hallway and a group of guys stop talking and watch as I walk past. I clutch the science book as a shield. I didn\u2019t even garner this much attention on my first day.</p><p>Screw them. I want to find Ryan and go to science. He won the writing competition and he has his last game this afternoon. I haven\u2019t even properly congratulated him. I round the corner and stop the moment I spot a crowd of people near my locker.</p><p>An underclassman nods her head in my direction. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>The whispering and laughing cease and people distance themselves from me and my locker. Dread forces all hope to abandon my body. Written on my locker is the word I fear the most: whore.</p><p>Whore.</p><p>I slept with Ryan on Friday night.</p><p>Whore.</p><p>But he came to the hospital Saturday. He texted and called on Sunday, but I was too exhausted to call back. Ryan cares.</p><p>Whore.</p><p>I spin on my heel and try to escape down the hallway\u2014away from my locker, away from the whispers and the laughter. I round a corner and slam into a friend of Gwen\u2019s. \u201cWell, look who it is\u2014Beth Risk. Is it true you were arrested in Louisville?\u201d</p><p>The only person I told about that was Ryan.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>Her friends laugh and she smiles. \u201cGwen tried to warn you. Ryan and his friends take dares very seriously. What made you think you were anything more than that?\u201d</p><p>Ryan gave me a bottle of rain. He told me he loved me. He wouldn\u2019t tell people that we slept together or that I was arrested in Louisville. He wouldn\u2019t call me a whore. \u201cI\u2019m not a dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then how come Ryan\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know that you guys were dating? In fact, his mom told my mom that they forbade him to date you weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>The ice pick straight to my heart leaves me speechless and I step back, but my retreat isn\u2019t enough. She glances at her friends, then narrows her eyes at me. \u201cNot only were you a dare, but you were Ryan\u2019s dirty little secret.\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I PARK THE JEEP behind Chris\u2019s truck and hop out. I\u2019ve got to find Beth and I need to find Gwen. I\u2019ll hand Gwen homecoming. I\u2019ll tell her that Beth and I will drop out, as long as Gwen keeps Beth\u2019s secrets. Chris and Logan lean against the tailgate and smile when they notice me. Today could be a nightmare for Beth and I\u2019m going to need their help. \u201cHave you seen Beth?\u201d</p><p>Both of them shake their heads.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Lacy?\u201d asks Chris. \u201cShe was supposed to meet me here.\u201d</p><p>I scan the parking lot and spot Lacy bolting out the side doors. \u201cThere she is.\u201d</p><p>Chris straightens as he watches her hurry to us. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She bypasses Chris, reaches out, and slaps me across the face. The pain sucks, but the worst part is the tears streaming down Lacy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she chokes out.</p><p>Lacy\u2019s never hit me before. She\u2019s never hit anyone before.</p><p>Chris places himself between me and Lacy while Logan yells at the people loitering to witness the show to keep moving. \u201cLace, what the hell?\u201d Chris says.</p><p>Lacy shoves Chris and the shoves turn frighteningly close to hitting. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she screams. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You were supposed to be her friend.\u201d</p><p>From behind her, Logan pulls her hands to her sides. \u201cSlow it down, Lace. Tell us what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tears overflow from her eyes while she stares at me. \u201cYou promised me you wouldn\u2019t hurt her. You promised she was no longer a dare.\u201d</p><p>Beth. She means Beth. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t. I mean, she was, but you know I called it off.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her arms out of Logan\u2019s grasp, but he stays near in case she decides to attack again. \u201cEveryone is saying Chris and Logan dared you to sleep with her. They said you won when you took Beth into the woods during the last field party. They said you slept with her and that she told you about her past. Everyone knows what happened to her in Louisville. Everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>Gwen. I smack my fist into the side of Chris\u2019s truck. \u201cHave you seen Beth?\u201d</p><p>Lacy shakes her head. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t do it. Please.\u201d</p><p>Chris hesitantly touches her cheek. \u201cNo, baby. The dare ended the night Ryan fell for her.\u201d</p><p>She wipes the tears from her face. \u201cSomeone wrote whore on her locker.\u201d</p><p>Logan runs both hands over his face while Chris swears. The nightmare has already begun.</p><p>I SEARCH THE HALLWAYS for Beth and I come up empty. The first warning bell rings and from the opposite end of the hallway Lacy shakes her head. Dammit. They can\u2019t find her either. Logan taps my shoulder. \u201cShe just walked into class.\u201d</p><p>Finally. I take off down the hallway and step into class right when the tardy bell rings. Lacy, Chris, and Logan trail behind me. Chris claps my back and the three of them head for our seats. Someone shushes the whispering and laughing as everyone watches me. I study</p><p>Beth. She\u2019s reclaimed the seat in the corner of the room instead of the one she took next to me weeks ago.</p><p>Just like the first day of school, Beth\u2019s hair hides her face and she doodles in her notebook.</p><p>My ribbon no longer graces her wrist.</p><p>An adult I don\u2019t know clears her throat. We must have a sub today. \u201cDo you mind taking your seat?\u201d</p><p>Beth glances up at me, then immediately looks back down. It\u2019s as if I swallowed knives.</p><p>She\u2019s heard the rumors and she believes them.</p><p>Perfection. It\u2019s what everyone expects from me. Take my seat. Do my work. Go to practice.</p><p>Play ball. Keep everything bottled up and let your insides rot as long as the outside looks perfect. \u201cBeth.\u201d</p><p>She keeps her head down and the substitute steps into my line of view. \u201cEither find a seat or find yourself in detention this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Chris says. \u201cThe game.\u201d</p><p>The game against Northside. I promised Chris I wouldn\u2019t miss another game and detention would bar me from keeping that promise. Reluctantly, I take my seat and turn to stare at Beth, willing her to look at me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll catch her after class,\u201d Chris whispers to me from across the aisle.</p><p>THE BELL RINGS and it\u2019s a race of who can get out of their seat faster. Beth is out the door first and her size makes it possible for her to duck and weave through the mass of bodies crowding the hallway. My next class is in the opposite direction of where she\u2019s headed, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>She runs down the history hallway and I grab her arm right before she enters the safety of the classroom. I lean in and look straight into her eyes. \u201cYou know I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes search my face and she appears as broken as she did two days ago at the hospital.</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck me to win a dare?\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to shake her. \u201cI didn\u2019t fuck you, I made love to you. Don\u2019t do this, Beth.</p><p>Don\u2019t take what was beautiful between us and make it ugly.\u201d</p><p>Water fills her eyes and my heart slices into a million pieces. Beth isn\u2019t a crier and I\u2019m making her cry. I thought making love would prove how much I loved her. Prove that she could trust me, and it\u2019s killing me to know that one act could be what\u2019s tearing us apart. \u201cI gave you my word that the dare was over.</p><p>When have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the front steps of Scott\u2019s house you promised me I wouldn\u2019t be a secret.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m standing here breaking the PDA rules by holding her close to me. How can she believe I lied? \u201cI\u2019ve told everyone at school. I\u2019ve brought you to games. I\u2019ve taken you to parties.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me you told your parents. Tell me that when your parents confronted you about us, you told them we were a couple.\u201d</p><p>My grip on her loosens and she jerks her arm away. How could she know that? Over Beth\u2019s shoulder I spot Gwen skulking at the end of the hallway. She glances at me, then immediately averts her gaze. Dammit.</p><p>Beth kneads her eyes with her hands. \u201cI fell for the jock again. The worst part is I told you how to play me. Convince me you love me and I\u2019ll fall into your bed. I\u2019m so fucking stupid.\u201d</p><p>The warning bell rings and I watch in shock as Beth turns. No. She can\u2019t believe that. \u201cI do love you.\u201d</p> <p>Beth pauses in the door frame and I pray she\u2019ll say she believes me. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to feel bad for winning the dare.\u201d</p><p>She walks into class and the tardy bell rings.</p><p>Beth\u2019s second period teacher assesses me.</p><p>\u201cGet to class.\u201d Then closes the door in my face.</p><p>Feeling numb, I turn in the direction of my next class. I made love to Beth and I lost her. I swallow as my own eyes sting. It was too soon.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t trust me enough. What we did together, it was too much, too fast. I run a hand over my head and try to comprehend how everything blew out of control.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d calls Gwen from behind me. \u201cRyan! Please wait!\u201d</p><p>Rage shoots through my veins as I spin in her direction and tower over her. \u201cAre you finally happy, Gwen? Congratulations, you\u2019ve bagged homecoming. I hope it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen and she steps back. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for homecoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why? Why would you hurt me like this?\u201d</p><p>She blinks. \u201cHurt you? I\u2019ve said nothing about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you hurt her, you hurt me. I love her.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s face pales. \u201cYou only think you love her. I just...I just told a few people. Just enough so word would get back to you, because I knew you wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I didn\u2019t know that they\u2019d call her a whore. I didn\u2019t know about the locker. I swear, Ryan. I feel awful. I do. I had no idea it would go down like this.\u201d</p><p>When I angle my body away from her, she tries to reach out to me. \u201cPlease, you have to believe me. Ryan...\u201d</p><p>I move out of range and her fingers hover in the air for a second before dropping to her side.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all wrong for you. I thought if you heard it, maybe from other people, you\u2019d see what she really is and then you\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>Nausea crawls up my throat. \u201cWhat? What did you think I\u2019d do?\u201d</p><p>Tears pool in her eyes and she shrugs.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p> <p>I pop my neck, trying to relieve the tension, but find the act did nothing to help. \u201cWe were over long before Beth came to this school. If you can\u2019t understand that, try this\u2014I love her, Gwen. I love her. \u201d</p><p>I turn my back and head in the direction of my next class. This school isn\u2019t that big and, because of that, Beth won\u2019t be able to hide from me for long.</p><p>Beth</p><p>I KNEW THIS MATERIAL LAST WEEK. I know I did. I studied every night and Scott quizzed me most mornings. But I\u2019m drawing blanks. The words jumble as I read them, which means my paper\u2019s blank. The bell rings. \u201cPlease bring your tests to me,\u201d says Mrs. Hayes.</p><p>The hand clutching my pencil sweats. I\u2019ve written my name. That\u2019s it. My head falls forward. I failed. Again. This is who I was meant to be.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d says Mrs. Hayes. She walks back to my seat after everyone else turns in their tests and leaves. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m a whore and I\u2019m stupid. I snatch my backpack and leave the blank test on my desk. \u201cI am not okay.\u201d</p><p>I burst out of class. Groveton is a mistake.</p><p>I\u2019m a mistake. Ryan lied to me. He used me. I was a dare. I\u2019m nothing more than a stupid whore who makes mistake after mistake after mistake. Just like my mom.</p><p>People laugh as I pass. They\u2019re judging me and their judgment is spot-on. I don\u2019t belong here. I never have. I can\u2019t go to lunch and I can\u2019t handle the thought of gym. I don\u2019t want to listen to Ryan lie so he can make himself feel better, to Gwen\u2019s laughter because I\u2019m the trash she wants me to be, or to Lacy\u2019s pleas to talk to her.</p><p>Ryan rounds the corner and I duck into the hallway where I saw Isaiah on my first day of school. God, I\u2019ve fucked everything up. I lost my best friend because I fell in love with a stupid jock who doesn\u2019t love me back. My fingers tunnel into my hair and I pull hard to cause pain. Stupid, stupid, stupid me.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I do one thing right in my life? If I\u2019d left with my mother weeks ago, none of this would have ever happened.</p><p>I stop breathing. I can still go. I packed my remaining money and a change of clothes in my bag last week. The backpack weighs me down. The books I can ditch in my locker. The other items that I kept as reminders can also be left, but not here. I know exactly where I can unload them on my way out of town.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>SMACK. THE BALL COLLIDES with my glove.</p><p>Bottom of the sixth and the game is tied. I wiggle the fingers of my throwing hand to keep them from becoming stiff from the cold.</p><p>Late October and it\u2019s the coldest day of the year. Cold-weather games bring strange sensations. The wind burns my cheeks and fingers, but sweat forms from the heat trapped beneath the mock turtleneck of my uniform.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ryan!\u201d Dad calls from the stands.</p><p>Playing the perfect wife and mother, Mom sits right beside him with a fleece blanket covering her legs. My eyes scan the bleachers again.</p><p>Beth\u2019s not here and she won\u2019t be showing.</p><p>A high-pitched whistle originates from home plate. The new batter is taking his time for the third pitch in what I assume is an attempt to freeze me out. Logan steps to the left of the batter\u2019s box and motions for me to throw.</p><p>He wants me to keep moving so my muscles will stay warm. I\u2019m distracted and have pitched the shittiest game of my life. My arm winds back, releases, and I curse when the ball flies two feet to the left of Logan\u2019s glove.</p><p>Logan pulls the catcher\u2019s mask to the top of his head and walks toward the mound.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Chris says as he approaches me from the right. \u201cLacy\u2019s already looking for her and after the game me, you, and Logan will do whatever we have to do to get her to listen.\u201d</p><p>Beth skipped class. I should have gone after her then, but Coach would have kept me from playing. \u201cI can\u2019t focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can,\u201d says Chris. \u201cYou have ice water in your veins when you pitch. Go to that place and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>How do I explain that I never had ice water in my veins when I pitch? That there is a constant burning pressure that threatens to destroy my pitch even when I\u2019m not distracted.</p><p>\u201cYour pitch,\u201d Logan starts when he reaches the mound, \u201cis everywhere. Rein it in and you\u2019ll get to her faster.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I will. Chris swears under his breath and I follow his troubled gaze to the first baseline fence. Lacy stands on the opposite side with Beth\u2019s pack dangling from her shoulder.</p><p>Logan gets in my face. \u201cOne pitch. One more pitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got another inning,\u201d Chris protests.</p><p>Logan throws him a glare. \u201cOne pitch.\u201d</p><p>They return to their spots and the batter digs his cleats into the dirt. This one\u2019s for Beth.</p><p>Logan flashes two peace signs in a row. I nod, glance over my left shoulder, and spot a shadow of movement. Crossing my right arm over my left, I throw the ball to the first baseman, and hear the sweet word come out of the ump\u2019s mouth: \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>The crowd cheers and I run off the field, into the dugout, and out to the other side. Lacy\u2019s eyes are wide with panic and she extends Beth\u2019s backpack to me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d</p><p>I tear the pack open as Lacy continues to talk. \u201cI drove by her house, but no one was there. Then I drove around town and came up with nothing. So I went home, hoping that maybe she dropped by or called the landline, and I found this.\u201d</p><p>The pressure that always threatens me explodes and I toss the pack to the ground. My hand clutches the bottle of rainwater with the ribbons tied to it. I suck in a breath before unfolding the note tucked into the ribbons: I thought I could, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>Dammit. Her mom. She\u2019s gone after her mom and Beth has had enough time to find a way into Louisville by now. I race back into the dugout and grab my bat bag.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d Coach calls from the other end of the dugout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got an emergency. Put Will in for me.\u201d</p><p>I slip the bottle of water into my bag and toss it over my shoulder. Chris wraps a solid hand around my arm. \u201cWhere are you going?</p><p>We have one more inning and the game is tied.</p><p>Will can\u2019t hold these batters like you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s running away. If I don\u2019t stop her, I\u2019ll lose her.\u201d</p><p>Chris tightens his grip. \u201cYou promised me you\u2019d never walk from another game.\u201d</p><p>The ice water Chris prayed for finally enters my veins. \u201cLet me go before I physically remove your hand from my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re choosing her over us?\u201d</p><p>Logan angles himself between me and Chris.</p><p>\u201cLet him go, Chris. He\u2019d never dog you if you chose Lacy over a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d yells Chris. \u201cI love Lacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look at him.\u201d Logan gestures to me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with Beth. You and Lacy don\u2019t own the emotion.\u201d</p><p>Chris eyes me and I see the war inside him.</p><p>He yanks the hat off his head and turns from me. I\u2019m letting him down, but I let Beth down first. Logan nods at me and I give him a quick nod of thanks back.</p><p>The crowd buzzes with conversation as I exit the dugout. I keep my head down and ignore how people stare and even the occasional shout. The perfect Stone is doing a very imperfect thing and I don\u2019t give a damn what anyone thinks about it. I hear loud thumping footfalls striking the metal bleachers.</p><p>If I\u2019m lucky, I can hightail it to my Jeep before Dad reaches the parking lot.</p><p>Like the rest of today, I\u2019m not lucky.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have time for this. I open the Jeep\u2019s door and toss my bag in the back. Dad grabs hold of the door. \u201cWhat are you doing?</p><p>You have another inning to play and the game is tied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s in trouble and I\u2019m going after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to finish that game.\u201d Dad\u2019s face reddens and he places his hand on his hips. In twenty-five years, I\u2019ll be his clone if I continue on my current path. My entire life I desired nothing more than to be him. It\u2019s funny how life changes.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t go after her, she\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go. She needs to be gone. Since she entered your life you\u2019ve lost focus on everything that\u2019s important. You\u2019re letting down your team, Ryan. You are single-handedly destroying your career in baseball.</p><p>Everything I\u2019ve worked so hard for!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A strange mixture of ice and heat fights through my veins as I go toe-to-toe with my father. \u201cYou haven\u2019t worked hard for it! I have.</p><p>This is my life. Not yours. If I want to play baseball, I\u2019ll play. If I want to go to college, I\u2019ll go to college. If I want to talk to my brother, I will. If I want to go after Beth, I am. You are not making my decisions anymore.\u201d</p><p>Spit flies out of his mouth as he yells at me, \u201cYou\u2019re going to destroy your life over a drug-using waste of life?\u201d</p><p>Power surges through me and my fist connects with his face. Adrenaline shakes my body and I watch as my father stumbles back.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever call her that again.\u201d</p><p>I jump into the Jeep, turn on the engine, and push the accelerator. I don\u2019t lose and I\u2019m not losing her.</p><p>Beth</p><p>I RUB MY HANDS TOGETHER and blow into them for possibly the thirtieth time. Hiding in the alleyway behind the bar, I stare at Mom\u2019s apartment. Trent entered right after I arrived and he\u2019s been in there for three hours. I have no choice but to wait. He\u2019ll kill me if he sees me again.</p><p>The door to the apartment opens and the bald asshole finally stumbles out. Fucking fabulous. He\u2019s tweaking, which means he\u2019ll be in a kicking babies mood. I\u2019ll take a heavy heroin user over a tweaker any day.</p> <p>Resting his weight against his car door, Trent fumbles his keys, drops them, and dips low to pick them back up. Yeah, asshole, you belong behind a wheel. I hope you drive into a wall and die.</p><p>His car doesn\u2019t start immediately. The engine whines as he turns it over twice.</p><p>Come on. The third time the engine groans to life. The car trembles when he backs it out and eases onto the main road.</p><p>I dash across the parking lot and bang on Mom\u2019s door as I try the knob. It doesn\u2019t give, but I hear Mom undoing the chains on the other side. She opens the door and wavers when she spots me. \u201cElisabeth.\u201d</p><p>I push in. \u201cDid you pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we should do this.\u201d</p> <p>God, this guy is a slob. His clothes are everywhere and so are the little empty packets that hold his meth. I grab a garbage bag and head into the bathroom. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>She follows me and rubs her bare arm. I remember Dad doing that. It means she\u2019s craving a hit. Withdrawal with her is going to be a bitch.</p><p>\u201cTrent took care of me after I came home from the hospital. He says he\u2019s sorry for how he treats me and he wants to start again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrent\u2019s full of shit.\u201d I pitch into the bag her toothbrush, hairbrush, then pause when I notice a small brown bag behind Mom\u2019s tampons.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her hand moves up and down her arm again. \u201cShirley put it in there when she brought me home.\u201d</p><p>I snatch the bag. \u201cI thought you said Trent took care of you when you came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to say he came by here this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the brown bag are a roll of fifties and a prescription bottle of the drug needed to help Mom detox from heroin. Thank you, Shirley. I try not to think about what she sold or what she did for the money. It\u2019s here and I need it and that\u2019s good enough for the moment. I throw everything into the garbage bag and go into her bedroom. The pickings are slim in the clothing department and I toss the less stained and torn clothes into the bag.</p><p>\u201cElisabeth,\u201d Mom says in a whine. \u201cMaybe we should put it off\u2014by a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not putting it off by a day or two, we\u2019re leaving. Where are the keys to the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t...know.\u201d Which means she does know.</p><p>I swing the bag full of stuff and knock her liquor bottles off the bedside table. Glass shatters against the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s what Trent\u2019s going to do to your head one of these days. We\u2019re getting out of here!\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, I stalk out of the room and quickly glance toward the spare bedroom. The door is open for once and I freeze. \u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>I rest my head against the door frame\u2014too dizzy with disappointment to stay upright on my own. On an old coffee table I found near a Dumpster a couple of years ago are several bags of white powder. Smaller baggies and balloons lay on the floor. I can barely whisper the words. \u201cYou\u2019re selling heroin.\u201d</p><p>Mom shoves me out of the way and shuts the door. \u201cNo. Trent does. I used to let him keep it here overnight at times, but after the night you busted out his windows the police got nosy with him so he brought it here for good. It was the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>My fingers open and close. \u201cYou busted out the windows of Trent\u2019s car. I took the fall so they wouldn\u2019t send you to prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend you didn\u2019t see it, Elisabeth. Trent will be mad you know. He thinks you ratted him out to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d I shout in her face. \u201cDo you not remember the outcome of our last heroin experience?\u201d</p><p>Forming a gun with my fingers, I point it to my forehead. \u201cHe was going to kill me, Mom. I was eight years old! He pushed the gun against my head and cocked the damned trigger.\u201d</p><p>Mom shakes her head too quickly and won\u2019t stop. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t have. Your father said he was just trying to scare me and your dad. Your father said you were safe the whole time. He swore it.\u201d</p><p>How can she lie to herself so easily? How can she continue to turn away from the truth again and again? Then Mom rubs her arm. I stumble back and hit the wall. God, I\u2019m no different. All the signs of a heroin user were there, for weeks if not longer, and I ignored every single one.</p><p>But I\u2019m not ignoring the truth, not anymore.</p><p>I go into the living room and start throwing crap off the kitchen counter to find her keys.</p><p>I\u2019ll drag her out by her hair if I have to. The knob on the front door turns and my heart squeezes and drops. I\u2019ve taken too long and Trent is going to kill me.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>BETH BLINKS RAPIDLY WHEN I WALK IN.</p><p>Standing in a tiny kitchen, she holds a garbage bag. I\u2019ve never been so relieved to see anyone in my life. Nor have I ever craved to shake someone so badly.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d I focus on remaining calm. Beth doesn\u2019t react well to threats or anger or anyone standing in the way of her doing anything.</p><p>Beth turns her back to me and throws papers and trash onto the floor. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ve come into Louisville twice for dinner and we have yet to have that date.\u201d</p><p>Beth leaves the kitchen and rummages through a card table. Her hands shake and her face is too pale against her black hair. \u201cI\u2019m not playing, Ryan. Mom and I are leaving today.</p><p>That\u2019s been the plan the entire time, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d My eyes dart around the confined room trying to pinpoint the threat that has Beth terrified. Adrenaline pours into my bloodstream, preparing me for the unseen attack. \u201cBut you changed your mind on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>A woman enters the living room. Too thin.</p><p>Stringy blond hair. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen Beth\u2019s mother up close. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I force myself to look into her flat eyes.</p><p>They\u2019re the same color as Beth\u2019s, but without the shine. \u201cI\u2019m Beth\u2019s boyfriend, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Her lips struggle into a weak smile. \u201cYou have a boyfriend, Elisabeth?\u201d</p><p>Beth tosses an empty plastic two-liter onto the floor. \u201cEx-boyfriend. He fucked me and then he told his mommy and daddy he hated me. Where are the damned keys, Mom?\u201d</p><p>My calm snaps. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that to you. If you\u2019ll give me a chance I\u2019ll explain about my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Beth screams and her mother flinches. \u201cKeys. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says and shuffles down the hallway.</p><p>Beth whirls and her nostrils flare. \u201cGet out, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you.\u201d</p><p>Her fists curl and she smacks her leg with the words. \u201cMy. Mom. Is. An. Alcoholic. And a heroin addict. Her boyfriend\u2019s favorite pastime is beating the shit out of me and if I\u2019m not around he has no problem taking his aggressions out on my mother. I have maybe minutes to get her out before he comes back and kills us all.\u201d</p><p>An eerie calm courses through me. Nobody hurts my girl. \u201cHe hits you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ryan. He hits me and kicks me and slaps me. I\u2019m his own personal violent video game. If I don\u2019t get my mom out of here he\u2019s going to kill her and if he doesn\u2019t, then the heroin will.\u201d</p><p>Every word Beth says is probably true, but I don\u2019t care about her mother. Beth is my only concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to you if I let you walk out this door with your mother?</p><p>Do you honestly think that getting in a car and driving to a different town is going to make anything better?\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>\u201cYES,\u201d I AUTOMATICALLY ANSWER, but a voice in the back of my head screams no. \u201cIt has to.\u201d</p><p>Looking out of place in his baseball uniform, Ryan takes up almost the entire living room thanks to his large body. \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you lied to me.\u201d He did and I try desperately to hold on to that.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up. I\u2019m not perfect. I lied to my parents about us, but I\u2019ve owned up to dating you. They know I love you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the right words, but... \u201cYou\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Anger blazes out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor months I thought you were the most courageous person I knew. You\u2019ve never apologized for being yourself, but standing here right now, I realize you\u2019re a coward.</p><p>You\u2019re so terrified of feeling anything that you\u2019d rather give up everything good in Groveton in order to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks to the side and my eyes narrow. \u201cSafe? I\u2019m standing here in a fucking drug den trying to save my mother from a boyfriend who will be thrilled to kill me, then torture her. There is nothing safe about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your safe. You\u2019d rather struggle in this life than live in Groveton.\u201d He glances at the squalor of the apartment. \u201cYou feel in Groveton. In this life, you don\u2019t have to feel a thing and that makes you a coward.\u201d</p><p>I drop the bag in my hand and raise a shaky hand to my forehead. He\u2019s wrong. He has to be. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m running. I need to save my mom because if I don\u2019t, who will?</p><p>Ryan closes the gap between us. My heart stutters when he places a hand on my waist. \u201cI wish I could say that I\u2019m the one that drove you away, but I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t have that power.</p><p>You\u2019ve been running from the moment I met you and I\u2019d bet you were running before that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like that bird in the barn.</p><p>You\u2019re so scared you\u2019re going to be caged in forever you can\u2019t see the way out. You smack yourself against the wall again and again and again. The door is open, Beth. Stop running in circles and walk out.\u201d</p><p>His other hand brushes the hair from my face and my lower lip begins to tremble. \u201cIf I leave her she\u2019ll die.\u201d My gut twists and my eyes burn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cups my face with his hands and I lean into his touch. Ryan can always do this\u2014make me feel safe. He continues, \u201cIf you stay it\u2019ll kill you. Maybe not physically, but you\u2019ll die on the inside. If you don\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll give you your space, but you have built so much more in Groveton besides me. Give up on us if you need to, but don\u2019t give up on you.\u201d</p><p>The instinct is to flee. Instead, I grab on to his arms. Fear claws at me and I don\u2019t like how naked it makes me feel. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Ryan lowers his forehead to mine. \u201cSo am I, but I\u2019ll be less scared when we leave here.\u201d</p><p>The front door opens. Bright sunlight blazes through the door and a gust of cold air announces the entrance of the devil. Trent\u2019s looming figure stalks into the living room.</p> <p>Losing control of my body, I feel my hands drop to my sides as my heart jumps to my throat. Ryan edges his body in front of mine.</p><p>Trent slams the door behind him and chuckles when he sees me. His eyes dart to the bag by my feet. \u201cYou should have stayed away.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, I hear the soft shuffles of my mother. \u201cElisabeth was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>Urging me in the direction of the door, Ryan presses his hand into my back. My mind screams run. My feet cement to the floor. It doesn\u2019t matter if I move or not. Trent won\u2019t let me walk out that door again.</p><p>\u201cLet Ryan go.\u201d I say it as a plea and Trent flashes a smile. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve asked anything of him and the bastard enjoys it.</p> <p>Trent opens a box of cigarettes, puts one in his mouth, and lights it. He sucks in a long drag and blows out the smoke as he stares at me. I shiver as I watch the glowing ashes. The last time, Trent enjoyed listening to me scream when he burned holes in my arms. \u201cGo ahead, boy. Get out. My problem isn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without Beth.\u201d Rage shakes Ryan\u2019s voice.</p><p>I love Ryan despite everything, and if it weren\u2019t for me, he wouldn\u2019t be here. Shoving my hands against his chest, I push him away.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Ryan sizes Trent up and Trent does the same to him.</p><p>\u201cWalk out the door, Beth,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to touch you.\u201d</p> <p>Trent laughs. Ryan is sturdy, strong, and young. Trent is larger, older, and a mean bastard. Last year, Isaiah and Noah took him on and the two survived because my uncle threatened Trent with a gun. My uncle isn\u2019t here and I\u2019m not lucky enough to own a gun.</p><p>Ryan inches toward me and the door. His eyes never leave Trent. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>My pulse pounds in my ears. Maybe we can walk out. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare move, Sky,\u201d Trent says.</p><p>I hold my hand out to her. \u201cCome with us.\u201d</p><p>Ryan yells my name as his arms fly out in front of me. Pain slices my head. The ground rushes toward my face. A combination of darkness and light flickers from behind my closed lids. Noises blend into a high-pitched buzzing as warm liquid trickles from above my eyebrow to the bridge of my nose. I lick my lips and flinch at the salty taste of blood.</p><p>My eyelids flutter and I fight to keep them open. The room shifts and spins. Forcing my eyes to focus, I see the shattered remains of Mom\u2019s table lamp on the floor next to me.</p><p>The buzzing fades and I turn my head to the sound of a struggle and grunts. Ryan shoves Trent into the front door by tackling him at the waist. Trent quickly responds by punching Ryan in the stomach.</p> <p>Ceramic cuts into my hand as I crawl toward them. \u201cStop.\u201d My voice comes out soft and hoarse. Ryan stumbles but is able to block a hit, then buys himself seconds by socking Trent in the jaw. I force pressure onto my legs so I can stand, but I fall.</p><p>Sitting in the fetal position on the other side of the room, Mom rocks back and forth on the floor. I swallow and force words out of my raw throat. \u201cHelp Ryan, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill us!\u201d</p><p>Mom lowers her head to her knees and continues to rock.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I scream. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Mom hums loudly and my heart breaks open. She\u2019s never going to change. No matter what I do. No matter how I try. My mom will always be this poor pathetic waste of life. I won\u2019t be her. I can\u2019t. I grab on to an overturned chair and force myself to my feet. Trent tackles Ryan and they both go crashing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d</p><p>Trent rises to his knees, punches Ryan in the face and Ryan falls once more. Panic tears at me. He\u2019s going to kill Ryan in front of me. The fucking bastard is going to take away everything I love.</p><p>I launch myself at him and smack and hit</p><p>and claw. He bends my wrist and arm in a way not physically possible. Bones in my arm snap and pop. A scream tears through my body as pain blinds me.</p><p>He lets go and I fall to my knees in agony.</p><p>My scream becomes silent as Trent squeezes his fingers around my neck. I gag and try to suck in air. Nothing happens. Thoughts flash through my head at a frenzied pace. I need air.</p><p>He\u2019s going to kill me. My hands go to the fingers crushing my throat, but I can\u2019t pry them off.</p><p>He\u2019s stronger than me and powerful and he\u2019s going to win.</p><p>Trent jerks and his fingers loosen. Ryan holds Trent in a headlock as I collapse to the ground and draw air into my burning lungs.</p><p>My hands flutter near my neck and cover where his fingers marked my skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby!\u201d Mom\u2019s hand joins mine on my throat. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Dazed, I nod.</p><p>Mom snatches my biceps and yanks in an effort to get me off the floor. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ryan curses and I unsuccessfully struggle to stand. \u201cHelp him, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Ryan locks his other arm around Trent\u2019s neck and yells, \u201cGo, Beth!\u201d Trent battles against Ryan\u2019s hold and Ryan\u2019s face strains as he fights to keep his grip.</p><p>Mom shakes her head. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Now. He\u2019ll hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Trent elbows Ryan in the gut, swings around and lands a blow to Ryan\u2019s face. Ryan falls.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Screams and pleas fly from my mouth. Blood covers Ryan\u2019s face. Trent stands and kicks Ryan in the stomach. I scream out in pain when I place weight on my left arm.</p><p>\u201cHelp him, Mom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go now, Elisssabeth.\u201d Mom calmly slurs my name. \u201cI want to leave. I\u2019ll go with you now.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and stare at the eerie image of my mother. Her tired eyes with their constricted pupils look at me as if I\u2019m a shadow instead of her daughter. Mom squeezes my hand again. For the first time, she\u2019s not rubbing her arm.</p><p>Cradling my left arm close to my body, I grip the table and pull myself to my feet. \u201cYou shot up?\u201d</p><p>As I stand, Mom drops to the ground. In shame? In exhaustion? Too high? I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Refusing to watch Ryan die, refusing to make eye contact with me, Mom covers her head with her arms and rocks over and over again.</p><p>Blood pours over my eye and my sight wavers as my body sways to the side. My fingers accidently hit Mom\u2019s cordless phone near the edge of the table.</p><p>Heroin.</p><p>It destroyed me nine years ago and one phone call cost me my father.</p><p>Heroin.</p><p>If I call, my mother will go to jail.</p><p>Heroin.</p><p>My finger slides against the numbers and like nine years ago I listen to the phone ring once, twice, a third time. The world turns black, then reappears in a fuzzy tunnel. My knees buckle and I force consciousness for a few more seconds.</p><p>\u201cNine-one-one, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d</p><p>Ryan</p><p>I SET MY CELL to the loudest ringtone and place it on my chest before I rest my head on my pillow. Beth\u2019s supposed to come home from the hospital today and because of that I\u2019ve refused pain medication. I want to hear her voice on the other end of the line and know that she\u2019s only a mile down the road instead of thirty minutes away in Louisville.</p><p>Then, for the first time in more than a week, I can sleep deeply.</p><p>My body is one slow, throbbing ache. Every pressure point pounds in time with my pulse.</p><p>Broken ribs, bruised everything, and cuts. Each and every injury worth the cost of saving Beth.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me why?\u201d My dad\u2019s voice carries into the room.</p><p>My eyes flash open and I turn my head to see him leaning against the door frame with his gaze pinned to the floor. It\u2019s the first words he\u2019s said to me since I hit him. He\u2019s been around. Present, but not speaking. I don\u2019t feel bad about it, because I haven\u2019t talked to him either...until now. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you risked it all for that girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love her. And her name\u2019s Beth.\u201d</p><p>No response. Sometimes I wonder if Dad knows what love is.</p><p>\u201cScott called,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cHe wanted to remind you that there are rules now. He\u2019s angry with both of you and he won\u2019t be letting her out of the house anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>I return my focus to the ceiling. I can deal with rules as long as I\u2019ve got Beth. Scott\u2019s been a mixture of grateful and pissed. In hindsight, maybe I should have called him when I found Beth\u2019s note, but I don\u2019t think Beth would have listened to him. She needed me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should continue to see her,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember asking.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and when I glance out of the corner of my eye, Dad\u2019s gone. Who knows if the two of us can fix what\u2019s been broken.</p><p>My cell buzzes and my stomach plummets when I notice Beth\u2019s name above the text. She promised she\u2019d call. Friends, right?</p><p>I half chuckle. It\u2019s the first text she ever sent me. Always.</p><p>The doorbell rings and I rub my eyes. I\u2019m too exhausted for guests, but they keep coming: my friends, the baseball team, my coaches, teachers, my parents\u2019 friends.</p><p>Mom and Dad\u2019s slightly raised tones indicate that they\u2019re disagreeing over something, and I don\u2019t care enough to figure out the issue. I expect them to continue the argument, but what I don\u2019t expect is Mom\u2019s voice at the door of my room. \u201cBecause I said so.\u201d</p><p>She throws a glare down the hallway before addressing me. \u201cRyan, you have a guest.\u201d</p><p>Before I can ask who, Beth walks into my room with her left arm in a sling. The breath slams out of my body. She\u2019s here. Forgetting about my injuries, I rush to sit up\u2014and wince.</p><p>The smell of roses overwhelms me and I glance up to see Beth by my side.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell. Have you been resting at all?\u201d</p><p>The right side of my mouth quirks up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Beth doesn\u2019t wear worry well and the ache on her face bothers me.</p><p>I capture the hand she uses to try to push me back down, bring it to my lips, and kiss her palm. God, I\u2019ve missed her.</p><p>A clearing of a throat and I notice Scott standing beside my mother at the door. \u201cA few minutes, Beth, then we\u2019re heading home.\u201d</p><p>Beth nods and I watch my mother\u2019s reaction to a girl in my room. She studies us, almost like someone seeing a painting they don\u2019t quite get. There\u2019s no malice in her expression, just curiosity. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the door open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say and I mean it. Mom\u2019s trying now\u2014not only with me, but with Mark, and I have Chris to thank for it. He called Mark when EMS brought me into the emergency room. Mark and Mom talked for the first time while I was in X-ray. Both are silent about the conversation they had, but they\u2019re speaking again. It\u2019s a start. Scott leans his head in when Mom leaves and stares straight at Beth. \u201cBehave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cBecause the moment you leave we\u2019re going to go at it like wild animals. Please.\u201d She motions to her arm.</p><p>\u201cBroken bones and bruises are so attractive.\u201d</p><p>Scott shakes his head as he follows Mom to the living room and Beth mirrors his movements. Do they have any idea they\u2019re clones of each other?</p><p>Beth sinks onto the bed and turns her head toward me. I don\u2019t like how she looks. Beyond the cuts on her face and head, plus the bruises, she\u2019s too pale and dark circles outline the bottom of her eyes. Wondering if I\u2019m dreaming, I reach over and rub her hair between my fingers. It\u2019s silky and real. I let the strands fall and meet her gaze. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>I hate the way her forehead crinkles and the pain weighing her features. She closes her eyes briefly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s my fault he hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not going to hear it.\u201d I grab Beth\u2019s hand and coax her to lie with me on the bed.</p><p>She resists. \u201cBut your mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she going to say? I\u2019m hurt. You\u2019re hurt. We got tired and lay down. I want to hold you so for once in your life can you not fight me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Someone\u2019s cranky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn right I am.\u201d But the knots twisting my gut begin to unravel when I lie back and Beth wraps her body gingerly around mine.</p><p>She\u2019s hesitant, testing areas first to confirm the contact won\u2019t make me sore, and I\u2019m gentle when placing an arm around her so that I don\u2019t jostle her arm.</p><p>When we\u2019re settled, I exhale and close my eyes. I\u2019ve dreamed of this for seven days. Who knows, I\u2019m probably dreaming now. If I am, maybe Beth will do something that\u2019s hard for her; maybe she\u2019ll give me answers. \u201cWhy did you believe Gwen over me?\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>I READJUST, SNUGGLING CLOSER to Ryan, but braced for signs that I\u2019ve hurt him. I can hear his heart now and the inhale and exhale of air through his lungs. If I weren\u2019t so damn tired, I could possibly cry. I thought I lost him at my mom\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Ryan runs a hand through my hair and I lick my lips, searching for courage. He deserves an answer. If not because he risked his life to save me, then because I love him. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p> <p>His heart beats several times before he speaks again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I was stupid. \u201cI don\u2019t know....\u201d I don\u2019t have Ryan\u2019s way with words. They\u2019re hard for me. Difficult. At least words that have emotion. \u201cI guess it was easier to believe that you used me rather than loved me. To be honest...I don\u2019t get it. Why would someone like you want to be with someone like me?\u201d</p><p>Ryan tips my chin up so that I have to look him in the eye. \u201cBecause I love you. Beth\u2014you\u2019re everything I want to be. You\u2019re alive and live without apology. I never would have made love to you if I thought you didn\u2019t trust me...or love me. And I never would have done it if I didn\u2019t trust and love you.\u201d</p><p>I lean up on my elbow and my heart is practically yanked out of my chest by the hurt in his eyes. \u201cI do love you, and I want to trust you....It\u2019s just that...I try....And...\u201d</p><p>Just damn. I slam my good hand on the bed.</p><p>Why can\u2019t I explain it? Why am I so impaired?</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The authority in his tone causes me to meet his gaze. My heart stalls when Ryan caresses my cheek with one finger and, under his touch, my skin turns red. I miss this. I\u2019ve missed him. Maybe I\u2019m not fucking this all up.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d he instructs. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Take your time, but just keep talking.\u201d</p> <p>Keep talking. I actually stick out my tongue in disgust and Ryan fights a smile. If he weren\u2019t so battered already I\u2019d sock his arm. I blow out a rush of air and try again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know....I just don\u2019t...trust...me.\u201d I blink and so does Ryan and it feels sort of scary and exposing to have said something so raw. He rubs my arm, urging me to continue, and I don\u2019t know how to continue. That\u2019s bull. I just don\u2019t want to continue. But this is beyond what I want. This is about me and Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make bad choices anymore.\u201d I glance at him, hoping I\u2019m making sense, because I\u2019m not sure that I am. \u201cAnd I sort of think that any choice is bad because I\u2019m making it and then I meet you and you\u2019re great and you\u2019re wonderful and you love me and I love you and I\u2019m just so damned scared I\u2019m going to screw it all up....\u201d</p><p>I slam my eyes shut and my lower lip trembles. \u201cAnd I did. I messed it all up again.\u201d</p><p>Ryan cups my cheek with his palm. I lean into it and open my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad it happened,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI thought they ran an MRI on your head.\u201d</p><p>His eyes laugh. \u201cThey did. Just answer me this\u2014before Trent arrived, were you going to leave with me?\u201d</p><p>I swallow and I\u2019m nodding before I answer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow as I try to understand the question.</p><p>\u201cNo, Beth. Don\u2019t think about it. Just give me the first answer that comes to mind. Why were you going to leave with me?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flash to his and my mouth pops open. No, it\u2019s not possible, because if it is, then it\u2019s a first for me.</p><p>The same hope I\u2019ve seen a million times from Ryan builds on his face. Is it possible he\u2019s known all along? \u201cSay it, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Those used to be the hard words, but now they\u2019re easier. I exhale and the air shakes as it comes out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other thing. Say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan...\u201d My throat dries out and sweat forms along my hairline. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slowly trail down my arm, over my sling and he rests his fingertips against mine. A warmth unfurls within me, starting in my heart and flowing through my bloodstream.</p><p>It creates a weird sensation of chains unlocking and breaking free. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m floating.</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d I say. \u201cI was going to leave with you because I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s silent, but the small, peaceful smile on his face causes me to smile in return. I wonder if my smile looks like his. I trust him.</p><p>Ryan. It\u2019s a little scary, but not as much as I thought it would be. Maybe this is it; maybe this is the beginning Scott\u2019s talked about for months\u2014the clean slate.</p><p>\u201cWas that so hard?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ryan touches my hair again. It\u2019s like he requires the contact to confirm I\u2019m not a ghost.</p><p>\u201cYou need to learn how to start trusting yourself.\u201d</p><p>I flop down so that my head rests on the pillow beside him. Ryan\u2019s slow as he shifts.</p><p>Our faces are so close that our noses almost touch. My arm begins to ache and I have a feeling Scott will show soon because he\u2019s timed my pain med schedule into his phone.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I heal first before I tackle anymore long-lost resurfacing emotional issues?\u201d</p><p>Ryan tilts his head and I silently swear.</p><p>Apparently we\u2019re not done yet. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott said Isaiah came to the hospital,\u201d he begins.</p><p>I nod, preferring not to go into this now...or ever. Noah visited me several times while I was in the hospital\u2014once with Echo, and twice on his own. He told me that Isaiah paced the waiting room until he heard I was going to be okay, then he left. My best friend left.</p><p>\u201cI think we should talk about it.\u201d</p><p>The fingers of my left hand try to tighten, but the blast of pain keeps me from making a fist. I hiss at the sting and Ryan edges closer.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I bite out. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I already told you that it\u2019s not like that for me with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>My brow begins to lift and I stop when the stitches on my forehead pull. Dammit, I\u2019m never going to be able to move again. \u201cThen why bring it up?\u201d</p><p>Ryan sucks in a breath and I can tell this conversation is eating at him as much as it is me. \u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d</p><p>No. Yes. \u201cIf he\u2019ll let me. But he left the hospital without talking to me. I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d Screw that. \u201cYes, of course I\u2019ll see him again. Isaiah and I are friends and he\u2019s going to realize that even if I have to take a two-by-four to him.\u201d</p><p>He looks torn between a smile and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit, the life you lived in Louisville is different than the one you have now. I\u2019m scared that if you have a place to run, a person to run to, when things get tough you\u2019ll go.\u201d Ryan stretches out the fingers of my left hand that had begun to retighten. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be someone doubting us, Beth, and I can\u2019t be in this if you\u2019re always running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more running. I promise.\u201d It\u2019s almost painful to step past my pride to say the rest.</p><p>\u201cYou were right...in Louisville...about me having a life in Groveton. I have you...but I also have Scott and Lacy and school. I like who I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he says as if proving his case.</p><p>\u201cBut Isaiah and I go back too far for me to abandon him. I\u2019m here. Heart. Soul. Body.</p><p>Groveton\u2019s my home, but I will never abandon a friend, especially my best friend.\u201d I stare at the comforter beneath us. \u201cI need you to be okay with it, because I\u2019m not budging when it comes to him.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of silence, I risk a glance. Ryan eventually caves. \u201cFine. He\u2019s your friend. If you\u2019re going to trust me, then I\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d</p><p>I kick off my shoes and rub my toe against his foot. It\u2019s the best I can do with an arm in a sling. \u201cDeal. I love you and...\u201d I swallow my fear and push through. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Ryan\u2019s muscles visibly settle and his eyelids flutter.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I repeat, allowing myself to relax along with him. \u201cYou know I want to hear it again.\u201d</p><p>Ryan moves closer, wraps a protective arm around my waist, and shuts his eyes. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d I softly mock elbow him with my padded cast and his chest moves as he chuckles. It feels so good to tease him again.</p><p>\u201cThe other thing. Say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Enjoying his warmth and strength, I melt into him and close my own eyes. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d But this time my mind drifts as I hear his soft declaration. I mean to demand the words again, but then my head finds his chest.</p><p>His heart beats steadily in my ear and I have my answer. Both Ryan and I lose ourselves in each other and sleep.</p><p>Ryan</p><p>A YEAR AGO, I had my life completely mapped out. It turns out, no one knows the future. I slip my arms through the suit coat and readjust my shoulders so the jacket will fit properly on my body. The bruises and cuts faded, but my ribs still ache by the end of the day. Especially if I\u2019ve pushed myself too hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour tie is crooked.\u201d Mom leans one shoulder against the door frame and gives a disapproving nod as she looks at my throat.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I inch away from my dresser and Mom undoes the knot.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cExcept for the tie.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s lips tilt up and she slides the tie to measure it against my chest. \u201cExcept for the tie. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Lines worry her eyes and she strains to hold the smile. \u201cI know the doctor cleared you to start practicing, but I think you should wait another week or two. Just to be sure everything healed correctly.\u201d</p><p>Mom expertly weaves the tie into a knot and tightens it up to my throat. She stares at it for a second before letting her hand touch my cheek\u2014a rare physical gesture for both of us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>She withdraws. \u201cI talked to your brother again this morning. He asked how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>Mark knows how I\u2019m doing. We\u2019ve talked on the phone every day since I was released from the hospital. Mark must still be feeling awkward talking to Mom and looking for the easiest conversation to have. I busy myself with buttoning my cuffs. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re stubborn like your father and wouldn\u2019t tell me if you were in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Mom fiddles with her pearls. \u201cIf we had listened to you that morning...If we had listened to you weeks before...If I had stood up to your father when Mark told us...none of this would have happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I wish they had listened to me the morning Beth ran away. I wish they had listened to me weeks before when I told them I cared for her. I wish Mom had stood up to Dad and kept Mark in our family, but none of that happened. Even if it did, there\u2019s no telling if it would have stopped the nightmare in motion.</p><p>Beth ran away because living in Groveton terrified her. She would have run regardless of what happened between us and because I love her, I would have followed.</p><p>Mom sighs and falls into social mode.</p><p>\u201cMark\u2019s coming home for dinner on Sunday. I thought we could keep it simple. Just me, you, Mark...hopefully your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d Even though we both know Dad will go into town while Mark is home.</p><p>Dad still refuses to acknowledge Mark exists.</p><p>Nothing much has changed in my parents\u2019 marriage. Mom\u2019s choosing me and Mark, and Dad dropped the idea of running for mayor.</p><p>But he\u2019s still home and they\u2019re still going to counseling. As I said, who knows what the future might bring.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the corsage.\u201d Mom slips out of the room.</p><p>I grab my car keys, the red rose wrist corsage, and head out to the garage. From the corner of my eye, I see Dad sitting behind his desk in his office. We haven\u2019t talked since that day in my bedroom and I guess today won\u2019t be the day either of us breaks our silence.</p><p>As I open the door to my Jeep, I hear the squeak of his chair and footsteps against the cement floor. Dad walks to his tool bench and sifts through the boxes of bolts and nuts. \u201cYour mom told me you signed a National Letter of Intent to play for the University of Louisville.\u201d</p><p>My muscles tense in preparation for a fight.</p><p>The letter required a parent to sign with me and I asked Mom for help. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that you\u2019re planning on playing with the team for a year, then reassessing whether or not you\u2019re ready to go pro.\u201d</p><p>Feeling naked without my cap, I rub the back of my head. I could go the easy route and give him a simple yes, but I\u2019m done saying or doing whatever it takes to appease him. \u201cAt the end of my freshman year, I\u2019ll decide if I\u2019m good enough to go pro. I\u2019m also going to major in creative writing. I love writing and baseball and I want to give them both a shot.\u201d</p><p>Dad slides a drawer full of nails closed and nods his head. \u201cDid you get her a corsage? Girls like flowers.\u201d</p><p>I hold the clear box in my hand. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say, and lift it up so he can see. \u201cYou taught me that.\u201d</p><p>Beth</p><p>SCOTT AND ALLISON\u2019S BEDROOM is too gaudy for my taste. The curtains are blue silk and frilly things like flowers and paintings of flowers decorate every available space. The bed is beyond massive. Scott and Allison don\u2019t have to go to separate rooms if they fight; they can roll over a couple times and be in different zip codes.</p><p>I sit on the overly cushioned chair in front of Allison\u2019s vanity and watch as she pins the hair onto my head. I hate the updo, but I can\u2019t complain. An hour ago, she dyed six stripes of temporary black color in my hair. Now my hair is an inch and a half of golden-blond at the roots, black flows over my shoulders, and black stripes even it out. \u201cScott is going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is, but I\u2019ll deal with that.\u201d</p><p>My lips curve and when Allison catches it in the mirror she smiles too. We\u2019ve had an uneasy truce since I came home from the hospital and sometimes I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing and send her over the edge. \u201cWhy are you being nice to me?\u201d</p><p>Allison lifts the curling iron again and shoots me a glare when I fidget. She twists a few strands that refuse to be a part of her plan.</p><p>\u201cBecause Scott loves you.\u201d</p><p>He loved me before, but that didn\u2019t keep her from hating every cell in my body. Not like I helped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I accused you of trapping him.\u201d</p><p>The curling rod pulls at the roots of my hair and I bite my lip. She releases the hair and little ringlets dance on the back of my neck.</p><p>Okay, I deserve the pulling\u2014and the ringlets.</p><p>Maybe now we\u2019ll be even.</p><p>Allison sets the iron back on her vanity. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...well, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>I blink. That was blunt, yet honest.</p><p>\u201cScott told me about his past, but it was easy to pretend it was a story until you came into the picture. I prefer life clean and simple. You made Scott complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott was always complicated.\u201d</p><p>Allison spritzes hair spray on me. \u201cI know that now.\u201d</p><p>Scott clears his throat and both Allison and I turn to see him entering the room. I stand and Scott grins when he sees me in the black strapless dress with a skirt that ends at the knees. He frowns again when he sees my hair.</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d says Allison without a hint of guilt.</p><p>Scott\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her last weekend she could wear those God-awful shoes with her dress and I told you that you\u2019d regret it.\u201d</p><p>I fidget in my official Chuck Taylors. \u201cI\u2019m wearing panty hose.\u201d That was a major concession on my part.</p><p>\u201cYou should put on a sweater,\u201d Scott says.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not wearing a sweater.\u201d Allison swats at him. \u201cThat would look wretched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how she looks. I care how much skin is showing.\u201d</p><p>Allison leans forward and Scott kisses her lips. I glance away. They do this more since I came home from the hospital. Not just kissing, but kissing like they mean it. Kissing because they truly love each other. She steps out of the room and Scott shoves his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I resist the urge to scratch my healing temple. \u201cShe covered the cut with the makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d He gestures to my left hand.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it feeling?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cFine.\u201d The black cast is temporary.</p><p>Trent shattered lots of the bones in my hand, wrist, and arm. I\u2019ll have to have another surgery in two weeks. My nondamaged fingers drum against my leg. I thought I could go without asking, but I can\u2019t. \u201cHow did Mom\u2019s court appearance go?\u201d</p><p>Mom and Trent had preliminary hearings yesterday. I told Scott that I didn\u2019t want to know what happened, but the curiosity is eating me alive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to want to know.\u201d He meets my eyes while I wrestle with the millions of emotions tugging me in different directions.</p><p>I nod and he continues, \u201cShe accepted the plea bargain and will be serving six years.</p><p>Trent pleaded not guilty against his lawyer\u2019s recommendation. The D.A. thinks they can get him to serve fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>A ball of dread forms in my stomach and I sink back into the chair. \u201cThen there will be a trial.\u201d</p><p>Scott lowers his head. All of us had hoped to avoid this. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and I will have to face Trent again when we testify. I take a deep breath to calm myself.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Mom?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about my mom at all. Six years. My mom is going to prison for six years and I\u2019m the one who put her there.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say softly. I do know, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it sucks any less. The doorbell rings and the dread starts to fade.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s here.</p><p>A good-natured smile settles on Scott\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAnd Prince Charming awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Scott?\u201d</p><p>He motions for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cHow could you keep the heroin to yourself?</p><p>I mean, that\u2019s a pretty big secret. I know that you wanted something to blackmail me with, but it was heroin.\u201d</p><p>Scott scratches behind his ear. \u201cI was in the process of hiring private detectives to find you when your aunt called. When I got to the police station, there was no way you were going home with anyone but me. One look at your mom and I knew things were bad.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cShe was so jumpy around the cops that I figured she was hiding something. I would have said anything I had to in order to keep you. But I never used the word heroin with you or your mom and I never went into your mom\u2019s apartment. I guessed that she had a secret and I bluffed.\u201d</p><p>And I sort of feel like an idiot. A happy idiot, but an idiot nonetheless. \u201cWell played.\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>AT THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING, my hands begin to sweat, including the one in the cast.</p><p>Indian summer in Kentucky has a strange way of making November feel like July. As we walk to the open field behind the scoreboard, Ryan holds my hand and he doesn\u2019t seem to care it\u2019s cold and wet. People yell and scream from the bleachers and the announcer informs the crowd that our team is at the first and ten\u2014whatever the hell that means.</p><p>The other couples nominated for homecoming court stand closer to the lamppost, but I hesitate farther back and Ryan plays along.</p><p>\u201cGwen won\u2019t bother you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019s right. She won\u2019t. Since Ryan and I returned to school, she\u2019s been less than her normal stuck-up self, quiet and withdrawn.</p><p>She apologized to both me and Ryan. I accepted it, but it doesn\u2019t mean I have to like her or be near her. Perfectly groomed, Gwen stands off to the side of the group. I sort of feel bad for her. Guilt is a horrible emotion. I should know.</p><p>\u201cWe could go talk to Carly and Brent,\u201d Ryan teases. \u201cShe\u2019s a big fan of yours.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cCarly and I were paired as lab partners today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee, best friends already.

Chipper is annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should double-date with them.\u201d</p><p>My eyes almost pop out of my head. \u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m about to walk out onto that football field and make a fool out of myself and you want me to consider double-dating with Mr. and Mrs. Chipper? Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>Ryan chuckles, then winks. \u201cI just wanted to see you get aggravated.\u201d</p> <p>I wrinkle my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re annoying.\u201d</p><p>He lets go of my hand, slips his arms around my waist, and pulls me close to his strong body. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The corners of my lips turn up and I slide my right arm around his neck. \u201cI miss touching you with both hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird seeing the ribbon on your other wrist,\u201d he says.</p><p>I shiver when Ryan caresses the sensitive skin above my cast and rubs the small of my back. Joyous and devious warmth spreads throughout my body. \u201cI never take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you in my bed,\u201d he murmurs so only I can hear.</p> <p>My smile grows and Ryan\u2019s face reddens.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant I miss sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>I know what he means. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to slip out with a broken hand.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his head to mine and his hold on me tightens. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t protect you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan, no. I would have died if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d he whispers against my mouth.</p><p>I expectantly part my lips for his kiss. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stone. Ms. Risk,\u201d calls the assistant principal. \u201cA little more space between you and a lot more paying attention. It\u2019s time for you to get onto the field.\u201d</p> <p>I deflate and wrap my hand on Ryan\u2019s bent arm so he can escort me out underneath the glaring lights. I wanted Ryan to kiss me. I needed him to kiss me.</p><p>Over the PA system, our names are announced and Ryan leads me to the fifty-yard line. People yell and scream, the loudest cheers coming from the section where we left Lacy, Chris, and Logan.</p><p>\u201cWhen you win,\u201d says Ryan, \u201cdon\u2019t forget you said you\u2019d keep that tiara on your pretty little head all night.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen as I realize how I can get exactly what I want. We stop in the middle of the field and I turn to him. \u201cKiss me. Not just a peck. The real deal.\u201d</p><p>Ryan glances around at the bleachers full of hundreds of people. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Beth Risk, do double dog dare you to kiss me in front of all these people.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes brighten and the arrogant smile that makes my heart trip over itself spreads across his face. \u201cAre you forgetting dare etiquette? You have to dare before you can double dog dare.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cFine.
