Rachel Peyton sat in a booth, gazing out at the street and taking occasional sips of the apple juice she\u2019d ordered. It was Friday, late afternoon, and she\u2019d come here after work to meet a friend. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her marriage to Bruce, wondering how it had disintegrated so fast. They\u2019d gone from an impromptu wedding last December to separation less than ten months later. She turned her head to look in the direction of Cedar Cove. The town was situated on the other side of Sinclair Inlet but might as well have been across the Pacific.</p><p>Rachel felt she couldn\u2019t go back home to Cedar Cove\u2014to Yakima Street\u2014and yet she had no other viable choice. She\u2019d left after the latest argument with her stepdaughter, Jolene. Although Bruce was aware of the tension between her and Rachel, he\u2019d never adequately addressed it, believing it would eventually resolve itself. Oh, sure, he\u2019d made a halfhearted offer to go to counseling with, or more likely without, Jolene. But that was too little, too late. Nothing had changed, and, as a result, the stress in their home had become intolerable. Now that she was pregnant, Rachel had decided to leave...for the sake of her sanity and for her own health and that of her baby.</p><p>She\u2019d lied to Bruce, saying she had a place to stay\u2014with an unidentified friend. Instead, she\u2019d checked into a Bremerton hotel.</p> <p>The problem was, she needed her job if she was going to support herself, which meant she\u2019d need to find an apartment in Cedar Cove or at least nearby. Everything was complicated by the fact that this hadn\u2019t been an easy pregnancy. She had severe morning sickness and her blood pressure was dangerously high. That was understandable, considering the tension in the house. If not for the baby, Rachel might have found the strength to deal with Jolene. She might\u2019ve been willing to devote all her energy to sorting out the complicated tangle of the girl\u2019s emotions, giving her the constant reassurance she seemed to require.</p><p>Since Jolene had learned about the baby, the whole situation had become that much more difficult. Not only did her stepdaughter see her as competition for Bruce\u2019s affections, but now Rachel had committed an even worse crime by bringing another child into the family, robbing the girl of his undivided attention.</p><p>What shocked Rachel was how close she and Jolene had been before she married Bruce. As a motherless child herself, Rachel had taken a special interest in Jolene, part maternal, part friendly. They\u2019d bonded when the girl was just six, a year after Jolene\u2019s mother was killed in a car accident. Bruce had brought Jolene into the salon for a haircut and Jolene had sadly told her how much she missed her mommy. Rachel had been drawn to the child because she\u2019d identified with Jolene. She still recalled in vivid detail how she\u2019d felt when her own mother had died and she\u2019d gone to live with her mother\u2019s sister, a woman she barely knew.</p><p>Through the years, the closeness between Rachel and Jolene had grown\u2014until she\u2019d made the mistake of marrying Jolene\u2019s father. To be fair to the teenager, Jolene had wanted Rachel and Bruce to wait until she\u2019d had time to get used to the idea. Bruce, however, wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He\u2019d wanted them married. Well, so did Rachel, although she\u2019d asked Bruce to delay the wedding because of Jolene\u2019s qualms. But by then...the momentum of their plans had taken over.</p><p>In the beginning, after first meeting Bruce, she hadn\u2019t considered him anything more than a friend. He was Jolene\u2019s dad. He relied on her help with his daughter. For years there hadn\u2019t been the slightest indication of romantic interest on either part. Rachel was seeing Nate Olsen, a navy warrant officer she\u2019d met after bidding on him at a fundraiser for the local humane society\u2014the Dog and Bachelor Auction. Shortly after the wedding, Nate was deployed out of state, but now he was back. They\u2019d been in contact recently and, in fact, he was the friend she\u2019d arranged to meet here.</p> <p>For a while she and Nate had seriously thought about marriage. However, by the time he\u2019d asked her to make a decision, Rachel had come to realize she was in love with Bruce. Surprisingly, miraculously, Bruce loved her, too. From there everything had moved quickly. Too quickly...</p><p>She had to acknowledge the truth of that old clich\u00e9 about marrying in haste. Rachel had been all too willing to accept Bruce\u2019s assurances that Jolene would adjust. After all, he\u2019d pointed out, it wasn\u2019t as though Rachel was a stranger.</p><p>But Jolene hadn\u2019t adjusted. Whatever affection she\u2019d had for Rachel had changed into passive-aggressive behavior and then escalated to open antagonism. Not wanting to distress her husband, Rachel had done her best to deflect Jolene\u2019s hostility. The pregnancy was unplanned, and she\u2019d hoped to keep it a secret for a few months, but Bruce insisted it was only right to tell Jolene. That, too, had backfired. And it had led to this.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 door opened but Rachel didn\u2019t look up until Nate Olsen slid into the booth across from her.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and offered him a weak smile.</p> <p>Nate\u2019s blue eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, sounding concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it. I look terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cJust...very pale.\u201d</p><p>Nate had emailed her when he returned to Bremerton. He felt she should know so that if they inadvertently ran into each other, she\u2019d be prepared. With everything else that was happening, Rachel hadn\u2019t paid much attention to his email and hadn\u2019t responded. Nate was someone she\u2019d loved in the past. She was a married woman now.</p><p>With time on her hands at the hotel, she\u2019d gone to the business center and logged on to her email account. She\u2019d impulsively answered his message, telling him that her marriage was falling apart. After they\u2019d exchanged a few short emails, Nate suggested they meet. She\u2019d accepted his invitation.</p><p>\u201cAt my last doctor\u2019s visit I learned I have an iron deficiency.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that she hadn\u2019t been able to keep down a meal. Her morning sickness lingered for most of the day, making her feel too queasy and uncomfortable to eat. She\u2019d lost weight when she should be gaining.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you got in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Only Rachel didn\u2019t know who else to contact. She couldn\u2019t reach out to her friends; they were the first people Bruce would approach. This separation was difficult enough without dragging her friends into the middle of it.</p> <p>\u201cI meant what I said,\u201d Nate continued. \u201cIf you ever need anything, call me. You know I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d</p><p>When the waitress came over to the table with a coffeepot, Nate turned over his ceramic mug and she filled it.</p><p>At his words, tears of appreciation sprang to Rachel\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cLike I said in my email, I...I\u2019ve left Bruce and Jolene.\u201d It went without saying that this fit right into her stepdaughter\u2019s plans. Undoubtedly Jolene was ecstatic about having her father to herself again.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s come to that?\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s dark hair fell forward as she looked down. \u201cI...talked to Teri and she wants me to move in with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. That\u2019ll be the first place Bruce goes. I told him I was moving in with a friend... . At the time I thought I might take Teri up on her offer, but I can\u2019t do that to her. She and Bobby have their hands full with the three babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri had triplets.\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed. That seemed to be a common reaction when people heard about the triplets. \u201cShe always does everything in a big way, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He knew Teri, so he also knew that if anyone could handle this, it was her friend. But capable though she was, Teri didn\u2019t need a miserable friend to deal with, in addition to caring for three babies.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you don\u2019t move in with Teri, where will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d All that mattered was getting out of the house as fast as possible. She got a hotel room, but that was far too expensive to be a permanent solution. At this rate she\u2019d drain her bank account in a week. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t take Bruce long to discover where she was, and once he did, he\u2019d do whatever he could to convince her to return home. Rachel couldn\u2019t allow that to happen, not while the situation with Jolene was still unsettled.</p><p>Nate sipped his coffee in thoughtful silence. Eventually he said, \u201cYou could always move in with me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s head shot up. That wasn\u2019t even a consideration. If Bruce learned she was living with Nate he\u2019d feel blindsided. Besides, it would give Jolene more ammunition to use against her. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the offer, I really am, but I couldn\u2019t possibly do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate, I couldn\u2019t.... What would Bruce think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She opened her mouth to object, then merely said, \u201cHe\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he would, but you don\u2019t have to tell him everything. The only important thing here is that you\u2019re somewhere safe and that you\u2019re taking care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stared at him. \u201cAre you suggesting I lie to my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lie, exactly. I\u2019m saying don\u2019t fill in all the blanks. As it happens, the house I\u2019m sharing belongs to a friend of mine. I have a room, but there\u2019s a third bedroom available. Unfortunately, Bob\u2019s deployed right now, so it would just be the two of us. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with that, I understand.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled, feeling torn. His idea did seem like a good solution, but she could only imagine how Bruce would react if he discovered the truth. For obvious reasons, the two men weren\u2019t on the best of terms.</p><p>\u201cIt might help you decide if I tell you I\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>Actually, that did help. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>Nate shrugged. \u201cSerious enough. I\u2019m out with Emily three or four nights a week. You\u2019d have the house to yourself most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of rent does Bob charge?\u201d</p><p>Nate mentioned an amount that was more than reasonable, then added, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be expected to cook or clean or anything else if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nibbled her lower lip as she considered his suggestion. He\u2019d given her an option she hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cBefore you answer, why don\u2019t you come over and check out the place.\u201d</p><p>Still, she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get away for a while, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She did, and Nate knew that.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace where Bruce and his daughter would never think of looking?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Nate told her once again. \u201cI loved you, Rachel, I really did, but I\u2019ve moved on. However, I care about you, which is why I brought up this arrangement. If you\u2019re concerned about what might result from the two of us being in the same house, then let me assure you right now, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll go see the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He left money to pay for their drinks, then slid out of the booth.</p><p>Rachel stood and immediately felt dizzy. She would have stumbled if Nate hadn\u2019t grabbed her elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you ate?\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and tried to remember. \u201cA while ago. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. Listen, no arguments. Once you\u2019ve toured the house, I\u2019m fixing you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t remember that I\u2019m a man of many talents.\u201d</p><p>His smile was just the salve she needed, his friendship the mainstay that would see her through this upheaval in her life.</p> <p>She followed Nate to the Bremerton address he gave her. The house was in a nearby neighborhood, convenient to the navy base. The two-story structure, built after the Second World War, had a large front porch and shuttered windows. It was meant for a family.</p><p>Unexpected emotion swelled up inside Rachel as she looked at the house. Her mother had been a single parent and her aunt had never married. All her life Rachel had yearned to be part of a family. When she married Bruce, she\u2019d felt as if she finally belonged. She had a husband and a stepdaughter and they were bonded together by love. It didn\u2019t take long for that dream to shatter and now, once more, she was on the outside...?. The baby stirred, and she pressed her palm against her stomach, hoping her child would one day know the love of a father, a mother and a big sister.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d Nate asked, again clasping her elbow as though he feared she might crumple onto the pavement.</p><p>Without answering, she accompanied him up the walkway to the steps.</p><p>\u201cI do my best to keep the place neat, but you have to remember I\u2019m a guy and housekeeping is low on my priority list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d she said, managing a glimmer of a smile.</p> <p>The house wasn\u2019t in bad shape. A few newspapers and magazines were scattered about but the sink was empty of dirty dishes and the living room free of clutter. The furniture, large and dark, wasn\u2019t anything she would\u2019ve purchased, but it would suffice.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you the extra bedroom,\u201d Nate said, steering her down the long hallway. He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, curious about what he found so amusing.</p><p>\u201cI promised there\u2019d be nothing romantic between us, and the first thing I do is take you to the bedroom.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSorry, the irony was too much for me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed softly. \u201cI guess it does sound rather...compromising.\u201d</p><p>The room he showed her was pretty basic. It might have been a hotel room for all the personality it revealed. A bed, a dresser and a nightstand were the only furniture. There wasn\u2019t a picture on the wall or any indication that someone else had once occupied the room. The bedspread looked worn and was probably one Bob had purchased years before.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d she asked, noting the number of doors leading off the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cUpstairs. Both of the other bedrooms are.\u201d</p><p>That meant it wasn\u2019t likely they\u2019d run into each other in the middle of the night, which made her feel a little less guilty about the prospect of deceiving her husband.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, leaning against the doorjamb with his arms crossed, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She paused. Again, she imagined what Bruce would say if he found out where she was living. That would definitely complicate an already complicated situation. But then, as Nate had said, she didn\u2019t need to tell Bruce the whole truth\u2014at least, not right away. He only had to be told one thing: that she was safe.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a good friend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She meant that. She believed in his genuineness, even though he\u2019d been hurt by her choice of Bruce over him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAnything for you, Rachel, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do it. You\u2019ve got yourself a housemate\u2014but on one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone I\u2019m living here. No one, okay?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Nate rubbed his chin. \u201cSince it\u2019s Bob\u2019s house I can\u2019t keep it a secret from him, and I feel I should say something to Emily, but I can ask them not to mention it to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you can tell Bob and Emily, as long as they\u2019re willing to be discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make that clear. But who do you expect me\u2014or them\u2014to tell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour friends. Or their friends. You\u2019d be amazed at how quickly word gets around in Cedar Cove. You might casually mention it to one of your navy buddies and that person might know Bruce and an hour later my husband will show up on the doorstep. Bruce isn\u2019t an aggressive or violent man, but he wouldn\u2019t take kindly to the two of us sharing a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, deal.\u201d Nate extended his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my end of the bargain, as well,\u201d she promised, shaking his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to be a good housemate. I\u2019ll pay my rent on time and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about it, Rachel,\u201d he broke in. \u201cI guess you can\u2019t tell Teri, can you?\u201d</p><p>Now, that was going to be painful. Rachel told Teri everything. She was her closest friend and had been for years. But Nate was right; she couldn\u2019t leak a word of this to anyone, not even Teri. Bruce would certainly ask her, and Rachel couldn\u2019t risk the chance that Teri would accidentally divulge the information. What she didn\u2019t know, she couldn\u2019t share.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will,\u201d she said. Hard as that would be, it was necessary.</p><p>Two</p><p>When the alarm rang at the Cedar Cove firehouse, Mack and his fellow firefighters jumped into action. The address was relayed as he leaped onto the fire truck, and the familiarity of it struck him immediately, although he didn\u2019t have time to think about it. Not until the truck, lights flashing and sirens blaring, turned onto Eagle Crest Avenue did he realize the house belonged to Ben and Charlotte Rhodes. Mack had visited there often, taking his daughter, Noelle, to see her grandparents. The smoke billowing out of the house came from the back, where the kitchen was located.</p><p>Mack and the two other firefighters pulled out the hose, all of them supporting it, and raced toward the house. The fire engine carried five hundred gallons of water, which enabled them to get water onto the fire without the delay of hooking up to a hydrant. A second truck would arrive within minutes and those firefighters would engage the closest hydrant.</p><p>Mack\u2019s heart pounded as he ran toward the rear of the house carrying the bulky hose. Already he could hear the second siren in the distance.</p><p>Ben and Charlotte, plus several of their neighbors, stood out on the sidewalk staring at the scene. Charlotte wore the horrified look of a woman who couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Ben stood next to her, his arm protectively around her shoulders. He seemed equally shaken.</p><p>Because he was busy working on the fire, Mack didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to the elderly couple until the blaze was extinguished, which took only minutes. Thankfully the damage seemed to be confined to the kitchen.</p><p>The fire squad commander spoke to Ben while Charlotte wrung her hands. She seemed so distraught and anxious that Mack approached, hoping to reassure them all was well.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mack, I\u2019m so grateful you\u2019re here,\u201d Charlotte said, her eyes brimming with tears, which threatened to spill at any moment.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he told her in a soothing voice. \u201cThe fire\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m sure I must have done something. Oh, why wasn\u2019t I more careful? I get so easily distracted these days... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cause of the fire hasn\u2019t been determined,\u201d Mack said, trying to be diplomatic, although he suspected she was right. \u201cAny number of things could be the cause.\u201d With a house of this age, electrical problems weren\u2019t uncommon.</p><p>\u201cBut I was the one in the kitchen,\u201d Charlotte said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been an electrical short,\u201d Mack said, hoping to calm her. He\u2019d just finished speaking when a car pulled up on the other side of the street and Olivia Griffin got out. She wore a suit and heels and had obviously just left the courthouse, where she was a judge.</p><p>\u201cMom, Mom!\u201d she called as she dashed across the street, barely watching for oncoming traffic.</p><p>Charlotte turned and hurried toward her daughter. They hugged fiercely for a minute, clinging to each other.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Charlotte assured her, tears slipping down her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Harry?\u201d</p><p>Mack hadn\u2019t seen the family cat and he\u2019d been too busy to remember Charlotte and Ben\u2019s pet.</p><p>\u201cBen got him out of the house,\u201d Charlotte explained. She glanced around as if unsure where he was currently hiding. \u201cOh, poor Harry, he must be terrified. He doesn\u2019t usually go outside, you know... .\u201d Her voice faded.</p><p>Mack\u2019s experience with the cat was limited. Whenever he, Mary Jo and Noelle visited, Harry made it clear that he was willing to tolerate them, but no more than that. After accepting the respectful greetings he considered his due, he generally ignored them all and retreated to his accustomed place on the back of the sofa. His other favorite perch was the windowsill overlooking the front yard. Harry was probably hiding somewhere, under the porch or maybe in some bushes. If the cat didn\u2019t show up soon, he\u2019d help with the search.</p><p>The squad commander seemed to be finished speaking to Ben, who now joined the circle. \u201cMack,\u201d the older man said, looking flustered. His white hair, normally carefully groomed, was in disarray, as if he\u2019d rammed his fingers through it repeatedly. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, his voice husky, \u201cfor looking after Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Mack didn\u2019t feel he\u2019d done anything out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cMack, what about the damage to the house?\u201d Olivia asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s being assessed,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut there doesn\u2019t appear to be any damage to rooms other than the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful you got here when you did,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cMom. Ben.\u201d Will Jefferson, her son, hoofed it up the last part of the steep street and across the lawn. Apparently he\u2019d run from the Harbor Street Art Gallery, where he lived and worked. It was only a few blocks away, but unfortunately they were all straight uphill.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s okay,\u201d Olivia told him. \u201cMom, Ben and Harry got out in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Will leaned over and placed his hands on his knees, wheezing as he attempted to catch his breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think when you called,\u201d he said to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Johnson left me a message at the courthouse,\u201d Olivia told their mother, \u201cand then I phoned Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t upset you too much,\u201d the next-door neighbor said, her brow furrowed. She stood a few feet away. \u201cI saw the fire and phoned it in, but Ben had already taken care of that. Then I thought if it was my house I\u2019d want my children to know what was going on, so I called the courthouse. I do hope that was the right thing to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt certainly was,\u201d Olivia said fervently. \u201cDon\u2019t ever hesitate to contact me in regard to Mom and Ben. About anything,\u201d she emphasized.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Will chimed in.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Charlotte echoed, reaching for her daughter\u2019s arm. \u201cI feel much better now that my children are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Will asked, still a little breathless. He glanced from Ben to Mack and back to Ben.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ben said, turning to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cI made lunch the way I always do\u2014chicken noodle soup, which was on simmer\u2014and then Ben and I sat down. We were reading when Ben said he smelled smoke.\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t smell anything, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. My new cooking magazine arrived today and they had twenty-eight recipes on how to use zucchini and I was absorbed in that. Then all of a sudden Ben threw down his book and let out a yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ben said, picking up the tale. \u201cI saw flames.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank goodness Ben can deal with a crisis because I panicked. My first thought was that we needed to put out the fire ourselves, but by then the kitchen drapes were in flames, and it was...just too much.\u201d</p><p>Mack cringed since trying to handle the fire themselves was one of the biggest mistakes homeowners made.</p><p>\u201cOne look told me it was already more than either of us could deal with,\u201d Ben continued, \u201cso I got Charlotte and Harry out of the house and used my cell phone to call 9-1-1.\u201d</p><p>Mack was grateful that Ben had remained calm. Too many people stayed inside the home to contact 9-1-1, putting themselves at greater risk. \u201cYou did the best possible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first action to take is always to get everyone out of the house, then call the fire department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens next?\u201d Olivia asked, directing the question to Mack.</p><p>\u201cThe fire department will investigate the cause,\u201d he told them.</p> <p>\u201cWhen will the investigator get here?\u201d Ben asked, standing close to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cUsually within a couple of hours,\u201d Mack told them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Crock-Pot?\u201d Charlotte said suddenly, clutching Ben\u2019s arm. \u201cI had tonight\u2019s dinner in it. Should we try to find it in this mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I think dinner is the least of your problems,\u201d Will inserted. \u201cI\u2019d assume the Crock-Pot\u2019s a lost cause.\u201d</p><p>Mack couldn\u2019t remember seeing it, but his attention had been focused on putting out the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about dealing with the insurance people?\u201d Ben asked, looking at Mack. \u201cWill they get in touch with us or will I need to call them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to notify them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contact information is inside the house,\u201d Ben muttered.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have the same carrier as you do for your car insurance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the phone number should be on your insurance card.\u201d Washington state law required carrying proof of insurance when driving, so either Ben had the insurance card in his wallet or in the car\u2019s glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ben grimaced. \u201cI guess I\u2019m more rattled than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable,\u201d Mack said. He glanced over his shoulder to be sure he wasn\u2019t needed elsewhere and noticed that Andrew McHale, the fire investigator, had arrived. Before he could point him out, Andrew disappeared around the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it be before we can go back in the house?\u201d Charlotte asked. \u201cI do hope everyone will be gone by five\u2014that\u2019s when Ben likes to watch Judge Judy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia said, gently patting her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to go back in the house. The kitchen\u2019s going to need a complete overhaul. It might be several weeks before the house is livable again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go back in the house?\u201d she asked in confusion. \u201cFor several weeks? Why not?\u201d</p><p>Mack realized that Charlotte hadn\u2019t taken in what Olivia was saying.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen\u2019s been destroyed,\u201d Will said, speaking slowly and clearly.</p><p>\u201cI know that, dear, but the rest of the house is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you can\u2019t live there until the damage to the kitchen has been repaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Charlotte turned to Ben as if asking him to plead her case.</p><p>Mack understood that she was bewildered and uncertain; she didn\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of what had taken place.</p><p>\u201cBut...where will we go?\u201d Charlotte asked helplessly.</p><p>\u201cDepending on the type of insurance coverage you have, the company might pay for you to stay in a hotel while the repairs are made,\u201d Mack explained.</p><p>\u201cA hotel?\u201d Charlotte shook her head as though the very idea was repugnant to her.</p><p>\u201cMom, you can stay with me,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019m close to the house and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good idea, Will,\u201d Olivia cut in. \u201cYou\u2019re living at the art gallery. That\u2019s no place for Mom and Ben. They\u2019ll stay with Jack and me.\u201d</p><p>The moment Olivia mentioned her husband\u2019s name, he drove up\u2014almost as though he\u2019d been summoned. The town\u2019s newspaper editor, Jack Griffin also did reporting duty when required; in this case he would have recognized the address. Accompanied by a cameraman, Jack headed in their direction, his ever-present raincoat billowing out from his sides as he strode across the lawn.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering why I called this meeting,\u201d he said, introducing a bit of humor.</p><p>Mack smothered a laugh.</p><p>\u201cJack, this is no time to joke,\u201d Olivia said, then hugged him. She seemed relieved that he\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, they say we can\u2019t go back inside,\u201d Charlotte wailed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blaming you,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cI want Mom and Ben to come home with us until the house is repaired,\u201d Olivia insisted.</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d Jack reached for his reporter\u2019s pad, a spiral-bound notebook, and had his cameraman get photos of the firefighters as they prepared to leave.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Olivia glared at her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to interview my mother, are you? Can\u2019t you see she\u2019s distraught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Jack Griffin had the good grace to look sheepishly at his mother-in-law. \u201cI am a reporter, Olivia, and this is news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, dear,\u201d Charlotte said, placating her daughter by patting her arm. \u201cBen was our hero, saving Harry and me and...oh, dear. Where is Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look for him, Mom.\u201d She turned to her husband. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to Mack,\u201d Olivia suggested. \u201cHe can explain about the fire.\u201d</p><p>Mack shook his head. It would be more appropriate if Jack talked to the squad commander. \u201cI\u2019m sure Chief Nelson would be happy to answer your questions.\u201d He motioned toward him, and Jack left them, hurrying toward Chief Nelson, pen in hand.</p><p>Mack saw Jack scribbling furiously during his conversation with the chief, nodding several times. Once he glanced over his shoulder at his mother-in-law and frowned, which told Mack that the cause of the fire had most likely been attributed to Charlotte\u2014just as he\u2019d guessed. She must have been distracted and left something, maybe the soup she\u2019d mentioned, on the stove. He remembered that she\u2019d talked about reading a magazine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be coming home with us,\u201d Olivia was saying when Mack returned his attention to Ben and Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cBut, Olivia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you can\u2019t stay here and you can\u2019t stay with Will. Where would you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would probably be best if you went with Olivia,\u201d Will concurred as Ben nodded. \u201cMy apartment\u2019s pretty small with only the one bedroom. I\u2019d sleep on the sofa if necessary, but frankly, it makes more sense for you to go home with Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll need to collect a few things. Ben,\u201d she said, \u201cwill you find Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in with you,\u201d Mack offered. \u201cIt\u2019s better if you don\u2019t go anywhere close to the kitchen until after the fire investigator\u2019s had a chance to finish his report and the insurance people have come by.\u201d</p><p>Then Mack joined Ben in looking for the cat. They found him a few minutes later, cowering under the front porch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault,\u201d Charlotte was saying when they returned, shaking her head as if to erase the memory of that afternoon. \u201cHarry!\u201d She held out her arms for the cat. \u201cOh, my sweetie...\u201d She nuzzled his broad head and then raised her eyes to Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m still not clear on what happened... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Ben and I are going to be with you for several weeks, I\u2019ll help you as much as I can,\u201d Charlotte promised. \u201cI\u2019ll clean and cook and I won\u2019t be a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019d never be a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bake for Jack,\u201d she said, her eyes lighting up with anticipation. \u201cYou know how he enjoys my baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack doesn\u2019t need you baking for him, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll cook him a pot roast. Jack\u2019s fond of my pot roasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s fond of food, Mom,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThe fact is, I can\u2019t think of a single thing you cook that he doesn\u2019t dig into like a starving man.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte beamed with pride. \u201cJack\u2019s a man of discriminating taste. Haven\u2019t I always said so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Olivia rolled her eyes. \u201cCome on, Mom, Mack and I\u2019ll help you and Ben collect what you need, starting with the cat carrier. Then we\u2019ll go to our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cVery sure,\u201d Olivia said, and slid one arm around her mother\u2019s waist.</p><p>Ben and Charlotte Rhodes would be fine, Mack mused as he followed them. They had family.</p><p>Three</p><p>Chad Timmons paced his Tacoma apartment and was so deep in thought, he nearly collided with the wall. That just proved it\u2014the woman drove him to distraction. From the moment he\u2019d met Gloria Ashton, it\u2019d been an on-again, off-again relationship. Like some unpredictable wind, she blew hot and then cold. The worst of it was he\u2019d put up with it. Well, he\u2019d had about all he could take. He refused to play her games anymore\u2014and that was what they were. Games. As far as he could see, there was no way he could win because she kept changing the rules. One day she wanted nothing to do with him. The next, she couldn\u2019t keep her hands off him.</p><p>Fine. He\u2019d decided he was finished. And he\u2019d stuck to that. Until Roy McAfee had hurtled into his life like a meteorite on its passage to earth. The crater that blast had left was deep enough to bury him.</p><p>Gloria was pregnant\u2014with his baby. He was about to become a father.</p><p>Talk about changing the rules... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It all added up now. After they\u2019d spent the night together, Chad had felt so sure they could resolve their differences. He was high on love, his head in the clouds, like some sappy walking clich\u00e9. The shock of her taking off without a word had made him feel bereft and stupid. Oh, she\u2019d written a note, but that had explained nothing.</p><p>So he\u2019d vowed that if this was how she felt, he\u2019d deal with it. He was finished. Chad had resigned from his position at the Cedar Cove Medical Clinic, moved to Tacoma and accepted a job as an emergency room physician. He\u2019d even started dating someone else. Joni Atkins was a lot less volatile and a lot more decisive.</p><p>A baby.</p><p>Even now, Chad had difficulty coping with Roy\u2019s news. If he was shocked, he could imagine Gloria\u2019s reaction. Her feelings about him, and about a future with him, seemed tentative, ambivalent at best. She\u2019d moved into the Puget Sound area a few years ago to search for her birth parents. Her adoptive parents had been killed in a small-plane crash and she was virtually without family. Then Gloria discovered something that had completely unsettled her. Her birth parents had eventually married and she had a full sister and brother. She\u2019d told him all that on their first night together\u2014which was also the night they\u2019d met. Their relationship had moved from being strangers to being intimate with reckless speed. That embarrassed Gloria and, frankly, him, too. Chad knew better. So did Gloria. Afterward she\u2019d asked for time to connect with her birth family. She\u2019d done that but nothing had changed. Every advance Chad made was met with stiff resistance. Then it happened again. She\u2019d agreed to a date, and they ended up in bed, which was followed by embarrassment and regret on Gloria\u2019s part. Again.</p> <p>Now Gloria was pregnant.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told him, although now he assumed she\u2019d come to break the news the day she\u2019d met him in the hospital parking lot. How was he to know what she\u2019d intended? As far as he was concerned, they were finished. That seemed to be what she\u2019d requested; according to the note she\u2019d left him, she wanted nothing more to do with him. If she\u2019d changed her mind, it was too late, or so he\u2019d felt at the time. He\u2019d moved on and he\u2019d advised her to do the same.</p><p>Roy, Gloria\u2019s birth father, had taken a tremendous risk by coming to see him. Gloria had asked that Chad be kept in the dark regarding the pregnancy, and Corrie, her birth mother, had agreed. But not Roy.</p><p>Years earlier Corrie McAfee had become pregnant while in college. Roy hadn\u2019t learned he was a father until after his daughter had been adopted. Apparently it remained a sore point between Gloria\u2019s birth parents. Roy wasn\u2019t willing to let history repeat itself, although Corrie felt the choice should be Gloria\u2019s alone. Going against his wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s wishes, Roy made sure Chad knew about the baby.</p><p>Chad hadn\u2019t decided yet what he should do. He worried that Gloria, who worked as a sheriff\u2019s deputy, might undergo too much stress in her normal job; she needed to be on desk duty. He wanted to talk to her, explain how important it was that she look after herself by eating right, taking appropriate prenatal vitamins, seeing her doctor regularly. While rationally he recognized that she was undoubtedly doing all those things, he couldn\u2019t help wanting confirmation.</p> <p>Chad reached for his car keys. It\u2019d been several weeks since his life was turned upside down and, so far, he\u2019d done nothing other than rage about the situation, agonize over it and try to settle on some course of action. The time had come to do something.</p><p>As he drove into Cedar Cove, Chad stopped at the local bookstore and picked up a baby name book, and a few others he often recommended to his patients. Perhaps that was a waste of money, since Gloria might already own these books, but he didn\u2019t care. It made him feel better. Knowing she didn\u2019t want to see him, Chad thought he\u2019d ask Roy McAfee to give her the books.</p><p>He got the address for the private investigator\u2019s office from the business card Roy had left him. Parking on the steep hill, Chad looked down at the waterfront, which bustled with activity on this beautiful September day. Cedar Cove had been his home for five years and he hadn\u2019t realized how much he missed it.</p><p>The totem pole at the library caught his eye. Its eagle\u2019s wings were spread wide as though embracing the entire community. He\u2019d enjoyed spending lunch hours at the waterfront park. Visiting the Saturday market had been another favorite activity; he remembered buying produce so fresh soil still clung to the roots. He saw a couple of kayakers paddling near the marina, their smooth, even strokes sending out ripples behind them. Harbor Street was busy, too, with late-afternoon shoppers and people leaving work.</p><p>Chad dragged in a deep breath before he tore his gaze away from the scene below. Shoulders squared, he walked toward Roy\u2019s office and stepped inside.</p><p>The front desk sat empty. A few chairs were lined up against the wall in the waiting area and an end table held a number of outdated magazines.</p> <p>\u201cMack, is that you?\u201d Roy McAfee called from the inner office.</p><p>Chad followed the sound of the other man\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s Chad Timmons,\u201d he said, and let himself into the office. He stood in the doorway, uncertain of his reception.</p><p>\u201cChad.\u201d McAfee rose from his chair and extended his hand. \u201cGood to see you. I was wondering how long it would take you to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably longer than it should have,\u201d Chad confessed. He sank into the chair across from McAfee and set the bag of books on the carpet. The office was sparsely decorated. A desk, a leather chair and a couple of bookcases. The walls were bare except for a large map of the town.</p><p>\u201cI guess my news was a bit jarring.\u201d</p><p>Chad snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d Then, because he had to know, he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Gloria feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Corrie tells me, she\u2019s been suffering from morning sickness, but other than that she appears to be doing well.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cBut then I\u2019m not my wife\u2019s favorite person at the moment. She hasn\u2019t quite found it in her heart to forgive me for contacting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not your problem.\u201d Roy dismissed Chad\u2019s comment with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes Gloria know that I know about the baby?\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned forward, shaking his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything and I doubt Corrie has, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, probably not.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cThat would be my take on it.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. \u201cI have something I\u2019d like you to give her.\u201d He lifted the sack of books.</p><p>Roy regarded the bag and then turned his attention back to Chad. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to give those to her yourself?\u201d</p><p>Chad wasn\u2019t sure of anything. \u201cFor now I think it might be best if I stayed in the background. From what Gloria said, she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me. So it makes more sense for you to do it.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t respond for several seconds, studying Chad intently. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>The front door opened. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>Roy got to his feet. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>Mack McAfee barged into the office and stopped abruptly when he saw Chad. \u201cSorry, am I interrupting anything?\u201d he asked, glancing from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d his father said, reclaiming his seat.</p><p>Mack\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve met, right?\u201d</p><p>Chad nodded.</p><p>Mack took the chair next to him. \u201cAh, yes, I remember now. You dated my sister Linnette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly.\u201d That whole scenario had been a disaster, and it had complicated everything else. While Gloria was building a relationship with the sister who didn\u2019t know they were even related, Linnette had developed a crush on Chad. Seeing how Linnette felt about him, Gloria had steered clear.</p><p>\u201cChad asked me to deliver some books to Gloria,\u201d his father explained.</p><p>\u201cGloria?\u201d Mack swiveled his head to look at Chad. \u201cWhy Gloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve...dated her, too.\u201d</p><p>Mack grinned. \u201cIt seems you get around.\u201d</p><p>Chad responded with a weak smile. \u201cYeah, I suppose it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my sister was big on reading,\u201d Mack said, relaxing in his chair, balancing one ankle on the opposite knee. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re dating Gloria, why don\u2019t you give her the books yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are a baby name book and a couple on pregnancy,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mack dropped his leg to the floor. \u201cYou and Gloria? Are you telling me you\u2019re\u2014this baby is yours?\u201d</p><p>Chad merely nodded.</p><p>For an instant Mack didn\u2019t seem to know how to react. Conflicting emotions showed on his face\u2014anger chased by confusion and then indecision.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, it came as a shock to me, too,\u201d Chad said, sharing a smile with Roy.</p><p>\u201cBut...but you\u2019re a...a physician.\u201d Mack stumbled over the words. \u201cIf anyone should understand about birth control, it\u2019s you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019m in full agreement,\u201d Chad said. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018It just happened\u2019 has got to be the most pathetic excuse in the book. What do you intend to do about this?\u201d Mack demanded.</p><p>Mack\u2019s anger was justified, and Chad took it to heart. \u201cThat depends on Gloria. At this point she isn\u2019t aware I know about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Mack glared at him and Chad looked over at Roy, hoping he\u2019d supply the answer.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, your sister specifically asked that Chad not be told. Your mother agreed to that, but I refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went behind Mom\u2019s back?\u201d Mack shook his head as if he already knew the answer and disapproved. \u201cAnd Gloria\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told your mother exactly what I was doing. She wasn\u2019t happy about it. In fact, she still isn\u2019t.\u201d Roy leaned back in his chair, frowning. \u201cI\u2019ll take the books to Gloria and explain that I told you about the baby.\u201d</p><p>Chad scowled. He wasn\u2019t ready for Gloria to find that out....</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time I told my daughter I went to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Chad said bluntly. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Roy blinked at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Chad tried to clarify his thoughts. \u201cFor one thing, I want Gloria to come to me. At some stage she\u2019s going to realize she needs me. If for nothing more than signing the adoption papers. Times have changed, Roy. Fathers have rights, too. Besides, I\u2019m thinking about raising the baby myself.\u201d The idea had only occurred to him a few days ago. He wasn\u2019t committed to it yet, but the possibility was gaining strength in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014Gloria\u2019s decided to give the baby up for adoption?\u201d Mack asked. He clenched his fists and stared hard at his father. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let her do that, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t our decision,\u201d Roy reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but... Okay, fine, whatever, but before that happens Mary Jo and I will raise the baby,\u201d Mack said in clipped tones. \u201cIf Chad doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d He obviously considered Chad capable of shirking what he himself saw as a duty. \u201cThis child is our family\u2019s flesh and blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore mine than yours,\u201d Chad murmured. But no use debating the issue until they learned Gloria\u2019s intentions.</p><p>Roy seemed slightly amused by Mack\u2019s reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should talk this over with Mary Jo first before you make that kind of offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll agree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a moot point,\u201d Chad said. \u201cNo one knows what Gloria\u2019s going to do. Once she\u2019s made her decision, we may need to talk again.\u201d</p> <p>Both men nodded.</p><p>\u201cFor now, all I ask,\u201d Chad said, \u201cis for one of you or even Corrie to see that Gloria gets these books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho should I say gave them to her?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Chad shrugged. \u201cLet her assume they came from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Mack asked.</p> <p>\u201cVery sure. I want\u2014no, I need\u2014Gloria to come to me. She\u2019s the one who walked away. Maybe it\u2019s just my pride talking, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d be more comfortable if she made the first move.\u201d</p><p>Roy allowed Chad\u2019s words to hang in the air for a moment before he responded. \u201cI\u2019ll hold off a bit longer if that\u2019s what you want. However, for the sake of my relationship with my wife, I think it might be a good idea if I confessed sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>Chad understood. \u201cOkay. Go ahead and tell Gloria.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it but Roy had done him one favor already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the books to her,\u201d Mack volunteered. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of good talks recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Roy raised his brows in question.</p><p>Chad was curious, too, although it wasn\u2019t his place to ask.</p> <p>\u201cGloria had to tell Sheriff Davis she\u2019s pregnant, and as of next week she\u2019s going on desk duty.\u201d Chad was relieved to hear it. However, Mack looked away as he spoke, which led Chad to believe there was more to this than he was saying.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s standard protocol for pregnant officers.\u201d Mack shifted in his seat, clearly uncomfortable with this turn in the conversation. \u201cBut, okay, the fact is that Gloria\u2019s in her mid-thirties, so the obstetrician is being extra cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she told her mother about this?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe so.\u201d</p><p>Roy sighed, and Chad guessed that Corrie hadn\u2019t said anything to Roy because she was still upset with him.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor\u2019s scheduled an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor when?\u201d Chad did his best to hide his own anxiety. He\u2019d dealt with a lot of pregnancies and a lot of babies during his medical career\u2014but none of those babies had been his. And although he was well aware that many women had babies later in life, he couldn\u2019t help worrying about Gloria.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t because you don\u2019t know? Or because she\u2019d disapprove?\u201d Chad asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t because I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d Mack said. \u201cAt least as far as I\u2019ve been given to understand. It\u2019s just that when it\u2019s someone close to you, I guess you worry more. But at least she\u2019ll be sitting safely behind a desk from now on.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Gloria, she\u2019d hate desk duty. She liked nothing better than being a beat cop, responding to calls and crises, interacting with the people of Cedar Cove. Chad found it interesting that she\u2019d gone into police work, following in the footsteps of the father she never knew.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call you if she mentions when the ultrasound is?\u201d</p><p>Chad nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, son,\u201d Roy said, his words and the sound of his voice lending Chad confidence. \u201cEverything will work out. It did for Corrie and me, and I\u2019m convinced it will for you and Gloria, too.\u201d</p><p>Chad relaxed in his chair. He had to believe Roy was right and there was actually a chance for him and Gloria.</p><p>Four</p><p>It\u2019d been a week since Rachel had moved out of the house, and Bruce was stunned that she hadn\u2019t returned. He\u2019d tried to be patient, giving her the space and time she claimed she needed. But he wanted her back with him and Jolene now, back where she belonged. The knot in his stomach hadn\u2019t disappeared yet, and it wouldn\u2019t, not until she came home.</p><p>Bruce still didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d gone. He\u2019d talked to her friends. Even Teri seemed bewildered about where she was, and her words rang true. Rachel\u2019s best friend was clearly very concerned about her.</p><p>\u201cDad, can you help me with this?\u201d Jolene asked, strolling into the kitchen, a math book clutched to her chest. She\u2019d been lounging in the backyard under a big striped umbrella, talking on her cell phone and pretending to do her homework.</p><p>Bruce looked up from the table where he\u2019d been sitting. \u201cYou know I\u2019m no good at this.\u201d The real problem, however, was his short fuse. He had limited patience when it came to explaining basic math. Computer programs were a different matter. Those he knew his way around; it was the theoretical stuff that stumped him\u2014partly for lack of interest. Things had been a lot better when Rachel was there to step in.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is just review. You helped me last year, remember?\u201d She cocked her head to one side, her dark brown eyes pleading with him. \u201cI passed the test. I never would have if you hadn\u2019t helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt was Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Her smile instantly disappeared. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. You helped me. I wouldn\u2019t let Rachel anywhere near my homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you did,\u201d he said a bit more forcefully. He remembered the incident well. Jolene had brought him her algebra homework and he\u2019d tried to work with her. Only when it became apparent that he wasn\u2019t particularly clear on the concept himself would his daughter accept Rachel\u2019s assistance. What stood out in his mind was how well the evening had gone. The tension between Jolene and his wife had lessened, giving both him and Rachel hope that the girl was finally adjusting to their marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou could at least try,\u201d Jolene snapped.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy,\u201d she said, all sweetness once again.</p><p>The phone rang as Jolene set her textbook on the table and Bruce leaped out of his chair, hoping, praying, it was Rachel. She\u2019d called a couple of times, but their conversations were always short, consisting of her reassurances that she was fine and her avoidance of any real answers. She\u2019d blocked his numbers so he couldn\u2019t get in touch with her. If it was Rachel, he was willing to promise her anything as long as she came home. He loved her and missed her. He\u2019d agreed earlier to see a counselor but Jolene wouldn\u2019t hear of it, and Bruce had foolishly put it off. He was embarrassed by the thought of spilling out their troubles to a stranger. He\u2019d assumed everything would right itself, but he\u2019d been wrong and his gamble had cost him dearly.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, grabbing the phone, his heart bounding into his throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is David Miller,\u201d intoned the recorded message, \u201cand I\u2019m running for state senator. Are you tired of runaway government spending? If that\u2019s the case, I need your vote\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bruce disconnected the line before he heard any more. He kept his hand on the receiver and hung his head, fighting back his disappointment.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jolene muttered. \u201cYou wanted that call to be Rachel, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to deny it.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need her,\u201d Jolene insisted, looking up at him from the kitchen table. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot better since she left. I\u2019ve made dinner all week, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t agree or disagree. Jolene had done her best to fill in, and while the meals weren\u2019t always palatable, his daughter had tried.</p><p>\u201cI know I overcooked the macaroni and cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly noticed,\u201d he said, and it was true because he\u2019d covered the entire plate with ketchup.</p><p>\u201cThe meat loaf was good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did an excellent job.\u201d Not exactly, but at least he\u2019d found it edible, again with the addition of ketchup.</p><p>Jolene beamed with pride. \u201cLike I said, we don\u2019t need Rachel.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Rachel\u2019s cooking Bruce missed, it was Rachel herself. He missed holding her in his arms and chatting in bed. He missed pressing his hand over her stomach and silently transmitting his love and excitement to their baby. He missed Rachel\u2019s smile when he walked into the house at the end of the day and the way she hugged him, welcoming him home. They\u2019d only been married a short while and yet Rachel had filled every nook and cranny of his world. He hadn\u2019t realized how alone and lonely he\u2019d been until she\u2019d come into his life. Without her nothing felt right.</p><p>\u201cDad, my homework, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019d do his best but he wished Rachel was the one helping Jolene... .</p><p>It took him nearly an hour. He wasn\u2019t a natural teacher and had to grit his teeth several times, but made it through the ordeal without losing his patience. Still, once he\u2019d finished, Bruce was cranky and ready for bed.</p><p>Walking into his room, he looked despairingly at the crumpled sheets and the bedspread, which had slipped off and pooled on the carpet. Rachel made the bed every morning before she left for the salon. Apparently the aunt who\u2019d raised her had insisted on it, and the habit had stuck. Then every night Rachel would remove the decorative pillows and neatly fold back the covers. The twisted and disheveled bedding depressed Bruce. He sagged onto the end of the mattress and came to a decision.</p><p>He was going to the salon tomorrow, and he\u2019d try his hardest to talk Rachel into giving him a second chance. He had to believe she missed him as much as he missed her. Surely she\u2019d want to come home. That belief was the only thing that got him through the day.</p><p>Friday morning, Bruce woke in good spirits. He had coffee brewing and Jolene\u2019s glass of orange juice poured before his daughter even wandered out of her bedroom.</p><p>She stared at him a moment before taking her glass off the counter. \u201cYou seem to be in a happy mood this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He was seeing Rachel today and he couldn\u2019t help feeling a sense of anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d Jolene regarded him skeptically. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to see Rachel, are you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one who left us, remember? If she wanted to come back she would have by now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Bruce ignored his daughter. \u201cDo you have your lunch money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit avoiding the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to leave now or I\u2019ll be late for my first appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>Bruce wasn\u2019t listening. He scooped up his keys and headed out the door, letting Jolene precede him. If he stopped work at four, which he fully intended to do, then he should be at the salon no later than four-thirty. He was his own boss and set his own hours. While he did his utmost to keep his computer clients happy, he had his priorities. Oh, yes, he\u2019d see Rachel, and once she heard how desperately he missed her, how much he needed her, she\u2019d move back home. Bruce couldn\u2019t wait. He found himself humming, but stopped when he caught Jolene scowling at him. He didn\u2019t care, but he didn\u2019t want to set her off, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At four o\u2019clock sharp, Bruce was in his car, driving back into Cedar Cove after finishing an on-site call in Gig Harbor.</p><p>He parked in the lot outside the shopping mall, and ran his fingers through his hair. He needed a haircut. Rachel had been cutting his hair for the past few years. Jolene\u2019s, too. Sooner or later his daughter would realize how much Rachel added to their lives\u2014and it was a lot more than free haircuts! He just hoped Jolene smartened up soon.</p><p>He chose the entrance closest to the Get Nailed salon. The salon storefront looked out on the mall and for several minutes Bruce stood there and simply watched Rachel work. His heart felt like it might pound straight out of his chest. He loved his wife.</p><p>A moment later, Rachel must have felt his stare because she turned and their eyes met. The brush she held dropped to the floor. She\u2019d lost weight, Bruce noticed, which wasn\u2019t good. It told him she wasn\u2019t eating enough and that the pregnancy was taking a toll on her health. His first instinct was to chastise her for not looking after herself. She also seemed exceptionally pale. Stephanie, when she was pregnant with Jolene, had suffered from an iron deficiency and Bruce wondered if that was the case with Rachel, too.</p> <p>While Bruce waited, Rachel finished with her client, then met him just inside the salon doors.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she whispered before he\u2019d had a chance to greet her.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t it be obvious?\u201d he returned, unable to take his eyes off her. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d Bruce didn\u2019t remember that. If so, he\u2019d agreed under duress and had since changed his mind, although he said none of that. \u201cI miss you,\u201d he whispered, and reached for her hand.</p> <p>Rachel looked down, but not before he saw tears in her eyes. \u201cI miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home, Rachel,\u201d he pleaded as his thumb stroked the top of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you ask. Just come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rachel had barely begun to speak when his daughter rounded the corner with two of her schoolfriends.</p> <p>\u201cI thought so!\u201d Jolene yelled, hands on her hips. Bruce recognized the girls, although he couldn\u2019t recall their names. \u201cI knew you were coming to see Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Next she glared at Rachel. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my dad says, I don\u2019t want you in our house ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene!\u201d Bruce snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re being rude and your behavior is unacceptable. This is between Rachel and me. Now please leave. We\u2019ll talk later,\u201d he said in as ominous a tone as he could manage.</p><p>\u201cI have as much of a right to be here as anyone.\u201d Her eyes sparked with indignation. She was obviously drawing strength from the presence of her friends, who stood with her, forming a silent barrier. Turning to confront Rachel, Jolene continued, \u201cHaving you out of the house has been great and I don\u2019t want you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene, stop right this minute!\u201d Bruce shouted. He lunged and grabbed his daughter by the shoulders. \u201cI told you, this is between Rachel and me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d his daughter insisted. \u201cI live in the house, too, and it\u2019s either me or Rachel because if she comes back, then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>That was an empty threat if there ever was one. \u201cAnd where exactly would you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it, both of you,\u201d Rachel cried, covering her mouth as she struggled to hold back a sob.</p><p>Jane, the salon manager, approached them. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if the three of you would take this elsewhere. We have customers here, and you\u2019re causing a scene.\u201d</p><p>Until then Bruce hadn\u2019t realized that there were two or three ladies in the waiting area a few feet away. His focus had been on Rachel to the exclusion of everyone else\u2014until Jolene arrived.</p><p>Taking his wife\u2019s hand, Bruce led her out of the salon, although they remained in full view of the customers. In fact, they were attracting a lot of attention\u2014and not just from Get Nailed. Everyone in the mall seemed to be staring at them.</p><p>Rachel noticed this, as well. \u201cI think it would be best if you all just left,\u201d she said, avoiding eye contact. Then she raised her head to meet Jolene\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this,\u201d Bruce muttered. \u201cIf anyone needs to go, it\u2019s Jolene and her entourage.\u201d He looked pointedly at his daughter, demanding that she give him some privacy.</p><p>Jolene folded her arms rebelliously and refused to budge. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Rachel pleaded, easing away from Bruce. \u201cLike Jane said, you\u2019re causing a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d He ignored his daughter and focused on Rachel. He understood now that he hadn\u2019t really grasped the extent of Jolene\u2019s selfishness. He didn\u2019t know how his daughter\u2019s dislike of Rachel had reached this point. Nor did he know what had torn the two of them apart in the first place. At one time they\u2019d been so close... .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jolene,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cYou can have your father all to yourself.\u201d</p><p>His daughter\u2019s smile could have lit up the entire mall. \u201cGood.\u201d To his shock, she and her posse of friends exchanged high fives.</p><p>With that, Rachel started to walk away, then apparently had a change of heart because she turned back. \u201cBruce, it would be better if you didn\u2019t come here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do show up, I\u2019ll get a job somewhere else. This is embarrassing to me and the salon.\u201d</p><p>Bruce shook his head, unwilling to stay away.</p><p>\u201cIf anything like this happens again, Jane\u2019s going to find an excuse to fire me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce had trouble believing that. But before he could respond, his daughter grabbed his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need Rachel,\u201d he countered, pulling his hand free. \u201cAnd our baby needs his or her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Jolene demanded. \u201cWhat about my needs?\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes locked with his. \u201cDon\u2019t come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Jolene inserted.</p><p>\u201cJolene, leave me and Rachel alone,\u201d Bruce said furiously. He refused to have her interfering in his life like this. It was time she recognized her role in the breakup of his marriage. And, he told himself, it was time he admitted that he\u2019d allowed her to do the damage she had.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said again, wanting Rachel to know how important she was to him. Somehow, some way, they\u2019d find a solution.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice was adamant. \u201cIf this...incident today did anything, it solidified my reasons for leaving. I won\u2019t go back to a house filled with tension and strife. It isn\u2019t good for me or the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t get a chance to finish as Rachel left him standing in the center of the mall with a dozen faces staring at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad,\u201d Jolene said, all sweetness now. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Bruce couldn\u2019t bear to even look at his daughter. If he opened his mouth, he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to curb his anger. So he simply turned and walked away.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re wearing that goofy look again,\u201d Tanni Bliss said as she strolled into the kitchen and selected an apple from the fruit bowl on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d Shirley asked, although she knew exactly what her daughter meant. She\u2019d just spent nearly two hours on the phone with Larry Knight, a nationally renowned artist\u2014and the man she was now seeing. Although \u201cseeing\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the right term, considering how much he traveled. They\u2019d met at the Seattle Art Museum a few months earlier and been in frequent touch ever since.</p><p>Larry was a widower of five years\u2019 standing, while Shirley had lost her husband to a motorcycle accident the January before last. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d never recover after Jim\u2019s death. She\u2019d been convinced that falling in love again was out of the question.</p><p>Then she\u2019d met Larry... . The problem was that he lived in California and traveled a great deal\u2014with his art exhibits, doing the lecture circuit, taking part in panels and interviews. They spoke every day now and emailed between conversations. They saw each other whenever possible, which wasn\u2019t nearly often enough to suit either of them.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s Larry now?\u201d Tanni asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in New Mexico.\u201d He might as well be on the moon. Without email and phone calls, she felt she\u2019d slowly go insane. Or maybe not so slowly! She\u2019d forgotten what it was like to fall in love. She\u2019d been a college student when she met and married Jim. He\u2019d been in the air force at the time and was about to be discharged. Eager to get on with an airline, Jim had set his sights on living in the Pacific Northwest. Once she\u2019d visited the Seattle area, Shirley had agreed. This would be a lovely place to live and raise their children.</p><p>After Jim had been hired by Alaska Airlines, they\u2019d settled in Cedar Cove and turned the basement of their large sprawling home into a studio for Shirley. She would\u2019ve been content to remain exactly where she was for the rest of her days. Until the accident...</p><p>And, even then, she couldn\u2019t imagine moving. But she\u2019d met Larry, and that changed everything.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you two getting married?\u201d Tanni asked, breaking into her musings.</p><p>\u201cMarried!\u201d Shirley gasped. \u201cWe hardly know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Mom. You haven\u2019t been yourself ever since the day you first laid eyes on him.\u201d</p><p>No use denying the obvious. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t noticed. You\u2019re crazy about Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s holding you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, Larry hasn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Tanni made it sound like she had insider information.</p><p>Shirley was tempted to ask if her daughter knew something she didn\u2019t. Larry and Tanni chatted frequently, although she assumed her daughter had been looking for information about Shaw, the boy she\u2019d once dated. The boy Larry had assisted in securing a place at the art institute in San Francisco.</p><p>\u201cHas...has he mentioned that he\u2019s going to ask me to marry him?\u201d Shirley didn\u2019t make eye contact. She felt guilty for even asking.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So much for that.</p><p>\u201cBut if he did propose, what would you say?\u201d Tanni asked.</p><p>Her daughter was teasing her. Playing along, she shrugged as if the question was of no real concern. \u201cI\u2019d probably tell him it was too soon and we should date a year or two first.\u201d</p><p>Tanni burst out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>She was, but that was irrelevant. Larry hadn\u2019t proposed and, even if he did, it would be far too soon to make such a major decision. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if she could just move to California. Tanni had a year of high school left, and Shirley\u2019s home and life were here in Cedar Cove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cWhat are your plans this weekend?\u201d she asked, blatantly changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d get together with Kristen and then we might hang with Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>At one time Kristen had been Tanni\u2019s sworn enemy. Shirley hadn\u2019t understood her daughter\u2019s intense dislike of the other girl. She suspected it was because Kristen was blonde, beautiful and extremely popular. Boys were drawn to her in a way Tanni seemed to find foreign. Shirley wondered if her daughter resented that she\u2019d only had one boyfriend in her whole life and that relationship was unraveling. Tanni had felt powerless; she hadn\u2019t wanted to lose Shaw, although in retrospect it was the best thing for both of them. They were too young and far too emotionally dependant on each other.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Jeremy an item now or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d Tanni cut her off. \u201cFirst of all, item is totally dated. Also, we\u2019ve talked a couple of times and that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t go making more out of it than there is, okay?\u201d Her voice rang with irritation, a tone that was familiar from the weeks and months following Jim\u2019s death.</p><p>Shirley instantly backed away from the sensitive topic. \u201cMiranda and I were talking about seeing a movie.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Shirley\u2019s best friend, Tanni grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cMiranda.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d She and Miranda had been friends for years. Miranda was a widow, too; she\u2019d been married to an artist, which was one reason she understood Shirley\u2019s artistic temperament. Shirley had fun with Miranda and appreciated her encouragement, her loyalty and support. Miranda could be opinionated and headstrong, but that didn\u2019t bother Shirley. If they didn\u2019t agree, Shirley had no problem either arguing with Miranda or ignoring her views.</p><p>\u201cI think Miranda likes Will Jefferson,\u201d Tanni commented.</p><p>Miranda had recently taken a part-time job with Will at the gallery. The fact that she\u2019d even accepted the position had surprised Shirley, since Will and Miranda seemed to disagree on almost everything\u2014and not in a friendly way, either.</p><p>If what Tanni said was true, and Shirley strongly suspected it was, poor Miranda was setting herself up for heartache. Shirley had recognized the type of man Will Jefferson was ten seconds into their first meeting. Will was all about Will, as Tanni might have put it. Handsome and charming, he was accustomed to having women fawn over him. More than that, he\u2019d come to expect it.</p><p>Shirley had to admit Miranda didn\u2019t possess the classic beauty that typically appealed to men like Will Jefferson. Tall and solidly built, Miranda easily stood five-eleven, and with heels\u2014although she rarely wore anything but sensible shoes\u2014she was over six feet tall.</p><p>Shirley felt that Will\u2019s usual preference was an empty-headed woman so he could be her intellectual superior. Miranda was his equal in every way. The fact that Will had made a blatant play for Shirley was\u2014to her mind\u2014more of an insult than a compliment.</p> <p>Even Tanni had picked up on Miranda\u2019s interest in him and Shirley worried for her friend. She doubted that Miranda was prepared for a Will Jefferson or the effect he might have on her emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie are you going to see?\u201d Tanni asked, unaware of the thoughts swirling around in Shirley\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home before ten,\u201d Tanni said, reaching for her car keys. She was out the door, munching on the apple as she went.</p><p>Pouring herself a cup of coffee from the pot she\u2019d made earlier, Shirley sat down at the kitchen table, wondering what to do with this unwelcome information. If she said anything to Miranda, it would only embarrass her friend. And any warning about Will would likely be dismissed out of hand.</p><p>Shirley glanced at her watch and, noticing the time, quickly got up from her chair. Taking one last sip, she left the mug in the kitchen sink, hurried to change her clothes and freshen her makeup, then headed out the door. She was supposed to meet Miranda at the Harbor Street Art Gallery at three-thirty.</p><p>The drive took less than ten minutes. When she stepped into the gallery, the first thing she heard was Miranda\u2019s raised voice. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, the Chandler painting will look better on this wall,\u201d she was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019d be better there,\u201d Will Jefferson said, just as heatedly.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d Shirley called out.</p><p>Miranda responded immediately. \u201cShirley, come over here. We need your opinion.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now she was going to be drawn into this argument, too. She walked toward them and glanced at the painting that seemed to be the subject of their disagreement. \u201cAre you ready for the movie, Miranda?\u201d she asked, hoping to avoid taking sides.</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Miranda insisted, gesturing at the watercolor.</p><p>The piece was stunning, the color choices vibrant and inviting. It portrayed a young girl in a blue cotton summer dress, biking past a white picket fence in a seashore town. A wide variety of flowers bloomed along the fence line. The girl\u2019s innocence was in subtle contrast to her unconscious feminine appeal. In style, it was naturalistic but its shimmering colors were influenced by classic Impressionism. \u201cThis is a lovely work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Will said, speaking for the first time. \u201cAnd I want it displayed in the way that will benefit it the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it should be on this wall and Will says\u2014quite irrationally, I believe\u2014that it should be there.\u201d Miranda indicated the opposite side of the gallery.</p><p>\u201cIrrational,\u201d Will repeated from between clenched teeth. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s irrational, it\u2019s you. If we hang the painting on the wall I suggest, it\u2019ll be the first thing people see when they enter the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wall reveals it in the best light,\u201d Miranda countered.</p><p>\u201cYou both have valid points,\u201d Shirley said when they turned to her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you compromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Will shook his head. \u201cThis is my gallery, despite what Miranda seems to think, and we\u2019ll do this my way because\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014I\u2019m the boss.\u201d This was said in a challenging voice, as if he expected Miranda to resign. As if he wanted her to.</p><p>\u201cFine. Hang it wherever you like,\u201d Miranda said, brushing her hands in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>Miranda sighed and, ignoring Will, said, \u201cHave you ever noticed how important it is to the fragile male ego to have the last word?\u201d</p><p>Shirley tried to disguise a smile, but Will obviously wasn\u2019t amused.</p><p>He bristled. \u201cThat is categorically untrue.\u201d</p><p>Motioning with her head, Miranda seemed to imply that his statement only proved her point.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go now?\u201d Shirley asked.</p><p>\u201cBe right with you.\u201d Miranda disappeared around the corner and returned an instant later with her purse and raincoat.</p><p>\u201cWhich movie are you going to?\u201d Will asked Shirley conversationally.</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Miranda muttered.</p><p>He walked them to the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got you on the schedule for Monday,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMonday?\u201d Miranda frowned. \u201cI thought I only worked Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind filling in for me? I\u2019m meeting with the insurance people on behalf of my mother and Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t mind, but I would\u2019ve appreciated knowing about it sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I forgot to mention it.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other and then Miranda nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be here at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said brusquely.</p><p>As they made their way to her car, Shirley considered Tanni\u2019s observation about Miranda\u2019s feelings for Will. She also suspected that, despite their bickering, he was actually fond of her\u2014and maybe he respected her more than he let on. He\u2019d certainly come to rely on her.</p><p>\u201cDid you choose a movie?\u201d Miranda asked. \u201cWhat about the latest Matt Damon picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the entertainment section of the paper and\u2014\u201d Miranda paused to look at her watch. \u201cThis is perfect. The next show starts in less than thirty minutes, which gives us time to drive there, buy our tickets and get our popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Larry this afternoon?\u201d Miranda asked as they got into Shirley\u2019s car. Her own would stay at the art gallery, and Shirley would drop her off there after the movie.</p><p>\u201cFor two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours!\u201d</p><p>Shirley laughed. Neither of them had wanted to end the conversation. \u201cLong-distance relationships are difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, this is how we stay in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get married? I don\u2019t know any two people better suited to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy, but I can\u2019t uproot Tanni when she still has a year of high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said you had to move right away?\u201d Miranda said.</p><p>\u201cWell, as I told my daughter, there\u2019s one small detail. Larry hasn\u2019t asked and at this stage I\u2019d be shocked if he did. I wish everyone would remember we only met a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your phone bill last month? And his?\u201d</p><p>Shirley rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. Okay, we spend a lot of time on the phone. Today wasn\u2019t an exception.\u201d Whenever he called her, whenever she called him, Shirley felt like a teenager again. Her heart would leap with joy at the sound of his voice.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the movie complex, and Shirley parked. They purchased their tickets and popcorn and were about to enter the theater when her cell phone rang.</p><p>It was Larry, which struck her as odd, since they\u2019d already talked that day.</p><p>\u201cDid I catch you at a bad time?\u201d he asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Miranda and I are just walking into the theater.\u201d She was juggling her popcorn, purse, drink and the cell phone, afraid of dropping one, when Miranda helped by taking the large soda out of her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you busy next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext weekend?\u201d She momentarily closed her eyes, trying to remember if anything was written on the kitchen calendar. \u201cI don\u2019t think so... Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to fly down to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in Nashville next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the lecture was postponed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I want you to meet me at my home in California. I know it\u2019s last-minute and I apologize, but I only just heard about this. Tell me you\u2019ll be able to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tanni and Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re available. I\u2019ll have to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. I want all of you to meet my children.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour children,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, I feel they should meet the woman I intend to marry.\u201d</p><p>Shirley froze. The bag of popcorn she held fell from her hand and spilled its contents on the floor.</p><p>Six</p> <p>Linc Wyse stepped outside the Wyse Man Garage and leaned against the building. Staying inside that office a moment longer would\u2019ve been intolerable. The bills were piling up and he had nothing to pay them with. His bank account, which had been substantial and was supposed to carry him for six months, was nearly empty.</p><p>The frustration was killing him. Marrying Lori and keeping it a secret from her family, which hadn\u2019t been his choice but hers, had created a fierce enemy in Lori\u2019s father. Linc had tried but he\u2019d been unable to convince Leonard Bellamy that he loved Lori, that he hadn\u2019t married his daughter for her money. Not that Lori had any money now, except what she earned herself. But Linc didn\u2019t care; he never had.</p><p>Despite that, Bellamy was out to ruin him and he was close to succeeding.</p><p>As Linc stared out at the street, a familiar truck passed, slowed down and then came to a stop in front of the garage. His brother-in-law. Linc straightened when Mack McAfee rolled down the driver\u2019s window and called out, \u201cHey, Linc, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Linc managed a grimace that he hoped would pass for a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look that busy. Do you want to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo\u2019s working late, Noelle\u2019s at day care and I just finished helping a friend move. A beer sounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me, too, but I\u2019d better stay here in case a job comes in.\u201d The mid-September sunshine made for a warm afternoon, not that Linc noticed the weather much. With no work, he\u2019d sent the men home. No point in paying for idle hands\u2014but it would be just his luck to have two or three people show up and find no one there. That was a chance he couldn\u2019t afford to take.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll pick us up a six-pack and be right back.\u201d</p><p>Mack returned within fifteen minutes, got out of his truck and handed Linc a can. They sat in the office. Leaning back in his chair, Linc pulled the tab off the cold beer and took a long swallow, enjoying the taste. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said to Mack, saluting him with the beer.</p> <p>Mack nodded. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen much of you lately,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t been getting out. He didn\u2019t have the inclination or, these days, the extra cash. But rather than respond, he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a man who\u2019s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\u201d Mack leaned back, too. \u201cTrouble?\u201d</p><p>Once more he answered with a shrug. He was tired of holding everything inside and yet he was used to keeping his own counsel. Fixing his own problems. But this time he couldn\u2019t. Bellamy was blackballing him\u2014no other word for it\u2014and the business was sinking fast. Not even Lori knew the extent of what her father had done, nor did she fully understand their financial situation. For that he had only himself to blame. Linc had told her next to nothing about any of this. Lori was angry enough with her father. Foolish and unrealistic though it seemed now, Linc had hoped to bring father and daughter together. It\u2019d never been his intention to drive a wedge into their already strained relationship.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s got trouble,\u201d Linc replied when he realized Mack was waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but not all trouble is created equal, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Linc agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here if you want to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>Linc regarded the man his sister had married. He\u2019d liked Mack from the start, although he\u2019d initially had doubts about their living arrangement. He\u2019d gotten over those doubts pretty fast. A firefighter and paramedic, Mack had helped deliver Noelle, Mary Jo\u2019s baby girl. While it had bothered him that Mary Jo didn\u2019t live close to her family, he\u2019d felt better knowing Mack was nearby. They\u2019d shared a duplex, he on one side and she on the other. They\u2019d married earlier in the year and Linc was happy for his sister.</p><p>\u201cYou might have noticed I\u2019m not exactly overwhelmed with work here,\u201d Linc began, finally giving in to the relief of divulging his problems to a sympathetic listener. \u201cI\u2019m not inexperienced in this business and I did my homework. By my calculations, I should have more repairs than I can handle.\u201d</p><p>Mack gestured with his beer can. \u201cLeonard Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>Linc nodded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t warn me.\u201d</p><p>Mack sat up straight, his eyes slightly narrowed. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t think I knew Bellamy wields that much power in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bremerton and all the surrounding areas, too, apparently. I couldn\u2019t even guess what rumor he\u2019s floating about me, but whatever it is, people in this community are buying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s causing problems between you and Lori.\u201d</p><p>Linc glanced away, avoiding his brother-in-law\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Mack nudged him. \u201cAre you telling me she doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lori\u2019s in the dark about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout almost everything.\u201d</p><p>Mack stared at him as if he found that hard to believe. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding, man! This is your wife. I know if I held anything back from Mary Jo, she\u2019d be furious. That, in case you\u2019re interested, is a lesson I learned the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Linc gave him a brief smile. Being well-acquainted with his sister\u2019s temper, he pitied Mack the wrath of Mary Jo.</p><p>\u201cThe Bellamys are her family,\u201d Linc said, defending his silence. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she want to be protected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a husband\u2019s responsibility?\u201d</p><p>Mack shook his head. \u201cNot if it means keeping her ignorant of things she should know. And,\u201d he added, \u201cBellamy might be her father but you\u2019re her husband. You two are in this together\u2014for better or worse. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Linc would think about that, but for now he was saying nothing to Lori. They finished their beers, chatting about the football season and the Seahawks\u2019 chances. Mack tossed his empty can in the recycling bin, then slapped Linc on the back and strolled out the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the beer,\u201d Linc said, following him outside.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He raised his hand in farewell, climbed into the truck cab and was off.</p><p>Linc left work early and by the time he arrived home, Lori was already there. Just seeing her warm, loving smile dissolved the tension that had been with him all day\u2014dissolved it for that night at least. Without a word she hurried across the room, slipped her arms around his neck and kissed him with enough enthusiasm to weaken his knees.</p><p>\u201cWas that for anything special?\u201d he asked as he spread nibbling kisses down the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYup. We\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...celebrating what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s Monday.\u201d</p><p>Each and every Monday was special when he was with Lori. She\u2019d changed his world, brought him joy, made him laugh. Before he\u2019d met her, Linc had seen life as a series of obligations. He\u2019d run the family auto repair business in Seattle with his two younger brothers. After their parents were killed in a car accident, Linc had assumed responsibility for holding the family together. He\u2019d taken his role as the oldest seriously and was determined to keep his brothers and his sister safe, to maintain a cohesive unit. That hadn\u2019t allowed time for anything frivolous like falling in love. Until he actually fell in love\u2014with Lori\u2014and his whole life went through a seismic shift.</p><p>\u201cI bought you a present today,\u201d she whispered seductively in his ear.</p><p>Shivers of awareness raced down his spine. They could barely afford groceries, let alone gifts. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see it?\u201d</p><p>He released her and slowly walked away.</p><p>\u201cLinc, don\u2019t you want to see what I got you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori, we\u2019re in a bit of a...a financial bind at the moment. It would be best if you didn\u2019t buy me anything for a while. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t make any unnecessary purchases. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, then nodded reluctantly. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll take it back. I still have the receipt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He felt bad asking her to return the item. Whatever it was would be superfluous. He had everything he needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to show it to you first, though. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Linc agreed and sat in the recliner while Lori disappeared into the bedroom. His heart was heavy. He felt her disappointment but they couldn\u2019t spend money indiscriminately, especially money they didn\u2019t have.</p><p>His wife reappeared dressed in a see-through chiffon piece of nothing. Linc\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cThat\u2019s...the gift you got me?\u201d Her tempting body was all but revealed, and Linc swallowed hard. \u201cI...I think we might find room in our budget for that.\u201d He got the words out, but with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I should know better than to buy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori,\u201d he said, closing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m nearly broke. The business is failing. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll last the month. I haven\u2019t wanted to tell you, but I can\u2019t hide it anymore.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand over her mouth and stared at him, wide-eyed with shock.</p><p>\u201cI realize I was wrong to keep this from you, but I...have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>Lori continued to stare at him as if she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. Leaning forward, he rubbed his hand across his face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She came to him then, climbing onto his lap and wrapping her arms around him. \u201cI married you because I love you. I don\u2019t need anything but you.\u201d</p><p>Linc buried his face in her neck and pulled her close. She lifted his head and he kissed her. Then she abruptly broke off the kiss, sliding off his lap and standing directly in front of him, her eyes flashing. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that to me again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss you?\u201d he asked in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I\u2019m talking about keeping the truth from me.\u201d Whirling around, she went into their bedroom, returning a few minutes later, fully dressed. \u201cOkay. What happened?\u201d Her voice was brisk, all seductiveness gone.</p><p>\u201cHappened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo cause this financial shortfall. You\u2019re...\u201d She paused as though everything had started to come together in her mind. \u201cMy father.\u201d She spoke in a low voice, then repeated the two words more loudly and with more conviction. \u201cMy father\u2019s done something, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he?\u201d she demanded again.</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t say for sure, but it seems that way.\u201d</p><p>She began to pace, five steps in one direction, five in the other, making quick, precise turns.</p><p>Linc found her movements almost hypnotic. \u201cNow, Lori,\u201d he began, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to get upset. I have everything under control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s low, even for him.\u201d Either she hadn\u2019t heard a word he\u2019d said or she recognized his statement for the lie it was. \u201cThis is going to change and it\u2019s going to change right now.\u201d She reached for her purse and yanked out her cell phone, punching a single button.</p><p>\u201cLori,\u201d he asked, \u201cwho are you phoning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Linc stood and circled her waist with his arms. \u201cLori,\u201d he said again, drawing her close. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>She moved the cell away from her ear. \u201cI\u2019m calling Daddy. And I\u2019m having it out with him.\u201d</p><p>Linc had seen that look in her eyes only once before and that, too, had been an instance involving her father.</p><p>\u201cHello, Helen, this is Lori Wyse. Is my father still in?\u201d</p><p>He started to tell Lori that maybe they should discuss this first, but one sharp glance from his wife told him to forget it. She was furious\u2014and determined.</p><p>A minute later Bellamy got on the phone. \u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d she said, all sweetness.</p> <p>\u201cHi, baby girl. If you\u2019re calling, I figure that means you\u2019ve come to your senses and dumped that useless husband of yours.\u201d</p><p>Linc stood close enough to hear Bellamy\u2019s half of the conversation. At his father-in-law\u2019s comment, his back stiffened. He released Lori, automatically clenching his fists.</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, it\u2019s the Bellamys I\u2019m\u2014as you so delicately put it\u2014dumping. For most of my life I\u2019ve cowered in front of you, caving in to your wishes. No more. You\u2019ve gone too far this time. You want to hurt the man I love, the man I married. I won\u2019t stand for that. I won\u2019t! In fact...I never want to hear your name or see you again. You have tried to manipulate me my entire life. Well, I chose to marry Linc. He is my husband and you will stop meddling in our lives. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Leonard Bellamy seemed amused. \u201cYou\u2019re talking mighty big for a girl living in an apartment her father owns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing. Linc and I will be out of here just as soon as we can find another place.\u201d</p><p>For once Bellamy didn\u2019t seem quite so sure. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, just the opposite. It\u2019s taken me too long. You\u2019ve done everything you can to ruin my husband, but you don\u2019t know what kind of man he is. He\u2019s going to make it, regardless of what you say or what you do. And as of this minute I am finished with this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to make her own decision. I\u2019ve made mine, and while I hate to exclude her from my life, I won\u2019t give you access to any part of me or my marriage. If that means never seeing Mom again, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy didn\u2019t appear to believe her. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re talking big now. But you\u2019ll change your mind at the first sign of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I, Dad? When\u2019s the last time I changed my mind about anything? When\u2019s the last time you convinced me to back down?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cListen, Lori...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Daddy,\u201d she said softly, and disconnected. With a hiccuping sigh, Lori dropped her cell phone back inside her purse. Then, as if she\u2019d suddenly realized he was right behind her, she walked into Linc\u2019s embrace and hugged him hard.</p> <p>Linc hugged her back. \u201cI wish you\u2019d talked to me before you did that.\u201d Linc knew what it was like to be without parents. He didn\u2019t fully grasp how important a father and mother could be until he\u2019d lost his own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only family I need now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lori...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to move,\u201d she said. She straightened and rubbed her moist eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that could be a problem,\u201d Linc felt compelled to tell her. He\u2019d known a move was imminent after his last dreadful confrontation with his father-in-law. The problem was, they didn\u2019t have enough funds to make a security deposit, plus the first and last month\u2019s rent. Even with Lori\u2019s salary from a high-end women\u2019s clothing store in Silverdale, they didn\u2019t have the amount they required. Or anything close to it. Her income covered groceries and daily necessities. And the apartment had been rent-free.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suggest we find a new place when our bank account is hovering around zero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about moving back to Seattle?\u201d</p><p>Linc had thought of that earlier but he hated the idea of bringing his wife into the same house as his two younger brothers. He enjoyed his privacy and feared Mel and Ned would see Lori as another Mary Jo, expecting her to take care of the cooking and cleaning the way their sister had. Not that he\u2019d allow it to happen.</p><p>\u201cThe commute would be difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change jobs,\u201d Lori said.</p><p>\u201cYou love your job,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019d miss it, but I\u2019ll do whatever I have to.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent for a moment. \u201cNo matter what it costs, Linc, we have to leave this apartment.\u201d</p><p>Lori was right, and he couldn\u2019t dispute that. The sooner they found a new place, the better.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Rachel wasn\u2019t sure that seeing Bruce was a good idea. He\u2019d been persistent, however, and after several conversations about it, she\u2019d finally given in. They\u2019d agreed to meet at the Pancake Palace after work. When she arrived, a few minutes late, Bruce\u2019s car was already parked out front; he\u2019d probably shown up right at five. She wondered if he\u2019d told Jolene where he was going, and doubted he had. Bruce liked to keep the peace. After all, he\u2019d let his daughter take charge of his life and their marriage. Rachel was astonished that she\u2019d stuck around as long as she had. The situation was emotionally unhealthy for all three of them.</p><p>Rachel parked several spots down from his car, hesitated for a moment, half tempted to flee, and then locked up. When she entered the restaurant she saw Bruce immediately. He\u2019d chosen a booth facing the door. He smiled as he stood to greet her. Funny how a simple smile could affect her so strongly. She smiled back, accepted his kiss on the cheek and slid into the booth across from him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said eagerly, his eyes filled with longing. He stretched his arms across the table and clasped her hands as if he needed to touch her. \u201cYou look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She\u2019d taken extra care with her hair and makeup, although she tried not to have high expectations about this meeting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling better?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo problems with the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay at work?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The past five days, following the fiasco at the salon, had been relatively calm. Jane hadn\u2019t been happy with her afterward, and Rachel couldn\u2019t blame her, but fortunately there\u2019d been no further reference to it.</p><p>One night recently when she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep, Rachel had gotten up for a glass of milk and found Nate in the kitchen. They\u2019d talked for almost an hour. He\u2019d been sympathetic, although never intrusive. During this conversation with Nate, she\u2019d realized with greater clarity than ever why Bruce acted the way he did. He hated confrontation and would do anything to avoid it. He coped by ignoring conflicts and tension, by wishing them away. He didn\u2019t want to be caught between his wife and his daughter. She couldn\u2019t fault him for preferring to keep the peace, but his approach didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYou need to look after yourself and the baby,\u201d Bruce was saying.</p><p>Alicia, the waitress, appeared in her pink uniform with the starched white apron. She automatically poured Bruce a coffee.</p><p>\u201cDecaf for me,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>\u201cComing right up. How about a piece of pie to go with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for me,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>Alicia scowled at him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you. She\u2019s the one who could use a little meat on her bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Rachel said, squelching a smile.</p><p>Alicia set the coffeepot on the table and started to enumerate the day\u2019s selection of pies. \u201cWe got apple, blueberry, coconut cream and peach. The apple\u2019s my favorite but you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Rachel looked at Bruce, who was grinning from ear to ear, apparently approving of Alicia\u2019s tactics.</p><p>\u201cApple, it is,\u201d the waitress announced, picked up the coffeepot and hurried into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost as bossy as Goldie,\u201d Bruce said, chuckling.</p><p>Goldie had been at the Pancake Palace forever, while Alicia, who\u2019d started there maybe twenty years ago, was a relative newcomer.</p><p>Actually, a piece of apple pie did sound good. With all this stress\u2014the pregnancy, the separation, the emotional upheaval\u2014Rachel had lost weight she could ill afford to lose.</p><p>Alicia reappeared with the decaf and a thick slice of apple pie. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Rachel reached for her fork but didn\u2019t try even a bite. She needed to hear what Bruce had to say, why he\u2019d wanted to meet. Clutching the fork, she waited until Alicia was out of earshot. \u201cYou asked to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s time you came home,\u201d Bruce said starkly. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife and I love you. You living somewhere else\u2014it\u2019s just plain wrong.\u201d His voice fell. \u201cI worry about you and the baby.\u201d</p><p>She knew he meant every word, but nothing about their situation had improved. Judging by the incident at the mall, Jolene was as angry and caustic as ever. Rachel wasn\u2019t wanted nor was she appreciated by her stepdaughter, and her husband wouldn\u2019t deal with the girl\u2019s hostility. Rachel refused to return to an environment that was unhealthy for her and her unborn child.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d she asked. With great precision, she set the fork aside and studied Bruce.</p><p>He cupped his mug with both hands and stared down at it. \u201cI have.\u201d He took in a deep breath. \u201cI failed you as a husband by choosing to ignore the obvious. I hoped the two of you would work it out on your own instead of doing what I could to help. If you come back, I promise I won\u2019t let Jolene say or do anything disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce, that isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019m sorry but this isn\u2019t going to be resolved just because you tell Jolene to respect me.\u201d Besides, he might be able to control his daughter while he was in the house, although she doubted it, but there were plenty of times when she and Jolene were alone.</p><p>His sigh revealed his impatience. \u201cOkay, tell me exactly what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want,\u201d she said emphatically, \u201cto get to the root of the problem and that means seeing a counselor. A family counselor,\u201d she specified. \u201cA professional trained to deal with situations like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He drew out the word.</p><p>His reluctance was evident. He\u2019d said yes to counseling a little while ago but it was obviously the last thing he wanted. Bruce had never been keen on the idea of pouring out their personal troubles to a stranger. For her part, Jolene had been violently opposed from the first. It was one of the factors that had led to Rachel\u2019s leaving. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that before and nothing happened. I\u2019d make an appointment and you\u2019d find a reason to cancel or forget or\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI only canceled the one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d make the next appointment but you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the table. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll go. No more excuses. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to bring you home.\u201d</p><p>Rachel reached across the table and squeezed his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s a start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can tell you right now that Jolene won\u2019t go,\u201d Bruce continued. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to get her to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, a trained professional can teach us how to deal with her.\u201d</p><p>Bruce frowned. \u201cYou really believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He held her look for a long moment, then shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go because it\u2019s what you want, but I don\u2019t hold out a lot of hope that someone neither of us knows is going to help in this situation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, you think counseling is a waste of time?\u201d She spoke slowly, letting him know how much his comment discouraged her.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Rachel, if Jolene begs off, which she already said she intends to do, what will we get out of counseling?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Rachel had to wonder which one of those two was the parent. Bruce had more or less told her everything she needed to hear. Without even sipping her coffee or taking a bite of the pie, Rachel slid out of the booth. What was a waste of time was meeting Bruce. Despite what he\u2019d said, nothing had changed, nor would it. Bruce just wanted their lives to go back to what he thought of as \u201cnormal\u201d\u2014the way they\u2019d been this past year. But Rachel would no longer tolerate Jolene\u2019s behavior toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Bruce asked, standing, too. He grabbed for her hand as if to stop her.</p><p>\u201cAll you care about is talking me into moving back home, and you\u2019ll say whatever it takes. Sweeping our problems under the carpet isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d go to counseling,\u201d Bruce insisted.</p> <p>Rachel was sure he\u2019d attend one or two sessions, but then he\u2019d find some excuse to cancel. Jolene would simply refuse to go, and Bruce would be powerless to make her. Rachel wasn\u2019t willing to accept half measures. When and if she moved back home, their circumstances had to be completely different.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave, Rachel. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was pointless for us to talk,\u201d she said, tugging her hand free.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want. I\u2019ve offered to go to counseling and that\u2019s not good enough. So what do you want?\u201d he demanded, irritated now.</p><p>\u201cI want my husband to be a man who honors my place in his life. A man who doesn\u2019t allow his children to dictate what goes on in his household. A man who\u2019ll cherish his role and mine\u2014and frankly, at this moment, you aren\u2019t that man. And I don\u2019t know if you ever will be.\u201d</p><p>Bruce blanched. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d he muttered sarcastically. \u201cSee how deep you can cut me. I came here hoping you\u2019d be reasonable, hoping to convince you of my love... .\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know what, Bruce? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for us to talk again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. All I ask is that you let me know when the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I will, but until then I\u2019d appreciate it if you stayed out of my life.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>While it was true that she might have a change of heart, right now she was dead serious. \u201cI do mean it.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Rachel walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sleep well that night or the next. Thursday afternoon she was with a client when she saw Bruce standing outside the salon. She turned her back, ignoring him.</p><p>Jane walked over to her and whispered, \u201cBruce is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head. Talking to Bruce wouldn\u2019t help either of them. How many times were they supposed to repeat the same argument?</p><p>\u201cRachel, he\u2019s only going to show up again and again. This is disruptive to you and to everyone here. I told you I didn\u2019t want him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call security?\u201d</p><p>Having Bruce escorted from the mall was further than she was willing to go. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d Setting the curling iron aside, and excusing herself to her client, Rachel stepped outside, where Bruce stood waiting.</p><p>He\u2019d buried his hands in his pockets and shuffled his feet back and forth like a schoolboy called before the principal. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good about how our conversation ended the other night.\u201d</p><p>It had bothered Rachel, too, although she had no idea how to change anything.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you please just come home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She hated to be so inflexible, but she didn\u2019t have any choice. \u201cI told you before and I meant it\u2014I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. I don\u2019t want to see you, Bruce. It only upsets me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay away, Rachel. I\u2019ve tried but I can\u2019t make myself do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re determined to hound me.\u201d Thank goodness she\u2019d had the sense not to tell anyone where she was living, not even Teri.</p><p>\u201cI want you back.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he intended to wear down her defenses until he got what he wanted. It sounded as if he planned to wait outside the salon every day until she moved back to Yakima Street. For her, the problem with that was twofold. First, Jane didn\u2019t want him hanging around, and second, Rachel feared that in time he would wear her down to the point that she\u2019d agree.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She longed to believe they could make their marriage work. For her sake and for the baby\u2019s. But every time she felt herself weakening, all she had to do was picture Jolene\u2019s face, mocking her with that triumphant smile. The girl had won, and for Rachel there was no going back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come here again, Bruce. I\u2019m warning you, if you do Jane will ask security to step in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, if that\u2019s what it takes to talk to you, then I\u2019ll gladly let them arrest me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t respond to his comment and returned to the salon. She wasn\u2019t sure how long Bruce stood there; she did her best not to look in his direction.</p><p>At quitting time, Jane asked the security guard to walk Rachel to her car. While she felt a bit ridiculous, she was grateful to be spared the risk of yet another confrontation with Bruce.</p><p>Once she got home, to the house she shared with Nate Olsen, she opened a can of tomato soup and had that and a few cheese slices for dinner. She wasn\u2019t hungry but she ate because of the baby.</p><p>Nate arrived around seven. Rachel was sitting in the recliner with her feet elevated. She had the television on and was reading a magazine at the same time. She needed as many distractions as she could get.</p><p>Her housemate took one look at her and frowned. \u201cBad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Unsure how much to tell him, she considered what she should say.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Nate held up one hand. He sat on the edge of the sofa. \u201cBruce showed up at work again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but didn\u2019t divulge the details of their conversation. \u201cJane isn\u2019t happy about it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he make another scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but he threatened to show up every day until I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awkward. It\u2019s going to cause problems for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t mentioned this part of the conversation to her boss. Jane was already upset with her over what had happened a week earlier.</p><p>\u201cI might have a solution,\u201d Nate said slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d At the moment everything felt hopeless.</p><p>\u201cA temporary position has been posted at the shipyard,\u201d Nate told her. \u201cOne of the clerks just had a baby and she\u2019ll be out for five months. The job requires basic computer and administrative skills. Do you think you might want to apply?\u201d</p><p>Rachel bit her lip. \u201cWould I have any chance of getting the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good a chance as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not.\u201d Getting on with the shipyard would certainly help her situation. The timing couldn\u2019t have been better. And after the baby was born, she\u2019d have to reassess her options, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI know someone in HR and I\u2019ll drop off a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that would be great! Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Not surprisingly, the next day after work, Bruce showed up at the salon. Rachel ignored him and after several minutes he left.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Jane whispered in warning. \u201cI don\u2019t want Bruce hanging around here. Can\u2019t you do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d Booking an extended lunch hour, she\u2019d gone to the shipyard employment office, had an interview and taken a test. She didn\u2019t know how well she\u2019d done but it didn\u2019t seem that difficult.</p><p>Nate was home early that evening, smiling when he walked in the door. \u201cI talked to Becky, my friend in HR,\u201d he said. He put his briefcase down, opened the refrigerator and removed a cold soda. \u201cYou got the highest possible score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did? Does that mean they might call me in for another interview? Did you tell her that if she hired me I\u2019d give her a free haircut?\u201d</p><p>Nate laughed. \u201cNo, because that might be construed as bribery.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled, optimistic for the first time in weeks. Months.</p><p>\u201cThe position will be posted for another couple of days and then Becky will notify the applicant who\u2019s been chosen. You\u2019ll know one way or the other by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Nate.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off her appreciation. \u201cAnything for a friend.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had a good feeling about this short-term position. It was perfect for her. The shipyard obviously agreed because a few days later Rachel received word that she had the job.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cJack, what\u2019s that in your pocket?\u201d Olivia asked, pulling her husband into the hallway that led to their bedroom. He had the grace to look guilty.</p><p>\u201cCookies,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she moaned. He had to watch his diet carefully, and the cookies and cake Charlotte insisted on baking weren\u2019t part of his low-fat eating program. After seeing Jack through one heart attack and bypass surgery, Olivia had been keeping a close eye on his eating habits. He\u2019d been backsliding recently, since temptation, provided by Charlotte, was ever-present these days.</p><p>\u201cYour mother baked them especially for me,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hurt her feelings, could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack.\u201d She sighed, and held out her hand. \u201cAt least give one of them to me.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAt this rate we\u2019ll both weigh three hundred pounds by the time your mother and Ben are back in their own house.\u201d</p><p>Olivia had already gained a pound and this cookie wasn\u2019t helping; still, like Jack, she couldn\u2019t resist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thrusting one hand in his pocket, he took out the cookies in their paper napkin, and begrudgingly placed two of the four he\u2019d pilfered in her palm.</p><p>Olivia finished off her last peanut butter cookie before she went into the kitchen. Her mother was busy with the dishes, quietly singing a hymn as she squirted detergent into the hot water. She put the bottle down by the sink and began a song about Jesus washing all our sins away.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia said, coming to stand next to her mother. She reached for a kitchen towel and slung it over her shoulder while she waited for the first clean bowl. \u201cYou could always use the dishwasher, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only takes a minute to do these few by hand,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were back.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d arrived home about ten minutes earlier and they\u2019d chatted briefly before she saw Jack slinking away, looking guilty. \u201cWe spoke when I came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did?\u201d Charlotte seemed confused.</p><p>\u201cMom, do you remember baking cookies yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I made Jack\u2019s favorites. Snickerdoodles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou baked him a pie last night, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes, the Granny Smith apples are outstanding this year.\u201d</p><p>Olivia tried to broach the subject carefully. \u201cThe thing is, Mom, Jack and I are trying to avoid sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heavens, why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of being healthy, eating right, getting in the required number of fruits and vegetables. While it\u2019s fine to have dessert once a week or so, every day is simply too much.\u201d</p><p>Her mother turned to look at her. \u201cBut I enjoy baking for you and it makes me feel like I\u2019m doing something to pay for my keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, you don\u2019t need to do a thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that, but I want to.\u201d</p><p>Because Olivia felt guilty she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not that Jack and I don\u2019t appreciate it, because we do. But Jack loves your cookies so much, he can\u2019t stop himself from stealing one or two even though he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mother beamed with pleasure. \u201cI always did like Jack Griffin. I was so pleased when you decided to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him myself,\u201d Olivia said, smiling as she spoke. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we compromise? You bake to your heart\u2019s content, and we\u2019ll freeze the cookies and other goodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, what a marvelous idea! That\u2019ll make everyone happy. No wonder you\u2019re such a good judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Olivia dried the clean dishes, put them back in the cupboards, then went to the laundry room. She had a load of whites she wanted to wash. To her surprise, she found them already clean and folded, sitting on top of the washer. Apparently her mother had taken that task upon herself. Unfortunately, she\u2019d added something red\u2014her new towel set? As a result, what had gone in white was now a fetching shade of...pink.</p><p>Groaning inwardly Olivia picked up the stack of clothes and carried them into the bedroom.</p><p>The phone rang just then, and the readout said Grace\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cGriffin residence,\u201d Charlotte\u2019s voice answered when Olivia picked up.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Charlotte,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two girls go ahead and talk. I\u2019ll get dinner on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a couple of minutes,\u201d Olivia told her mother. She heard the phone click as Charlotte hung up.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going with your mother and Ben living at the house?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy having your mother in your own home, is it?\u201d Grace said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, that\u2019s what I was calling about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to aerobics class, Grace, and I won\u2019t accept any excuses.\u201d They\u2019d stopped attending their weekly classes during Olivia\u2019s cancer treatments, but they\u2019d since resumed. This was their time and she wasn\u2019t going to be cheated out of it.</p><p>\u201cI promised Beth Morehouse I\u2019d stop by her place on Christmas Tree Lane to meet some dogs she wants to bring into the Reading with Rover program.\u201d As head librarian, Grace had started the program toward the end of the school year and now it had begun again. Beth, a local dog trainer, had been instrumental in its success. \u201cHave you ever been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You aren\u2019t trying to change the subject, are you, Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. She\u2019s got quite the operation. Twenty acres of Christmas trees and a full working crew. The house is lovely, too\u2014a big two-story place, charming as can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace, you know Wednesday is our exercise night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Olivia heard reluctance in her voice. \u201cBut I sort of got out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s more important than ever for us to get back into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Grace admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the pep talk. I needed it, and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t all that excited about driving out to Beth\u2019s.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can do it later in the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing Buttercup, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There was a silence, and Olivia realized her friend was fighting back tears over the loss of her beloved dog. \u201cYeah, I miss her. She was far more than just a pet. She saw me through the darkest days of my life.\u201d</p><p>Olivia felt her own eyes welling up with tears. She\u2019d loved Buttercup, too. Years before, one of her mother\u2019s friends was moving into an assisted living complex; she couldn\u2019t take the golden retriever with her and Charlotte had suggested Grace might want the dog. Dan Sherman, Grace\u2019s first husband, had disappeared a few months earlier and Grace had been alone for the first time in her life. Those had been dark days. It was more than a year before they\u2019d learned of Dan\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cSee you at seven,\u201d Olivia said once she\u2019d recovered her own voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Dinner that evening was a four-course meal Charlotte had spent most of the afternoon preparing. Ben had set the table, and Olivia noticed that he\u2019d arranged their cutlery in the wrong order\u2014very unusual for her always impeccable stepfather. They had squash soup, using squash from Charlotte\u2019s own small garden. That was followed by a mixed green salad with homemade poppyseed dressing. The main course was meat loaf, mashed potato casserole, fresh green beans, plus homemade pickled asparagus and sweet corn relish. And for dessert, a chocolate zucchini cake.</p><p>Olivia would\u2019ve preferred a light dinner because of her workout, but her mother wouldn\u2019t hear of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much too thin as it is,\u201d Charlotte murmured as she heaped a second spoonful of potato casserole onto Olivia\u2019s plate. Olivia forced a smile, took one more bite and then excused herself.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jack joined her in the bedroom. Ten extra minutes during which he was helping himself to seconds of everything on the table.</p><p>Olivia sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jack said, ever sensitive to her moods. \u201cAre you upset about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is trying so hard to be helpful and God bless her for it, but I\u2019d rather do my own wash and I\u2019d rather she stopped cooking like it\u2019s Thanksgiving every single night.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s face broke into a huge grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear me complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWipe that smile off your face, Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>He spread out his hands. \u201cHoney...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018honey\u2019 me. Look at this.\u201d She flew off the bed to her underwear drawer and yanked it open, then removed the now-pink panties and waved them at him. \u201cDid you see this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, when did you start wearing pink underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently today. Mom washed them with the new red towels, which by the way have also turned pink. Oh, and it isn\u2019t just my underwear that\u2019s this lovely color. You\u2019d better hope no one catches a glimpse of you in your pink shorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite so funny now, is it?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t all,\u201d Olivia lamented. \u201cMom cleaned out my sewing room. I asked her to not touch anything in there but either she forgot or she ignored me. Jack, I had all the fabric cut out for my next quilt and Mom decided to put everything away. Except that I don\u2019t know where away is and obviously it\u2019s slipped her mind, as well.\u201d A great deal had been slipping her mother\u2019s mind these days, and this wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d noticed. She needed to make Charlotte an appointment with a gerontologist.</p><p>\u201cYour mom straightened out my desk, too.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes went wide. Even she never touched Jack\u2019s desk. \u201cShe was only trying to help,\u201d Olivia explained unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sat down beside her and placed his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to have Mom tested for Alzheimer\u2019s. Or perhaps she has some other form of dementia. But something\u2019s wrong and we\u2019ve got to find out what it is and what we should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia...are you sure? That sounds a bit drastic. She\u2019s got a few memory problems, but a lot of people her age do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir house could have burned to the ground!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully it didn\u2019t,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat about next time? And there will be a next time, Jack. Mom\u2019s memory is declining and it isn\u2019t going to improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Olivia, I agree there\u2019s a problem but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re a reporter and you\u2019ve researched stories on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d In fact, not three months ago the Chronicle had done a feature on rising rates of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s, and local resources for families. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t like seeing it so close to home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean at home,\u201d Olivia said with wry humor.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But your mom and Ben might not be able to go back to their house. Would they continue to live with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That would slowly but surely drive Olivia over the edge of sanity.</p><p>\u201cWhere would they go, then? A seniors\u2019 complex?\u201d</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t given the matter much thought. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some pretty good assisted-living places,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRemember we profiled a few for that feature in the paper?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cThat makes the most sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Now that she\u2019d acknowledged the problem, much of what had been happening recently suddenly became clear. The fact that Charlotte had left her knitting in the car at Faith and Troy\u2019s wedding, for instance. Her mother was never without her knitting. True, it\u2019d been a traumatic day, since Ben had gone to confront his son David.</p><p>If it\u2019d been a single incident, Olivia could easily gloss over it, but there\u2019d been countless other ones. Small things such as forgetting where she\u2019d put Olivia\u2019s quilt fabric. The problem with the laundry. Then there was the fire.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia stood and walked around to her bedside table, where she reached for the phone.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother. I need Will\u2019s input on this.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes met hers. \u201cTime for a family conference,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nine</p><p>\u201cOh, what a lovely painting,\u201d the older, smartly dressed woman commented as she walked around the Harbor Street Art Gallery. While Will was out running errands, Miranda Sullivan had removed the Chandler painting from the wall where he\u2019d placed it. Then she hung it on the opposite wall, which\u2014in her humble opinion\u2014showed off the watercolor to its best effect. It was all about the light, her husband used to say, and who\u2019d know that better than an artist like Hugh Sullivan? She noticed how quickly this customer was drawn to the painting.</p><p>\u201cYou have good taste. This is one of our loveliest pieces,\u201d Miranda said, walking toward the woman. \u201cWelcome to the Harbor Street Gallery. Are you visiting Cedar Cove? I\u2019m Miranda Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Veronica Vanderhuff. My husband and I recently moved to the area and we\u2019re looking for a few pieces by local artists. Your gallery was recommended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come to the right place. All the art on display is by local talent. The work you\u2019re admiring is Beverly Chandler\u2019s Girl in Spring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my view it\u2019s the best painting we currently have.\u201d</p><p>Veronica shrugged her slim, elegant shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll our prices are extremely reasonable,\u201d Miranda assured her. She\u2019d love to sell this painting before Will returned. Then she could flaunt the fact that it sold only after she\u2019d hung it on this other wall.</p><p>Veronica checked the price list Miranda handed her and seemed pleasantly surprised. \u201cOh, this is reasonable. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Miranda wanted to clap and leap up and down. She\u2019d derive real pleasure from rubbing this in Will\u2019s stubborn face. Not a very commendable impulse, perhaps, but there it was. In all her life, Miranda had yet to meet a man who irritated and enthralled her in equal measure. She found herself highly attracted to this man she didn\u2019t even like. If that wasn\u2019t puzzling enough, he was constantly in her thoughts. She knew it was unlikely that Will would ever look on her as anything more than an employee, and yet she couldn\u2019t seem to help herself. Frustrating, to say the least.</p> <p>Miranda finished the credit-card transaction and made arrangements to have the painting delivered. Twenty minutes later, Will came back. He walked into the gallery and didn\u2019t bother to greet her, which Miranda considered the height of rudeness. Instead, he went directly to his office, slumping down in his high-backed leather chair.</p><p>Miranda followed him, leaning against the doorjamb, crossing her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>Will glanced up, frowning. \u201cI need a few minutes alone,\u201d he mumbled. He slouched forward as though depressed.</p><p>Miranda\u2019s sympathies instantly went into action. \u201cIs everything all right with your mother?\u201d She knew Will had been talking with his sister regarding his mother and stepfather. Dealing with the insurance company had demanded a lot of his time and energy. From what Miranda surmised, work in the kitchen was going well, although much more slowly than anyone had expected. But Will shared very little of his personal life with her, so this was based on information she\u2019d managed to pick up from others.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s doing fine\u2014not great but okay.\u201d</p><p>Miranda knew she should give Will the privacy he\u2019d requested but felt an almost overwhelming need to comfort him. \u201cWill,\u201d she said softly, moving a few feet into his office. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes lowered and shook his head. \u201cI have no one to blame but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she urged, wondering why he was so upset if there was no new crisis with his mother. She struggled to hide her feelings for him. Admittedly those feelings alternated between annoyance and attraction, but there were times, such as right now, when she realized how deeply she cared about Will. He was vain, supercilious, pompous and a hundred other adjectives she could think of. On the other hand, he was intelligent and witty, a talented businessman, devoted to his family and kind to animals. Not to mention good-looking in a dignified but still sexy way.</p> <p>\u201cI ran into Tanni Bliss,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cShirley was in California last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s head shot up. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>He asked the question as though she\u2019d personally betrayed him by keeping the information to herself.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Shirley and I are good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve told me.\u201d His eyes snapped with irritation.</p><p>Miranda planted one hand on her hip. \u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel about Shirley.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the ceiling and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me. Shirley is no more interested in you than...than the man in the moon. You\u2019re a smart boy. You should\u2019ve figured that out by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who introduced her to Larry Knight.\u201d He jammed his index finger against his chest. \u201cI met her first and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley isn\u2019t a prize marble,\u201d Miranda countered swiftly. \u201cAre you so egotistical that you can\u2019t accept the fact that not every woman in the universe is going to fall in love with you?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her and said, \u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll be happy to know Larry proposed.\u201d</p><p>As it happened, she was. \u201cShirley told me. So who told you? Larry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tanni. Like I said,\u201d he returned pointedly, \u201cI ran into her at the bank and she said she and her mother had a\u2014\u201d he made quotation marks in the air \u201c\u2014\u2018fabulous time\u2019 with Larry and his children. When they got there, Larry asked Tanni and her brother if they had any objections to him as their stepfather. And now...they\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>Miranda smiled delightedly, although she wondered whether Shirley would move to California. She felt a little forlorn at the prospect of not having her best friend close by anymore.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been kicked in the gut,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cOh, for crying out loud, get over it.\u201d</p><p>Will seemed shocked that anyone would speak to him in such a derogatory tone of voice. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Get off your pity pot. If you think Shirley was ever interested in you, then you\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>Will got to his feet and placed both hands on the edge of his desk. Leaning forward, he demanded, \u201cAnd you know this because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she told me so herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want. You aren\u2019t the right man for Shirley. She recognized it from the start. Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did she go out with me?\u201d</p><p>That was a no-brainer. \u201cGratitude. You helped Shaw get into art school and she felt she owed you. That\u2019s the only reason she agreed to a couple of dates. They didn\u2019t mean anything\u2014at least not to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this...\u201d He seemed to fumble for the right word.</p><p>\u201cCorrect?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and his ears grew red. \u201cI was thinking more along the lines of smart alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, smart is true enough. I was at the top of my class,\u201d she bragged. \u201cBy the way, did you notice the Chandler sold while you were out?\u201d</p><p>Will brightened considerably. \u201cHey, that\u2019s great! I didn\u2019t even look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, to a new customer who recently moved here. Veronica Vanderhuff wants to decorate her home with work by local artists and the first piece in her collection is the watercolor.\u201d</p><p>Will wore a smug, know-it-all look. \u201cI told you that wall was the perfect place to display it. The Chandler was the first thing she saw when she walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Miranda could hardly wait to enlighten him. \u201cWhile you were out, I moved the painting to the opposite wall. She barely glanced at the price before she bought it.\u201d Miranda was sure her expression was just as smug as his\u2014but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cThe morning light on it was perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved the painting?\u201d Will barged out of the office, nearly knocking her over in his eagerness to investigate.</p><p>Miranda followed him. The space where she\u2019d hung it was now blank, since she\u2019d brought it to the storeroom for wrapping.</p><p>\u201cWho said you could move that painting?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI knew I was right,\u201d she insisted. The painting had sold within thirty minutes, which should tell him her judgment was superior to his. If he wasn\u2019t too arrogant to admit the truth...</p><p>\u201cYou went against my orders,\u201d he flared.</p><p>\u201cOrders? Did I join a military unit and not realize it?\u201d she yelled back. \u201cIn case you\u2019re missing the point here, allow me to remind you. The painting sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve sold where I\u2019d hung it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll concede it might\u2019ve eventually sold, but we didn\u2019t need to wait because once it was effectively displayed, a buyer appeared right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve overstepped your bounds,\u201d Will said. He stalked over to the counter and slapped his hand against it. \u201cI will not have an employee taking matters into her own hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention we got full price and that Ms. Vanderhuff is interested in more artwork?\u201d Okay, Miranda was willing to agree that she might\u2019ve been out of line, but she had a point to prove, which she\u2019d done, and very successfully, too. One might think Will would take the fact that she\u2019d sold the artwork\u2014and for top dollar\u2014into consideration.</p><p>\u201cYou leave me no option,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re firing me because I sold the highest-priced item in the entire gallery?\u201d He couldn\u2019t possibly be serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m firing you because you went against my wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re firing me,\u201d she repeated tonelessly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Pack your things and go.\u201d He gestured to the door as if she needed guidance in finding her way out.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but before I go I want you to know I regret one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d she echoed. \u201cI deeply regret that I didn\u2019t quit weeks ago. You\u2019re the worst employer I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s mutual. I want you out of here and you\u2019re just as eager to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.\u201d Miranda marched into the back room and quickly gathered up her things. With her back stiff and her pride intact, she returned to the main part of the gallery. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d mail me my final check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and without another word she walked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, so much for that. Although she pretended otherwise, she was sorry to lose this job. She\u2019d enjoyed it; she knew she was good at it. Although Will Jefferson was as delusional and arrogant as she\u2019d said, she considered him a friend, too. A begrudging friend, but still a friend. That friendship, such as it was, had probably ended now.</p><p>The weekend dragged by. Looking back on the incident, Miranda wished she\u2019d handled everything differently. Will had already been upset about learning that Shirley was engaged to Larry Knight. Then she\u2019d heaped hot coals on his bruised ego by boasting about the sale of the painting.</p><p>Still, it was for the best that she leave. They bickered constantly and neither one of them was willing to give in. Will was just as stubborn as she was. And then there was this...this useless attraction she felt for him. Yes, it was preferable all around that she seek other employment. Only...she\u2019d really liked working at the gallery. She knew many of the local artists and they were familiar with her, too. Her being at the gallery was an asset to Will, but apparently he no longer saw it that way.</p><p>Normally Miranda would have confided in Shirley, spilled out her tale of woe. Not this time. But she couldn\u2019t explain why she hesitated to tell her closest friend that she\u2019d been fired.</p> <p>Instead, she hibernated all weekend, not venturing out of her apartment, even for groceries. She used the time to clean her oven, scrub the bathroom walls and sort out the clutter in her kitchen drawers. The tasks suited her mood perfectly. She needed a distraction, something to keep her mind off Will and the blowup they\u2019d had. And this kind of work made her feel more organized, more in control.</p><p>When her paycheck wasn\u2019t in the mail on Monday, she thought perhaps he\u2019d forgotten. She punched out the phone number for the gallery and waited for him to answer. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if he\u2019d already hired her replacement.</p><p>\u201cHarbor Street Gallery,\u201d Will answered on the third ring, sounding harried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miranda. I was looking for my check. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sorry. I haven\u2019t had a chance to write it. I\u2019ll do it this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like me to stop by and pick it up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can I expect you?\u201d</p><p>Miranda glanced at her watch. \u201cAn hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p> <p>She replaced the phone and felt better than she had all weekend. Collecting her purse and sweater, she headed out the door. The early part of the week was generally slow at the gallery. She\u2019d filled in for Will a couple of Mondays that month so he could help his mother and stepfather with the insurance people and the builder remodeling the kitchen.</p><p>Will was sitting behind the counter, leafing through a catalog, and stood when she entered the gallery. He didn\u2019t smile at first and neither did she. The old wooden floor creaked as she walked across the room, which made her feel even more self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cI have time on my hands, so it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her weak joke.</p><p>\u201cYou have my check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, locating the envelope under the counter. He handed it to her but held on to one end. \u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I might\u2019ve been a bit hasty in letting you go when I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally...\u201d</p><p>He hedged for a few seconds. \u201cThere aren\u2019t as many tourists as we usually get this time of year, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she went on, \u201cthe gallery has the potential to bring in a large clientele.\u201d Miranda had plenty of ideas she wanted to share\u2014like a holiday show, sponsoring an art walk, hosting an event for the chamber of commerce. They could invite local artists, serve wine and cheese, consider ways to work with other businesses.</p><p>\u201cI believe there\u2019s great potential here, too,\u201d Will concurred. \u201cProblem is, I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need an assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut I was foolish enough to fire the best one I\u2019m likely to find.\u201d</p><p>Miranda felt sure she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly. \u201cAre you saying you want me to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cantankerous, insubordinate and a lot of other things I could mention, but two days without you and I was ready to pull my hair out. Pride is a fine thing, but it only carries you so far\u2014and I\u2019ve reached my limit. I want you back. Would you be willing to let bygones be bygones and start over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I could do that,\u201d she said, struggling to hide her delight. The knot in her stomach unraveled and the tension eased from her shoulders. \u201cWe can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d Will smiled.</p><p>And Miranda smiled back.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Sitting at her parents\u2019 kitchen counter, Gloria Ashton watched her mother move briskly around, assembling a variety of bowls and wooden spoons. Gloria wasn\u2019t sure what Corrie was making but it seemed to demand a lot of attention. The cookbook was propped open and a dozen ingredients were lined up on the counter.</p><p>Roy was in the living room reading the local paper and that, too, appeared to be completely captivating.</p><p>\u201cWould you like more milk?\u201d Corrie asked, nodding at Gloria\u2019s half-empty glass.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had first noticed the tension between Roy and Corrie a couple of weeks ago and tried to ignore it. She figured they\u2019d resolve the problem, whatever it was, without interference from her or anyone else. But that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay between you and Roy?\u201d she finally asked. She\u2019d decided just coming right out with it was better than pretending this uneasiness didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Roy rattled his paper and Corrie dropped an egg on the counter, breaking the shell. She tore off a paper towel and used it to shove the raw egg and broken shell directly into the kitchen sink. She turned on the water, ran the garbage disposal, then washed her hands, drying them on her apron.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, dear?\u201d she asked as if she hadn\u2019t heard the question.</p><p>\u201cI asked if everything\u2019s all right between you and Roy,\u201d Gloria repeated.</p><p>Corrie stood on the other side of the counter, looking into the living room, where Roy sat with the newspaper hiding his face. \u201cThat\u2019s something you need to ask your father,\u201d she said in a starched voice.</p><p>Roy lowered the paper, stared into the kitchen, then resumed reading. He\u2019d been at it a solid hour. Gloria assumed he\u2019d read it from front to back twice over by now. The Tuesday editions were often the skimpiest of the week.</p><p>\u201cRoy doesn\u2019t seem to be in the mood to talk,\u201d Gloria said. The fact that she\u2019d only recently come into their lives had left her with an incomplete picture of Roy and Corrie\u2019s relationship. She wasn\u2019t sure how they handled disagreements. Her adoptive parents had been both verbal and demonstrative, arguing often and loudly. Roy seemed restrained, which might come from his training as a cop, while Corrie was the more voluble. This was the first serious argument she\u2019d encountered; its duration surprised her.</p><p>\u201cI saw Mack a few days ago,\u201d Gloria said, making conversation. She hoped to put her mother at ease. If Corrie relaxed, perhaps she\u2019d let down her guard and Gloria could get to the bottom of this.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He dropped off a baby name book and another couple of books on pregnancy. One of them I hadn\u2019t heard of. Apparently it\u2019s hot off the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack brought you books?\u201d Corrie asked, then answered her own question. \u201cOh, they must be from Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t think so. \u201cThese looked brand-new. The spines hadn\u2019t even been cracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you read them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finished with the pregnancy books. Did you know the baby\u2019s heart is already beating? Incredible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredible is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny news from Linnette?\u201d Gloria knew her sister was overdue by a few days.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ready to have this baby anytime. My suitcase is packed. As soon as we hear from Pete, I\u2019m heading to the airport.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Corrie was cooking up a storm. She\u2019d be joining her daughter and helping with her grandchild. She probably intended to freeze most of the meals she was preparing.</p><p>\u201cWill you...\u201d Gloria wasn\u2019t sure she could find the courage to ask.</p><p>\u201cWill I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria, of course I will!\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cI...I haven\u2019t made any final decisions yet,\u201d Gloria was quick to add. \u201cI still might give the baby up for adoption. I was adopted into a loving home and I\u2019d want my baby to know the same love I received from my adoptive parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you would.\u201d</p><p>Roy dropped the paper and let it rest on his lap. \u201cThe laws have changed since you were adopted, Gloria. These days the father has legal rights.\u201d</p><p>It embarrassed Gloria to think about Chad. She\u2019d rather keep him out of the picture, although that was neither practical nor ethical. Sooner or later she\u2019d have to contact him....</p><p>Her father continued to look at her as if anticipating some response. \u201cI don\u2019t need to put the father\u2019s name on the birth certificate,\u201d she eventually said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He arched both brows with the question.</p><p>\u201cI could say the paternity\u2019s unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but is that fair to the father or your child? What if the baby has a medical issue at some point in his or her life and needs that information? Not only would you have cheated the father but also the baby. It\u2019s something to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Gloria murmured. And she had thought about it. In fact, she\u2019d thought about little else.</p><p>Roy\u2019s gaze locked with Corrie\u2019s.</p><p>Corrie whirled around and yanked open the refrigerator door. \u201cYou had to bring that up, didn\u2019t you? It wasn\u2019t enough that you went behind my back but you\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p><p>Roy vaulted out of his chair with a speed that shocked Gloria.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you that I didn\u2019t go behind your back. You, on the other hand,\u201d he began, then floundered for words and finished with, \u201cdid.\u201d</p><p>Gloria stared openmouthed at the two of them. \u201cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Roy sat back in his recliner and snatched up the paper. It crackled as he jerked it open to the page he was supposedly reading.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Corrie told her, resuming her cooking.</p><p>Gloria noticed that her mother\u2019s hands trembled and she had to pause, drawing in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d Gloria said, fearing she was about to get caught in the undertow of whatever was wrong between them. Their disagreement was obviously something neither Roy nor Corrie wanted to discuss in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please,\u201d Corrie said, and to Gloria\u2019s astonishment, her mother\u2019s eyes were bright with unshed tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sliding off the stool, she walked around the counter and hugged her.

He tossed the paper aside and returned to the kitchen. \u201cHave you told Chad about the baby?\u201d</p><p>Gloria bristled. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t intend to...at least, not yet.\u201d She felt that when she did tell him, she should know her own intentions.

She didn\u2019t feel she had to make any decisions right that minute.</p><p>\u201cI think you should tell our daughter what you did,\u201d Corrie said angrily.</p><p>\u201cFine, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d Gloria asked, looking from Roy to Corrie and back again.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Corrie said, reaching for Gloria\u2019s hands. \u201cChad knows about the baby.\u201d</p><p>The words went through Gloria with the force of a blow torch.</p><p>Gloria jerked her hands free of her mother\u2019s. \u201cWho told him?\u201d Although she asked the question, she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Roy stepped forward and confronted her face-to-face. \u201cYou can hate me if you want, but I wasn\u2019t going to let what happened to me happen to another man, especially if that man\u2019s the father of my grandchild.\u201d</p><p>Gloria felt the sudden need to sit down.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d She wondered what other betrayal he was about to hit her with.</p><p>\u201cThose books you\u2019re reading didn\u2019t come from Mack or Mary Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roy admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe gave them to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to deliver them, but Mack offered and Chad decided that might be best.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cIn other words, he didn\u2019t want to give them to me himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame him?\u201d Roy asked, none too gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve hidden this from him for months. What did you expect?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes he know the doctor wants to do an ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mack mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>So Chad knew she was pregnant. She\u2019d wanted to tell him, felt he had a right to know\u2014and then she\u2019d learned he was involved with someone else. The situation was complicated enough without adding another person. She\u2019d concluded that it was better to wait until her own plans were clear. Only when she\u2019d made a decision about the baby would she contact him. Telling him now seemed premature.</p><p>Her father disagreed with her, and he felt strongly enough to go behind her back.</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Corrie whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I did everything I could to talk your father out of this.\u201d</p><p>Gloria looked at Roy, who stared belligerently back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what did Chad say? When you told him, I mean.\u201d She could barely get the question out.</p><p>\u201cAt first he was surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry.\u201d Roy didn\u2019t try to soften the word. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be? He has a right to know he\u2019s going to be a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs...is he still seeing...her?\u201d If Gloria had known the other woman\u2019s name she\u2019d forgotten it. As it was, she tried not to think about Chad at all, let alone Chad with that lovely blonde.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him,\u201d Roy said shortly.</p><p>The phone rang and for a moment everyone ignored it. Corrie was the first to move. She reached for the receiver while Gloria and Roy looked at each other with no sense of resolution between them.</p><p>\u201cA boy...it\u2019s a boy!\u201d Corrie cried.</p><p>Roy tore his gaze away from Gloria and went to Corrie\u2019s side. He placed his hands on her shoulders while she spoke excitedly into the receiver. \u201cYes, yes. I\u2019ll phone you as soon as I\u2019ve got the flight numbers and times.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cYes, yes, give Linnette my love and tell her how thrilled Roy and I are.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, then threw her arms around Roy. \u201cWe have a grandson,\u201d she said in a quavering voice. \u201cLinnette had a boy. They\u2019ve named him Gregory Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGregory Paul,\u201d Roy repeated, nodding approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice, solid name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Linnette?\u201d Gloria asked.</p><p>\u201cFabulous. Pete said she was a real trouper. Gregory weighed over eight pounds and is almost twenty inches long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy,\u201d Roy said, smiling proudly. \u201cCorrie, we have our first grandson.\u201d His eyes shone with pleasure and they hugged each other tightly.</p><p>\u201cThat makes me an aunt for the second time,\u201d Gloria whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, I\u2019ve got to get on the internet and book my flight.\u201d Corrie raced out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Mack and Mary Jo and tell them,\u201d Roy said, heading off in another direction.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Gloria offered. She glanced around the kitchen and got to work finishing the casserole Corrie had started. She was about to place it in the freezer when Roy came back.</p><p>\u201cCorrie\u2019s looking through her suitcase one final time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s arranged her flight then?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBefore we end here, I wanted to be sure everything\u2019s square between you and me.\u201d</p><p>Gloria considered the question. \u201cIt\u2019s square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>That was all he said. Then Roy was back to his paper, looking more at peace than she\u2019d seen him in a long while.</p><p>Gloria left about an hour later. She stopped at the grocery store on her way home; as she climbed out of her car she began to cry, standing there in the darkened lot, sobbing.</p><p>Gloria wasn\u2019t easily given to tears. If anything, she kept her emotions hidden and rarely if ever revealed them to others.</p><p>The tears were an obvious reaction to the birth of her sister\u2019s son, and to seeing how happy and excited Corrie and Roy were. That had to be it.</p><p>Only it was much more. Instinctively Gloria recognized that this went beyond the joy she felt for her sister.</p><p>This had to do with Chad.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Thursday evening, feeling depressed, Bruce walked into the house and found Jolene working cheerfully in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making tacos for dinner,\u201d she announced. \u201cThey\u2019re your favorite, right?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the mail on the kitchen counter and realized she was waiting for him to comment. \u201cSure,\u201d he said without enthusiasm. His mind wasn\u2019t on dinner but on what he\u2019d just learned. He needed time to absorb this latest news about Rachel before he could deal with his daughter\u2019s chatter. Until recently, he\u2019d never noticed how much attention Jolene required.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said as she shredded cheese with unnecessary vigor. \u201cI bet you went to the salon to talk to Rachel.\u201d She paused and then added, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question in her voice, but that was exactly what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cSo how is Rachel?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>Bruce doubted his daughter cared. He shrugged in response. Removing his jacket, he hung it in the closet and started down the hall.</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in ten minutes,\u201d Jolene called after him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Bruce washed his hands and by the time he returned to the kitchen, Jolene had set the table and placed the serving dishes in the center.</p><p>Bruce pulled out a chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d Jolene asked as if his silence had offended her. Her voice had a singsong quality that reminded him of when she was much younger.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner! I worked really hard on this and the least you could do is tell me I did a good job.\u201d</p><p>Bruce looked at the table; it was obvious that she\u2019d put some effort into this meal. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice, Jolene. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Apparently pacified, she pulled out her own chair and sat down. Reaching for the platter of crisp taco shells, she took one and then passed it to him. \u201cI had a good day at school.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey and I are going to a movie on Friday night. That\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you pick us up when it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>He certainly didn\u2019t have any plans for the evening. Not without Rachel. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, all sunny and happy. \u201cI\u2019ll let Lindsey know. You met her mom, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Jolene argued. \u201cShe was at the school picnic last year when\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t,\u201d she muttered, and paid an inordinate amount of attention to the taco she was busily assembling.</p><p>\u201cRachel went to the school picnic,\u201d Bruce told her. He recalled how upset his wife had been afterward. Rachel hadn\u2019t said much at the time, but Bruce could tell how miserable she\u2019d felt. Jolene had acted in a rude and insulting manner, and while Rachel had downplayed his daughter\u2019s behavior, she\u2019d asked not to attend any more school functions without him. Bruce had agreed.</p><p>Every day, it seemed, he was reminded of how badly he\u2019d failed both his wife and his daughter. The situation would never have gotten to this point if he\u2019d realized how bad things were for Rachel and had stepped in earlier.</p><p>Father and daughter ate in silence. Bruce made an effort to eat, although he had no appetite. He did manage to force down one taco, but that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHave another, Dad,\u201d she insisted, handing him the platter of taco shells.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, sweetie,\u201d he said, pushing his plate aside. The lettuce had fallen out and spilled salsa ran across the white plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Jolene snapped. \u201cI made your favorite dinner and I tried to have a conversation with you, but you\u2019re ignoring me and it isn\u2019t fair.\u201d Her voice shook slightly and her lower lip protruded.</p><p>Bruce rubbed his face with one hand. Now he had both Rachel and Jolene upset with him. It seemed nothing he did was right anymore. If only he knew how to set everything straight... .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jolene,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m pretty depressed at the moment. I went to see Rachel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jolene leaped on the news, not allowing him to finish. \u201cShe\u2019s being a witch, isn\u2019t she? I bet she wouldn\u2019t even talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane got mad at her the last time you were there, remember?\u201d</p><p>What Bruce remembered was the scene Jolene had caused and how it had brought Jane out of the salon to chastise them all. Afterward he\u2019d been asked not to return. He\u2019d honestly tried to abide by the owner\u2019s wishes, but he needed to talk to Rachel, to see her.</p><p>\u201cRachel no longer works at the salon,\u201d Bruce said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His announcement was followed by a stunned silence. \u201cRachel quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Bruce said, hardly able to fathom it. Rachel had worked at the salon for ten years. It was a second home; her clients were her friends, and the other staff members were like family.</p><p>Her leaving shocked him. She must\u2019ve been desperate to get away and the reason, the only reason he could figure, was directly related to him and Jolene. In his eagerness to convince her to come home, he\u2019d sent her fleeing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d</p> <p>If Bruce had any inkling, this news wouldn\u2019t be nearly as devastating. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane wouldn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cEither she genuinely doesn\u2019t know or she isn\u2019t willing to divulge the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jolene\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Rachel would quit without telling me.\u201d The fact that she\u2019d left her job was one thing, but not mentioning it to him felt like...like a betrayal. He was afraid he\u2019d lost Rachel entirely and that she never intended to return to their family. He refused to think that was the case.</p> <p>\u201cI told you she\u2019s a witch,\u201d Jolene said calmly. She stood and carried the bowls of salsa and sour cream to the kitchen counter. \u201cIf Rachel\u2019s decided she wants out of our lives, then I say we should let her go.\u201d She hummed softly to herself, evidently happy with this turn of events.</p><p>Bruce stood so quickly that his chair scraped against the hardwood floor. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>She spun around to face him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we should let Rachel go. She\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to divorce her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Divorce her? How could Jolene even suggest it? \u201cNo!\u201d He nearly shouted the word.</p> <p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t need her. I can do the cooking and laundry and cleaning. I made dinner all by myself, didn\u2019t I? It\u2019s way better when it\u2019s just the two of us like before you married her.\u201d</p><p>Bruce was horrified that his daughter could be so callous. \u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Jolene shrugged. \u201cThe baby\u2019s a small complication, I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small complication? A small complication,\u201d he repeated. He couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough. \u201cThis small complication is my son or daughter, your brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I miss Rachel. I want nothing more than to have her back. It\u2019s wonderful that you can make a great taco dinner\u2014don\u2019t think I\u2019m unappreciative. But Rachel means more to me than cooking dinner and doing the laundry. She\u2019s my wife, my best friend, and I\u2019m miserable without her.\u201d He found it unimaginable that his daughter could be so self-centered, that all she thought about were her own interests and desires. She saw this pregnancy as a complication, while he was worried sick about his wife and child.</p><p>He sagged back into his chair. \u201cI called Teri Polgar and she doesn\u2019t know where Rachel\u2019s living, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel doesn\u2019t want anyone to know. Not you, not her friends. We should just accept that,\u201d Jolene said earnestly.</p> <p>Bruce looked up. \u201cHave you heard anything I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t agree. Dad, Rachel wants to get away from us.\u201d</p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t believe that.</p><p>\u201cYou say you love her and everything, but if she wants to live somewhere else, that\u2019s up to her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jolene seemed to delight in pointing out that Rachel had left of her own free will. That she was the one who\u2019d chosen to keep her whereabouts a secret.</p><p>\u201cSit down, okay?\u201d Bruce spoke soothingly, gesturing toward the chair.</p><p>Sighing, Jolene reclaimed her seat. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, folding her arms defiantly.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember, after your mother died, how you tried to hold on to your memories of her?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Jolene nodded.</p><p>\u201cEvery night when I put you to bed you\u2019d ask me questions about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked listening to your stories about Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes when you talked about her, your voice would go all soft and I could really, really see how much you loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did love your mother. I still do and I always will. After we lost her, I didn\u2019t think I could ever love another woman as much as I loved Stephanie. Then I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Rachel ruined everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jolene. You didn\u2019t let me finish. Then I discovered that loving again was possible\u2014with Rachel. I want my wife back and I want us all to be a family.\u201d Foolishly he\u2019d hoped his daughter would see how sad Rachel\u2019s departure had made him.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you and I are a family. Rachel isn\u2019t one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d he told her. \u201cI realize I made a mistake by rushing into this marriage. Rachel and I knew each other for a long time and we were friends before we fell in love. Once we did, we decided to get married, and I felt there was no reason to wait.\u201d</p><p>Jolene shook her head impatiently but Bruce paid no attention. He had something important to say and he was determined to make her listen.</p><p>\u201cWhat I failed to take into consideration was how you\u2019d feel. For that I\u2019m truly sorry. But it\u2019s too late to go back. Rachel and I are husband and wife, and we\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>With her arms still folded and a look of defiance, Jolene muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am reminding you because we have to work this out. Rachel suggested counseling but you refused.\u201d</p><p>Jolene shook her head again. \u201cThat\u2019s so lame. No way am I talking to someone I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if it helps you understand why you feel so negative about Rachel and our marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make any difference,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I won\u2019t go and I won\u2019t. You can\u2019t force me to talk to anyone. If you think it\u2019s so awful without Rachel, then you go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already scheduled his first appointment. \u201cI plan to, but it would mean a lot to me if you\u2019d attend the sessions, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Her mouth thinned in patent disgust.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so hard for you to see that I\u2019m concerned about Rachel and the baby? If Rachel\u2019s completely on her own, what does the future hold for her and our child?\u201d</p><p>Jolene remained stubbornly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI remember a time when you begged me for a brother or sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was only eight and I wasn\u2019t smart enough to know that if I had a brother or sister I\u2019d have a witch for a stepmother, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel isn\u2019t a witch.\u201d He swore if she referred to his wife like that one more time, he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cSure, she isn\u2019t one to you. The two of you were so lovey-dovey you couldn\u2019t see what she\u2019s really like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Rachel do that was so terrible other than marry me?\u201d Unable to stay seated any longer he stood and circled the table, pushing back his hair in frustration. He could imagine how difficult it must\u2019ve been for Rachel to deal with Jolene. She\u2019d tried everything and, idiot that he was, Bruce hadn\u2019t appreciated the self-control it took to put up with his daughter\u2019s barbs and insults.</p><p>No wonder Rachel had left. Bruce was as much to blame as his daughter. He\u2019d been blind\u2014willfully blind\u2014and oblivious; now he was paying the price. If only he could turn back the clock...</p><p>\u201cDad, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019m unreasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel will tell you when the baby\u2019s born. You know she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be more involved in my child\u2019s birth than just getting a phone call after the event. My place is with Rachel at the hospital, the way I was there with your mother. My child deserves that and I will not\u2014\u201d He pointed his finger at Jolene. He needed a moment to subdue his irritation before he could continue. \u201cI will not let you dictate to me how I should feel about my son or daughter. It\u2019s time you grew up and thought of someone other than yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jolene leaped out of her chair, her face reddening. \u201cMe?\u201d she repeated. \u201cThe two of you were disgusting, going to bed so early every night. I knew what you were doing. It\u2019s repulsive. And then you had to go and do something stupid like not use birth control!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to snap out of this and accept that Rachel and I belong together.\u201d Bruce was shouting now. His voice shook with the effort to control his anger. \u201cThis baby, boy or girl, is going to need a father who\u2019s present and available in his or her life, just like I was for you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd he or she is going to need a big sister, too. You\u2019ve said you see our child as a complication, but this is a sweet, innocent baby who\u2019ll love you unconditionally...who\u2019ll need your love, too. Are you so biased you can\u2019t see that?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you so coldhearted that you\u2019d reject your own brother or sister because you\u2019re jealous of Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not jealous of Rachel!\u201d Jolene screamed, tears streaming down her face. \u201cI hate her! I hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you hate your brother or sister, too,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>Jolene stamped her foot and in a rage swept her arm across the table. Dishes and serving bowls toppled onto the floor, shattering, spilling food in all directions. Then she ran out of the kitchen and down the hall to her bedroom, slamming the door. The sound reverberated through the house.</p><p>Bruce sank into the chair and leaned forward, resting his head in his hands. They desperately needed help. This was more than he could deal with, more than he could handle alone. How right Rachel was to insist on a counselor.... He should have taken her seriously months ago.</p><p>He hoped it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Grace Harding was in her library office reviewing the budget when she heard a knock at her door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called, expecting her assistant.</p><p>Beth Morehouse opened the door and stuck her head inside. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d</p><p>Grace glanced at the clock and realized it was past closing. She\u2019d been so involved in her review that she hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cSure, come on in.\u201d</p><p>Beth walked into the office carrying a picnic basket. Filled with books? Grace wondered but didn\u2019t ask. She smiled at this woman who\u2019d become a friend. Beth\u2019s love for dogs resonated strongly with her. Not only was she an effective trainer who\u2019d been instrumental in setting up the Reading with Rover program, she rescued stray and abandoned dogs. She found homes for some of them and kept others for the library program. She trained them to sit with children as they read aloud. Being with a dog relaxed children who struggled with reading and were at risk academically. While a volunteer was close at hand, the real focus was on the children and \u201ctheir\u201d dogs. And on learning to read. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace had instigated the program after hearing how it had started in a Seattle bookstore. Because of her own volunteer work at the animal shelter, it had immediately appealed to her. She\u2019d checked with local grade schools and, not surprisingly, the idea had met with enthusiasm.</p><p>That was when Grace heard about Beth, who\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove three years earlier. As soon as Grace approached her, Beth had responded with an unqualified yes. Despite the work on her Christmas tree farm, Beth faithfully brought the dogs into the library several times a week. Without her the program wouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Grace asked, pushing aside her spreadsheets. After hours of staring at numbers, considering proposed budget cuts and trying to do more with less, she welcomed the break. It\u2019d been a draining week and she looked forward to a relaxing weekend with her husband. They planned to go horseback riding along the beach on Saturday, maybe take in a movie Sunday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI need a favor,\u201d Beth said, sitting down in the chair opposite Grace\u2019s desk. She carefully set her picnic basket on the floor beside her.</p> <p>\u201cAnything.\u201d Grace would never be able to repay Beth. Although the library program hadn\u2019t been in operation long, Grace could already see a dramatic difference in the children. At first they\u2019d arrived tense, uneasy about yet another reading exercise, but as soon as they saw the dogs, everything changed. Twice now she\u2019d seen children from the program taking out books. Nothing could\u2019ve been greater proof of Reading with Rover\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the stray dog I found four or five weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>Grace recalled that Beth had rescued a golden retriever she\u2019d come across on the side of the road. The poor dog had no identification and she\u2019d apparently been on her own for some time because she was in bad shape.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d Grace repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cThe puppies were born a few days after I brought her home. She had a litter of five. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t make it. She was a lovely, sweet-tempered dog and it breaks my heart to have lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive puppies?\u201d The fact that the lost dog had been a golden retriever instantly brought back memories of Grace\u2019s beloved Buttercup. Buttercup had been almost twelve when she\u2019d died quietly in her sleep that summer. Grace still couldn\u2019t think about her dog without feeling a pang of grief. The golden retriever had loved her life on the ranch and had never seemed happier than when she and Grace took long walks through the property and along the shore. It didn\u2019t seem right that Buttercup was gone. Even now when she got home from work, she expected the dog to greet her.</p><p>\u201cSo if you would, I\u2019d be forever grateful,\u201d Beth was saying.</p><p>Grace blinked. Caught up in her memories, she\u2019d entirely missed most of Beth\u2019s comments.</p><p>\u201cIf I would do what?\u201d Grace asked.</p> <p>\u201cLook after one of the puppies for me,\u201d Beth said, giving her an odd glance.</p><p>\u201cMe? But...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to be fed every couple of hours. I have a special bottle I\u2019ll give you. In addition to the feeding, he\u2019ll need lots of attention. This poor baby has lost his mother and he\u2019s been separated from his brother and sisters. He\u2019s lonely and afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth, I couldn\u2019t possibly take on the care of a puppy.\u201d It was out of the question. \u201cI have to be at work here in the library. I haven\u2019t got the time, and Cliff\u2019s constantly busy with the horses... .\u201d Her voice drifted off. She didn\u2019t add that she was still in mourning for her own dog and couldn\u2019t take on another one right now. It was just too hard.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it by myself anymore,\u201d Beth said. \u201cNot with all the work on the tree farm. We\u2019re gearing up for the holidays. We\u2019re already getting orders and some trees are being shipped as far away as Hawaii and Japan. I\u2019m overseeing all that, plus I\u2019ve got the training and the library program, and I can\u2019t stop to feed two puppies.\u201d She paused. \u201cI can barely handle one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry....\u201d</p><p>Beth ignored her protest. \u201cSuzette has one puppy and Kristen Jamey took another. A third went to a woman at church, and I have one myself, so that only leaves this last little guy. Unfortunately he\u2019s the runt of the litter, smaller and more at risk than the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find someone...else,\u201d Grace said.</p> <p>Suzette Lambert was an associate librarian, and Grace figured the library was well represented in the puppy-care department.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother you if there was anyone else I could ask, and trust me, I\u2019ve tried. I have nowhere else to turn. It\u2019s just for a few weeks,\u201d she said, her voice increasingly desperate. \u201cI really need your help, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Grace started to raise her objections again when Beth bent down to open the basket and lifted out a small puppy. He was so tiny he didn\u2019t even look like a golden retriever. His eyes were squeezed shut against the light and he squirmed a little in Beth\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell the breed of the father?\u201d Grace asked as a delaying tactic.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that he was probably a mix. Some Lab, some hound and maybe a bit of poodle. It\u2019s too early to really tell.\u201d</p><p>An odd combination, although the puppy was golden like his mother...like Buttercup.</p><p>\u201cBut I have a lot of responsibilities at the library,\u201d Grace said, hoping Beth would accept the excuse.</p><p>\u201cBring him with you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be a hit with the children and they\u2019ll enjoy seeing him grow week by week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how long will I\u2014will he need this extra care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month, six weeks at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be able to adopt him out?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour to six weeks,\u201d Grace murmured. She didn\u2019t want to do this but didn\u2019t feel she could refuse, since Beth had done so much for her and the children. Grace didn\u2019t like it, not one bit, but felt she had no other choice.</p><p>\u201cWill you do it?\u201d Beth asked again.</p><p>Grace sighed loudly. \u201cI guess I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry,\u201d Beth promised. \u201cHe really is a sweet little dog.\u201d</p><p>Beth left as soon as she\u2019d gone through the feeding instructions and other pertinent information. The puppy slept in the basket on the corner of her desk and didn\u2019t make a sound the whole time Grace worked on her budget review.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished an hour later, she called Cliff at the ranch. There was no answer and she didn\u2019t leave a message. Then she stood, retrieving her purse and jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home,\u201d she informed the puppy, \u201cbut don\u2019t get too comfortable because you\u2019re not staying, understand?\u201d</p><p>The puppy slept peacefully on, apparently not distressed by her lack of welcome.</p><p>The basket rested on the passenger-side floor during the fifteen-minute drive home. The only sound Grace heard was a weak mewling as she turned into the driveway leading to the house. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get your dinner soon,\u201d she said in a grudging voice.</p><p>When she pulled into the garage, Cliff left the barn to greet her, as he usually did. Grace climbed out of the car and he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI brought company,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCompany?\u201d Cliff looked behind him.</p><p>\u201cA puppy,\u201d she said. \u201cBeth asked me\u2014no, begged me\u2014to take care of him for the next six weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d He seemed surprised, as well he should be, since Grace had made it clear that she was through with pets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d she admitted. Walking around to the other side of her car, she removed the basket and handed it to Cliff.</p><p>Her husband raised the lid and peered inside. \u201cOh, he is a tiny thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe runt of the litter.\u201d Grace managed to make that sound like an insult.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll just have to fatten him up.\u201d Cliff murmured endearments as he took the puppy from the basket and held him against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe has to be fed every couple of hours,\u201d she told him. \u201cLike either of us has time for that.\u201d</p><p>Cliff grinned, which irritated Grace even more. \u201cWipe that smirk off your face, Cliff Harding. I know what you\u2019re thinking and you can stop right this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re reading my thoughts now?\u201d Returning the puppy to his basket, he slipped his free arm around her waist as he steered her toward the house.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to fall for this puppy and we\u2019ll want to keep him ourselves. That\u2019s not going to happen, so you can put it out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will,\u201d he said blandly.</p><p>He was being far too agreeable, and Grace didn\u2019t believe a word of it.</p><p>He opened the door to the mudroom off the kitchen and motioned her in ahead of him. The soft mewling continued from inside the basket. Cliff put it down to shuck off his boots.</p><p>\u201cBring the basket into the kitchen where it\u2019s warm,\u201d he said. \u201cThis little guy\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give him the bottle while I get dinner started,\u201d Grace suggested. The less she had to do with the puppy, the better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to.\u201d</p><p>Grace was grateful. She wouldn\u2019t allow herself to feel any tenderness for this small animal. She couldn\u2019t. Losing Buttercup had broken her heart and she refused to be vulnerable to a pet again. Refused to set herself up for the inevitable grief. As Olivia had pointed out, that was the downside of having pets\u2014their lives were too short. Besides, an additional animal would tie her and Cliff down all the more. As it was, they had the horses. Getting away for even a weekend was difficult and required a lot of advance planning.</p><p>Sitting at the kitchen table, her husband cradled the puppy on his lap and gently offered him the tiny bottle of formula. Grace tried not to watch as she peeled potatoes, then bustled about the room, taking the salad fixings out of the refrigerator, washing lettuce, slicing tomatoes and cucumber. She\u2019d put Swiss steak in the Crock-Pot before she\u2019d left for work that morning. All she had to do now was boil the potatoes and finish preparing the salad.</p><p>\u201cHe needs a name,\u201d Cliff said after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cGive him one if you like,\u201d she said without any real interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rover after the library reading program?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d A name was just a name and six weeks from now Rover or whatever Cliff chose to call him would be out of her life.</p><p>\u201cNah, Rover doesn\u2019t really fit him. Too generic. We need to come up with something else,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with just calling him Puppy. Or Dog. In six weeks\u2014four weeks if we\u2019re lucky\u2014he\u2019ll be adopted by a new family and they can name him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs a name now,\u201d Cliff insisted.</p><p>\u201cFine, then you name him.\u201d</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t comment, Cliff\u2019s eyebrows shot up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she muttered. \u201cI am not going to let that puppy worm his way into my heart. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a glass of wine with dinner?\u201d she asked, wanting to change the subject before the puppy became an object of contention between them.</p><p>\u201cIf you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRed or white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She went from the kitchen to the walk-in pantry, where they kept several bottles of wine, and chose a Shiraz. She returned with the wine, used a corkscrew to open it and let it breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Beauregard?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a name,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the puppy. It\u2019s fine but a little long, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d She caught herself, adding, \u201cNot that I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d call him Beau for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d She placed her hands on her hips and glared at him. \u201cYou name him whatever your heart desires but I want nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Cliff nodded. \u201cThen Beau, it is.\u201d He ran his index finger down the puppy\u2019s golden back as Beau sucked greedily at the tiny nipple. The bottle looked like something that came with a child\u2019s doll.</p><p>\u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t do his business in the house,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll wait fifteen minutes and take him outside.\u201d</p><p>Beau was already proving to be a nuisance. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably interrupt our meal,\u201d she complained. \u201cAnd you know darned well that he\u2019ll be awake at all hours of the night. How many years has it been since you\u2019ve had to deal with a puppy?\u201d</p><p>Cliff smiled down at Beau, completely entranced. Her husband was an easy victim to the puppy, but not Grace. She fully intended to keep her distance, emotionally if not physically.</p><p>Cliff took Beau outside and returned just as she was mashing the potatoes. He looked in her direction and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo success?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not too bright, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d her husband chastised. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had a chance to learn what it means to go outside.\u201d</p> <p>She knew that, but was unwilling to admit how critical she was being. She could see how attached Cliff was getting, and the puppy hadn\u2019t even been with them an hour.</p><p>\u201cListen, Cliff, we will not be keeping this animal, understand?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up from where he lay sprawled on the floor, playing with the puppy, and grinned. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Cliff. I don\u2019t want another dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Grace narrowed her eyes as she set their dinner on the kitchen table. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she groaned, \u201cthis is no joking matter. You wait and see, he\u2019ll interfere with dinner. It\u2019s already begun.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, in the middle of dinner, the timer went off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d she asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cBeau. I\u2019m giving him a second chance.\u201d Taking his wineglass, Cliff headed outside with the puppy, who\u2019d been curled up on an old towel near the stove.</p><p>Grace reached for her own glass and raised it to her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for six weeks,\u201d Cliff reminded her as he opened the door off the kitchen.</p><p>Grace had a feeling that these would be the longest six weeks of her life.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Hurrying out of the courthouse, Olivia frowned as she looked at her watch. She\u2019d told her brother she\u2019d meet him at the gallery at four, but a custody hearing had run late. Will had already left one message on her cell phone, although she hadn\u2019t taken the time to listen to it.</p><p>Thankfully the courthouse was just a few short blocks from the Harbor Street Gallery. It was a crisp October day, so Olivia decided to walk. The trek was downhill, which was something else to be grateful for. And she loved the beauty of the brilliant autumn leaves, which were falling fast and would all be gone in another week.</p><p>Olivia walked steadily but she was out of practice and out of breath. She\u2019d be seeing Grace later for their weekly Wednesday-night aerobics class. She was slowly regaining her strength; maybe she\u2019d even catch up to Grace in skill and endurance soon.</p><p>Thinking about her friend, Olivia couldn\u2019t contain a smile. Grace and Cliff were caring for that puppy of Beth\u2019s. Beau had instantly won over Cliff. Not so Grace, who stubbornly refused to grow attached to him. Olivia wondered just how long Grace would be able to hold out. Her friend had loved Buttercup and she\u2019d love Beau, too, if she\u2019d give him a chance. Still, Grace insisted that in less than six weeks, she\u2019d hand Beau over to Beth Morehouse without a second\u2019s hesitation. No matter what, she kept saying, that dog was going back. If Olivia was a betting woman, she\u2019d place her whole retirement income on Grace keeping that puppy.</p><p>She arrived at the gallery and entered, accompanied by a blast of wind off the cove. The door banged behind her, rattling the windows.</p><p>Will laughed. \u201cThat was quite an entrance,\u201d he teased as he came toward her. Leaning forward, he kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it worked out fine. Miranda,\u201d he said, turning to his assistant, \u201cwould you take over for me?\u201d</p><p>The other woman nodded and smiled at Olivia.</p><p>\u201cShall we go to my office?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He followed her inside, closed the door, then took a seat on one of his visitor chairs. Olivia took the other one, perching on the edge with her hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI understand the repairs on Mom\u2019s house are just about finished,\u201d Will said, introducing the topic she\u2019d come to discuss.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. As you can imagine, Mom and Ben are eager to go home.\u201d It was all her mother talked about these days\u2014how soon she\u2019d be back in her own kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re eager,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you and Jack are, too. Having them live with you couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p><p>Her brother didn\u2019t know the half of it. Olivia and Jack had each gained at least five pounds with all the desserts Charlotte had baked in the past few weeks. Charlotte made it difficult to say no; she was persistent and obviously felt hurt when they tried to decline her cookies, pies and cakes. Olivia\u2019s plan to freeze Charlotte\u2019s bounty hadn\u2019t worked; for one thing, they\u2019d quickly run out of room. As well, the house had been thoroughly cleaned from top to bottom, and nothing was back in its proper place. When asked, Charlotte would gaze blankly at Olivia and assure her she\u2019d put everything exactly where she\u2019d found it. Olivia understood that her mother was only trying to help. She and Ben were considerate, too, giving her and Jack their privacy in the evenings by staying in their own part of the house. And they kept Harry\u2019s litter box in their en suite bathroom; most of the time Olivia wasn\u2019t even aware of his presence.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, Jack enjoys Mom\u2019s cooking.\u201d Will didn\u2019t attempt to hide his smile.</p><p>\u201cWe both do and that\u2019s another problem. Mom takes great pride in feeding us huge meals. We haven\u2019t eaten this well since last Thanksgiving. The problem is, the feast\u2019s continued for five solid weeks. Mom\u2019s made it her mission to cook all our favorite meals\u2014chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, every kind of dessert. I\u2019m just glad we haven\u2019t gained twenty pounds each.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you shock me. Where\u2019s your willpower? I\u2019ve always thought of you as the one with self-discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I blame Jack. He keeps saying we should enjoy this while it lasts. Not only that, I hate to hurt Mom\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ll be going home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure...\u201d Olivia hesitated. \u201cI know we\u2019ve already talked about this, but these past few weeks have opened my eyes. It\u2019s made me realize that the situation is more urgent than we thought. We\u2019ll need to do something sooner rather than later about finding an assisted-living place.\u201d</p><p>The smile disappeared from her brother\u2019s face, and Olivia knew what he was thinking. They\u2019d decided a couple of weeks ago that Charlotte and Ben should go back to the house for the time being, while the two of them investigated other housing options. Will had even added a few extras to the kitchen upgrades as an early Christmas gift.</p><p>Olivia and Will hadn\u2019t lined up any seniors\u2019 residence visits yet, although they had a list of possibilities provided by Jack.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, things appear to be escalating. For example, Mom washed several loads of the same clothes twice. She\u2019d taken them out of the dryer and put them in the laundry basket and then the next morning rewashed the same load.\u201d</p><p>Will frowned. \u201cShe forgot she\u2019d already washed those clothes?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think so, too, but as I said, it happened more than once.\u201d</p><p>Will leaned back in his chair and laced his fingers together. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep a list, although now I wish I had. There\u2019ve been a bunch of little things and some not-so-little things. Here\u2019s another example. Grace put aside a mystery at the library Mom said she wanted to read. Then Mom claimed she\u2019d never heard of the book or the author. Then she misplaced it two or three times. Jack found it in the refrigerator once and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe refrigerator?\u201d Will seemed to find that especially humorous.</p><p>\u201cWe all got a kick out of it, but when she misplaced it again, Ben found it tucked between the mattress and the box spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she was hiding it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Will shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve gone undetected except that we started getting late notices from the library\u2014and Ben kept complaining that the mattress was hurting his back. So he decided to look and...there it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mom remember putting it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact, she forgot she was even reading the book.\u201d</p><p>Her brother took a moment to mull this over.</p><p>\u201cThis is more than just a case of forgetfulness,\u201d Olivia felt obliged to say. \u201cAs we\u2019ve discussed, Mom is either suffering from dementia or in the beginning stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the appointment you made for her with the gerontologist?\u201d</p><p>She threw back her head, groaning in frustration. \u201cMom forgot the appointment. Ben was supposed to take her, but either he forgot, too, or he fell asleep. We couldn\u2019t reschedule until after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reminded her that morning, too. I even put a note on the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll take her,\u201d Will suggested.</p><p>\u201cGood idea, but, Will, it isn\u2019t just Mom. Obviously Ben hasn\u2019t been doing that well, either.\u201d</p><p>Will brought his hands up to his face. \u201cOkay, he didn\u2019t remember the gerontology appointment. What else?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll this trouble with his son over Mary Jo and Noelle has taken its toll. Ben tires so easily these days. He takes a nap every afternoon. A long nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains missing the appointment.\u201d He paused. \u201cEvery afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Harry, too. It\u2019s the only time I see the cat. He crawls into Ben\u2019s lap and the two of them snooze away pretty much the whole afternoon, seven days a week. Ben\u2019s mind isn\u2019t as sharp as it once was, either. Mom shows more signs of memory loss, but Ben isn\u2019t far behind.\u201d</p><p>Will exhaled slowly. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t think they should return to the house at all? Not even for the short term?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia nodded regretfully. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mom might forget to turn off the stove again and next time we might not be so fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to talk to them about this?\u201d The way he asked implied that he wanted to nominate her.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should tell them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkaaay,\u201d he drawled. \u201cDo you have any idea about how to approach them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I think it might be wise to know exactly where they should move first, don\u2019t you? Or at least have some options to present. We have a list but I haven\u2019t got around to doing anything about it yet.\u201d</p> <p>Will sighed, then nodded. \u201cIf you want to make us some appointments, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone knocked politely at the office door. Will looked mildly surprised. \u201cYes?\u201d he called out.</p><p>Miranda opened the door a few inches. \u201cExcuse me, but Shirley Bliss is here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Will was instantly on his feet, his face eager. \u201cShirley\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Larry Knight.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s smile faded as quickly as it had come. \u201cShe\u2019s with Larry,\u201d he muttered, as if he found the other man\u2019s name distasteful.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d like to speak to you for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, send them in,\u201d Will said. He remained standing as Miranda ushered Shirley and Larry into the office.</p><p>Will made introductions; Shirley smiled and Larry shook hands with Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI hope we\u2019re not interrupting anything important,\u201d Shirley apologized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Will said. \u201cOlivia and I were discussing a family matter. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Larry placed his arm around Shirley\u2019s waist. \u201cWe wanted to tell you in person that I\u2019ve asked Shirley to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>Olivia noticed that Will\u2019s smile looked decidedly forced.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, I never would\u2019ve met Larry.\u201d Shirley held out her left hand and displayed a beautiful solitaire diamond ring.</p> <p>\u201cHave you set the date?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Shirley said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll be soon,\u201d Larry added. \u201cI\u2019ve been alone long enough. I want Shirley with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful you asked me to attend that show at the Seattle Art Museum,\u201d Shirley said, her expression radiant. \u201cI almost decided not to go and I\u2019m so glad I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Olivia told the happy couple. If Will wasn\u2019t going to say it, she would.</p><p>\u201cYes, by all means. Congratulations,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d Shirley started out the door. \u201cBye, Will, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d Larry said, turning to follow her out.</p><p>Will closed the door firmly behind them. \u201cShirley was my date that afternoon and then Larry swooped in on her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? Anyone with eyes can see how much in love they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But I\u2019d hoped Shirley would fall in love with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would she do that?\u201d Olivia asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Well, because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in common, other than the fact that you own an art gallery and she\u2019s an artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, not every woman is going to fall at your feet in adoration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, you sound like Miranda! I happen to like Shirley Bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you tried to charm her the way you did with practically every woman you\u2019ve met, whether you were married or not.\u201d That last remark was meant to remind him that he hadn\u2019t been a good husband. He\u2019d cheated on his wife repeatedly, and Olivia didn\u2019t care what his excuses were.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve gone all day without saying that,\u201d Will snapped. \u201cOkay, so I wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s best husband. I admit it. But my ego just took a major hit, and if I want to whine a bit I should be able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Be a little boy for a couple of minutes and then get over it.\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked over to the cabinet. \u201cHow about a glass of wine? I could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Shall we invite Miranda to join us?\u201d The gallery was closed by now and she was probably waiting.</p><p>Will shrugged. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get along all that well,\u201d he muttered as he took down a bottle of red wine and three glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a know-it-all, not to mention contradictory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep her on?\u201d Olivia asked, finding his attitude amusing. Her brother\u2019s relationship with his assistant fascinated her. They bickered and argued and she couldn\u2019t remember a time that Will had anything good to say about Miranda. And yet he continued to employ her.</p><p>\u201cI tried to fire her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTried?\u201d Olivia raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was completely overwhelmed without her. Two or three days later, I asked her to reconsider and return to work. I could\u2019ve hired someone else, but that would mean training that person, which is a lot of time and trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda came back, though.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cShe seemed almost glad of it, too. The truth is, I don\u2019t really like her. Miranda\u2019s far too bossy. God save me from bossy women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not all bossy women,\u201d he returned, and broke into a lazy smile. \u201cNot you, my darling sister.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head and started toward the door. \u201cBefore I ask Miranda to join us, are we in agreement that Mom and Ben can\u2019t go back to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to them together about moving into an assisted-living complex as soon as possible,\u201d she said, summing up their discussion.</p><p>Will exhaled loudly. \u201cTogether? Can\u2019t you tell them and I\u2019ll back you up?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI was hoping we could do this good-cop/bad-cop style and I\u2019d be the good cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll present a united front and go from there. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Madame Judge.\u201d</p><p>Olivia ignored that and opened the door. \u201cMiranda, would you like to have a glass of wine with us? We\u2019re celebrating Shirley and Larry\u2019s engagement.\u201d</p><p>Will, who was pouring the wine, nearly toppled a glass. He caught it just in time to prevent it from tumbling onto the beige carpet.</p><p>Miranda came into the room. \u201cYou\u2019re happy about Shirley\u2019s news?\u201d she pressed, looking at Will.</p><p>Olivia could see that the other woman wasn\u2019t easily fooled.</p><p>\u201cI can boast that I was the one who introduced them,\u201d Will muttered as he passed around the glasses.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to work out for you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it,\u201d Will asked sharply, \u201cthat everyone enjoys telling me that? You think I haven\u2019t figured it out by now? But if Larry hadn\u2019t come into the picture, I believe she would\u2019ve ended up with me.\u201d</p><p>Miranda exchanged a glance with Olivia that said Will was delusional. Olivia recognized, even if her brother didn\u2019t, that he\u2019d never had a chance with Shirley, whether he chose to accept that or not.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, it isn\u2019t that. Let\u2019s enjoy our wine and drop the whole Shirley issue, shall we?\u201d Olivia suggested.</p><p>It looked for a moment as if he wasn\u2019t willing to let it go. \u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Miranda raised the wineglass to her lips but not before Olivia noticed that she was humming a song from the 1960s. If memory served her right, the first line was \u201cGoin\u2019 to the chapel and we\u2019re gonna get married.\u201d She burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Will demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Olivia said, making an effort to keep her composure. She liked Miranda. In fact, Olivia could see that Will\u2019s assistant was exactly the woman to rein in her brother\u2019s ego and keep him in line.</p><p>Poor Will. He didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Mary Jo McAfee set the large pumpkin on the kitchen counter and found a felt pen in the junk drawer. Since this was Noelle\u2019s first Halloween, she was determined to make it special. She already had her daughter\u2019s costume picked out. Noelle would be dressed as a ballerina, complete with pink tutu and tights.</p><p>Never mind that her baby hadn\u2019t yet taken her first step. Noelle was close, so close, but still clung to the coffee table, bending her chubby legs, longing to explore her world and at the same time hesitant to leave the security of something to hold on to.</p><p>Mary Jo knew everything would change once Noelle decided she could walk. As it was, her daughter was a champion crawler. The nine-month-old loved to travel on all fours, putting anything and everything in her mouth as she progressed from one side of the room to the other. Mary Jo had to be constantly vigilant.</p><p>The front door opened and Mack walked in. Mary Jo smiled and held her arms open to him for a hug and kiss. They\u2019d only been married for two months and still felt the sheer wonder of the intimacy they shared.</p><p>As soon as she saw him, Noelle raised her arms, seeking his attention.</p><p>\u201cCome to Daddy,\u201d Mack urged, getting down on his knees a couple of feet from the coffee table.</p><p>Mary Jo held her breath and waited. Noelle glanced at her mother and then at Mack.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d Mack urged, stretching out his arms.</p><p>Noelle took one fledgling step and then another before plopping down on the floor. She let out a wail, more in surprise than pain. Mack scooped her up and swung her around, holding her high above his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did it! She did it!\u201d Excited, Mary Jo started waving her arms. Noelle was a week and a half from being ten months old and had taken her first step. \u201cThat\u2019s early for her to be walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to go,\u201d Mack said as he spread kisses over Noelle\u2019s face. Then balancing her on his hip, he turned back to Mary Jo. \u201cHey\u2014you got a pumpkin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked it up on my way home. I thought we\u2019d carve it\u2014actually, I\u2019ll leave the carving to you. I\u2019ll draw what I want and the rest will be in your capable hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do I get out of this?\u201d Mack teased.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come up with some way of rewarding you.\u201d</p><p>Mack wore a silly grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will, too.\u201d Sitting, he bounced Noelle on his knee while Mary Jo continued to draw eyes, a nose and a gap-toothed mouth on the pumpkin. After a few minutes, Noelle squirmed, wanting to be put down. Mack set her on the floor and she immediately took off crawling toward her favorite spot in the house, next to the coffee table. She pulled herself up to a standing position, then twisted around to check on her audience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI talked to your brother this afternoon,\u201d Mack said conversationally. \u201cWe grabbed a coffee after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Mary Jo was concerned about Linc. Nothing seemed to be going right for him and Lori. The business was close to failing and he was at odds with his in-laws. The last she\u2019d heard, Lori had disowned her entire family. She wasn\u2019t speaking to either her mother or her father.</p><p>\u201cDid you know they\u2019re looking for a new apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mary Jo dropped her pen. She would\u2019ve thought Linc might mention it to her, but he tended to be private, to keep his problems to himself.</p> <p>It made sense that her brother and Lori would need a new place. The Bellamys owned the apartment building where they currently lived, and neither Linc nor Lori wanted to be indebted to them. Still, Mary Jo knew that Linc didn\u2019t approve of Lori\u2019s cutting off her family. He\u2019d tried to talk to her, but Lori was adamant\u2014she wanted nothing more to do with them. Because Linc and Mary Jo had lost their own parents, they had a different view; Mary Jo suspected that Lori wouldn\u2019t appreciate how important family was until she was without either parent and there was no opportunity left to reconcile.</p><p>\u201cI put out the word to the fire crew and Linc picked up some business this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d She leaned down and kissed him again, letting her mouth linger on his.</p><p>\u201cI...I could,\u201d Mack said, clearing his throat before he continued, \u201ctry to send more business his way.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, Mary Jo patted his back. \u201cYou do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill I get more kisses like that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Mack brightened. \u201cMy dad\u2019s helping, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s good friends with the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo remembered that about Troy Davis and her father-in-law.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Dad was talking to Sheriff Davis and suggested he might have the city ask your brother to bid on a contract to service police vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mack, he has an auto body shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can manage oil changes, can\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd routine maintenance?\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo shrugged. \u201cI assume he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork is work, and your brother is hungry.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo was well aware of how hungry her brother was.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of hungry, when\u2019s dinner?\u201d Mack glanced around the kitchen.</p><p>Mary Jo had started on the pumpkin as soon as she got home and hadn\u2019t really thought about dinner. \u201cAh, any chance I could talk you into going out tonight?\u201d</p><p>Mack cocked his head. \u201cI could be persuaded,\u201d he said, winking at her.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d she muttered. \u201cCan we afford to take Linc and Lori? After all, this is a celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA celebration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle just took her first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Where do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Knowing their own budget was tight, Mary Jo said, \u201cThe Pancake Palace. I love their spaghetti and meatballs, and Thursday night is all-you-can-eat spaghetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Linc and Lori and see if they can join us,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cBesides, I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re thinking the same thing I am.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, when Mack had carved the pumpkin and Mary Jo had fed and changed Noelle, it was time to meet her brother and his wife. They took her car for the short drive down to Harbor Street and the Pancake Palace.</p><p>Linc and Lori were waiting for them outside the restaurant, apparently deep in conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys?\u201d Mary Jo asked after they\u2019d left the car and unfastened Noelle from her seat.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Lori said. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo noticed that her brother didn\u2019t echo his wife\u2019s sentiment. Lori took Linc\u2019s hand, and she was sure that whatever they were discussing concerned their troubles with her family.</p><p>They entered the restaurant and were quickly seated, despite the number of families availing themselves of the pasta specials. She recognized Pastor Dave Flemming and his wife, who waved cheerfully. Once the hostess had obtained a high chair for Noelle, Mary Jo gave her daughter a cracker while everyone else looked over the menu. She\u2019d already made her decision\u2014the spaghetti and meatball dinner.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Mack said, hidden behind the menu. \u201cThis is our treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Linc insisted.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Mack said mildly, \u201cbut we\u2019re celebrating the fact that Noelle took her first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s early, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lori\u2019s eyes widened with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes, but she\u2019s been ready for weeks now,\u201d Mary Jo explained. \u201cOnly, she was afraid to let go. It took her daddy to get her to leave her comfort zone.\u201d Mary Jo knew how hard it was for her staunchly proud brother to allow them to pay for his and Lori\u2019s dinner.</p><p>Linc lowered his menu. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much already,\u201d he said, sounding almost humble.</p><p>This was Linc? Mary Jo looked up. She wanted to ask her big brother if he was okay. Humility was so unlike him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Mack asked as he reached for his water glass.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best week we\u2019ve had since I opened the shop and practically everyone\u2019s made a point of mentioning your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d Mack feigned astonishment. \u201cAll I said was that you do quality work at competitive prices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis stopped by to talk to Linc, too,\u201d Lori added. She slipped her arm through Linc\u2019s and pressed her head against his shoulder.</p><p>Mack raised both hands as though to avert their thanks. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but your father did. I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done. If anyone\u2019s paying for dinner, it\u2019ll be Lori and me.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo released a pent-up sigh. That sounded much more like her take-charge brother.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll settle up later,\u201d Mack said. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s order.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d finished their meals, they chatted over coffee and dessert. Noelle had eaten at home but Mary Jo spooned some plain spaghetti, cut up and sprinkled with cheese, into her mouth. Soon after, Noelle fell asleep. Mack cradled his daughter in his arms; every now and then he\u2019d bend his head and press his lips against her soft curls.</p><p>Mary Jo loved watching Mack with Noelle. He was her father in every way that mattered, every way except the biological. How fortunate she was to have met and married such a decent, honorable man, especially after falling for a jerk like David Rhodes. Thanks to Noelle\u2019s grandfather, Ben Rhodes, David was completely out of their lives. She\u2019d never learned precisely what agreement Ben had struck with David, but whatever he\u2019d said or done convinced David to sign the paperwork allowing Mack to legally adopt Noelle. They\u2019d already started the legal procedure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss living in Cedar Cove,\u201d Lori murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d Linc said without elaborating.</p><p>Mary Jo made eye contact with Mack.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t seem to find a place that\u2014\u201d Lori began.</p><p>Linc put a restraining hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cLinc,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cTell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Her brother remained stubbornly quiet.</p><p>\u201cListen, you two, we\u2019re family,\u201d Mack told them. \u201cAs soon as I heard that you and Lori were looking for a new apartment, I told Mary Jo. We\u2019ve come up with an idea we wanted to present to you.\u201d</p><p>Linc and Lori exchanged a puzzled glance.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d Linc said, holding up his hand. \u201cLori and I have decided to move back to Seattle. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on to the business. I\u2019ve had one good week\u2014thanks to you, Mack\u2014but there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll continue... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy go all the way to Seattle?\u201d Mary Jo asked. \u201cThe commute will take hours out of your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to move in with Mel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Mary Jo couldn\u2019t see that happening in a million years. It was a setup for disaster. Her two brothers, both younger than Linc, were terrible slobs, and Lori would be miserable.</p><p>\u201cMary Jo and I would like to offer a solution,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>Mary Jo smiled. \u201cWe\u2019d like to rent you the other half of the duplex.\u201d</p><p>Linc stared at them, while Lori\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cBut...I thought you\u2019d rented it out?\u201d Linc said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWe had a couple who was interested, but it fell through,\u201d Mary Jo explained. \u201cThey decided to stay in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the other half of the duplex is still vacant?\u201d</p><p>Mack nodded. \u201cIt sure is\u2014vacant and available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could move in anytime,\u201d Mary Jo said. \u201cReally. We mean it. We want you to.\u201d</p><p>Linc slowly shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m honored that you\u2019d offer, but we can\u2019t accept.\u201d His jaw had that stubborn set Mary Jo knew so well.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d Lori looked as if she was about to break into tears.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated emphatically. \u201cWe\u2019d be trading one charity situation for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow just a minute,\u201d Mack said, raising his voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t say we wouldn\u2019t be charging rent.\u201d</p><p>Mary Jo placed her hand on her husband\u2019s thigh. Mack had to know that Linc and Lori could barely make it without paying rent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll charge you the same as I did Mary Jo,\u201d Mack said. Beneath the table he put his hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>Mack named the figure he\u2019d first charged Mary Jo, which was a greatly reduced rate. When she\u2019d learned what he\u2019d done, she\u2019d been outraged; it\u2019d been a source of major conflict. Mary Jo was more like her older brother than she\u2019d realized. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t object to paying less than market value.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same amount Mack charged you?\u201d Linc asked, eyeing her closely.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredibly reasonable,\u201d Lori told her husband.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this, Mack?\u201d Linc seemed unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could stay in town, Linc,\u201d Lori said, squeezing his arm. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to quit my job and you\u2019d be able to put all your energy into the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Mack asked.</p><p>Linc smiled and thrust his hand across the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Rachel unlocked the door to the house she shared with Nate Olsen in Bremerton, not far from the naval shipyard. She shed her jacket, set down her purse on the hall table and walked into the living room.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d moved away from Bruce and Jolene, her stress was much lower. Her blood pressure was back in the normal range, she\u2019d started to gain weight and her iron levels had improved. At her routine appointment, she\u2019d heard that Bruce had phoned the doctor\u2019s office to check on her and the baby. Their privacy policy wouldn\u2019t allow them to divulge any information about her, but they did tell Rachel he\u2019d called. Knowing he was concerned buoyed her spirits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d never questioned his love for her or the baby. What her husband had failed to recognize was Jolene\u2019s reaction to having another woman in the house.</p><p>Turning on the television, Rachel flipped through the channels until she located a news program. She\u2019d often enjoyed sitting with Bruce after dinner as they savored a cup of freshly brewed coffee and discussed their day while the television played in the background. She missed those evenings.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t miss Jolene slamming around in the kitchen or bedroom. Her stepdaughter resented every minute Rachel spent with Bruce. There\u2019d been no sign of it before they were married, but once Bruce slipped the wedding band on her finger, it was all-out war. It didn\u2019t help that Rachel had tried to bring a bit of badly needed discipline into her stepdaughter\u2019s life.</p><p>Oh, why was she doing this to herself? Rehashing the past was pointless. Rachel had gone over everything in her mind dozens\u2014no, hundreds\u2014of times. Reviewing the past few months with Jolene and Bruce only upset her. Slumped down in the chair, she was listening to the weather report when the door opened and Nate came in.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he said, pausing halfway into the room.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so. You generally aren\u2019t around when I am.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had purposely stayed out of Nate\u2019s way as much as possible. This living arrangement was temporary and she didn\u2019t want to burden him by being constantly underfoot. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to see a late-afternoon movie, go to the Bremerton library or just stroll through the mall to kill an hour or two. She wanted to give Nate a chance to get home and get ready for his date with Emily or his evening with friends\u2014or whatever he had planned.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to wonder if I had a housemate or not,\u201d he said, removing his jacket.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a date tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but something came up and Emily had to cancel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to make dinner?\u201d She\u2019d never enjoyed cooking for one; it always felt like a lot of work for very little return.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m meeting people at Phil\u2019s Tavern down town. I\u2019ll pick up something there.\u201d</p><p>Rachel knew the sports bar was a popular hangout with the military crowd. Monday-night football was a big attraction. \u201cHave a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Nate disappeared upstairs to his bedroom and Rachel finished watching the news.</p> <p>She was in the kitchen, searching through her half of the cupboards for inspiration, when Nate left. He waved on his way out the door. When she\u2019d first accepted his invitation Rachel had worried that he might want to re-kindle their romance. Fortunately, that hadn\u2019t been the case. Rachel had met his girlfriend, Emily, and liked her; she felt that Emily suited him far better than she ever had. The situation was ideal\u2014or as ideal as it could be while Rachel was separated from her husband.</p><p>She ate a lonely dinner at the kitchen table while paging through a six-month-old golf magazine. She finished that in short order. Needing something else to occupy her mind, she reached for a pencil and the newspaper to do the crossword puzzle.</p><p>That was when she felt it.</p><p>At first she wasn\u2019t sure\u2014and then it happened again.</p><p>The baby moved.</p><p>She pressed her hand to her stomach. \u201cWell, hello,\u201d she whispered. At her last visit, the doctor had told her she could expect to feel movement at any time. This was so light, like a butterfly landing on her arm, that for an instant she hadn\u2019t even thought it was the baby.</p><p>She wanted to share this joy, but there was no one to tell. Not Bruce. Not Nate. No one.</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, she got her cell and called her husband.</p> <p>As she\u2019d feared, Jolene answered. \u201cIt\u2019s Rachel.\u201d Waiting for a sarcastic remark, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the thirteen-year-old said, sounding almost friendly. That quickly changed and Jolene\u2019s voice hardened as she asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem possible but for a second or two she wondered if Jolene had softened toward her... .</p><p>\u201cCould I speak to your father?\u201d</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t respond but Rachel heard her set down the phone and call her father. \u201cDad! It\u2019s Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Bruce was on the line immediately, firing questions at her. \u201cWhere are you? Are you all right? Is anything wrong with the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, \u201cand so is the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you block my number so I can\u2019t call your cell?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him checking up on her two or three times a day. The scene at the salon had left a bitter taste, and she\u2019d blocked his numbers shortly after that.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him, rather than answer his question.</p><p>\u201cThe baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had the ultrasound yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A couple of days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find out what we\u2019re having? A boy? A girl? One of each would suit me just fine,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even try to keep the smile out of her voice. \u201cI asked the ultrasound technician not to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be surprised.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Jane told you I stopped by the salon,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Actually, Rachel had been too busy to call her former employer in the past week. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you working? Do you need anything? Money? Groceries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Bruce, but thank you for asking.\u201d He did seem to worry about her, which made Rachel miss him all the more.</p><p>\u201cYou have another job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him any more information, preferring to keep it to herself for fear of another embarrassing encounter at her workplace. She hoped to continue working at the shipyard until the baby was born.</p><p>\u201cYou have a job at another salon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Again, she didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cYou left because of what happened that day with Jolene?\u201d</p><p>The answer was obvious, so she didn\u2019t reply. \u201cHow is Jolene?\u201d she asked, broaching the subject of her step-daughter cautiously. Rachel hoped that once she was out of the house, their broken relationship could begin to heal. Perhaps that was an unrealistic expectation; Rachel no longer knew.</p><p>\u201cJolene is...adjusting,\u201d he said, as though searching for the right word.</p><p>\u201cAdjusting,\u201d Rachel echoed, trying to determine exactly what he meant.</p><p>An awkward silence followed. What he didn\u2019t say told her more than what he did. Nothing had really changed. Still, the biting sarcasm was gone when Jolene had initially answered the phone. It might be premature to feel hopeful, but she couldn\u2019t resist grabbing hold of that small piece of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse at the obstetrician\u2019s said you\u2019d called the office to ask about me and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no, not at all. I\u2014I was pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to hide from you, Bruce. But...well, it\u2019s difficult. For now, I think it\u2019s best if we have limited contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept that,\u201d he said swiftly. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a week since we talked and you kept the conversation so brief I hardly had a chance to find out how you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept it brief because you wouldn\u2019t stop badgering me about where I\u2019m living and for now that isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it such a secret?\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t want this conversation to end on the same negative note as the one a week earlier. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d Eventually she\u2019d tell him she was living with Nate but at the moment her roommate was the least of their concerns.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry. If you want me to pretend I don\u2019t care about you, then I will.\u201d He sounded frustrated, and that made her feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cBruce, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see you?\u201d he cut in. \u201cOr is that asking too much? I need to see you, Rachel. At least give me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...guess we could meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday night?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe could go out for Mexican.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled and lifted her hair off her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mexican food doesn\u2019t agree with me these days.\u201d One taste and she had an instant attack of heartburn. She trusted this would pass after the baby was born.</p><p>\u201cYou choose, then. Any place you want. D.D.\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, D.D.\u2019s on the Cove, it is.\u201d</p><p>She could almost feel Bruce\u2019s spirits rise.</p><p>\u201cI have missed you so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care why, I\u2019m just happy you did,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cI felt the baby move for the first time this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby moved?\u201d he asked excitedly. \u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking good care of yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday can\u2019t come soon enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d She wondered if Jolene was listening in, and what her stepdaughter would say when Bruce hung up the phone. It broke her heart that she and Jolene had lost the closeness they\u2019d once shared. But at this point she didn\u2019t know how to regain the girl\u2019s trust.</p><p>\u201cBefore we meet, there\u2019s something I want to tell you,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sounded so serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a family counselor.\u201d</p><p>This was a huge step for him, and it gave her hope that they could resolve their problems before the baby arrived.</p><p>\u201cDid Jolene go with you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, but that was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she will next time,\u201d Rachel said, trying to encourage him. \u201cAt some point I\u2019m sure the counselor will want to see all three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Bruce corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting the baby.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you call again soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and leaned against the wall.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should start all over,\u201d he said, lowering his voice. \u201cEase back into a relationship.\u201d</p><p>Rachel bit her lip, tempted by his suggestion. \u201cDo you think that would help Jolene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s worth a try, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She had to be careful. She loved him so much, he could convince her of almost anything. Except coming home...</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jolene doing Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be with a friend. She usually is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Rachel had been afraid of this. Bruce had ceded all control to Jolene. Rachel had always insisted on knowing where Jolene was going and who she\u2019d be with before she left the house, and Jolene had hated that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either Carrie or Lucy. Why? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe big deal is that your daughter needs supervision. Jolene is at a vulnerable age. She needs boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her she had to be home before midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight?\u201d Rachel thought she was going to be sick. \u201cA thirteen-year-old should be home and in bed long before then. Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about this later?\u201d Bruce said after a strained moment.</p><p>\u201cThat might be best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall I meet you at D.D.\u2019s at six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d Then, because she felt the urge to talk to Jolene, the urge to try yet again, she asked Bruce to put her stepdaughter on the line.</p><p>It was a couple of minutes before Jolene got on the phone. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re taking good care of your father,\u201d Rachel said, thinking that if she began with a compliment, the conversation might go more smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI told you before\u2014we don\u2019t need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t.\u201d That obviously wasn\u2019t what Jolene had expected. \u201cYour father and I are going out for dinner on Friday night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she muttered sarcastically. \u201cYou aren\u2019t moving back, though, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because it\u2019s been really nice around here without you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t doubt that was true\u2014in Jolene\u2019s mind, if not Bruce\u2019s. Rachel responded with silence.</p><p>\u201cDad and I are as close as ever.\u201d</p><p>Rachel decided to ignore that, too. \u201cI wanted to tell you I felt the baby move today.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d picked up the phone, Jolene didn\u2019t have anything derogatory to say.</p><p>Rachel continued. \u201cThe doctor says the baby\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know yet if it\u2019s a boy or girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father asked me the same thing. No, I didn\u2019t want to be told. I\u2019d rather be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jolene seemed disappointed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a baby brother?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sister would be nice, too,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cSomeone you could be friends with later on. I always wanted a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too. When I was little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, this baby is going to be happy to have a big sister,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIt was nice chatting with you, Jolene. Maybe we can do it again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk,\u201d Jolene whispered, \u201cas long as you don\u2019t move back.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d Tanni whispered as she stepped into her mother\u2019s bedroom. \u201cYou look so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Shirley blushed. \u201cOh, Tanni, do I?\u201d She was about to be married and felt more unsettled than she could ever remember being.</p><p>A small wedding was what both she and Larry wanted. Just family and a few friends. Tanni had agreed to be her maid of honor and Miranda would serve as her one and only bridesmaid.</p><p>The wedding would take place in the small chapel at the Catholic church, with Father Donahue presiding. Larry and his children had flown in from California early that morning. They either had to get married in this two-day window or wait another three months until he returned from his travels.</p><p>To Larry, the three months seemed far too long, since they\u2019d already made up their minds. Shirley had never intended to fall in love again; she\u2019d certainly never expected to. Meeting Larry had overturned all her preconceived ideas about living the rest of her life as a widow.</p><p>As Larry said, they were meant to be together.</p><p>Together.</p><p>That was almost worthy of a laugh. With his lecture tour and painting schedule, they\u2019d have this forty-eight-hour period, and then he was off to New York for two weeks, followed by a European tour. Naturally Larry wanted her to go with him, and she would\u2019ve loved it.</p><p>But unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible. Shirley couldn\u2019t pull Tanni out of school or take off for weeks at a time. She wasn\u2019t willing to leave her seventeen-year-old daughter to fend for herself. She also had several commissions she was working on and couldn\u2019t abandon what she\u2019d been contracted to complete. Above all, she was Tanni\u2019s mother and Tanni needed her to be at home.</p><p>Losing her father had been a terrible blow to her teenage daughter, and Shirley wasn\u2019t going to subject Tanni to another massive change, just when she was starting to cope.</p><p>The plan was that they\u2019d have their wedding Friday afternoon, honeymoon for two days and then Larry would be gone for nearly eleven weeks.</p><p>The ceremony was lovely, and both families went to dinner afterward. She was relieved to see how well her children and Larry\u2019s got along. They joked and teased as if they\u2019d known one another all their lives.</p><p>Larry clasped her hand beneath the dinner table. \u201cAre you ready to get out of here?\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Shirley asked. She was enjoying the families\u2019 interactions and hated to have everything end so soon.</p><p>\u201cWe can stay as long as you like, but we do have a three-hour drive ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Shirley. She\u2019d planned the wedding, but had left the honeymoon to Larry.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have good friends who own a summer home near Leavenworth, which they\u2019ve lent us.\u201d</p><p>The Bavarian-style village in the eastern part of the state was one of her favorite places. Since it was an artists\u2019 community, she wasn\u2019t surprised that Larry had friends living there.</p><p>Larry squeezed her fingers. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Shirley squeezed back. \u201cWe can leave now.\u201d</p><p>Except that it took at least half an hour to get away, since everyone wanted to wish them well. Still holding hands, Larry led her to the front of the restaurant, where the valet had brought their rental car. Larry helped her in, and with their friends and family gathered around, they drove off to waves and shouts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way,\u201d Larry said, glancing at her as he pulled out of the circular drive. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>Shirley smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful bride,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an exceptionally handsome groom,\u201d she returned. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so\u2014and sad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad? Why?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have so little time.\u201d</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t want to think about the future, other than this coming weekend. Somehow they\u2019d make it through the next eleven weeks. Then, after Tanni left for college, they could live together in California.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you how much I enjoy Leavenworth?\u201d she asked. They often spoke for two and three hours at a time. Shirley supposed she must have mentioned her fondness for the town at some point.</p><p>\u201cNot that I recall. I was only there once and liked it tremendously. It\u2019s the first place I thought of for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Shirley nestled in the plush leather seat. She was exhausted and the warm air from the car\u2019s heater made her feel sleepy.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and rest,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI plan on keeping you up for most of the night.\u201d</p><p>Shirley sighed contentedly. \u201cThen you should be aware that I plan on wearing you out.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see about that.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Shirley had to admit they were both right. They\u2019d arrived at the cabin around eleven the previous night. While Larry lit a fire and opened a bottle of champagne, she\u2019d unpacked their suitcases and changed into her silk nightgown and robe.</p><p>He was a gentle, caring lover. Afterward, they slept for a while and then made love again. In the morning, Shirley woke to sunshine. She sat up and stretched contentedly before she snuggled against Larry\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He rolled over, throwing one arm around her. \u201cI like waking up with you beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered. Tossing aside the covers a few minutes later, she shivered in the morning chill and hurriedly reached for her flimsy robe, although it offered little warmth.</p><p>The coffee was brewing by the time Larry joined her. He\u2019d dressed and immediately set about building another fire.</p><p>Not until she\u2019d poured them each a cup did Shirley look outside. \u201cLarry!\u201d she cried, pulling open the drapes. \u201cIt snowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in the mountains, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but it\u2019s still October, and I wasn\u2019t expecting this. It\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said, coming to stand behind her, folding his arms around her. She loved being this close to her husband, loved feeling his embrace. All too soon she\u2019d be back in the real world, alone once again.</p><p>They spent one glorious day together, riding snow-mobiles, laughing, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Larry took her to a wonderful restaurant for dinner and they spent much of that night discovering each other in new and exciting ways. Then, early Sunday morning, Larry drove them back to Cedar Cove.</p><p>Since he had to return the rental car to the airport, he took her home first. When they got there, he carried her small suitcase into the house, then held her close. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t want him to go, either. In fact, she felt like weeping.</p><p>Larry hid his face in her hair. \u201cThe weeks will fly by,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t,\u201d she protested. \u201cEvery minute\u2019s going to seem like an hour.\u201d She felt his smile against her skin when he kissed her neck.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to think positive here. How about a little help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d she muttered. \u201cPositive I\u2019m going to be lonely and miserable.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d If he got delayed in traffic or at the rental return, he\u2019d miss his flight. Shirley dared not keep him there any longer.</p><p>They kissed one last time, and she walked him out to the car and waved, forcing herself to smile, refusing to send him off with tears in her eyes. Standing by the fence she waited until the car disappeared from sight.</p><p>With a sigh, she went into the house and found Tanni\u2019s scribbled note on the kitchen chalkboard. \u201cWith Kristen. Home before six.\u201d</p><p>It was only three now. Her arms around her middle, she sank into a chair, feeling sorry for herself.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she said aloud. She\u2019d met and married a good man\u2014an artist like herself, whose work she admired. Instead of brooding about the empty weeks ahead, she should be counting her blessings.</p><p>She picked up the phone and called Miranda. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCleaning house,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSomebody stop me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, stop. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m fighting off depression. I can\u2019t do it alone. Want to come over and eat ice cream and watch a bunch of romantic movies with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Her friend didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cDo you have butter pecan or do I need to go to the store on my way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d Shirley walked to the fridge and opened the freezer section. \u201cI\u2019ve got vanilla and...\u201d She shuffled aside two frozen halibut filets, a microwave dinner and a box of peas. \u201cNope, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an ice cream run,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take me...forty minutes. Can you survive that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty I can do. Forty-five would be a stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the grocery clerk this is an emergency and I\u2019ll be there as fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>Before she hung up, Shirley managed a smile. Miranda was a good friend and she was grateful for her willingness to drop everything and come to her rescue.</p> <p>When Miranda arrived with three flavors of ice cream, Shirley had unpacked her suitcase, started a load of laundry and set out bowls and spoons. A selection of DVDs was stacked and ready. After sorting through her favorite romantic movies, she\u2019d chosen The African Queen, French Kiss, Romancing the Stone and The Princess Bride.</p><p>Miranda decided they should watch French Kiss first. Shirley slipped it into the DVD player while her friend dished up their treats. They both sat on the sofa, eating slowly. \u201cI love this movie,\u201d Shirley mumbled through a mouthful of melting ice cream.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Miranda said dreamily.</p><p>Given Miranda\u2019s often brusque manner, few would guess she was such a romantic. Shirley knew otherwise. The contrast between her no-nonsense exterior and her warm, sensitive heart was one of the interesting things about her.</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t know anyone, not even Olivia, who could cut Will Jefferson down to size as effectively as her friend. She\u2019d been observing the bickering and one-upsmanship between the two of them for months. They argued like a long-married couple, and Shirley was convinced they both enjoyed it. That style of interaction wasn\u2019t for her, but it worked for some couples.</p><p>\u201cGuess what I got in the mail,\u201d Shirley said.</p> <p>\u201cAnything good? A prize from Publishers Clearing House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. A card from your employer.\u201d</p><p>Miranda put her bowl of ice cream on the coffee table, sat up straight and paused the movie. \u201cWill sent you a wedding card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill? Will Jefferson? Are you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t so bad, you know,\u201d Shirley said. \u201cBeneath all that bravado, he\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Miranda frowned, shaking her head. \u201cHe\u2019s completely wrapped up in himself. His ego is so big I can\u2019t imagine how he fits it through the door.\u201d</p><p>Shirley laughed. \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. Aren\u2019t you exaggerating?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t work with him. I do. I\u2019ve seen him at his worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his best,\u201d Shirley added.</p><p>Miranda wasn\u2019t giving in that easily. \u201cYou go ahead and believe what you like, but I know the real Will Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>Shirley got up from the sofa and retrieved the wedding card, which she handed to her friend.</p><p>Miranda read Will\u2019s message, then closed the card and looked up at Shirley.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good with words,\u201d Miranda reluctantly admitted. \u201cHe even sounds gracious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised.\u201d The congratulatory note had felt authentic to Shirley. Will had wished her and Larry happiness and claimed he was proud to have played a role in bringing them together.</p><p>\u201cHe can be sincere,\u201d Miranda said, still with some reluctance.</p><p>Shirley agreed. Despite her initial doubts, she\u2019d sensed his good qualities\u2014his kindness, his commitment to the artists of Cedar Cove, his generosity. Granted, he\u2019d tried too hard to impress her and had come across as excessively sure of himself. \u201cHe\u2019s genuinely pleased that Larry and I found happiness together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenuinely?\u201d Miranda snickered.</p><p>Shirley studied her friend. \u201cI had no idea you disliked him so much.\u201d In reality she knew the opposite was true; Miranda was falling for Will, and fighting it every step of the way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dislike him,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cIn fact...\u201d She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shirley pressed, although she was well aware of what Miranda was about to divulge.</p><p>\u201cIf you laugh, I swear to you I will get up and walk out of this house and never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t laugh,\u201d Shirley promised, her expression sober. \u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Miranda frowned at her, as if to gauge the truth of her words. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m afraid...actually, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t already know that?\u201d Shirley broke into a big grin. Miranda\u2019s confession pleased her. Maybe something would finally happen between Will and her friend.</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, we\u2019ve been friends far too long for me not to see how you feel about Will.\u201d</p><p>Miranda looked stricken. \u201cDo you think Will knows?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cWill Jefferson?\u201d Shirley asked. \u201cThe poor man doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d Although she secretly thought he did...and that he felt exactly the same way.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>When Gloria had first discovered she was pregnant with Chad Timmons\u2019s baby, it had felt like the end of the world. In the months since, she\u2019d come to think differently. She loved her unborn child with a fierce protectiveness and the kind of intensity she\u2019d never experienced before.</p><p>Her obstetrician had ordered a routine ultrasound for Tuesday morning. Sitting on the edge of her bed, Gloria closed her eyes, silently debating what to do. She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Chad since they\u2019d talked in the hospital parking lot, the day he\u2019d been with that other woman.</p><p>The blonde had looked beautiful, petite, delicate. Unlike Gloria, who considered herself moderately attractive and took pride in her strength and toughness. As a cop, she had to be strong, mentally and physically.</p><p>Chad knew about the baby. For reasons of his own, Roy McAfee had told him. She\u2019d been upset that Roy had gone against her express wishes, but she\u2019d forgiven him in time and even found a measure of relief in knowing that this uncomfortable task had been taken from her. After he\u2019d learned the news, though, Chad hadn\u2019t made any effort to contact her. That shouldn\u2019t surprise her, though. Oh, he\u2019d had Mack deliver those books, which showed he was concerned. But he hadn\u2019t reached out to her\u2014nor, for that matter, had she approached him.</p><p>It occurred to her that he might want to know about the ultrasound. The nurse who\u2019d scheduled it had told Gloria that she could bring someone with her.</p><p>She\u2019d considered asking her birth mother, but Corrie was in North Dakota with Linnette and her new grandson. Otherwise, Corrie would certainly have accompanied her.</p><p>But she had to acknowledge that the one person who should be there was Chad. Fingers shaking, she picked up her cell phone and punched the button that would connect her to Chad. A dozen times she\u2019d been tempted to delete his number. She never had. Perhaps she\u2019d secretly wanted to maintain this link.</p><p>He answered immediately. \u201cDr. Timmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gloria.\u201d Her throat was so dry, she could barely get her name out.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI understand Roy told you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cYes...almost five months.\u201d</p><p>Silence again, a tense silence that gnawed at her stomach. \u201cI tried to tell you,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cThat day I showed up at the hospital. But you were with this woman and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cHow is your...friend?\u201d That was a less than subtle way of asking if he was involved with the other woman.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Gloria clenched her fist. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay with the baby?\u201d His voice remained cool, detached.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t inquired about her. \u201cEverything is normal so far... . I\u2019m having an ultrasound tomorrow at nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me this because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you should know.\u201d She regretted calling him. Chad\u2019s attitude\u2014indifference verging on hostility\u2014was making this nearly impossible.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nurse said I could bring someone,\u201d she muttered, feeling foolish.</p><p>\u201cYou want me with you?\u201d His voice softened.</p><p>\u201cIf possible. I...I realize I didn\u2019t give you much notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work the early shift on Tuesdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She should\u2019ve phoned right away... .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can. But I\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate accelerated. Chad was saying he\u2019d join her if he could\u2014that he wanted to be with her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and recited the pertinent information.</p><p>\u201cAt nine,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, and, Chad, thank you for the books.\u201d She wanted him to know that she was aware those had come from him. He might not care about her, but he cared about his baby, and that gave her courage. She wondered if she would\u2019ve had the nerve to call him if not for that one small sign.</p><p>\u201cMack told you the books were from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first. I confronted him about it after Roy admitted he\u2019d talked to you.\u201d Once she\u2019d found out, her emotions had been chaotic for days afterward.</p><p>\u201cI have a right to know I\u2019m about to become a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never have hidden it from me.\u201d She heard the resentment in his voice; clearly he hadn\u2019t yet forgiven her.</p><p>\u201cI hope to see you tomorrow,\u201d she said, and before their conversation could deteriorate into a verbal battle, she ended the call. She did understand his reaction to her keeping the pregnancy a secret. The ironic thing was, she\u2019d done it for him. Chad was seeing someone else\u2014still might be, for all she knew. At this point their only bond was the baby, and she didn\u2019t feel that an unplanned responsibility, one he hadn\u2019t asked for, should interfere with his future or his new relationship.</p><p>The next morning Gloria arrived at the ultrasound clinic fifteen minutes early. The waiting area held six chairs, four of which were occupied. Gloria took the fifth one, sat down and picked up a magazine. The couple across from her held hands, while the other couple whispered excitedly.</p><p>The two holding hands were called in first. Gloria glanced at the wall clock, figuring Chad probably hadn\u2019t been able to get the time off.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the assistant called her name. Gloria put down the magazine, which she\u2019d hardly looked at, and stood. She followed the woman out of the waiting area and into an examination room. She was on the table, with her pants unzipped and pulled down and her top raised, when there was a knock on the door. The technician was explaining the procedure and what Gloria could expect to see and not see in the ultrasound. She listened intently but found herself distracted by a feeling of aloneness. A feeling of abandonment, of not mattering enough to anyone. The lump in her throat seemed about to choke her\u2014and then the assistant opened the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDr. Chad Timmons is here. Would it be all right if I sent him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gloria said. To her embarrassment tears filled her eyes and slid down her face. She desperately wanted to wipe them away but was afraid it would only call attention to the emotion that racked her.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d the technician said. She smiled, greeting Chad. \u201cPull up a chair and sit down. We\u2019re about to get started.\u201d</p><p>Chad arranged his chair so he\u2019d have a full view of the screen. The technician spread a cold gel on Gloria\u2019s stomach and placed a wandlike device over the small round protrusion that was her baby.</p> <p>Gloria stared at the screen. She didn\u2019t dare look at Chad.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to know the sex?\u201d the technician asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gloria answered for them both, then turned to Chad.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, do you see him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHim?\u201d Chad asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s definitely a him.\u201d</p><p>Despite her determination not to look at Chad again, Gloria shifted her head\u2014and saw his broad smile. He glanced at her and she smiled tentatively.</p><p>\u201cA girl would make me just as happy,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The technician continued. \u201cWe have ten fingers and ten toes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure that\u2019s not another finger you\u2019re seeing?\u201d Chad teased.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Daddy, that\u2019s no finger.\u201d</p><p>Chad laughed, and Gloria relaxed. To her surprise, he reached for her hand in a simple gesture of comfort and sharing. It helped ease the tension between them.</p><p>The ultrasound only took a few minutes. The physician would be reviewing it for any abnormalities, but Chad\u2014as a doctor himself\u2014assured Gloria that all looked well.</p><p>The technician cleaned the sticky substance off Gloria\u2019s abdomen and left the room.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about names?\u201d he asked as she sat up.</p><p>\u201cA little...I thought if it was a boy, I\u2019d choose Roy for the middle name.\u201d</p><p>Chad nodded.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a suggestion for a first name?\u201d she asked, adjusting her clothes.</p><p>\u201cDiMaggio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gloria asked. She couldn\u2019t have heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cDiMaggio. After Joe DiMaggio. I\u2019m a big baseball fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just call him Joe?\u201d</p><p>Chad shook his head. \u201cToo boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not subjecting our son to a name like DiMaggio. He\u2019ll grow up hating us for that. What\u2019s your dad\u2019s name?\u201d It suddenly occurred to her how little she knew of his life before Cedar Cove, his family, his childhood....</p><p>\u201cRobert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob Roy. Oh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy granddad\u2019s name was Simon,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cSimon Roy,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWell, let\u2019s think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do that.\u201d They walked out of the office together. \u201cI can hardly believe we actually agree on something.\u201d Chad smiled. \u201cOr almost agree, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chad had good reason to feel that way, and Gloria felt the need to show her appreciation for the fact that he\u2019d come. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were here,\u201d she mumbled, looking down at the pavement.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve mentioned it earlier... .\u201d</p><p>Chad shrugged. \u201cI traded days with a friend. He owes me.\u201d</p><p>Neither spoke as he walked her to her car.</p><p>\u201cYou read the books?\u201d he finally asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cAll three, cover to cover.\u201d She grinned. \u201cIncluding the name book, but the only thing I learned from that is how hard it is to make a decision. I found the pregnancy books really useful, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often recommend them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>They stood there, facing each other. It seemed that neither was ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on desk duty now,\u201d Gloria told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI bet you hate that.\u201d</p><p>She motioned with her hands, unsure what to say. When she\u2019d first been assigned to administrative work and the phones, she\u2019d expected to be bored. But that hadn\u2019t turned out to be the case. \u201cIt\u2019s actually okay,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about you? Do you like being an E.R. doctor?\u201d</p><p>He made the same noncommittal hand motion she had. \u201cIt\u2019s not that different from what I did at the Cedar Cove clinic.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the button to unlock her door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling good?\u201d</p><p>Gloria nodded. \u201cToo good. I\u2019ve gained five pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both want a healthy baby, Gloria. I don\u2019t want you to worry about gaining weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised. While she didn\u2019t want this conversation to end, she did need to get to work. \u201cI\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, and leaned forward to hug him.</p><p>Chad returned her hug. \u201cGloria?\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should know I\u2019m still seeing Joni.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Rachel waited inside the Cedar Cove movie theater for Bruce, looking at her watch every few minutes. Their Friday-night dinner date the week before had gone well\u2014almost like the way things had been when they\u2019d first started going out. It felt good to laugh with her husband again.</p><p>What hadn\u2019t felt good was leaving him at the end of the evening. They\u2019d each driven off in opposite directions. But before they parted, they\u2019d made plans to meet again. Rachel had suggested a movie. She\u2019d already seen this particular romantic comedy on one of her late-afternoon excursions, but she knew Bruce would enjoy it, too. They needed more reasons to laugh together. They hadn\u2019t communicated since last Friday and she worried that he might have confused the time or forgotten that they\u2019d agreed to meet.</p><p>Just when she was about to give up and go home, Bruce appeared, harried and out of breath.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d wait,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d He took hold of her shoulders and brought her close.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, then realized she knew. \u201cJolene?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was going to a haunted house with some friends tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil she found out you were meeting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got sick.\u201d He rolled his eyes, as though he suspected she was faking.</p><p>\u201cBut, Bruce, she really could be ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I know when Jolene is sick and this was pretty lame. I told her she\u2019d be fine by herself for a few hours and I\u2019d be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the movie,\u201d he said, steering her toward the ticket counter and then the refreshment stand. They ordered a large bucket of popcorn, a soda and bottled water for Rachel, joking about the fact that their popcorn and drinks cost more than the movie.</p><p>Bruce escorted her into the appropriate theater, where the previews had begun. He tilted the popcorn in her direction, then both of them settled in to watch the film.</p><p>Not until it ended and the credits were rolling did Rachel have an opportunity to resume their conversation. Jolene had obviously made a fuss about her father\u2019s date with Rachel. That was discouraging, especially if Jolene was faking illness in order to keep Bruce from seeing her. She found it hard to believe that her stepdaughter would go to such lengths. The one bright spot was that Bruce had recently had his second appointment with the counselor.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019d it go with Dr. Jenner?\u201d she asked, once they were outside. It was dark by then and raining.</p><p>\u201cFine. I guess. Do you want to go somewhere and talk for a while?\u201d</p><p>She wanted that very much. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you check on Jolene?\u201d</p><p>Bruce hesitated. \u201cI asked Anne from next door to look in on her. If there\u2019s something wrong, Anne will call me. I\u2019m not letting Jolene force me into giving up this time with you.\u201d He grinned and reached for her hand. \u201cDr. Jenner would be proud of me.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were sitting across from each other in a booth at the Pancake Palace.</p><p>Goldie, the long-time waitress, approached their table, coffeepot in hand, menus tucked under her arm. Bruce ordered the club sandwich and Rachel requested a small bowl of seafood chowder. She was full from the popcorn and could\u2019ve gone without dinner, but Bruce wouldn\u2019t hear of it.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about the counselor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Bruce began. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ve done most of the talking. He asked about my relationship with Jolene before you and I were married and what it\u2019s like now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jolene go with you?\u201d Rachel knew it wasn\u2019t likely, and she wasn\u2019t surprised by his answer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That would\u2019ve been too much to expect, Rachel acknowledged, although she\u2019d hoped Jolene would have a change of heart.</p><p>\u201cYou started to tell me what happened this afternoon,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he broke in. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell me where you\u2019re living. Fine. You have your secrets and I have mine. Why should I be the one to spill everything when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t exactly a secret,\u201d she protested quickly.</p><p>Bruce raised his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell me, fine.\u201d</p><p>Rachel glared at him. She was perfectly willing to let him know she was sharing a house with Nate\u2014but not when he was in this frame of mind. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>Neither seemed inclined to continue the conversation.</p><p>When Goldie delivered their meals, she set the soup in front of Rachel and the club sandwich by Bruce and then retreated one step. \u201cAre you two not getting along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d Rachel murmured.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you have the same sour look. It\u2019s not a good idea to eat together while you\u2019re arguing. Mel and me have been married for fifty-six years and we never eat or go to bed without resolving our differences.\u201d She snorted. \u201cSeems to me you two should do that, too\u2014otherwise, you\u2019ll end up with stomachaches and blame the restaurant when it\u2019s your own fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Goldie,\u201d Rachel said, without looking the other woman in the eye.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, the opinionated waitress left them, shaking her head as if to say she\u2019d done all she could to help.</p><p>Rachel picked up her spoon, although she doubted she\u2019d be able to swallow any of her soup. She took a deep breath and glanced at Bruce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sharing a house with a friend in Bremerton,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As she said that, Bruce reached across the table to take her hand. \u201cJolene pulled every trick in the book to keep me home. Pretending she was sick was just one. She wanted you to wait at the theater, not knowing where I was or whether I was even going to show up.\u201d</p><p>It hurt that her stepdaughter disliked her so much she was willing to miss a night of fun with her friends for the sole purpose of ruining Bruce\u2019s plans. This was about keeping him away from her. His wife... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve let Jolene control my life for far too long. I\u2019ve set some rules for her. Dr. Jenner calls them boundaries, although they sound like plain old rules to me. Saying Jolene doesn\u2019t like it is putting it mildly.\u201d He gave a quick shake of his head. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve started seeing Dr. Jenner, she\u2019s gotten more rebellious.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t know what to say. Depressed, she felt as if they\u2019d never find a solution. The one suggestion she had was that they live apart until Jolene left for college. Then and only then would she and their baby move in with Bruce.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about more pleasant subjects,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChristie and James. And their wedding.\u201d</p><p>Caught up in her own personal crisis, Rachel hadn\u2019t thought about her best friend\u2019s sister in weeks.</p><p>Christie and James, Bobby Polgar\u2019s chauffeur and close friend, had gone to Vegas for the ceremony. Bobby and Teri had been married in Vegas, too, Rachel remembered fondly. On the surface those two were an unlikely couple; Teri was practical and emotionally astute, while Bobby, a professional chess player, lived\u2014or used to live\u2014an entirely cerebral life. His approach was logical rather than instinctive. Maybe because of that, they fit together perfectly, each respecting the other\u2019s skills and talents. If only her own marriage was as uncomplicated.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about the chess game?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cBobby was in another tournament?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, the video chess game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d The last time she spoke to Teri, her friend had said something about Bobby and James having developed some sort of computer game. It involved chess and a parallel universe. That was all she knew. Teri wasn\u2019t sure how it worked so she hadn\u2019t explained it too clearly. She was far too busy caring for their triplets to worry about chess or gaming.</p><p>Bruce smiled. \u201cThey sold it to a major gaming company. The deal\u2019s worth a whole lot of money and there\u2019s the potential for more games in the future. James has a real talent for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed James had it in him? He\u2019s always been so quiet and content to remain in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently all the paperwork\u2019s signed and the game\u2019s gone into production. It\u2019s going to be the biggest thing since World of Warcraft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorld of what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how are Christie and James doing?\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing him so amused made her want to smile, too.</p><p>\u201cChristie\u2019s decided to fatten him up.\u201d</p><p>She did smile now. James was tall and rail-thin, always had been as far as she knew. She remembered the first time she\u2019d seen him. He\u2019d come to the salon on an errand for Bobby. He\u2019d looked so uncomfortable and out of place she was torn between sympathy and laughter. \u201cI doubt it\u2019ll work. He\u2019s got one of those superefficient metabolisms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn any case, Christie is cooking day and night. Teri said she\u2019s become more domesticated than a house cat. James wanted her to quit her job at Wal-Mart, which she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her classes at the community college?\u201d They\u2019d been so important to Christie when she\u2019d enrolled, and Rachel hated the thought of her dropping out.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s more determined to finish those than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. She needs to do that for herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever she wants, James is supporting her and eating well at the same time.\u201d He paused, grinning. \u201cEven if he stays exactly the same weight.\u201d</p><p>Clearly Bruce had been to see Teri. \u201cHow are the triplets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing like grass in August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Teri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. The boys are sleeping better now and she looks like she\u2019s getting more rest. Bobby, too.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d hired a nanny, whom Rachel had met, but Teri kept a close eye on her sons.</p><p>\u201cShe said you hadn\u2019t come over or called her in a while.\u201d This sounded a bit accusatory.</p><p>Rachel knew that the instant she saw Teri she\u2019d tell her about living with Nate. Teri was her best friend in all the world, but she couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. The only solution, really, had been to avoid her altogether. Rachel missed her desperately, so she\u2019d give her friend a call or visit soon. She was feeling stronger and it no longer needed to be such a secret that she was living and working in Bremerton.</p><p>\u201cJames and Christie are happy, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure seem to be.\u201d</p><p>If he noticed the abrupt change of subject, he didn\u2019t comment. Instead, he squeezed her hand and looked directly into her eyes. \u201cLet me come home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t spend more than a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>She knew what her husband wanted and, frankly, she was tempted. Very tempted. It was too dangerous, though. She was afraid that they\u2019d walk into the house and Nate would be there. And she wasn\u2019t ready for that... .</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t... . I have a roommate, don\u2019t forget.\u201d That probably wouldn\u2019t matter to Bruce, so she decided to elaborate on the truth. Okay, she\u2019d lie. \u201cMy roommate\u2019s having a big party tonight... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me go home with you,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>Bruce hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay longer than...necessary,\u201d she said, and then because it sounded so calculating, she started to giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. We\u2019re married and we can\u2019t find a place to be alone. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s still at the house,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. That won\u2019t work, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my house. I don\u2019t care what my daughter thinks. You\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not pick a fight with her now, especially if she isn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>Neither said anything for several seconds.</p><p>\u201cWe could always get a hotel room,\u201d Bruce said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better idea?\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t.</p><p>Bruce rubbed his thumb over the top of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhy not? I want to be with you, and if that means paying for a room, then so be it.\u201d He was already halfway out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Goldie will get it to us.\u201d He peeled off a five-dollar bill, dropping it on the table for a tip, then extended his hand to Rachel.</p><p>She stood and Bruce bent to kiss the side of her neck.</p><p>Sure enough, Goldie appeared with their bill mere seconds later. \u201cAnything wrong with the food?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Their meals were almost untouched.</p><p>\u201cEverything was fine,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a take-out bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Bruce placed his hand on the small of Rachel\u2019s back, not hiding his eagerness to be on their way.</p><p>\u201cYou two still fighting?\u201d Goldie demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to kiss and make up,\u201d Bruce added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. Good for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, good for us.\u201d Bruce grabbed Rachel\u2019s hand. They paused only long enough to pay for their meal.</p><p>By the time they were in the parking lot, Rachel felt almost giddy. Bruce backed her against the side of his car and kissed her with a hunger that assured her she\u2019d been greatly missed.</p><p>Wrapping her arms around her husband\u2019s neck, she returned every kiss in full measure. \u201cBruce...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we get a hotel room...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d</p><p>She ignored that. \u201cI think you should check on Jolene first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Like I said, I\u2019m not giving her any reason to bring me home earlier than I want to be.\u201d Bruce was far more interested in unlocking his car door while still kissing her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she murmured, dragging her lips from his.</p><p>\u201cWait?\u201d he asked as he straightened. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove my own car here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He stepped back\u2014and just then, his cell phone rang. Rachel froze.</p><p>So did Bruce. He pulled out his cell and his shoulders tensed with what could only be dread.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and answer it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Reluctantly Bruce did. \u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped. His eyes locked with Rachel\u2019s. \u201cSorry. Yes, of course. I\u2019ll be right home.\u201d</p><p>This was obviously serious. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked even before he could disconnect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Anne from next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene called her over. She\u2019s been throwing up all night. Anne said she hasn\u2019t been able to keep anything down. She\u2019s afraid there might be something really wrong. She thinks it\u2019s a good idea to take her to the E.R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should go,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Bruce reached for her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>And she was, far more than she dared admit.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Shortly after nine on Thursday morning Miranda Sullivan was getting into her car to run errands when her cell phone chirped. Digging in her purse, she retrieved it, all the while wondering who\u2019d be calling this early. Caller ID identified Will Jefferson. He\u2019d given her the day off and she planned on putting it to good use.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOn my way to the grocery store. I\u2019m picking up treats for the goblins who\u2019ll be coming by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, it\u2019s Halloween. Aren\u2019t you doing this a little last-minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but if I buy candy too early I tend to eat it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo willpower?\u201d</p><p>Miranda frowned and refused to take the bait. He knew exactly which buttons to push with her. \u201cIs there a reason you called?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, speaking of last-minute, I was hoping you\u2019d be able to work this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t then, but I do now. My sister wants me to come with her to check something out... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d counted on a free afternoon and wasn\u2019t giving it up without a good reason.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you must know...\u201d He sighed. \u201cOlivia and I have appointments at a couple of assisted-living complexes in the area.\u201d</p><p>Miranda did sympathize but she had her own appointment at Get Nailed. \u201cI have plans this afternoon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sounded somewhat morose. \u201cSo you can\u2019t come in for a few hours? Well, I could close the gallery, I suppose. It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt for one afternoon. Only I hate the idea of doing that... .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d Miranda said, capitulating far too easily.

I really appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye.\u201d She called the salon to cancel her appointment, then shut her cell and put it back inside her oversize purse. So much for shopping, hair and fun. She quickly revised her plans.</p><p>First things first. She ran errands, going to Safeway for the candy she needed. In addition, she bought an extra bag of miniature chocolate bars and a plastic pumpkin for the gallery. Then she picked up her dry cleaning. Shirley met her for an early lunch, and when they\u2019d finished, she dropped off some books at the library. From there Miranda got to the art gallery with fifteen minutes to spare.</p><p>Will was with a customer when she arrived. He raised his hand briefly but otherwise didn\u2019t acknowledge her. Miranda hung her coat in the back room and stashed her purse in a safe place. Then she opened the candy, dumped the small chocolate bars in the pumpkin and set it on the counter near the cash register for customers to help themselves.</p><p>Will was at the door saying goodbye to his customer when she returned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, nodding toward the plastic pumpkin.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought candy in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The answer should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it and neither do I. Whenever possible I avoid sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t indulge. I thought you were the one with willpower,\u201d she said sarcastically. When he started to respond, she said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t for you, anyway.\u201d Was he so self-absorbed that he assumed she\u2019d purchased the bag for him?</p><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s it for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCustomers,\u201d she said irritably. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d She\u2019d done him a favor and Will acted as if she\u2019d brought poison into his precious gallery.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get that many children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time you met your sister?\u201d she asked, interrupting him.</p><p>Will gave her a startled look. \u201cRight. I shouldn\u2019t be longer than a couple of hours. Three at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t back by five, I\u2019ll close for the night and head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he says,\u201d Miranda muttered under her breath. If Will heard her, he pretended he didn\u2019t.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was busy, much busier than she would\u2019ve expected. She sold another Beverly Chandler painting, a sculpture and a quilt. Will should be pleased, but knowing him, he\u2019d invent reasons to find fault. She just hoped he realized that if she hadn\u2019t given up most of her afternoon, they wouldn\u2019t have made three rather large sales. If he\u2019d placed a closed sign on the door, he might never have known what he\u2019d missed. After all, there was no guarantee those customers would\u2019ve come back.</p> <p>A little after five, as she was putting the cash from the till into the bank deposit bag, Will walked into the gallery, looking completely worn out.</p><p>\u201cWe had a great afternoon,\u201d she said, eager to share her news.</p><p>He nodded absently. \u201cOlivia and I are shocked. You wouldn\u2019t believe the monthly fees these adult residences charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sold the quilt,\u201d Miranda bragged. It\u2019d been in the gallery for three months and she\u2019d almost lost hope that it would sell.</p><p>Will still wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cOf course, when you take into account that the fees include meals and utilities, I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother Beverly Chandler painting, too.\u201d If nothing else, this should get his attention.</p><p>\u201cThey have a lot of programs for the elderly,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey do everything they can to keep the residents physically fit. The social activities sound great. Both Olivia and I think this mental stimulation is exactly what Mom needs. Ben, too.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cStill, we\u2019ll have to talk to Ben\u2019s son\u2014and I don\u2019t mean David\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard a single word I said?\u201d Miranda asked.</p><p>Will glanced up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She tossed the deposit bag on the counter and went into the back room for her coat and purse.</p><p>He followed her. \u201cWhy are you in such a state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat figures. Apparently everything I do annoys you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how true that is. And you seem to be just as annoyed by me. I\u2019m not even sure why you keep me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering that myself,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFurthermore I doubt you heard a single word I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I did.\u201d She marched into the outer room and grabbed the plastic pumpkin.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. You don\u2019t appreciate it, so I\u2019m taking it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t appreciate it. Anyway, I didn\u2019t have a chance to pick up any treats, so I was going to use it tonight in case any of the neighborhood kids stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Whatever.\u201d He glared at her.</p><p>Miranda glared back.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...so moody. You jump all over me every chance you get. I don\u2019t understand what your problem is.\u201d</p><p>Miranda took offense at that. \u201cI am the most even-tempered woman you\u2019re likely to meet. Ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fly off the handle over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward her. \u201cJust listen to how defensive you are. Can\u2019t we have a civil conversation without you making all kinds of false assumptions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d Perhaps she was being defensive. Okay, true, she was, but she had no choice. It was either that or own up to how attractive she found him... .</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked, frowning slightly. He didn\u2019t seem to know how he should react when she didn\u2019t have an immediate comeback.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d she started again, and then, without considering her actions, she stepped forward and kissed him.</p><p>For an instant they were both too shocked to do anything but stare at each other. Then Will reached out and caught her by the shoulders as if to shove her away. Instead, he brought her close, kissing her deeply, passionately.</p><p>They both seemed to realize what was happening at the same time. Breaking apart, they retreated, gazing at each other in shock.</p><p>Miranda could feel her face heating up with acute embarrassment. In all her life, she\u2019d never been the one to take the initiative and kiss a man. Well, not the first time they kissed, at any rate. This was completely out of character.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Will asked, frowning.</p><p>Miranda could play this one of two ways, she decided. She could be nonchalant about the whole thing and dismiss it as unimportant. Irrelevant. Or she could simply say he\u2019d made her so angry that it was either kiss him or slap him across the face. And that being the case, she\u2019d opted for the lesser of two evils.</p><p>Before she could choose which approach to take, Will raised one hand to his face and narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou just kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever kissed you before?\u201d she asked flippantly.</p><p>\u201cNot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Not answering, he turned away and then abruptly turned back. \u201cDo you do that often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she said, playing stupid. Because that was how she felt. Stupid.</p><p>\u201cWalk up to a man and kiss him,\u201d he said. His voice seemed to echo around the gallery. Thankfully they were closed; otherwise, some unsuspecting customer might breeze in. But maybe that wouldn\u2019t be so bad because she\u2019d be able to escape.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t usually go around kissing men,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt seems to me you enjoyed it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please!\u201d She laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Come on, Will. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so thrown by a little kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t going to be an easy way to extricate herself from this awkward situation. She could confess that she was strongly attracted to him. No, that would be totally the wrong move. It would give him the upper hand, always dangerous with a man like Will. Acting defensive and ill-tempered protected her, although she\u2019d rather burn at the stake than admit it.</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d She\u2019d really done it this time. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was a mistake. A big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your employer, I\u2019m finding this all rather...amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would find it amusing.\u201d Leave it to Will to use this to embarrass her even further\u2014although a moment ago, his reaction had been quite different.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to kiss rather than be kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have rules for such things,\u201d she murmured, not pointing out that he\u2019d done his share of the kissing. This entire conversation was ridiculous. She yanked her raincoat from its hook and thrust her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has rules about kissing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you, it was a mistake. An accident...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn accident,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re joking. That kiss was probably the most deliberate action you\u2019ve taken since the moment I hired you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved the first Chandler painting,\u201d she was quick to remind him, \u201cthe one that sold a month ago.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cWhen I kiss a woman, I prefer she not be a big-boned, opinionated windbag.\u201d</p><p>So now he was going to insult her. Miranda didn\u2019t need to hang around for that. Grabbing her purse, she stomped out of the gallery.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, following her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m just...curious.\u201d</p><p>She was at the door, which stubbornly refused to open. She twisted the handle several times, but couldn\u2019t budge it. So much for making a grand exit.</p><p>Will reached over and flipped the lock so that when she tried again she stumbled backward and almost fell into his arms. He clutched at her shoulders to steady her. It didn\u2019t take much effort to shake herself free.</p><p>As soon as the door opened, she hurried around to the rear of the building where she\u2019d parked. Again, Will followed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked sharply.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, and it occurred to her that he was as bemused as she\u2019d been. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing or why. That was comforting\u2014at least a little.</p><p>Before she could open the car door, Will planted his hand on the side window and turned, leaning against the vehicle so she couldn\u2019t leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said heatedly.</p><p>Then Will hauled her into his arms and kissed her full on the mouth. When he released her, she faltered for a second or two.</p><p>He looked as shocked as she\u2019d felt when she\u2019d kissed him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked again, his voice faint.</p> <p>\u201cHome.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one with voice problems. Her own sounded as if a mouse had gotten control of her voice box; her words came out like a high-pitched squeak.</p><p>\u201cWill you be back in the morning?\u201d He seemed anxious, as though concerned that she might resign her position.</p><p>\u201cYes, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want a little thing like a kiss to stand between us,\u201d he said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I kissed you...first. Okay, I\u2019ll admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on doing it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d After all, he was the one who claimed she was a big-boned, opinionated windbag. \u201cDo you want to kiss me again?\u201d</p><p>His head shot up. \u201cLet\u2019s just call this whole episode a slip in judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn both our parts,\u201d she added.</p> <p>He offered her a tentative smile. \u201cOn both our parts,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>The puppy\u2019s soft mewling cry woke Grace from a sound sleep. Cliff had been feeding Beau in the middle of the night, and usually seemed to hear the puppy before Grace did. Often she got up, too, but there really wasn\u2019t much she could do. So, after a few minutes she simply returned to bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I hear you,\u201d she muttered as she threw aside the covers. Cliff continued to sleep peacefully, which told her he was especially tired. It was her turn to get up with the puppy.</p><p>Beau slept in a cardboard box in the corner of their bedroom. She didn\u2019t like it, but there wasn\u2019t anyplace else they could keep him where he could be heard at night. Unfortunately, he still needed to be fed every few hours.</p><p>Reaching for her fleece housecoat at the end of the bed, Grace slipped it on and tucked her feet into the warm, fuzzy pink slippers that had been a gift from her daughter Maryellen last Christmas.</p><p>Cliff had the puppy formula ready, so she got it out of the kitchen and carried Beau into the living room. As she set him in her lap, he latched on to the small rubber nipple and sucked greedily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as cute as you think you are,\u201d she felt obliged to inform the puppy. \u201cButtercup was a great-looking dog,\u201d she said aloud. Sighing, she realized she actually wanted this small, runt-of-the-litter dog to feel jealous. Beau wouldn\u2019t grow up to be half the dog Buttercup was. Nope. Not in a million years.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d she said. Beau might think he\u2019d finally got her where he wanted her, but he was dead wrong. Grace had no intention of letting this puppy, or any other dog, capture her affections. The only reason she\u2019d agreed to take him was as a favor to Beth. Even now she was sorry she\u2019d allowed herself to be talked into this.</p><p>Grace had managed to steel herself against the puppy\u2014so far. In fact, she went out of her way not to pay attention to Beau. During the day Cliff looked after him, which helped. Unfortunately, he had a meeting with fellow horse-breeders the next day and wouldn\u2019t be able to bring Beau with him. That meant she\u2019d have to take the puppy to work for the first time\u2014something she\u2019d rather not do.</p><p>Holding the baby bottle, she focused her gaze on the opposite wall. \u201cButtercup would\u2019ve looked after you,\u201d she said. It was still difficult not to tear up when she thought of her beloved golden retriever. Not a day passed that she didn\u2019t think of Buttercup. Her dog had always greeted her when she returned from work, and in the evenings Buttercup would lie at Grace\u2019s feet while she read or watched television.</p><p>\u201cYou could pet him, you know.\u201d Cliff\u2019s voice startled her. Grace looked up to see her husband leaning against the archway that led into the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see. Early. Too early for either of us to be up. This dog isn\u2019t worth losing sleep over,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cSure he is,\u201d Cliff said, crossing his arms. \u201cJust look at him, cuddled up on your lap. Pet him, Grace. He needs affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not getting it from me.\u201d</p><p>Cliff shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman.\u201d</p><p>She ignored that. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to coax me to be friends with Beau. Well, it isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought him the chew toy.\u201d</p><p>She had, but that was for self-preservation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him cutting his teeth on my shoes.\u201d Because she was often on her feet for long periods of time, Grace purchased high-end pumps that were both attractive and designed for comfort. The last thing she wanted was for Beau to make a meal out of one of those.</p><p>\u201cI have that meeting at ten,\u201d Cliff reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She wasn\u2019t happy about it, but she had little cause for complaint, since Cliff had been so accommodating toward the puppy.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll sleep all morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope.\u201d She worried about what would happen if the puppy got away from her at the library. If he got lost...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good-natured little guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone will steal him,\u201d she joked. Well...sort of joked.</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d</p><p>His disapproval annoyed her. \u201cIf you\u2019re up, you might as well feed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather watch you.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously want this dog, do you?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him a chance to respond. \u201cPuppies are a nuisance.\u201d The fact that Cliff had disregarded her wishes concerning this dog didn\u2019t sit well with her. It hadn\u2019t taken him more than a day to fall under Beau\u2019s spell.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone had asked me,\u201d Cliff said, \u201cI would\u2019ve agreed with you. We don\u2019t need a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen Beau arrived on our doorstep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was foisted on me by a woman with a conniving mind,\u201d Grace said irritably.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you, maybe, but he\u2019s grown on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she wailed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re saying this. Do you think it was any accident that Beth placed this puppy with us? You\u2019re falling right in with her schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so bad? All Beth wants is a good home for these puppies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want a puppy,\u201d Grace said, glaring across the room at her husband. \u201cOr any other dog for that matter. Buttercup is gone, and that\u2019s the end of any pets for us. Agreed?\u201d she asked pointedly.</p><p>Maybe Cliff thought he could convince her to change her mind; in that case, she wanted it understood right now that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Grace. This is totally up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because my decision\u2019s already made.\u201d She heard a sucking noise and realized the bottle was empty. Gently she withdrew the nipple from Beau\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt you to give him a bit of affection.\u201d</p><p>Grace ran her index finger down the puppy\u2019s back. He was so small and skinny she could feel the ridges of his spine. Poor thing really was undernourished. To Cliff\u2019s credit, Beau looked healthier than when he\u2019d first arrived, but that wasn\u2019t saying much.</p><p>Beau\u2019s deep brown eyes seemed to plead with her. Well, if he was hoping to steal her heart, he could look elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cShould I give him a second bottle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not good to feed him too much at once. Better to let him eat smaller meals but more often.\u201d</p><p>That made sense.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to burp him, do I? Like a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019ll be asleep in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Beau settled contentedly onto her lap and quickly went back to sleep. Grace wished it was as easy for her. When she returned Beau to his box and got into bed, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Cliff, on the other hand, obviously had no problem. Within minutes\u2014no, seconds, she thought enviously\u2014he was deep in dreamland.</p><p>Lying on her back, staring up at the ceiling, Grace recalled the day Charlotte Rhodes had brought Buttercup to the house. Except that Charlotte had been Charlotte Jefferson then.</p><p>That was such a dark time in Grace\u2019s life. Dan had gone missing and, to all appearances, seemed to have run off with another woman. She remembered the day someone had reported seeing him in town, driving a pickup truck. Later, her husband had been spotted just down the street from the library. Grace had run out, coatless, chasing after him in such a frantic hurry that she\u2019d stumbled, fallen and skinned her knee.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Dan that day. It couldn\u2019t have been. Almost a year passed before she learned that her husband wasn\u2019t with another woman. He\u2019d killed himself, unable to let go of a crime he\u2019d committed as a young man serving in Vietnam.</p><p>For years after the war he\u2019d periodically sink into black moods, during which he\u2019d lash out at those around him, at those who loved him. Any effort to question or comfort him was met with fierce, uncontrollable anger. After a while, Grace stopped trying. His mood would reverse itself after a few days or weeks and it would be as if nothing had happened. For their entire married life, she\u2019d loved a man who had what was essentially a split personality.</p><p>Grace must have fallen asleep because the alarm startled her awake. Her eyes flew open and she sat up and switched it off. Cliff rolled over, pulling the blanket over his shoulder. Leaning down, she kissed his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll start the coffee,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>She climbed out of bed and grabbed her housecoat. Shrugging into it as she walked to the kitchen, Grace paused at the cardboard box to discover Beau tightly curled up in the receiving blanket Cliff had found for him. \u201cI see the alarm didn\u2019t bother you any,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She waited until there was enough coffee in the pot to fill two mugs, then carried them into the bedroom. Cliff was up and in the shower.</p><p>Drinking her coffee as she dressed, she slipped into a long-sleeved polo shirt and a jumper. She wore something similar most days; it was almost a uniform. Cliff took his coffee from the dresser as he strolled out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. The radio was reporting on weather and traffic in the Seattle area. Half listening, she plugged in her curling iron and applied moisturizer to her face.</p><p>When Grace had finished putting on makeup and fixing her hair, she saw that Cliff had removed Beau from his box. The puppy had made his way over to one of her fluffy slippers, snuggled inside and gone right back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit that\u2019s cute,\u201d Cliff said, coming to stand behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not. I don\u2019t want that dog in my shoe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Grace. Hallmark would print a card with a picture like that. Or...how about if I put him on YouTube? He\u2019d be a star. Just look at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can look all you want but I have to get to work.\u201d</p><p>Cliff shook his head and bent to take Beau from her slipper.</p><p>Grace hated to be so coldhearted but she couldn\u2019t lower her guard, not even a little. The instant she did, Beau would wriggle his way into her affections, which was exactly what Cliff and Beth hoped would happen. Grace was determined it wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Half an hour later, after a second cup of coffee and a toasted English muffin, Grace drove to the library with Beau in the box beside her. She had several small bottles of formula, which she\u2019d have to feed him during the day.</p><p>Cliff said that if the meetings ended early, he\u2019d come and pick up Beau, but he wasn\u2019t making any promises. She figured she\u2019d be stuck with the puppy all day.</p><p>Naturally Beau had everyone on the library staff wrapped around his tiny paw the moment she carried him into the building.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want to feed him?\u201d she asked. If she could arrange for someone else to do it, all the better.</p><p>Every single employee volunteered. She let them work out a schedule as she retreated to her office and assumed her tasks for the day. Writing the email newsletter that went out to patrons every Monday morning was at the top of her list.</p> <p>Beth phoned shortly after the library opened. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going. Cliff named him Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>So Beth had been in contact with Cliff. If Grace was a paranoid kind of person, she\u2019d wonder if those two were teaming up against her. More than likely Beth had phoned the house and Cliff had answered, then simply forgotten to mention the call.</p><p>\u201cHave you weighed Beau lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. Cliff did, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember his weight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>Beth asked a few additional questions, but Grace was no more helpful with those than she\u2019d been with the first one. Cliff had taken on nearly all Beau-related duties and that was how Grace intended to keep it.</p><p>Once she was off the phone, she went to check with the children\u2019s librarian regarding story hour that Friday afternoon. She needed the information for her newsletter.</p><p>As she walked toward the children\u2019s section, she noticed several people smiling in her direction. She didn\u2019t think anything of it until she looked back. Beau was trotting after her as if he were her shadow.</p><p>Grace stopped and so did Beau. He sat on his haunches and stared up at her, his tail wagging. Ignoring him, she moved forward purposely. Beau ran after her, his small legs hardly able to keep up.</p><p>Finally she couldn\u2019t stand it a minute longer. Crouching down, she picked him up and cradled him in her arms. He licked her hand, then reached for her face.</p><p>She raised her chin out of his range. \u201cI am not going to love you, no matter what you do,\u201d she insisted. \u201cDon\u2019t even try, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Beau whimpered as if to disagree.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find you a good home,\u201d she said, stroking his soft fur. \u201cA family with lots of children for you to play with. That\u2019s what you need\u2014a family with children. You don\u2019t want to live with Cliff and me. We won\u2019t feel like playing chase or throwing a Frisbee or doing any of the other things you\u2019d love. It\u2019s for your own good. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Beau didn\u2019t, because he licked her hand again.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Teri Polgar was enjoying her first peaceful moment of the day. She sat in the most comfortable chair in the family room, rested her feet on the matching ottoman, leaned back and closed her eyes.</p><p>The triplets were all asleep and, after the morning she\u2019d had, Teri was ready for a nap herself. Friends and family claimed that if anyone could handle a multiple birth, she could. It was a nice compliment, and she took it as such, although she was beginning to doubt the high opinion they had of her abilities.</p><p>Bobby and James were off for the next few days meeting with the video game people in L.A. Bobby was a huge help with their sons, and of course Gabrielle, their nanny, was, too. Still, the major part of the triplets\u2019 care fell to her. Other than quick trips to buy groceries, Teri couldn\u2019t even remember when she\u2019d last ventured out of the house. As for \u201cgirl time\u201d\u2014it\u2019d been practically nonexistent. Her hair needed to be cut and her fingernails were a mess.</p><p>She missed Rachel, although they\u2019d talked a few days ago\u2014for the first time in ages. Rachel had described her situation\u2014her housemate and the temporary position she\u2019d taken with the shipyard. That girl must like living on the edge because she was definitely not in her right mind to be living with Nate Olsen. Teri could only imagine what Bruce would say once he found out. Well, she wasn\u2019t going to be the one to tell him.</p><p>Bruce Peyton. Teri felt like slapping him silly.</p><p>Honestly\u2014letting a thirteen-year-old dictate his life. How crazy was that? Teri knew what poor Rachel had endured in the months that led up to her moving out. She certainly didn\u2019t blame her. In Teri\u2019s opinion, Rachel deserved a medal for putting up with that spoiled brat.</p><p>Then, last week, just when things seemed promising\u2014because Bruce was seeing a counselor and Jolene appeared to be softening\u2014everything had blown up in Rachel\u2019s face. Jolene had gotten sick and Bruce had to hurry home. But Bruce soon discovered that this so-called illness had been self-inflicted. He found an empty bottle of ipecac in the garbage and confronted his daughter. He\u2019d emailed Rachel, and Rachel had subsequently told Teri. This marriage wasn\u2019t looking good. Not good at all.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Teri bounded to her feet with more energy than she\u2019d realized she had. If whoever it was woke any of the triplets...</p><p>Bruce stood on the porch.</p><p>\u201cBruce?\u201d She was too surprised to say any more. Then she added, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to talk to you about Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Teri shook her head, unwilling to let him in. This was Rachel\u2019s worst fear, that Bruce would ask Teri for information. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should,\u201d she said bluntly. She\u2019d vowed she wouldn\u2019t supply Bruce with any of the details Rachel had so recently and reluctantly shared. Not until Rachel had the chance to tell him herself, which she\u2019d fully intended to do until she\u2019d heard about this latest trick of Jolene\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI have something I want you to give Rachel,\u201d he pleaded, still on the porch.</p><p>His sad eyes did her in. Teri had always been a sucker for sad eyes. She\u2019d learned more quickly than her sister had, however. Christie\u2019s heart had been broken more times than a carton of eggs, usually over some down-on-his-luck loser. Christie did eventually learn; it just took her longer.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you can come in,\u201d she said, not very graciously. Stepping aside, she gestured into the house, then led him into the family room. It was far enough away that they wouldn\u2019t disturb the triplets, but at the same time she could hear them if they cried. That was especially important, since Gabrielle had the night off.</p><p>She motioned toward the sofa, which Bruce sank into.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, not bothering with small talk.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d Bruce admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say you do.\u201d However, Bruce needed more help than she could give him. She hoped he was continuing to see the counselor.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI really blew it with Rachel, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>No point in answering that. Bruce already knew he was in trouble with his wife.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what happened last Saturday?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cI was beginning to think Rachel might be willing to move back home. Then the three of us could all go to the counselor together. We need to work on being a family, and Rachel living somewhere else complicates everything.\u201d</p><p>Teri couldn\u2019t even manage an encouraging smile for fear she\u2019d blurt out her opinion, which she was sure Bruce wouldn\u2019t appreciate. As far as she was concerned, Jolene should be grounded until she turned thirty or wised up, whichever came first. Teri felt the girl would see the light far more quickly that way.</p><p>Bruce apparently thought the best approach was to attempt reason. What a joke! Reason with a teenager? No wonder their marriage was falling apart.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Rachel in the past week?\u201d Bruce asked with wide-eyed hopefulness.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Teri mentally zipped her mouth shut. She refused to divulge a single detail of their conversation. Not one.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Now, that was tricky. \u201cAll right...I guess.\u201d</p><p>Bruce leaned forward. \u201cWe had dinner two weeks ago and everything went so well that we started talking on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Teri knew that, too, but didn\u2019t respond. Rachel would never forgive her, and this was her closest, dearest friend in the world. Well, other than her sister. Rachel had entrusted her with this secret, which Teri vowed she would keep to herself. Not even Bobby knew.</p><p>\u201cBut after last weekend, she won\u2019t answer my calls anymore,\u201d Bruce concluded.</p><p>She\u2019d missed a whole section of what he\u2019d been saying, which was just fine. The less she heard, the better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>She clamped her teeth tightly together. If Bruce was worried, he didn\u2019t have anyone to blame but himself. How he could\u2019ve been so oblivious to Jolene\u2019s manipulations for so long would forever remain a mystery.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I want you to give Rachel something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He stood and took a wad of bills out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou want to give her money?\u201d He thought that was how he\u2019d win back his wife? Even Bobby, with his chess brain, wouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything so...so dumb. And he\u2019d had some prize ideas in his time, adorable though he was.</p><p>\u201cShe must be low on cash,\u201d Bruce explained. \u201cSo, would you give this to her for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019s low on cash?\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers, and Teri quickly looked away, afraid he\u2019d read something in her expression that she didn\u2019t intend to tell him. \u201cI know she\u2019s working but she\u2019s also paying rent,\u201d he said, \u201cand there have to be additional expenses. I just feel I should be helping her financially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her about this, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she refuses to discuss money with me\u2014or anything else.\u201d</p><p>She murmured a few noncommittal words.</p><p>\u201cI do know she\u2019s working,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut not where. I called every salon in the Kitsap area looking for her.\u201d</p><p>Teri gave him high grades for trying. She still hadn\u2019t taken the money, although he continued to extend it to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to be sure she has vitamins, good food\u2014stuff like that. She might not want to talk to me, but I\u2019d feel better if I knew she had the things she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand why she\u2019s upset, but I feel responsible for her and the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Teri said without censure.</p><p>\u201cSo, would you give this to Rachel for me? Please?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Teri accepted the cash. She was about to suggest he buy something for the baby, which would go a long way toward convincing his wife that he was serious. Again, she managed to suppress any comment. She had to carefully weigh every word she spoke. No offers of help. No advice. No information.</p><p>\u201cWhen you talk to her,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cwould you mention how much I love her? Tell her I\u2019m still going to the counselor and that Jolene has agreed to meet him.\u201d</p> <p>Now this was promising news. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Teri.\u201d That was all he said, but the gratitude in his eyes, the hope and longing, almost made her cry.</p><p>After Bruce left, Teri stood by the window and watched him pull away. As soon as his car was out of sight, she rushed to the phone and called Rachel\u2019s cell, which went straight to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cRach, it\u2019s Teri. Call me ASAP. Bruce just stopped by the house.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, the return call came. Her friend didn\u2019t even say hello. \u201cDid you let him in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Teri said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been rude to slam the door in his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want? You didn\u2019t tell him anything?\u201d</p><p>The worry in her voice made Teri regret that she hadn\u2019t immediately set Rachel at ease. \u201cNo, nothing. I swear he doesn\u2019t know a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in relief.</p><p>\u201cCan you come by this afternoon? Bobby\u2019s away and I could use the company.\u201d</p><p>Rachel hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cBesides, Bruce gave me something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Rachel\u2019s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>\u201cYup, but I\u2019m not saying what it is. You\u2019ll have to come over here.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, Rachel did.</p><p>Teri hugged her and practically dragged her into the foyer. \u201cGabrielle\u2019s out and we only have about thirty minutes before the boys wake up.\u201d The triplets had started to teethe and Teri\u2019s life wasn\u2019t her own anymore.</p><p>Rachel followed her into the kitchen and Teri began preparing a cheese and cracker plate with apple slices and grapes. She could use a snack herself, and this was a good excuse to feed her friend. She\u2019d forced herself not to tell Bruce that she was worried Rachel wasn\u2019t getting enough fruit and vegetables or high-quality protein. From the tidbits Rachel had dropped, Teri surmised that she dined out alone two or three nights a week, which probably meant fast food. That couldn\u2019t be the best thing for Rachel or the pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cYou said Bruce left something for me,\u201d Rachel began.</p><p>She sat on the bar stool and propped her elbows on the counter. Teri had washed the grapes and sliced two apples; now she was cubing the cheese and arranging it on the platter. Only about half the cheddar found its way to the plate. The other half seemed to automatically end up in her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, offering the plate to Rachel, who reached for a piece of apple and speared some cheese.</p><p>\u201cBruce?\u201d she prompted before taking a bite.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, Bruce.\u201d Teri dug in the hip pocket of her jeans and brought out the wad of cash.</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to contribute to your care and the baby\u2019s. He loves you. He\u2019s feeling guilty and miserable and lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Teri pantomimed locking her lips. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t say a word. I told you I wouldn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou should take the money,\u201d Teri urged. She set it on the counter, then crossed her arms. \u201cHe looked pretty broken, Rach.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t say anything at first. \u201cDid he talk about what happened last Saturday?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cA little. But he also said he\u2019s been seeing the counselor\u2014and Jolene agreed to go.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s head jerked up. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...for one time, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded, but she didn\u2019t seem too encouraged. \u201cI wonder what Bruce had to promise to get her to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t promise her anything.\u201d He hadn\u2019t really said, but Teri got the impression that Jolene hadn\u2019t been given a choice.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Bruce must have bribed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>A baby\u2019s cry came from down the hall, soon followed by a second and a third. Teri sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Christie?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>Now that James and Christie were married, her sister lived in the apartment above the garage with her husband.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with James. You remember how it is when you\u2019re first married. They\u2019re constantly together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember,\u201d Rachel whispered. \u201cUnfortunately, the honeymoon for Bruce and me didn\u2019t last nearly long enough.\u201d</p><p>Rachel counted the money. Five crisp one-hundred-dollar bills. She put them back on the counter. \u201cPlease return it to him for me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and Teri knew instinctively that she was lying.</p><p>\u201cRachel, don\u2019t be unnecessarily stubborn. Bruce wants you to have this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cTell him to spend it on the counselor for him and Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cYou can put that box in the master bedroom,\u201d Lori Wyse told her brother-in-law, pointing the way, which was silly. Mack owned the duplex and knew exactly where the master bedroom was.</p><p>He disappeared down the hallway as she started to unpack the dishes, setting them in a cupboard in the compact kitchen. The duplex was smaller than their apartment had been. Nevertheless, it would serve their needs nicely.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s it,\u201d Mack said, hands in his back hip pockets.</p><p>\u201cCan you go with me to turn in the rental truck?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Linc kissed Lori on the cheek as he walked out the door. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be long. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised, although she was determined to get as much unpacked as she could.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d Mary Jo asked, joining her, the baby in her arms. She set Noelle on the kitchen floor, where she was content to play with a large toy rabbit.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Lori wasn\u2019t about to decline such a generous offer. She dragged over the box of pots and pans and showed her sister-in-law where she wanted them placed.</p><p>They worked in silence for a while, with the radio playing softly in the background. \u201cLinc and I are so grateful to get out from under my father\u2019s thumb,\u201d Lori said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done if it wasn\u2019t for you and Mack.\u201d Moving to Seattle was one of their few options, and they were both grateful not to be living in Linc\u2019s family home with his two younger brothers.</p><p>\u201cThis helps me and Mack, too.\u201d</p><p>Lori didn\u2019t know Mary Jo well yet, but she felt they\u2019d already become friends. Mary Jo sat on the kitchen floor and reached for a second box. \u201cDo you want these bowls down here or in the cupboard above the dishwasher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbove the dishwasher,\u201d Lori told her.</p><p>Noelle threw her rabbit aside and yawned loudly.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s nap time,\u201d Lori said. Come to think of it, she was tired, too. Linc had left the apartment to pick up the truck before six that morning. But they\u2019d been awake since four, finishing the last of the packing and cleaning.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby girl,\u201d Mary Jo said, scooping up the toy, then bending to retrieve her daughter. \u201cLet me change your diaper and put you down for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sleeps that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost every afternoon. She still takes a morning nap, too, but she\u2019ll outgrow those pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>Lori knew she had a lot to learn about babies. She and Linc had talked about starting a family and had decided to wait a couple of years. As newlyweds, they were still getting used to living with each other and to the demands and compromises of married life. They\u2019d weathered a couple of challenges in the past year, thanks largely to her father. Leonard Bellamy refused to give Linc the opportunity to prove himself and had gone out of his way to sabotage every effort Linc made.</p><p>His attitude infuriated Lori. Linc was a decent, honest, hardworking man. Her father should thank God that she\u2019d married a man as wonderful as Lincoln Wyse. Leonard was determined to control her life and she wouldn\u2019t let him. Because of that he was punishing Linc and, through Linc, her.</p><p>When she\u2019d phoned home and severed her relationship with her family, Linc felt she\u2019d overreacted. It was true that she\u2019d acted on impulse, but she\u2019d meant every word.</p><p>Linc arrived home just as she finished sorting out the silverware. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re making good progress,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat amazes me is how much stuff I\u2019ve accumulated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty shocking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Linc slipped his arms around her from behind and buried his face in her neck. \u201cDo you think we could initiate our new home tonight?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a distinct possibility,\u201d Lori whispered back, her hands covering his.</p><p>There was a polite knock at the open front door.</p><p>Instantly Linc dropped his arms. They both turned to find Kate Bellamy standing on the other side with a small gift bag in her hand.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lori said, forgetting for the moment that she was no longer speaking to her family.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by the apartment and the neighbor told me where you\u2019d moved,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI brought you a small housewarming gift.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be waiting for an invitation to step inside. Lori was too stunned to react.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bellamy,\u201d Linc said, taking charge. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d He pushed aside a series of empty boxes, clearing a path for Kate. She made her way to the small table in the breakfast nook, where he pulled out a chair for her.</p><p>Lori was uncertain of what to say. She\u2019d stood up to her family, and pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to back down. Still, this was her mother; she couldn\u2019t very well ask her to leave. Especially since her real problem was with her father...</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee or tea?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve unpacked the kitchen?\u201d Kate asked, eyeing the cardboard boxes stacked against a wall.</p><p>\u201cI know where the tea bags are and I can boil water,\u201d Lori said. Mary Jo had unboxed the pots and pans, so she knew exactly where to find one.</p><p>Her mother grinned. \u201cI taught you well,\u201d she said in a joking voice.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact you did,\u201d Linc said smoothly. \u201cLori obviously picked up her cooking skills from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Linc, you\u2019d been eating your brothers\u2019 cooking. Anything was an improvement over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jo cooked, too,\u201d he was quick to tell her.</p><p>Ignoring him, Lori said to her mother, \u201cActually, I could stir fry crabgrass and Linc wouldn\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when your father and I were first married,\u201d Kate said with a wistful look. \u201cI was a terrible cook. I ruined almost every meal and yet he ate all those atrocious, burned dinners and said they were delicious. That\u2019s what love will do for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lori set the kettle on to boil and found three mugs. A canister in the cupboard held the tea bags.</p><p>\u201cOpen your gift,\u201d her mother said, handing her the package.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do this,\u201d she said as she took the bag. The pink tissue paper inside was folded into peaks. Her mother had always been a stylish woman whose sense of elegance and beauty transformed everything around her. Since those early days of her marriage, Kate had learned how to cook, and every meal was as lovely to look at as it was to eat. Beauty had become her watchword in all things. Even now, dressed in slacks and a sweater with a rain jacket, Kate resembled a model. She was tall and slim and Lori had rarely seen her without perfect hair and makeup.</p><p>Lori wished she could be more like her mother, although she believed she\u2019d inherited her interest in fashion from Kate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something small,\u201d Kate murmured.</p><p>Lori pulled out the paper and discovered a handheld blender. She didn\u2019t have one. \u201cOh, Mom, this is great. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love mine, and I hoped you hadn\u2019t bought one yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re always so thoughtful.\u201d She knew her father wouldn\u2019t have approved of this. \u201cDoes Dad know you bought a gift for us?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s silence told her what she\u2019d already figured out.</p> <p>After an awkward moment, Kate raised her chin and announced, \u201cYour father and I are no longer speaking.\u201d</p><p>Lori sat down on one of the kitchen chairs. \u201cYou and Dad aren\u2019t talking?\u201d The kettle whistled and Linc removed it from the burner.</p><p>He went to stand behind Lori and placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with Lori and me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her mother looked at them, then nodded. \u201cWe all know your father is a stubborn man.\u201d</p><p>Lori snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce he gets an idea in his head, no one can convince him he\u2019s wrong. No one.\u201d</p> <p>Lori studied her mother closely. Kate wasn\u2019t an emotional woman but tears filled her eyes. She blinked them away.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you phoned last month and told your father you were finished with the family...well, as you might assume, I got upset. I wasn\u2019t about to lose my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, I was just angry. I probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything until I\u2019d calmed down.\u201d She did regret distressing her mother, who was invariably loving and supportive. Not only that, Kate had accepted Linc, despite Leonard\u2019s decrees.</p><p>\u201cYour father refuses to be reasonable. It makes no sense. He wasn\u2019t a rich man when we met\u2014he had to prove himself to my father and he did. Yet he won\u2019t give Linc the same chance my family gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that Dad\u2019s being so unreasonable. He thinks he knows what\u2019s best for me, but he doesn\u2019t. I made a wise choice in my husband, and nothing Dad says or does is going to change my mind.\u201d Lori reached up and pressed her hand on Linc\u2019s.</p><p>Kate lowered her gaze. \u201cAfter your call, your father said good riddance and he was cutting you out of the will.\u201d</p><p>Lori laughed. This was a threat he\u2019d made more than once through the years. She was tired of him holding that over her head, trying to manipulate her. \u201cIf that\u2019s what he wants, Mom, I don\u2019t care. I have everything I\u2019ll ever need or want right here with Linc.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband bent forward and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI told your father he was being ridiculous and that if he cut you out of the will, I was leaving.\u201d She paused and inhaled deeply. \u201cUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Lori wasn\u2019t sure what her mother was saying. \u201cAre you telling me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her mother cut her off. \u201cYour father called our attorney and, while he was talking to Matt, I packed my bag. He thought I was just making a point and that I\u2019d be back the next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not with Dad?\u201d If she hadn\u2019t already been sitting, Lori would have collapsed into a chair from shock.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, your father and I are no longer talking. Or...living together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you living?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cWith my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Hilary?\u201d Lori asked.</p><p>Kate nodded. \u201cMy sister\u2019s a widow,\u201d she explained to Linc, \u201cand the two of us have been enjoying ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Lori asked. Her father relied on Kate for everything. Lori couldn\u2019t imagine him surviving one day on his own, let alone weeks.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Kate said, her back straight and her chin raised. \u201cThat\u2019s his concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had any contact with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Undoubtedly her father blamed Linc for this, too, along with everything else. \u201cIs there anything I can do for you, Mom?\u201d Lori asked. She felt dreadful that things had deteriorated this far.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Kate repeated. \u201cGood grief, no. As I said, your father is being completely unreasonable. I\u2019ve stood by him all these years, backed him even when I disagreed, but this time he went too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, I feel awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you? Anyone who spends half an hour with Linc knows he\u2019s everything you said. Even more apparent is how much he loves you. While your father might not like Linc because he isn\u2019t some high-priced attorney or bank president, he should be grateful our daughter\u2019s found a man who loves her and makes her happy.\u201d</p><p>Lori couldn\u2019t have put it any better herself. \u201cI am happy married to Linc. Happier than I ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry our marriage has caused such a problem in your family,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>Kate dismissed that. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a problem for anyone other than Leonard.\u201d</p><p>Linc nodded slowly. \u201cWhat would it take for you to move back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would it take?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cWell, first Leonard would have to apologize to you for everything he\u2019s done to undermine your business. Then he\u2019d have to apologize to our daughter for his high-handed behavior. And last...last, he\u2019d have to apologize to me.\u201d</p><p>Lori knew it would be difficult to get one apology out of her father, never mind three. None of this was likely to happen.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Hilary and I get along just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Her mother could be just as stubborn as her father. This was a formula for disaster. She was afraid one of them would do something stupid\u2014like file for divorce. Lori didn\u2019t know if she could live with herself if that happened, regardless of the fact that Leonard brought it on himself... Maybe she should\u2019ve given him a chance to meet Linc again, more time to get used to the idea of her marriage. And yet, she reminded herself, she was an adult with the right to make her own decisions.</p><p>Her mother left shortly afterward, making Lori and Linc promise not to mention her visit to anyone in the family.</p><p>Lori sank into her chair again after walking Kate to her car. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I have to do something,\u201d she told Linc frantically.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think your brother and sister know that your mother\u2019s moved out?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. They would\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Linc nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to phone my father and try to reason with him. All these weeks without Mom... He must be going nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to try.\u201d</p><p>Linc seemed to agree with her. He dragged his chair close to hers and held her free hand while Lori called the family home. To her surprise, her father answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lou Lou?\u201d she asked, shocked that the woman who\u2019d been their housekeeper for more than twenty years didn\u2019t pick up.</p><p>\u201cShe no longer works here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou Lou quit?\u201d</p><p>Her father ignored the question. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad, you know who this is. Lori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori, your daughter,\u201d she said, struggling to hold on to her temper.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have a daughter named Lori.\u201d</p><p>His words felt like a slap in the face. \u201cOkay, Daddy, if that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d She clicked off the phone and hid her face in Linc\u2019s chest.</p><p>His arms came immediately around her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d he whispered, kissing her hair.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she murmured tearfully. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me at the gallery a little after five?\u201d Miranda asked Shirley, keeping an eye on the clock. She needed to leave for work soon.</p><p>\u201cThe gallery?\u201d Shirley repeated. \u201cYou don\u2019t work on Thursdays, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday I do. Will asked me to come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got something he has to do.\u201d He\u2019d mentioned that he and his sister were going to revisit two of the assisted-living complexes they\u2019d recently toured. Miranda assumed that was scheduled for this afternoon, although why he couldn\u2019t have told her earlier...</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that Will Jefferson takes a lot for granted as far as you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>Miranda agreed, but now wasn\u2019t the time to discuss it. They could do that over dinner. \u201cSo, can you stop by around five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Disconnecting, she tossed her phone in her purse and headed out the door. If there was one thing she hated, it was being late.</p><p>When she arrived at the gallery, she found Will sitting in the showroom, working on his laptop. Their relationship had been a bit uncomfortable ever since they\u2019d kissed. Now they were both making an effort to pretend nothing had happened.</p><p>Only it had. And ignoring the events of that afternoon\u2014it\u2019d been Halloween afternoon\u2014wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Part of the problem was that Miranda wasn\u2019t doing a good job of hiding her feelings for Will. She wasn\u2019t usually shy; she preferred to discuss differences, talk things over and avoid miscommunication. With Will, she hadn\u2019t done that, but couldn\u2019t explain why. She was just being silly, she told herself. He was a sophisticated man and this would hardly be the first time a woman had fallen for him. Really, what did she have to fear? Well, other than the fact that she\u2019d look like an idiot. He\u2019d probably find her attraction to him highly amusing. Judging by his infatuation with petite, charming Shirley, Miranda clearly wasn\u2019t his type. She wondered about his marriage\u2014and his divorce\u2014but he\u2019d never spoken about his ex-wife and she\u2019d never asked.</p><p>Will smiled when he saw her. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate this,\u201d he said.</p><p>Miranda deposited her coat and purse in the back room. \u201cWell, don\u2019t get used to it. I\u2019ve got more to do than be at your beck and call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cMy, my, aren\u2019t we testy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plans this evening,\u201d she said, without enlightening him that those plans involved Shirley Knight. She figured they\u2019d have left by the time he returned from his appointment. Anyway, it was none of his business, although she\u2019d rather let him think she had a date. \u201cI had to cancel my hair appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always have said no, but I\u2019m grateful you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for you,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cIt\u2019s for Charlotte and Ben.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor my mother and stepfather?\u201d he asked, crossing his arms. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said something about going back to a couple of the assisted-living places,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I did. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you most certainly did.\u201d Miranda wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why else would you drag me here on my day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wanted the pleasure of your company.\u201d He grinned. His sexy smile never failed to lower her guard. Unable to meet his eyes without butterflies swarming in her stomach, Miranda looked away.</p> <p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about your hair appointment. Go ahead and keep it. I\u2019ll change my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little late now.\u201d She snorted. A customer walked in the door and Will gestured for her to do the talking. Matt Langley, a local attorney, wanted a birthday gift for his wife, telling Miranda that Olivia Griffin had recommended her brother\u2019s gallery. Miranda sold him a painting, the most expensive one they currently had.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re good,\u201d Will said admiringly after Matt left.</p><p>Miranda didn\u2019t respond. She\u2019d already started to make arrangements to have the painting delivered to the attorney\u2019s home Saturday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you take a compliment?\u201d Will asked with a slight edge.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I can. It just depends on who\u2019s giving it.\u201d</p> <p>Will grumbled under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d she asked in a sharp voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was it?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you find it so difficult to simply say thank you. That\u2019s what most people do when they receive a compliment. But not you. Oh, no, that would be far too conciliatory. Why are you constantly fighting with me, Miranda? Am I really such a terrible employer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted with some reluctance.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you mean it. Listen, it was a mistake to call you in on your day off. Go. I\u2019ll be fine. I can rearrange my dentist appointment and my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dentist appointment! You called me in because you have a dentist appointment?\u201d He knew which days she had off and obviously he\u2019d scheduled this one knowing full well she\u2019d have to come in.</p> <p>He turned his back on her and walked into his office. \u201cIt\u2019s at three\u2014after Olivia and I see the people at Stanford Suites.\u201d</p><p>So he did have an appointment at the assisted-living place. Why hadn\u2019t he just said so? she thought irritably. What kind of game was he playing?</p><p>Miranda followed him into the other room. \u201cI\u2019m here now. You might as well go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll reschedule with Olivia and the dentist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d stay.\u201d</p><p>He kept his hand on the phone. \u201cLike I said, you could\u2019ve told me no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you leave everything to the last possible minute, as if I don\u2019t have any plans or responsibilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty as charged. You\u2019re right. I should\u2019ve asked you sooner. But the appointment at Stanford Suites was on fairly short notice. And the dentist had a cancellation. Still, I apologize.\u201d He seemed to think he could charm his way back into her good graces.</p><p>Miranda reviewed their short conversation earlier that afternoon. Will had called her at home around noon and, despite everything, she\u2019d been excited to hear from him. He\u2019d asked if it was possible to work on her day off for a few hours. She\u2019d said yes and even been eager to do so. She\u2019d overreacted just now because...because she needed to keep her distance, emotionally and otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me off?\u201d he asked, sounding half amused and half surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming down with a fever, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied tersely. \u201cLike you\u2019d care.\u201d</p><p>He immediately sighed. \u201cOh, good. You\u2019re back to normal.\u201d</p><p>He was right; snapping at him was her normal reaction\u2014especially since their kiss...or rather, kisses. Until that very moment, she hadn\u2019t really understood what she was doing or why. She wondered if Will had reached the same conclusion. Probably not. After the incident on Halloween she\u2019d redoubled her efforts to hide her attraction, from him if not herself.</p><p>\u201cKeep your appointments,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve already rearranged my schedule to accommodate yours, so there\u2019s no need to cancel now.\u201d She hurried out of his office and avoided him until he left. They exchanged a curt goodbye and that was it.</p><p>Will was away from the gallery for two and a half hours, arriving back at quarter to four, but he might as well have been invisible. He went directly into his office and shut himself in. After closing the gallery a few minutes early, she knocked at his door, hoping to at least clear the air before their next encounter.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Will called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting ready to go.\u201d She wanted to escape as soon as Shirley arrived, sparing them both an awkward moment. Maybe they should just have met at the restaurant....</p><p>He glanced at his watch, apparently surprised at the time, then nodded. \u201cThank you for coming in this afternoon,\u201d he said formally.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI, uh, wanted to be sure everything is okay between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d Will asked in congenial tones.</p><p>\u201cNo reason, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He stood, leveled another of those killer smiles directly at her and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d she asked, leaning forward to extend her own.</p><p>Will\u2019s handshake was firm and solid. His smile didn\u2019t waver as his eyes connected with hers. \u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d she echoed, but her voice sounded odd.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to call you into work on your days off. I apologize again. I should\u2019ve talked to you much earlier. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Miranda knew very well what he was thinking. Will was thinking of himself, the same way he had most of his adult life. No, she admitted to herself, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. He was capable of very generous behavior. Only it was dangerous\u2014to her sanity and well-being\u2014to view Will as anything but self-centered and self-absorbed. Somehow she managed to nod and smile.</p><p>Before she could leave his office and shut the door, Shirley arrived at the gallery. Will brightened the instant he saw her, becoming animated and happy. \u201cShirley, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d He clasped her hand in both of his and couldn\u2019t seem to take his eyes off her.</p><p>Miranda had to look away for fear he\u2019d notice her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Miranda,\u201d Shirley said as she withdrew her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Larry?\u201d Will asked, ignoring the comment.</p><p>\u201cLondon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you?\u201d The sympathy in his voice made Miranda grit her teeth.</p><p>\u201cTanni\u2019s still in high school,\u201d Shirley reminded him. \u201cAnd I have work to complete here.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded with that same unctuous sympathy.</p><p>\u201cLarry often travels to England. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to join him next time,\u201d Shirley went on to say.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could walk down to D.D.\u2019s on the Cove for dinner,\u201d Miranda suggested, purposely turning the subject away from Larry\u2019s absence. \u201cIt\u2019s close, and that way we won\u2019t need to worry about finding a parking spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going for dinner?\u201d Will asked, arching his eyebrows slightly. He seemed to be expecting an invitation. He moved away from Shirley to stand beside Miranda.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d she said. \u201cJust the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls\u2019 night out?\u201d</p><p>Shirley nodded.</p><p>Changing tactics, Will rested one hand on Miranda\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWell, then, have fun, you two.\u201d</p><p>Miranda shrugged off his hand and glared at Will. Whatever he thought he was doing, she refused to be part of it.</p><p>Shirley started out the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d Miranda told her. She waited until the gallery door was completely closed before she whirled around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Will asked with a look of innocence.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you put your hand on my shoulder?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re so upset about. It didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to make Shirley jealous, which is ridiculous. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, she\u2019s married to Larry Knight and has no feelings for you whatsoever. I realize it\u2019s difficult for your fragile ego to accept that any woman would choose a man other than you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d choose me,\u201d Will said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...not true.\u201d She could feel a hot blush crawling up her face.</p><p>\u201cIs it so strange that you\u2019re attracted to me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI will not acknowledge anything so asinine,\u201d she said, turning away from him. This was one of the few times in her life when she couldn\u2019t be truthful, didn\u2019t even want to be. The sooner she made her escape, the better. She hoped the November air would cool the embarrassed color heating her face.</p><p>\u201cMiranda.\u201d He whispered her name.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she barked, refusing to turn around.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about the day you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d she said, not adding that he\u2019d kissed her, too. She kept her back to him, her hand on the doorknob, eager to get outside where Shirley was waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you have,\u201d she muttered sarcastically. And, no doubt, laughing his head off, too.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d he said, his voice low and seductive. He placed his hand on her shoulder again, stroking it gently. \u201cWe do need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s already been said. It\u2019s a dead subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, maybe, but not me.\u201d</p><p>That did it. She whirled back toward him. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me, Will. You need me because your ego\u2019s taken a hit. What better way to prove to Shirley that you\u2019re over her. An affair with her best friend would tell her that, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He frowned but didn\u2019t contradict her.</p><p>\u201cYou obviously assume I\u2019m an easy target...that I\u2019m so starved for affection I\u2019d willingly fall into bed with you, even though you\u2019d break my heart without a second thought. But you\u2019re wrong, Will. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour kiss said otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you\u2019ve misread the situation.

Much more of this and she\u2019d end up taking a swing at him. \u201cDo you honestly believe you\u2019re going to persuade me with...with lies? If you say anything else, I swear I will walk out this door and never return. That isn\u2019t an empty threat, Will. I mean it.\u201d</p> <p>A pained look came over him and he nodded. Then, to Miranda\u2019s astonishment, he stepped closer, held her face between his hands and kissed her.</p><p>When he broke it off, she nearly stumbled backward in both shock and wonder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I quit,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I expect you here by ten tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Four</p> <p>The Pot Belly Deli was decorated for Thanksgiving. Gloria glanced around at the dried cornstalk and gourd arrangements, nervously sipping her juice as she waited for Chad. He\u2019d asked for this meeting, and she\u2019d agreed, but she still wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea.</p><p>Since the ultrasound, there\u2019d been no direct contact between them, although they\u2019d exchanged a number of emails over the past few weeks. These were generally short messages in which she answered his questions about the pregnancy and her health.</p><p>Gloria resisted the urge to ask him about Joni. Every time she thought about the two of them together, her stomach twisted. But she was the one who\u2019d rejected him, so she couldn\u2019t blame him for dating someone else. Sometimes she didn\u2019t understand her own actions and could only regret what she\u2019d done. It was because of her shame and uncertainty that she\u2019d run out of his bedroom last summer, after spending the night with him. Then, when she\u2019d gone to tell him about the baby\u2014and perhaps even try to reconcile\u2014it was too late.</p><p>The door opened and Chad came inside. He looked around until he saw Gloria, smiling tentatively when he did.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said as he approached her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet his eyes but gestured for him to take a seat.</p> <p>The waitress stepped up to the table with a coffeepot and he righted his mug. \u201cWould you like a menu?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, just coffee.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and left them alone.</p><p>Now that they were together, Gloria\u2019s nervousness grew more intense. Nausea attacked her stomach, and her hands shook.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one to say so. Roy had said that pregnant women really did have a glow about them, adding that she was more beautiful every time he saw her. Her biological father didn\u2019t hand out compliments casually and his comment had taken her aback. She hardly knew how to respond to Chad\u2019s words any more than she had Roy\u2019s.</p><p>Finally she managed to say, \u201cThanks.\u201d And left it at that.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind standing?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d She pushed back her chair and stood.</p><p>His eyes rested on her stomach, and a slow smile spread across his face. A warm, wholehearted smile that said Chad was going to love this baby. Seeing his reaction nearly brought her to tears.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, extending his hand toward her.</p><p>Gloria came closer and he pressed his palm against the small bump.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel him moving yet?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She sat back down and reached for her drink to hide how moved she was by what he\u2019d done. She noticed that his hand shook as he picked up his coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cHave you given any more thought to the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately make any suggestions or comment on other names he liked, she asked, \u201cDo you want to share your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I feel it would be best to wait until you make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout giving the baby up for adoption. Have you decided?\u201d</p><p>Gloria held her arms protectively around her stomach. \u201cI think adoption is a viable choice. I was adopted into a loving home with parents who badly wanted a child.\u201d</p><p>Chad lowered his eyes, as if he couldn\u2019t tolerate the idea, but didn\u2019t want to argue with her.</p><p>\u201cMy mother gave me up because she was still a teenager with several years of school ahead of her. Roy didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. But thanks to your father, I know about this baby.\u201d Chad stiffened, apparently unable to keep quiet any longer. \u201cAnd I\u2019m entitled to a say in what happens to my child.\u201d He emphasized the last two words. \u201cIf you decide you don\u2019t want him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s what adoption is?\u201d Gloria asked. \u201cDo you really believe a mother who gives her child to another family acts out of selfishness? Do you think that\u2019s what Corrie did with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved me enough to offer me a better life with two parents who yearned for a child of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur baby has two parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery baby has two parents, Chad,\u201d she said, hoping he\u2019d see the humor in his statement.</p><p>\u201cTrue. Every child has two parents, biologically speaking. What I meant is that times are different from when you were born. A father has legal rights and I intend to pursue mine. If you prefer to give the baby up for adoption, then I think it\u2019s only fair to tell you that I\u2019d take him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a single father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your hours at the hospital? Who\u2019d look after him while you\u2019re working? You make it sound easy. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a doctor. I can pretty well guarantee I\u2019ve handled more babies than you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have an advantage over most men,\u201d she had to agree. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll be like to spend sleepless nights if the baby\u2019s colicky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was an intern and a medical resident. I know about sleepless nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want our baby, Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d she said, gazing down at her hands. \u201cI do, too. I\u2019ve decided to raise him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Chad sounded disappointed and that disturbed her even more.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted him all to yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you did.\u201d He nodded. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll need to work out a parenting plan. My son will know his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still dating Joni?\u201d she blurted out, unable to resist.</p><p>His eyes locked with hers. \u201cThat has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Forgive me for being so blunt but what will our son call Joni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? We\u2019ll figure that out when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t like it, but she couldn\u2019t say so without sounding churlish. Finally she conceded, \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his coffee.</p><p>She sipped her juice.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t stand the silence anymore, she said, \u201cYou asked to see me. Was there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so eager to get away? Are you meeting someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating someone?\u201d He frowned, as if the possibility hadn\u2019t occurred to him until now.</p><p>\u201cLike I said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your business,\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>Clearly the thought unsettled him. Well, good. She hoped it did. Chad didn\u2019t like the idea of her seeing someone else any more than she enjoyed the knowledge that he was dating another woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello.\u201d Roy stood in front of their table, shocking Gloria. She hadn\u2019t seen him arrive.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you both,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Gloria wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cUh, hi,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHello, Roy.\u201d Chad stood and the two men shook hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Gloria asked.</p><p>\u201cTroy Davis and I come here for coffee once a week. I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Gloria knew the sheriff and her father were good friends, but she hadn\u2019t realized they routinely met at this restaurant. Although she worked in the sheriff\u2019s office, she wasn\u2019t privy to Troy Davis\u2019s schedule.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I join you for a few minutes?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Without waiting for an invitation, he pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you together.\u201d He looked from one to the other, as though assuming they\u2019d enlighten him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do this often,\u201d Chad explained.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, this is the first time we\u2019ve met since the ultrasound,\u201d Gloria added.</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy, please. This is difficult enough.\u201d Her father was making it more so by interfering with their conversation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude or obnoxious, but can one of you tell me what went wrong with your relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get along,\u201d Gloria said, giving him the easy answer.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me you get along just fine,\u201d Roy murmured, \u201cor at least you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is between Gloria and me,\u201d Chad said. \u201cDiscussing it with you isn\u2019t going to solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you want me to butt out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Gloria said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, message received.\u201d Roy stood, smiled down at them and turned away. He took a couple of steps, then turned back. \u201cThe thing is, that boy deserves a family. A mother and a father who\u2019ll love him and raise him to be a fine young man. And...he deserves his grandparents, his aunts and uncles and cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Roy,\u201d Gloria said.</p><p>\u201cMessage received,\u201d Chad said, echoing Roy\u2019s earlier statement.</p><p>Gloria felt she needed to apologize. As soon as Roy was seated at another table, she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. But it might be a good idea if we went somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Gloria nodded. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Wok and Roll is down the street.\u201d</p><p>She remembered that Chad liked Chinese food. The scent of fried food made Gloria feel queasy but she should be fine; she hadn\u2019t thrown up in several weeks. \u201cSure, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They paid and waved an obligatory goodbye to Roy. Then, with his hand under her elbow, Chad escorted her to the Wok and Roll. The moment they walked in the door, Gloria was assaulted by the aroma of spices and frying meat, and her stomach instantly revolted. Taking a deep breath, she grabbed a corner of the front desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGloria?\u201d Chad asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying not to vomit. This shouldn\u2019t be happening anymore, but because of the meeting with Chad, she\u2019d been tense all day. As a result she hadn\u2019t eaten much, which was probably a good thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pale. Do you want to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She dashed to the women\u2019s restroom. Pushing open the stall door, she barely made it inside. Bent over the toilet, she lost the juice she\u2019d managed to drink.</p> <p>When she finished, she turned to discover Chad waiting for her by the sink, holding a wet paper towel. \u201cAre you okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sorry. I didn\u2019t expect that. I should\u2019ve known.\u201d She wiped her mouth and then smiled. \u201cDo you make a habit of walking into women\u2019s restrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when\u2014\u201d He stopped short. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, amending whatever he\u2019d been about to say. \u201cLet me get you home.\u201d</p><p>She obediently followed him out of the restaurant. Her apartment was close to the library and near the waterfront. Chad had been there often enough not to need directions.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay long,\u201d he said when she\u2019d unlocked the door.</p> <p>After she\u2019d rinsed out her mouth again they sat on the sofa, he at one end and she at the other.</p><p>\u201cDoes that happen often?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore... It was just nerves, I guess.\u201d She didn\u2019t explain what she\u2019d been nervous about, but he obviously understood.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept well for several nights either,\u201d Chad confessed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a sad case, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she whispered. It seemed the only place they\u2019d ever been able to communicate was in bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you working today?\u201d Chad asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I took personal leave. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Thursdays off.\u201d</p><p>That made sense, since he\u2019d requested the meeting for this afternoon.</p><p>She tried to hide a yawn. She didn\u2019t succeed and he responded with a yawn of his own. They looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>Chad stood. \u201cI\u2019ll leave and you can nap.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she didn\u2019t want him to go. But she knew instinctively that if she asked him to stay, he wouldn\u2019t. Instead, she got up, too, and reached for his hand. He frowned as she led him toward the hallway, hesitating when he saw her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGloria, where are you taking me?\u201d Then he answered his own question. \u201cYour bed?\u201d He inhaled sharply and said, \u201cI hope you remember that\u2019s what got us into this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nap. All I want you to do is hold me, feel our baby move. Nothing more. We\u2019re both tired and stressed. I want us to sleep. Once we do, we\u2019ll be able to talk and make the decisions we need to make.\u201d</p><p>He stood next to her bed. \u201cYou\u2019re sure this is what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep, Chad. That\u2019s all. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut then I\u2019ve never been able to understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m finding it downright impossible to walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She folded back the covers, removed her shoes and slid beneath the blankets. Rolling onto her side, she turned her back to him and closed her eyes. It took Chad several minutes to join her. He climbed into the bed, fully dressed, and cuddled her spoon fashion. After a moment, he slipped his hand over her side, pressing it against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe baby just moved.\u201d</p><p>Gloria smiled sleepily. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to play soccer, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Now close your eyes and nap.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she heard the deep, even rumble of his breathing, which told her he was asleep. Tired though she was, Gloria stayed awake.</p><p>She\u2019d acknowledged it herself\u2014they\u2019d only ever been able to communicate in bed. Now that they had decisions to make, this seemed the best place for that to happen.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am to be in my own home,\u201d Charlotte said as Ben unlocked the front door of 15 Eagle Crest Avenue. The kitchen had been completely remodeled.</p><p>Olivia exchanged a look with her brother. She had reservations about her mother and Ben returning here, but when she\u2019d broached the subject of moving into assisted living, Charlotte had instantly rejected the idea. Ben hadn\u2019t been keen on it, either, automatically dismissing it as \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d</p><p>So far, none of the places she and Will had checked out had any apartments available, but they\u2019d put their name on a couple of waiting lists. Maybe, when something appropriate came up, Charlotte and Ben would be ready to consider it. Like it or not, eventually they\u2019d have to leave this house. Probably before another year was up.</p><p>\u201cI want to see my new kitchen,\u201d Charlotte said, walking into the house and heading straight to the remodeled room. \u201cOh, my.\u201d She brought her hands to her cheeks. \u201cEverything is so...new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe decided to replace the cupboards,\u201d Olivia reminded her, coming to stand beside her mother.</p><p>\u201cWe did?\u201d Charlotte looked to Ben for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cWe picked out the white oak together,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I remember now.\u201d Charlotte pulled open a couple of drawers, which then slowly glided shut. This was a new feature; unless the drawer was pulled out completely, it would automatically return to the closed position once it was released.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s back exactly the way you left it,\u201d Olivia reassured her. She\u2019d taken great pains to make sure of that. She\u2019d replaced the ruined pots and pans with new ones that were as similar as possible. Charlotte frowned as if she didn\u2019t believe that. \u201cIs everything all right, Mom?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cIt just looks so different... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new stove, too,\u201d Will said, opening the oven door to display the large baking area.</p><p>Slowly, deliberately, Charlotte examined the knobs and studied the burners. \u201cIt looks complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll read over the instruction manual and we\u2019ll learn about it together,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cThat would help.\u201d Every word and movement revealed her hesitation. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m so accustomed to my old stove and this one...well, it looks far too modern for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ben told her. He placed his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I should know about?\u201d Charlotte asked Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYou have a new refrigerator,\u201d Will said, and gestured proudly toward it.</p><p>\u201cBut why? The old one was working fine and it wasn\u2019t damaged in the fire, was it?\u201d</p><p>Will answered. \u201cWe figured you\u2019d want a new one, since all the other appliances are new,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an early Christmas gift. I thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, I am,\u201d Charlotte was quick to tell him. \u201cI\u2019m just used to seeing the old one here. What did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the back porch, Mom,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cFor extra things.\u201d Seeing her mother\u2019s puzzled expression, Olivia added, \u201cCold sodas and beer, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take the new fridge back if you don\u2019t like it,\u201d Will offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was so thoughtful of you... . Of course we\u2019ll keep your gift, Will. I wouldn\u2019t dream of sending it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you, Mom?\u201d Olivia asked. She and Jack would be meeting Grace and Cliff for dinner, but that wasn\u2019t for hours yet.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, everything is fine. It\u2019s so good to be home again.\u201d She rubbed her palms together as her eyes darted about the kitchen. Charlotte had visited the house frequently since the fire, but this was the first time she\u2019d seen everything in place and complete. She walked over to the apple-shaped cookie jar and rested her hand on it. That, at least, was familiar. It\u2019d been around for as long as Olivia could remember. Countless times through the years that jar had held her mother\u2019s home-baked cookies. Luckily it had survived the fire.</p><p>On her way out, Olivia hugged her mother and Ben, and so did Will. Brother and sister left together.</p><p>As soon as the front door closed, Will asked, \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d gone over their plan of action repeatedly. They\u2019d let Ben and Charlotte move back into the house for a while and then bring up the idea of assisted living again. It seemed only fair, despite their fears, to give their mother and Ben an opportunity to adjust to their new surroundings, see how things worked out. Olivia hoped that once they were ready to move, there\u2019d be an opening at one of the better facilities.</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what I was afraid would happen,\u201d Olivia said. They reached their cars, which were parked at the curb.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. The new kitchen\u2019s overwhelmed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid she\u2019ll leave a burner on again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t think Mom will turn on any of the burners unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. She won\u2019t want to cook because she\u2019s unfamiliar with the stove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom not cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That was one of her main objections to moving into assisted living. She still enjoys working in the kitchen.\u201d She\u2019d rejected the idea out of hand and then listed a number of excuses, that being the first.</p><p>\u201cBut she can still cook,\u201d Will said, showing his frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge kitchen at Stanford Suites for anyone who wants to bake or prepare a meal.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d But the person they needed to convince was their mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shared kitchen,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cMom\u2019s used to her own pots and pans and, well, her own kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kitchen is gone,\u201d Will said.</p><p>He was right. The fire had destroyed more than a few cupboards, the walls and flooring. What had once been the heart of their childhood home had become a pile of ashes. In its stead was a sterile room that lacked the familiarity, the memories, of the past sixty years. In many respects Olivia felt the same disappointment her mother did. She wanted everything to go back to the way it was, although that was obviously impossible.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest we do now?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d Olivia didn\u2019t expect it would be easy for Charlotte to make the transition, leaving the only home she\u2019d known all her adult life. \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Will shook his head. He shoved his hands in his pants pockets and shrugged. \u201cThis is hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped Ben would see the wisdom of moving and smooth the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as unsettling for him as it is for Mom,\u201d Olivia commented. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter all the moves he\u2019s made in his navy career, one would think it\u2019d be old hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne would think,\u201d Olivia murmured. \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t want Mom to feel we\u2019re kicking her out of her own home. We can\u2019t force her to leave, nor should we. She has to accept this and she hasn\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of the problem,\u201d Will said, \u201cis that she\u2019s afraid of what\u2019ll happen to the house if she isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>It was a point worth considering. \u201cShe loves this house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first question she asked was if we\u2019d sell it,\u201d Will reminded her, frowning. \u201cEventually we\u2019d have to do that, and I get the feeling that upsets her more than the need to move.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have any option. Renting it out could be a nightmare,\u201d she said half to herself, remembering the troubles Grace had encountered when she rented out her house on Rosewood Lane. Olivia hated the thought of anyone vandalizing her family home, which was exactly what had happened to Grace\u2019s house. No, renting wasn\u2019t an option she wanted to consider.</p><p>\u201cBen might be more amenable to the idea than he\u2019s led us to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Olivia could only hope her brother was right. \u201cDid he say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly, but I could tell how concerned he was when Mom first saw the new stove. He loves Mom, and realized right away how flustered and unsure she is with all these changes.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia nodded; she\u2019d seen the same doubt and hesitation in her mother\u2019s eyes and it had shaken her. Charlotte seemed almost childlike in her reaction to the changes taking place around her.</p><p>\u201cIf you have any ideas, let me know,\u201d Will said. He reached for his car keys.</p><p>\u201cAny plans tomorrow?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. What have you got in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack wants to watch the Seahawks game on TV and you\u2019d be welcome to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect. See you then.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hoped she and Will could continue their conversation the next day. Surely they could come up with a solution. The problem had seemed less immediate while Charlotte and Ben were living with them, since both Olivia and Jack were able to help. Despite various incidents with the laundry and so forth, Olivia had grown accustomed to having her mother close. It was comforting to find Charlotte waiting for her at the end of the day with a cup of tea and one of her many baked treats. Necessary as Olivia knew the transition to an assisted-living environment was, she found it painful. The loss of Charlotte and Ben\u2019s independence, the loss of their familiar surroundings and, most of all, the loss of the person her mother had been... Olivia hated it. And yet she had to be practical and protect their safety and well-being above all else.</p><p>A moment after Olivia got home, Jack pulled into the driveway behind her. He\u2019d been to an AA meeting and, as was his habit afterward, had gone for coffee with his friend and sponsor, Bob Beldon.</p><p>\u201cHow was the meeting?\u201d she asked, walking back to join him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack wrapped his arm around her waist and kissed her. \u201cHow\u2019d everything go with your mother and Ben?\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears, and Jack leaned forward to get a better look at her. \u201cLiv?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside and tell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>The early evening was dreary and overcast, and it reflected how Olivia felt. With his arm around her waist, Jack led her into the house through the back door.</p><p>While he removed his coat, Olivia put on the kettle for tea. This was something her mother had done all her life. Whenever it was time to have a serious discussion, Charlotte would reach for the teakettle and her favorite ceramic teapot with the butterflies painted on it.</p><p>Olivia remembered the day she\u2019d come over to tell her mother that she and Stan were separating. Olivia had been emotional and weepy. That had been the most horrible year of her life, and her mother, teapot in hand, had been a constant source of love and support.</p><p>In a one-year span, Olivia\u2019s oldest son had drowned and her marriage had fallen apart. She didn\u2019t know what she would\u2019ve done if not for her mother and, of course, Grace.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Jack asked gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been standing in front of the stove for five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d Embarrassed, she brushed the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI was just remembering all the talks I had with my mother over tea,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jack guided her toward a chair, then set out two mugs. At the moment Olivia felt incapable of performing even that simple task. Reaching across the table she grabbed a tissue and blew her nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about the day Mom made me tea when Stan and I decided we couldn\u2019t stay married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know exactly. It\u2019s just that she was so wonderful, so reassuring and supportive. That wasn\u2019t the only time, either. I could always count on her to see me through whatever crisis I faced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cEverything\u2019s reversed\u2014I\u2019m the one taking care of Mom. She needs me more than I need her. So does Ben.\u201d She held the tissue to her mouth and swallowed a sob.</p><p>Jack stood behind her and rubbed her shoulders. \u201cYou have me and your brother and your kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. But this is...different.\u201d</p><p>The kettle whistled and Jack returned to the stove. He poured the water into the pot and carried it to the table.</p><p>\u201cThis is all because of taking your mother and Ben to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, it\u2019s so hard for me to watch my mother grow old... . She\u2019s trying to pretend everything\u2019s the same, but it isn\u2019t. Today it was even more obvious that she and Ben can\u2019t stay in the house much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk to them?\u201d he asked after a short pause. \u201cMy parents both died years ago, so I haven\u2019t been through this, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I appreciate the offer, but this has to come from Will and me. I can\u2019t blame Mom. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave my home, either. And then there\u2019s the problem of what to do with the house itself.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d visited the assisted-living complexes, both Olivia and Will had felt encouraged and excited. It\u2019d all sounded so positive, with a variety of programs that would keep her mother and Ben entertained and involved in life. She could visualize her mother leading the knitting group and Ben playing pinochle.</p><p>The facilities had exercise and physical therapy programs, musical evenings, reading and craft circles, excursions and more. At each place she must have counted at least five different activities for every day. The meals were well-planned and the menus were nutritious and appealing. Olivia wouldn\u2019t mind eating there herself.</p><p>But convincing her mother of the benefits of making that move seemed beyond her.</p><p>The phone rang and Jack answered, glancing at caller ID. \u201cIt\u2019s Ben or your mother,\u201d he said to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cHello, Charlotte.\u201d Almost immediately his gaze went to her. \u201cCharlotte, of course. Now don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nearly leaped out of her chair. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked in a panic.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack said calmly. \u201cApparently Ben fell. He can\u2019t get up and Charlotte can\u2019t help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s not fine!\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her to call 9-1-1? Is Ben hurt? He might\u2019ve broken his hip... . Oh, my goodness, Jack, this is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen isn\u2019t hurt. But your mother\u2019s been trying to get him up, and she can\u2019t do it. They\u2019re both exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d She ran for her jacket, then grabbed her purse and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cShe said Ben slipped on the rug in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Will had purchased the small rug and placed it in front of the new refrigerator, but it had a rubber backing and shouldn\u2019t have slid.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t remember it was there,\u201d Jack continued as if reading her mind, \u201cand he stumbled over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should call 9-1-1,\u201d Olivia cried. Jack put on his coat and followed her out of the house.</p><p>\u201cBen is embarrassed enough as it is,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd Charlotte told me he\u2019s not hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d They hurried to Jack\u2019s car and were off, not even bothering to lock up.</p><p>Charlotte met them at the front door, pale and shaken.</p><p>Jack walked straight past her and into the kitchen, where Ben sat on the floor, knees bent and head down. \u201cI feel like an old fool,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have you up in a second.\u201d</p><p>With his hands under the older man\u2019s arms, he hauled Ben to his feet, hardly exerting himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Except for my pride, which has taken quite a beating.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pulled out a chair and collapsed into it. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cOh, thank goodness you were able to come.\u201d</p><p>Olivia crouched beside Charlotte and hugged her, whispering reassurances. It was just as she\u2019d told Jack. Just as she\u2019d known for a while. She was the parent now. She\u2019d become her mother\u2019s mother.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Monday afternoon, Rachel left work early. She went to the Cedar Cove library, where she sat in one of the big overstuffed chairs and awaited her stepdaughter\u2019s arrival. She\u2019d called Jolene\u2019s cell to make this appointment; the girl had agreed to meet her but Rachel had no idea what to expect. Jolene had attended a counseling session, and it had been a complete waste of time, according to Bruce. She\u2019d been sullen and silent through the entire session, refusing to participate in the conversation. The longer Rachel stayed away from her husband and stepdaughter, the more obvious it became that she wouldn\u2019t ever be able to return. It was time to make other arrangements, permanent ones.</p><p>Rachel wondered if Jolene would stand her up and was somewhat surprised when the library door swung open and the girl stepped inside. She came alone, which was also rather unexpected, since Jolene usually traveled with a pack of friends.</p><p>She stood in the foyer and scanned the library until her gaze fell on Rachel. As soon as she saw her, Jolene\u2019s eyes narrowed. Walking across the library, she carelessly dropped her backpack on the floor and sat in the chair next to Rachel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d she said without any greeting. Her voice was devoid of warmth.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you for coming,\u201d Rachel replied pleasantly, choosing to ignore her stepdaughter\u2019s attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask me to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I have several reasons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jolene looked conspicuously at her watch. \u201cHow long is this supposed to take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Rachel promised. So far, the meeting was going exactly as she\u2019d feared. The girl\u2019s hostility was un-disguised. The battle lines were drawn and swords ready. Except that Rachel was about to hand over her weapon. She was finished.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, she came directly to the point. \u201cMainly, I wanted to tell you I\u2019ve decided to leave the area.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s eyes flew to hers. \u201cDoes my dad know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She would tell Bruce later.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to celebrate. You\u2019ve beaten me, Jolene. You win. You can have your father all to yourself. I won\u2019t be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to my brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head. \u201cI grew up without a family. My aunt tried but she didn\u2019t have a warm bone in her body. She was raised in an era when children didn\u2019t speak unless spoken to. Her mantra was that cleanliness was next to godliness, so what she held most important was a spotless house. There was very little fun in my life and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me all this before,\u201d Jolene said, defiantly crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry, no need to repeat myself, is there? All I meant was that my aunt taught me what not to do, what not to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen with the baby?\u201d Jolene sounded like an attorney representing her father\u2019s interests.</p><p>\u201cHappen?\u201d Rachel shrugged. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll raise this child and love him or her to the very best of my ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p> <p>Jolene glared at her. \u201cHe has a right to the baby, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not preventing your father from having contact with the child, Jolene, I\u2019m protecting him or her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting him or her from what?\u201d</p><p>Rachel hardly felt a reply was necessary. The answer should be obvious, even to Jolene. If Jolene hated Rachel this much, then she couldn\u2019t trust her to feel any differently toward her child.</p><p>When Rachel didn\u2019t immediately reply Jolene\u2019s eyes widened as realization dawned on her. \u201cI would never hurt a baby,\u201d she insisted as though highly insulted.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not physically,\u201d Rachel agreed, \u201cbut there are other ways of inflicting damage. I can\u2019t risk that.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s gaze moved past her and she swallowed visibly. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t decided. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of Portland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOregon?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close but not too close, and far enough away that your father won\u2019t be tempted to...\u201d She let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s been seeing a counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked away, apparently embarrassed by her behavior at the counseling session.</p><p>Rachel hadn\u2019t expected changes overnight, but there had to be some effort and Jolene seemed unwilling to bend at all.</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Rachel hadn\u2019t spoken to Bruce during the past three weeks. They\u2019d exchanged a few emails, in which they\u2019d kept each other up to date. After Jolene\u2019s stunt\u2014making herself ill\u2014and then the wasted counseling session, Rachel felt convinced the situation was hopeless. If Jolene would rather throw up than let her father see his wife\u2014well, what more was there to say?</p><p>\u201cThe counselor has Dad setting boundaries with me.\u201d She said the words sarcastically. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked down at her feet. \u201cYou gave Dad back the money, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was surprised the girl knew anything about that. \u201cYour father told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Teri Polgar did. She came to the house and made a big stink about it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel could well imagine that scene. Teri wasn\u2019t one to hold back her opinions. No doubt she\u2019d told both Bruce and Jolene what she thought of them, whether they wanted to hear it or not.</p><p>\u201cDad was pretty upset about it. You not taking the money, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him\u2014that is, if you want to say anything about our meeting\u2014tell him the baby and I are doing well. I don\u2019t need money. I can care for the baby on my own.\u201d She didn\u2019t want a thing from him. Eventually her pride would give way and she\u2019d need to ask, but until then she was content to manage on her own without any help, financial or otherwise, from Bruce or Jolene. They\u2019d both done quite enough.</p><p>\u201cMy dad loves you.\u201d</p><p>The lump was back in her throat. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you loved him you wouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Jolene accused her. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be keeping the baby away from him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel wasn\u2019t willing to be attacked for the difficult choices she\u2019d had to make. But rather than defend herself, she disregarded the girl\u2019s comment. Standing, she placed one hand over her stomach. \u201cI appreciate you meeting me this one last time,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cGoodbye, Jolene.\u201d She started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jolene cried.</p><p>\u201cWait?\u201d Rachel echoed. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...have something for you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel wondered if Jolene was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI told my dad you called and wanted to meet. He wrote you a letter. I wasn\u2019t going to give it to you, but...I think maybe I should.\u201d The girl reached for her backpack, unzipped it and dug around inside. After a moment she pulled out an envelope, then handed it to Rachel. \u201cGo ahead and read it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Silly question. Of course she had.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s eyes dropped so quickly, that was answer enough. \u201cJust read what Dad wrote.\u201d</p><p>Rachel opened the blank envelope, which either hadn\u2019t been sealed or had been replaced.</p><p>Dear Rachel,</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to start this. I\u2019ve tried writing this twenty times and gave up every time. When I realized you\u2019d blocked me from calling you, I was angry at first. I\u2019d hoped we could reconcile. Then I understood why you did it and I have to say I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. Nothing changed, despite all our efforts. It was the same problem over and over again, only worse.</p><p>I apologize that I didn\u2019t step in earlier to help you with my daughter. Jolene has major issues, and I should have recognized them earlier. I\u2019ve made some changes here at home and attended several counseling sessions now. You were right about that, too. I should\u2019ve agreed to talk to someone much sooner... . If I had, it might have prevented this. Jolene went, too, not voluntarily, but at least she\u2019s had to listen. It\u2019s helping, I think, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit we have a long way to go.</p><p>Teri Polgar returned the money.</p><p>I\u2019ll abide by any decision you make.</p><p>Oh, Rachel, I can\u2019t stop thinking about you and the baby. I\u2019ve never felt such sadness. When Stephanie died, it was like someone had ripped off both my arms. This is different but just as painful. I\u2019ve failed you and failed our child.</p><p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more I can say, other than to tell you again how much I love you. Although Jolene would never admit it, she needs you, too.</p><p>Ending this letter is impossible. Words are impossible. I know I\u2019ve lost you but I can\u2019t say goodbye. Bruce</p><p>The last two lines blurred as tears filled Rachel\u2019s eyes. She swallowed, blinking hard, so Jolene wouldn\u2019t know how emotional the letter had made her.</p><p>\u201cThank you for giving this to me.\u201d Her hand trembled as she folded the paper and slid it back inside the envelope.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s right,\u201d Jolene whispered.</p><p>Rachel looked up and saw that Jolene\u2019s head was bent. A tear splashed on her backpack and she jerked her hand across her face.</p><p>\u201cYour father is right?\u201d Rachel repeated softly. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Jolene shook her head, refusing to answer.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need me, all you have to do is check in with Teri Polgar. She\u2019ll get in touch with me and I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she returned without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re my stepdaughter, and second, you and I used to be close.\u201d That felt like a long time ago, but Rachel could look back through the years and hold on to the good memories without allowing the more recent ones to taint her perspective.</p><p>\u201cThe baby...\u201d Jolene began, and then paused. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d she said, and almost smiled.</p><p>The door of the head librarian\u2019s office opened and Grace Harding came out. Behind her a puppy scampered, running across the library and directly toward Jolene.</p><p>Bending down, Jolene scooped the small dog into her arms. The puppy started to lick her chin. Squinting, Jolene laughed and held him away from her face.</p><p>\u201cBeau,\u201d Grace called out as she hurried toward them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cHe\u2019s just so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a darn nuisance. I keep forgetting to close the office door behind me. This is the second time today.\u201d She reached for Beau, but Jolene continued to hold him.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I petted him for a while?\u201d she asked, looking up at the librarian.</p><p>Grace glanced at Rachel as though to get her permission.</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Grace lingered a moment. \u201cWhen are you coming back to the salon, Rachel?\u201d she asked. \u201cWith both you and Teri gone, I\u2019ve had a heck of a time finding someone to cut my hair the way I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...won\u2019t be coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd I bet that\u2019s how all your clients feel.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. Rachel had heard via Jane that a number of her clients were looking for her. She hated to disappoint anyone but she seriously doubted they\u2019d follow her to Portland or wherever she landed.</p><p>\u201cBring Beau back to me when you\u2019re tired of playing with him,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Beau had settled down in Jolene\u2019s lap and chewed on her finger until she moved her hand just out of his range.</p><p>Rachel enjoyed watching Jolene with the puppy. Several minutes later, she stood to leave but Jolene asked, \u201cCould you stay a little longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She waited, unsure if Jolene had something else to say. She leaned down and petted the puppy, who immediately tried to chew on her finger, too.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, he\u2019s got sharp little teeth.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had discovered that. \u201cOuch.\u201d She jerked her hand away and examined her finger to see if he\u2019d drawn blood. Thankfully he hadn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never had a dog,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI wanted one but Dad said we\u2019d have to leave him alone all day, and that didn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had one, either.\u201d Her aunt hadn\u2019t been keen on pets, although Rachel had longed for a dog.</p><p>\u201cToo messy?\u201d Jolene guessed.</p><p>\u201cToo messy,\u201d she confirmed, and offered her step-daughter a tentative smile.</p> <p>Jolene cuddled the small dog as though that required her undivided attention.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d she whispered after several minutes. \u201cDon\u2019t move to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go someplace else?\u201d She frowned, a little confused.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother town farther away?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene repeated emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to move at all.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t say anything, afraid she might be reading more into this than warranted. \u201cAre you asking me to stay in Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer she\u2019d hoped to hear.</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is I don\u2019t know what my dad will do when he finds out you\u2019re leaving the area.\u201d</p><p>Rachel realized her decision would be hard on Bruce, but she didn\u2019t feel she had any choice.</p> <p>\u201cI...don\u2019t want you to go, either,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Perhaps that was a start.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Is Thursday still your day off? Gloria texted Chad. It was less intimidating than phoning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have long to wait for a reply. Yes.</p><p>She bit her lip and texted back. Could you come over?</p><p>Now?</p><p>Anytime.</p> <p>His reply was almost instantaneous. On my way.</p><p>Gloria hoped, prayed, she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Forty minutes later her doorbell chimed. Nervously wiping her palms on her maternity-front pants, she opened the door.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Chad immediately asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, realizing she\u2019d left him standing outside, and let him into her apartment.</p><p>Chad walked in and looked around as if this was the first time he\u2019d ever been there. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had gotten in touch with him on impulse. She did need help, which she knew Mack or Roy would\u2019ve been happy to provide. But she couldn\u2019t resist asking Chad, although she was afraid it might be too late for them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...purchased a crib.\u201d</p><p>His gaze met hers. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t have surprised her. They\u2019d more or less agreed to share custody of the baby. Returning to the matter at hand, she continued. \u201cHave you assembled yours yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried, and frankly, I found it rather confusing. I was wondering if you\u2019d mind helping.\u201d It was an excuse to see him again, to end this tension between them. If they were going to share custody, then they needed to feel comfortable with each other. Adversity and mistrust weren\u2019t in the baby\u2019s best interests. Or theirs...</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you asked me over?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Yes, it was an excuse but she\u2019d wanted to see him again.</p><p>Everything had changed after their...nap. That was a week ago. Nothing had happened that afternoon, nothing physical, and yet it had made a difference, at least for Gloria. Now, whenever she crawled into bed and closed her eyes, she could feel Chad lying beside her and it comforted her, calmed her. She wanted that closeness again, that feeling of being protected and cherished. Everything before had been about the powerful physical attraction between them. But they\u2019d experienced something else that afternoon\u2014tenderness toward each other and love for their unborn child. Gloria had felt a bond with Chad, a feeling of wholeness that she\u2019d lost with the death of her parents. She had a blood relationship with the McAfees and they\u2019d welcomed her into their lives. What she didn\u2019t have were the memories, the shared times, the laughter and private moments that connected the members of a family.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the crib?\u201d he asked, giving her an odd look.</p><p>Caught up in her thoughts, she\u2019d been staring off into space. Startled, she led him down the hall and escorted him into the second bedroom, which she planned to turn into the nursery.</p><p>He paused halfway into the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve bought quite a lot of stuff already.\u201d</p><p>Gloria rested her hand on the changing table. \u201cCorrie saw this on sale and phoned me from the store. I bought it sight unseen, and then Mack and his brother-in-law picked it up for me and brought it to the apartment.\u201d The change table was white wood with six drawers, three on each side. There was a brightly colored pad on top.</p><p>\u201cI want to paint the room a light shade of blue.\u201d Mack had volunteered to do that for her. She\u2019d thanked him and declined. She wanted Chad to offer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Chad looked at the two ends of the crib that leaned against the outside wall. She\u2019d taken everything out of the cardboard packaging, which she\u2019d put in the recycling bin.</p><p>\u201cThe assembly directions are in several different languages,\u201d she said, handing him the printed sheets. \u201cI suspect the English version might be a bit difficult to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, English isn\u2019t their first language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Chad studied the directions, then flipped through several pages. \u201cThe pictures will help.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had made that assumption herself, only to give up in frustration. \u201cI have all the tools we\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I didn\u2019t think to bring anything with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d He didn\u2019t know until he arrived why she\u2019d contacted him.</p><p>They sat down on the floor together and Gloria marveled at how thorough Chad was. He read the entire booklet before he even reached for the screwdriver.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Gloria had to get up off the floor. Everything ached. \u201cHow about a cup of coffee?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more in the mood for a shot of whiskey. Has anyone ever successfully assembled one of these cribs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. Sorry, I don\u2019t have anything stronger than wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter six.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even thought to look until he asked. It was already dark.</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d he repeated, and in one fluid motion he was on his feet. He grabbed his cell and rushed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to be someplace else?\u201d she asked, and assumed he was meeting Joni. Her chest tightened as she held her breath.</p><p>Talking on his cell phone, Chad stepped outside the apartment onto the second-story walkway. He paced back and forth, intent on his conversation. Several minutes passed before he returned.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to leave?\u201d she asked, hoping she\u2019d be able to hide her disappointment if he did.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize... I should\u2019ve realized you might have made other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll finish up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right, really,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like I\u2019m due next week or anything. We have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d stay.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Chad went back to the baby\u2019s room and she went into the kitchen. The cupboard above the refrigerator held a bottle of merlot. Gloria couldn\u2019t remember how long it\u2019d been there\u2014well over a year, anyway. But aging red wine was supposed to improve the flavor. Opening the bottle proved to be a challenge but she managed. She poured Chad a glass and carried it into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHere, this might help,\u201d she said, handing him the wineglass.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could join you... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time, perhaps. After the baby\u2019s born.\u201d He sent her a warm smile, which she immediately fell victim to; he\u2019d had that effect on her from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cI also bought a mobile.\u201d The words tumbled out in her effort to break the spell he had over her.</p><p>\u201cDoes it need assembly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d he teased, laughing.</p><p>She laughed, too.</p><p>He had one side of the crib attached when her stomach growled, reminding her that it\u2019d been a long time since lunch. If she was hungry, Chad likely was, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix us some dinner,\u201d she suggested, eager to do something useful. She wasn\u2019t much help with the crib, other than to reread the instructions aloud. Every once in a while he\u2019d ask her to repeat a step and she\u2019d struggle with the poor syntax and confused vocabulary. At one point Chad muttered that English must be the author\u2019s fourth or fifth language. Smiling, Gloria agreed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to any trouble,\u201d Chad said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Not until she was in her kitchen did she realize this was the first time she\u2019d ever cooked for him. She\u2019d soon be giving birth to his son and yet they\u2019d never once shared a home-cooked meal. She had to wonder if Joni ever cooked for him and decided she probably did.</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t have a large repertoire of recipes. One of her favorites was a seafood pasta dish. Corrie had given her the recipe, which she, in turn, had received from Peggy Beldon. Setting a pot of water on to boil, she got the shrimp and scallops from the freezer and canned clams from the cupboard.</p><p>She\u2019d chopped the onions and fresh parsley when Chad appeared. \u201cI need a break,\u201d he said, holding his half-full wineglass.</p><p>\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t allergic to seafood?\u201d she asked, suddenly worried.</p><p>\u201cNope. Love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d What a sad commentary that she should know so little about him.</p><p>Chad leaned against the counter and she wondered if he had any idea how sexy he looked.</p><p>The phone rang and she answered it without checking caller ID. It was her brother.</p><p>\u201cJust calling to make sure you don\u2019t need any help putting that crib together,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it under control. Thanks, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Linc said he could help, too, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, give me a call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>When Gloria replaced the receiver, she saw Chad frowning into his wine. He obviously thought her conversation had been with someone she was dating. Remembering how wretched she\u2019d felt when he was on the phone with Joni, she didn\u2019t explain. Let him think what he would. He didn\u2019t ask and she didn\u2019t enlighten him.</p><p>Chad finished his glass of wine and replenished it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to turn on the radio?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Soon soft rock filled the kitchen, followed by radio personality Delilah\u2019s soothing voice.</p><p>While the fettuccine boiled, Gloria set the table, adding a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. She placed two candles in the center, as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve created this intimate little scene before,\u201d he commented as she stirred the pasta.</p><p>\u201cWith the hours I work?\u201d While she was on patrol duty, she\u2019d rotated between swing shift and graveyard. Her nights and days were often reversed. Chad knew that.</p><p>Her answer seemed to please him. When the timer went off, he took the kettle from the stove and emptied the pasta into the strainer. Then he transferred the hot noodles to a ceramic dish she\u2019d set on the counter. She poured the seafood sauce in its olive oil and fresh herb base over top.</p><p>Chad carried the serving bowl to the table. \u201cThis smells fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cCorrie served it several months ago and everyone raved about it.\u201d</p><p>Chad pulled out her chair. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard you refer to Corrie and Roy as family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d That was how she thought of them now, especially since she\u2019d discovered she was pregnant. While Gloria hadn\u2019t been happy when she learned that her father had told Chad about the baby, in retrospect she was glad of it.</p><p>Chad took the chair across from her. \u201cYou seem more comfortable with who you are,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>Gloria wrapped the noodles around her fork, savoring the scent of basil and oregano. \u201cYes, I suppose I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to think about her answer. \u201cThe baby. Roy and Corrie have been wonderful and Mack, too.\u201d Then, feeling mildly guilty, she added, \u201cThat was him on the phone earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>She took her first taste of the pasta and nodded.</p><p>Chad tried it, too. \u201cHey, this is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised. I can cook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He beamed her another of his irresistible smiles.</p><p>Gloria needed every ounce of self-control she possessed to pull her gaze away from him.</p><p>\u201cMore wine?\u201d she asked when she noticed his empty glass.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>They finished their dinner and carried their plates to the sink.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Chad said as he set down his plate. \u201cThat was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve heard the old saying,\u201d she joked. \u201cThe way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach.\u201d</p><p>He shocked her by taking her hand and raising it to his lips. \u201cYou already know the way to my heart, Gloria. You always have.\u201d</p> <p>She could hardly breathe as his eyes held hers. Gloria felt as if her legs were about to collapse. She swayed toward him and his arms went around her, drawing her into his embrace.</p><p>Their kiss was magical. Exquisite. Powerful.</p><p>When the baby kicked, Gloria broke off the kiss and hid her face in his shoulder. \u201cDid you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cI think he likes it when we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I like it.\u201d Chad\u2019s arms tightened briefly. \u201cBut...I need to go.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, she did her utmost to send him off with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d She dropped her arms, then retreated a step. \u201cThank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hand against her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to finish the crib next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ll cook, okay?\u201d He backed away a couple of steps, then rushed forward and kissed her again. By the time he left she was breathless and shaking.</p><p>And happier than she\u2019d been in months.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>\u201cOh, this is so much fun,\u201d Charlotte said as she linked her arm through Olivia\u2019s. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and they were visiting local craft fairs.</p><p>Olivia carefully set her pace to match her mother\u2019s.</p><p>The biggest fair was at Cedar Cove High School. \u201cDon\u2019t you just admire how clever people are?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cI certainly do,\u201d Olivia said. She pulled up the hood of her raincoat to protect her hair from the drizzle. Still, no weather could have kept her away from the Christmas bazaars. They\u2019d seen a range of crafts and artwork, from quilts and sewing to original paintings, blown glass and jewelry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, Mom.\u201d With equal parts anticipation and dread. Will would be joining them later, and together brother and sister would once again bring up the subject of their mother and Ben moving into an assisted-living complex.</p><p>\u201cI used to enjoy knitting for the charity bazaars,\u201d Charlotte was saying as they moved across the crowded high school parking lot. \u201cI haven\u2019t donated anything in the past few years. I\u2019m not sure why. Time just seems to get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does with all of us,\u201d Olivia said as they walked. They\u2019d both made several purchases, which she carried in a plastic bag draped over her free arm.</p><p>\u201cWhere to next?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cStanford Suites,\u201d Olivia said, trying to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cOh? That\u2019s where Bess lives now. She moved there...a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hadn\u2019t heard that, but found the news encouraging. Charlotte had obviously forgotten exactly when Bess Ferryman went to Stanford Suites; however, it must have been recent. \u201cThey\u2019re having an early Christmas bazaar, too,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the seniors have craft items for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you saw Bess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday. Bess is still part of the regular knitting group at the Senior Center.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stopped just short of pointing out that Bess could visit the others whenever she wished, even if she did reside at the retirement complex. She was afraid that if she said too much about it, Charlotte would become suspicious. Olivia had worried about this ever since they\u2019d made the arrangements. All she could hope was that her mother and Ben would be more receptive than they\u2019d been earlier.</p><p>The parking lot at Stanford Suites was nearly full.</p><p>\u201cLook how busy they are,\u201d Charlotte said as they pulled in.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather skip this and go directly to lunch?\u201d They\u2019d decided to eat at a Mexican place. Her mother was obviously tiring, and so was Olivia. It was only months since she\u2019d finished her chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and fatigue hit her sooner than it used to. And, she had to admit, she was quailing at the prospect of the conversation ahead.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind going in,\u201d Charlotte said, \u201cif that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go inside. It\u2019ll be fun to see what kinds of crafts they have for sale. I\u2019ve been looking for a special gift for Ben. He\u2019s so hard to buy for, you know.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the case with Jack. Books, music, DVDs\u2014he loved them all; she just needed to keep track of what he already had. She\u2019d also taken over purchasing his clothes and even he agreed that was a good thing. Except for his raincoat. She hadn\u2019t been able to convince him to give up that shabby old coat of his. She\u2019d bought a new one, which hung unused in their closet. He said it felt too stiff and insisted there was nothing wrong with his old coat. She knew that eventually he\u2019d start wearing it, but all the hints and suggestions she made were pointless until Jack was ready to switch, and he\u2019d decide that for himself.</p><p>Funny how thinking about his raincoat made her realize that same approach might work with her mother and Ben, too. In other words, all she should do was mention Stanford Suites, ensure that Ben and Charlotte were aware of the place and its advantages. Pressuring them would only cause resentment and, if anything, make them more resistant.</p><p>She drove slowly around the lot. Luck was with her; a car parked close to the front left just as she drew near. Right away Olivia grabbed the empty space. She hurried around to help her mother out of the passenger side, afraid Charlotte might slip on the sidewalk. Ben\u2019s fall had emphasized how vulnerable both of them were.</p><p>\u201cMy, the grounds are nice here,\u201d Charlotte said, glancing at the flower beds. \u201cYou know, I feel so bad about neglecting my garden. Ben and I were in the backyard earlier this week. There\u2019s so much we need to do... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I can come over and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Charlotte said, immediately dismissing the offer even before Olivia could make it. \u201cBen and I are thinking about hiring a yard service. But I have to tell you, Olivia, the price for goods and services is so high these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I have a yard service.\u201d In Olivia\u2019s opinion, it was worth every cent. She enjoyed working outdoors, but her spare time was limited. While on medical leave she\u2019d spent hours in her garden, especially after she\u2019d started feeling better and regained some of her strength. Until then, Olivia had forgotten how much pleasure she got from her garden. Jack had helped, too, but it wasn\u2019t something he did for the joy of it. Not like her. He had an ulterior motive. Pulling weeds and preparing the earth, he\u2019d watched her constantly. He\u2019d been terrified that she\u2019d become dizzy or faint or, worse, that she\u2019d collapse.</p><p>When Olivia was diagnosed with breast cancer, Jack had hardly let her out of his sight. If Olivia had ever doubted her husband\u2019s love\u2014and she hadn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019d proved himself a thousand times over while she underwent cancer treatments. And, as a bonus, their garden had benefitted, too.</p><p>A youngster held the door open as Olivia and Charlotte entered the complex.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said with a toothless grin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even Thanksgiving until next week,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas here,\u201d the young man told them earnestly. \u201cMy great-grandma said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who are we to argue?\u201d Olivia said as they walked in. The large open room was filled with tables placed in a U-shape for easy access. Bess sat at the second table, her baked goods and knitted items on display.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte!\u201d she cried. She put down her knitting needles to lean over the table and give her friend a hug. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came. When I mentioned the bazaar last Monday, you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to stop by.\u201d</p><p>Her mother hadn\u2019t said anything about the craft show and Olivia assumed Charlotte had simply forgotten, or\u2014another possibility\u2014she hadn\u2019t wanted to give Will and Olivia an opportunity to promote the idea of assisted living.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to my friends,\u201d Bess said, and animatedly waved her arm in the direction of several other women. \u201cThis is Eileen, and over here is Rosemary and that\u2019s Eve.\u201d She pointed to the other ladies, who had their own booths. They raised their hands and waved. \u201cI see you met my great-grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Billy?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s eight now. Unbelievable, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI helped Bess with a sweater pattern when he was two. It had a dinosaur on the front,\u201d Charlotte explained to Olivia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Interesting how her mother would remember that and not a conversation she\u2019d had just a few days ago.</p><p>\u201cBess talks about you all the time,\u201d Eileen said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you selling?\u201d Charlotte asked as she moved closer to Eileen\u2019s table.</p><p>\u201cOh, I make polished wood pens. My husband used to love writing with a wooden pen, but they aren\u2019t available the way they once were. One year, I decided they couldn\u2019t be that difficult to make, so I attended a woodworking class at the community college and made him several for Christmas. He used them until his dying day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA wooden pen,\u201d Charlotte repeated. \u201cWhy, Ben would love that.\u201d She looked at Olivia. \u201cYou know how he likes to do the crossword puzzle every morning? Well, he does it in ink.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cGetting him one of these pens is a great idea. Very classy.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte purchased a pen and so did Olivia. Every booth sold something wonderful, and Olivia ended up spending more money at the retirement complex bazaar than the three other craft fairs combined.</p><p>They left loaded down with gifts, plus baked goods, homemade candy and watermelon pickles to serve with Thanksgiving dinner. Olivia knew Ben would enjoy the peanut brittle Charlotte had bought, as well.</p><p>Over cheese enchiladas, Olivia and Charlotte reviewed their Thanksgiving menu. Little had changed through the years. They\u2019d have turkey, of course, and two kinds of stuffing. The traditional inside-the-bird bread stuffing and a much-loved family recipe for rice stuffing, too. Old-fashioned homemade gravy. The salads and vegetable selections hadn\u2019t altered much from the time Olivia was a child. Potatoes, mashed and sweet. And at least three choices of pie for dessert.</p> <p>\u201cJustine\u2019s bringing the appetizers,\u201d Olivia reminded her mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Charlotte frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re having dinner at your house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom.\u201d The entire family had celebrated the holidays at Olivia and Jack\u2019s place for a number of years. Her home was larger than anyone else\u2019s and the kitchen was bigger. \u201cWould you rather have it at your home, Mom, with your new kitchen and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d She shook her head adamantly. \u201cI just wanted to be sure everything\u2019s set for your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be helping with the dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Olivia echoed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of making Thanksgiving dinner without you.\u201d</p><p>They finished their lunch and headed back to Charlotte and Ben\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDid you two have a good time?\u201d Ben asked when they went inside. A blast of wind nearly slammed the door behind them. The weather remained dark, wet and dreary. Not that Harry, her mother\u2019s cat, seemed to notice. He sat contentedly in his usual position on the back of Ben\u2019s chair, his long furry tail draped over the cushion.</p><p>\u201cWe had the loveliest time,\u201d Charlotte cooed.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s cell phone chirped, and as she took it out of her purse, she saw that the call was from her brother. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, looking at her watch. He was supposed to \u201cdrop by\u201d in about half an hour.</p><p>\u201cHi. Listen, something\u2019s come up and I won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d So her brother was leaving this in her hands. Her warm feelings for him and the help he\u2019d given her recently dipped by several degrees.</p><p>\u201cI can probably stop by but not at the time we agreed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen can you?\u201d she asked, struggling to hide her irritation.</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m not sure. I have to see someone and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone? Olivia was not amused. \u201cMale or female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Male. The guy\u2019s an artist I\u2019ve been wooing. A painter from Bellevue. I want him to bring his work to my gallery. Miranda\u2019s the one who got him to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda? Not right this minute, but she will be. Actually, we decided to double-team him, convince him to sell his art on this side of Puget Sound. Are you going to get all huffy about it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, she had to acknowledge that Will\u2019s excuse was legitimate and she hoped his overtures to this artist paid off.</p><p>\u201cCan you handle things without me or would you rather put it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The sooner we settle this, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too. Good luck. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She snapped her phone shut and put it back in her purse.</p><p>\u201cWho was that, dear?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m so happy about the way the two of you have reconnected since he\u2019s moved back to town. It does my heart good to see you getting along so well.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Will and Olivia had reconnected. They were closer now than at any other time in their lives. It was a gift she hadn\u2019t expected, and she was grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cI was just telling Ben about our bazaar shopping,\u201d Charlotte continued. \u201cWe had such a good day, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ben, the very best place wasn\u2019t the big craft bazaar that they hold at the high school. Remember, I mentioned it earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one you were looking forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014until we got to Stanford Suites. Oh, my, you wouldn\u2019t believe what I found there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, because almost everything I bought is for you for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt that assisted-living complex?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes. Bess lives there, you know, and she told me how much she loves it. Her great-grandson was the greeter. Oh, and they had the most beautiful decorated sugar cookies I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure did. The ladies\u2019 group baked them. They have Bible study on Tuesday mornings and a bridge club and a knitting circle and art lessons... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the assisted-living complex?\u201d Ben repeated with a frown. \u201cI had no idea they offered all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>Olivia refrained from pointing out that she and Will had described all the amenities and programs to them\u2014more than once. \u201cMom, before I go,\u201d she said. \u201cJack wanted me to ask what you\u2019re making for tonight\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>Ben and Charlotte exchanged a glance.</p><p>Olivia had asked because she suspected her mother hadn\u2019t even tried the new stove.</p><p>\u201cWe had cornflakes last night,\u201d Ben admitted.</p><p>\u201cCornflakes?\u201d This was worse than she\u2019d thought. \u201cOh, Mom, I was afraid this would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicrowave popcorn the night before,\u201d Charlotte murmured, shamefaced. \u201cThe microwave is easy to work. You just press the button that says popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI started to read the instruction manual, but the stove\u2019s got all these bells and whistles and, to tell you the truth, I just sort of gave up.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t surprised. The owner\u2019s manual was a good hundred pages thick. She\u2019d read shorter novels.</p><p>\u201cThe grounds at the complex were so lovely, too.\u201d Charlotte turned the conversation away from the stove and back to the retirement complex.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you talking about Stanford Suites again?\u201d Not that Olivia was complaining...</p><p>Charlotte nodded and looked at Ben. \u201cThey have a container garden there. Bess told me. The zucchini for the zucchini bread she sold me came from the garden. And the green tomatoes for the mincemeat, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ben raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Olivia reached for her car keys. It no longer seemed necessary to say anything. Her mother was doing all the talking.</p><p>\u201cSo you liked Stanford Suites?\u201d Ben asked Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cYes...I did.\u201d</p><p>Ben caught Olivia\u2019s eye. \u201cCharlotte, do you feel we should live there? I thought you were dead set against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was, but after being there today and meeting Bess\u2019s friends, I think I might like it. I never believed I would, but I can see the advantages to us. And really, Ben, nothing will change other than our address.\u201d She paused. \u201cBess said they have two openings coming up.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t look nearly as convinced. \u201cWhat about the house?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte grew quiet. \u201cI forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill and I may have a solution,\u201d Olivia said, trying not to reveal how eager she was to tell them. She and Will had been talking about this all week.</p><p>Her mother and Ben turned to her. \u201cYou do?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cWill wants to buy it from you.\u201d This was the news her brother was supposed to be there to impart. Well, she\u2019d have to do it for him.</p><p>\u201cWill wants to move into this old house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can discuss the details with him. We planned to talk to you this afternoon, until he got called away,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the apartment he fixed up at the gallery? Surely he doesn\u2019t want to just abandon it after all the work he\u2019s done there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go to waste. In fact, he\u2019s already got a potential renter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda Sullivan. She works at the gallery nearly full-time now, and she said she\u2019d be happy to rent the space, which would be ideal.\u201d This possibility had evolved during the past few days. Olivia was pleased by the growing closeness\u2014professional and, she guessed, personal\u2014between Miranda and her brother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a good solution for us,\u201d Ben said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019d feel much better about leaving the house if Will would buy it.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou tell him, though, that he\u2019ll have to get me another Christmas present\u2014otherwise, I\u2019m taking that new refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad, it\u2019s Thanksgiving,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cYou\u2019re being a real drag.\u201d</p><p>Bruce forced a smile. There\u2019d been plenty of Thanksgivings with just him and his daughter before, but this year, without Rachel, was different. He\u2019d picked up a precooked turkey with fixings at the grocery store, and everything was in the oven heating up. This wasn\u2019t the kind of meal he wanted, but unfortunately it was the best he could do.</p><p>Jolene had set the table. She\u2019d brought home a decorative papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 pumpkin she\u2019d made in art class, which served as the centerpiece. Using a white linen tablecloth and their good dishes, his daughter had gone to some trouble to make this a special event. He tried to show his appreciation, but his attempt had fallen decidedly short.</p><p>Jolene threw herself down on the sofa next to him and sighed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right without Rachel, does it?\u201d</p><p>He was shocked that his daughter was willing to admit it. \u201cNo. I wish she was here.\u201d Despite Jolene\u2019s unexpected concession, he braced himself for her backlash. But he didn\u2019t really care; he was tired of pretending, of putting on a brave front. Every day was an effort without Rachel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we call her?\u201d Jolene asked, shocking him again.</p><p>Bruce shook his head \u201cShe blocked all my numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t block mine.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stared at his daughter. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said I could phone her anytime.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. He wished she\u2019d told him sooner. \u201cHave you called her?\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s long hair fell forward as she hung her head. \u201cNo. I was going to a couple of times, but I didn\u2019t. She...she wants to move.\u201d</p><p>Bruce leaped off the sofa. His daughter was only now telling him this? Jolene had seen Rachel a week ago last Monday. He\u2019d hoped to pry information out of her, but Jolene had remained stubbornly tight-lipped. Eventually he\u2019d given up. All he\u2019d been able to learn was that Rachel had read his letter.</p><p>\u201cMoving? Where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe mentioned Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Jolene shrugged. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I asked her not to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d He found it difficult enough with Rachel living in Bremerton, which was just across the cove but felt like it was on the other side of the world. Portland would be so much harder.</p><p>\u201cNothing. She didn\u2019t tell me when she plans to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI asked her to stay,\u201d Jolene reiterated.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Jolene refused to meet his look. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather she went to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene!\u201d Bruce couldn\u2019t help it; he exploded. Pacing the room, he tore at his hair like a crazy man, tempted to slam his fist against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIf you felt that way, why did you even ask her to stay?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Jolene didn\u2019t immediately answer. \u201cYou,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned about me, then Rachel would be back in this house where she belongs.\u201d He jabbed his index finger at the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me here anymore, do you?\u201d she shouted, hiding her face in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! Of course I want you here. You\u2019re my daughter\u2014I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love Rachel more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her more. I love her, too. She\u2019s my wife and she\u2019s carrying my child.\u201d His pacing continued. \u201cA child I might never get to know because of this whole mess.\u201d Unable to bear it, he stormed out. With nowhere else to go, he went into his room, closing the door, and sat on the edge of his bed. He felt like crying but was too numb, too drained by his anger.</p><p>He had no idea how long he\u2019d been there when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Jolene opened the door and stood framed in the hallway light, holding her cell. \u201cRachel is on the phone. Do you want to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You shouldn\u2019t be moping around on Thanksgiving. I knew you\u2019d want to talk to her. You do, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Bruce swallowed painfully and nodded. \u201cVery much.\u201d The words were thick with emotion.</p><p>Jolene handed him the phone and then left, closing the door quietly behind her.</p><p>Bruce waited until the door had clicked shut. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving,\u201d he said, doing his utmost to sound upbeat and positive.</p><p>\u201cSame to you. Jolene said the two of you are about ready to eat.\u201d</p><p>Eat? Bruce had no appetite. He\u2019d be lucky to manage a roll, let alone an entire meal. \u201cI bought us one of those prepared turkey dinners from Albertson\u2019s. They\u2019re supposed to be halfway decent.\u201d But nothing compared to the home-cooked meal they would\u2019ve enjoyed if Rachel was with them.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, wondering if she\u2019d be joining Teri Polgar or one of her other friends.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m cooking today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkey and all the fixings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...for my roommate and some friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said dully.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re away from home and family, so we pooled our resources and decided to have our own Thanksgiving celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re living with a female navy\u2014what?\u2014officer?\u201d Bremerton was filled with navy personnel.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNavy, though, right?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to turn this call into an inquisition, but he couldn\u2019t help being curious. Rachel had told him so little about her living arrangements.</p><p>\u201cYes, navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man?\u201d he pressed, and could tell right away that she didn\u2019t appreciate his questioning her.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, does it, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d He did his best to pretend it didn\u2019t. Then he suddenly realized where she was staying and it nearly destroyed him. His hand almost crushed his daughter\u2019s cell phone. \u201cYou\u2019re living with Nate Olsen, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked starkly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters if it\u2019s Nate.\u201d He clenched his jaw.</p><p>Rachel was completely silent.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>He inhaled and slowly released his breath. \u201cEither I trust you or I don\u2019t. I choose to trust you. If you\u2019d wanted to marry Nate, you could have. He wanted you and so did I. You chose me. Whether that was the right decision or not, you\u2019re my wife... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. I trust you, Bruce, and I expect you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A moment later, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s been a friend to me. That\u2019s all. A friend.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy, but he had to believe she was telling him the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Jolene?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, when she called me just now. I told her when we met at the library that she could phone me anytime, day or night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised she called you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, but she didn\u2019t call me for her sake. She did it because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small one.\u201d</p><p>Bruce couldn\u2019t disagree. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He could argue, but decided against it. \u201cJolene said you\u2019re thinking of moving to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m considering it.\u201d She didn\u2019t add any further information.</p><p>\u201cWherever you are, I\u2019d like to be with you when the baby\u2019s born.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t be asking too much. As the baby\u2019s father, he had the right. All he could do was hope she agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about that later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t willing to drop it.</p><p>Bruce could tell she wanted to end the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s Thanksgiving, Rachel, and before we hang up I want you to know that, despite everything, I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re in my life. I will always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>He noticed she hadn\u2019t told him she loved him. Not that he\u2019d blame her if she\u2019d given up on their marriage...</p><p>He walked back into the living room, where Jolene sat in front of the television. He handed her the cell phone. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been kind of a brat, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>At least she recognized her role in all this.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>The timer on the stove indicated that the turkey was done. \u201cAre you ready for dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She regarded him skeptically. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He\u2019d make an effort; Jolene deserved that much. \u201cAfter dinner, do you want to work on a jigsaw puzzle? Or we can play Yahtzee if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do a puzzle. The one with the dogs playing poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d They\u2019d worked on a different puzzle last Thanksgiving. Rachel had been with them then, and it was the best Thanksgiving in recent memory. Jolene and Rachel had cooked the meal together.</p><p>Bruce and Jolene sat at the table with their purchased meal. Neither of them ate much, although they made a pretense of being happy. They\u2019d just finished putting the leftovers in the refrigerator when the house phone rang.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Jolene said, leaping on the one in the kitchen as if she thought it might jump up and run away.</p><p>Bruce smiled, observing that his daughter was almost back to the way she\u2019d been a year earlier, before he\u2019d married Rachel.</p><p>Rachel. His heart sank. He could pretend all he wanted, but he missed his wife.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jolene said, holding the phone against her shoulder. Her dark brown eyes seemed twice their normal size. \u201cIt\u2019s...Rachel. She wants to know if it would be all right if she came over for a little while.\u201d</p><p>His heart rate automatically doubled. \u201cOf course it would be all right. She doesn\u2019t need to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asking me. She tried my cell, but I left it in my bedroom and didn\u2019t hear it ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s asking you, then you need to answer.\u201d He gripped the back of his chair, waiting to see how his daughter responded.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She studied him, then returned the phone to her ear. \u201cDad and I were just about to start a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d</p><p>He nearly grabbed the phone away from her, wanting to tell Rachel that this was her home and she could come anytime she wanted, no matter what he and Jolene were doing.</p><p>\u201cWe did one together last Thanksgiving, remember?\u201d Jolene went on.</p><p>Rachel must have said something, because his daughter was silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. Dad got a pumpkin pie with the turkey.\u201d A short silence and then, \u201cIt was all right, I guess, for turkey, but last year\u2019s was way better. The stuffing was pretty bland. I like yours a lot more.\u201d</p><p>Bruce relaxed. They were having a normal conversation. \u201cI like pecan pie and so does Dad,\u201d she said next. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll tell him. Bye.\u201d</p><p>She replaced the phone. \u201cThat was Rachel,\u201d she said, as if he didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>\u201cSo, is she coming by?\u201d He tried to sound casual. Nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in about an hour. She said we should get started on the puzzle and get all the border pieces in and then she\u2019d help us with the rest. Oh, and she\u2019s bringing a pecan pie. We have whipped topping, don\u2019t we? Because I told her we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. If not, there\u2019s ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d his daughter said in an exasperated voice. \u201cWe have strawberry ice cream. That would be awful with pecan pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it.\u201d</p><p>Jolene rolled her eyes, but she was smiling and so was he. Really smiling for the first time that day, and it felt darn good.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to get back into our regular schedule,\u201d Grace said as she slid into the booth at the Pancake Palace. She and Olivia had finished their aerobic workout\u2014a Wednesday-night tradition for years\u2014and stopped for coffee and coconut cream pie. Another tradition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their schedule had been disrupted for months after Olivia\u2019s surgery for breast cancer and the chemotherapy and radiation treatments that followed. She\u2019d lost weight and grown so weak that for a time Grace had feared her best friend might not survive. If there were lessons to be learned from this experience\u2014and there were\u2014one of the most profound was how dear Olivia was to her. How important their friendship was. Grace treasured her and their special times together. Every week they made a point of catching up with each other. They\u2019d shared so much through the years. Grace relied on Olivia to sympathize when necessary, to tell her the truth and to laugh with her. And Olivia expected the same from Grace. They\u2019d seen each other through births and deaths, marriage and divorce, triumphs and disappointments.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, girls?\u201d Goldie asked as she sidled up to the booth.</p><p>\u201cTea for me,\u201d Olivia said, surprising both Grace and Goldie.</p><p>\u201cTea?\u201d Goldie echoed. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cCoffee leaves a bitter taste in my mouth these days. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the prescriptions I\u2019m taking or what, but I prefer tea now.\u201d</p><p>Goldie snorted, shook her head and, after pouring Grace\u2019s coffee, returned to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou usually order tea when there\u2019s something on your mind,\u201d Grace said, studying Olivia. Her friend had been unusually quiet all evening.</p><p>\u201cI guess so, but I really have gone off coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me you\u2019ve had the most important conversations of your life over tea, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I suppose I have. Most of them in the kitchen. My mother\u2019s or mine.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cConversations with my mother. With Stan. With Justine.\u201d She smiled. \u201cJack and I have had some of the most intimate discussions of our marriage in the kitchen. Funny, isn\u2019t it, that the kitchen and a cup of tea would play such a major role in my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s such a comfortable setting. So personal,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019s on your mind tonight?\u201d She couldn\u2019t see any reason not to be direct.</p><p>Olivia leaned forward to reply, but didn\u2019t have a chance before Goldie came back with a small white ceramic teapot and a tea bag on the side. \u201cI thought I\u2019d better ask if you\u2019re ordering coconut cream pie or if that\u2019s changed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have coconut cream pie,\u201d Grace said. This was her one indulgence of the week and she wasn\u2019t about to give it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat other kinds do you have?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace had to bite her lip to keep from giggling at Goldie\u2019s horrified reaction. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d she burst out. \u201cNow you\u2019re quitting coconut cream pie, too? What are those drugs doing to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI also like pumpkin pie,\u201d Olivia said evenly, \u201cand I think it would be a better choice health-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a pumpkin pie kind of woman,\u201d Goldie argued. \u201cIf you order pumpkin, I swear you\u2019ll have to get some other waitress to serve it. Fact is, I\u2019m wondering what those doctors did to the Olivia I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here. Okay, you win, I\u2019ll have a piece of coconut cream pie.\u201d</p><p>Goldie\u2019s face broke into a wide smile. \u201cYou were just playing with me, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Not waiting for a response, she turned sharply and marched back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Grace said. \u201cNow you can tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Olivia reached for her fork and stared at it. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Mom moving and everything else\u2014things I never thought would affect me.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew that Olivia and Will had been concerned about Charlotte and Ben for some time.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s memory problems are getting worse?\u201d Grace asked, testing the waters.</p> <p>\u201cNo...actually, I think she\u2019s a little better now that she\u2019s back on familiar ground. Although...who can tell how long that\u2019ll last? But since she and Ben decided to move into Stanford Suites, Mom\u2019s been cleaning out the basement. She\u2019s like a woman on a mission. You know my mother. Once she\u2019d made a decision, there\u2019s no stopping her. Ever since Thanksgiving she\u2019s been sorting through sixty years of accumulated stuff. I know it\u2019s necessary but I didn\u2019t realize how hard it would be for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What kind of stuff?\u201d Grace had been in that basement herself and tried to remember what was stored there.</p><p>\u201cA lot of it is unimportant\u2014canning jars, old clothes and things Mom kept for one reason or another,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cBut some of that stuff is part of my childhood. I know there\u2019s no real reason to hang on to a perfect spelling test I did in the second grade. Mom kept it, she said, because she was so proud I could spell Mississippi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got an A on every spelling test,\u201d Grace reminded her. \u201cSo you could see this one as representative,\u201d she said, pleased with her explanation.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m saying is that when Mom and Ben agreed to move into assisted living, I was so relieved I didn\u2019t think about how all of this would affect me\u2014about how it would feel.\u201d</p><p>Grace considered that for a moment. \u201cYou mean you\u2019d be losing some of your personal history, as well.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Olivia said, \u201cNaturally Mom wants me to take all the files she\u2019s saved. She held on to so much and it\u2019s so neatly organized. On the one hand, I\u2019m tempted. On the other...what use is it? It\u2019s just a bunch of childhood memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy memories,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s ridiculous to save all this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen pass it on to your children and grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Olivia appeared to be mulling over that thought as she stirred her tea. \u201cI could, I suppose, but what good is an old spelling test to my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask Justine and James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw out most of those old files. My kids have their own clutter\u2014they don\u2019t need mine. But I have to tell you, Grace, it\u2019s hard letting go of all that...evidence. Those tests and drawings and Valentine cards bring back so much of my childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Will?\u201d</p><p>Olivia raised her eyebrows. \u201cWill? He tossed everything without a qualm. All of it went right in the garbage. He didn\u2019t even have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Cliff would do the same thing,\u201d Grace said. \u201cMen. I swear there isn\u2019t a sentimental bone in their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men,\u201d Olivia agreed and then added, \u201cJack can be shockingly romantic at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you have to admit he\u2019s the exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe. The problem is, most men don\u2019t want us to know how sentimental they can be.\u201d</p><p>Goldie appeared with their coconut cream pie. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she said, and it sounded like an order.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Olivia saluted smartly and exchanged a smile with Grace.</p><p>After a sip of coffee, Grace picked up her fork. She\u2019d looked forward to this all week. The library had been hectic, what with putting up Christmas decorations, creating displays of Christmas books, planning programs and events.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Olivia said, after taking her first bite. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in your world?\u201d</p><p>Grace hardly knew where to start. \u201cWell, I heard from Ian and Cecilia Randall. Remember them? Ian\u2019s still in the navy. They have two kids now and Ian\u2019s been transferred back to the Bremerton base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember the Randalls. It\u2019ll be good to see them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked about the house on Rosewood Lane and my current renters are moving out this month. It was a short-term rental after Faith Beckwith\u2014I mean, Davis\u2014left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should work out well, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Olivia said. Slicing off another bite of pie, she casually asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Beau?\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. The dog was the least welcome subject. \u201cThat puppy is a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace, he\u2019s adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, he\u2019s cute but he\u2019s a pain. I\u2019m not keeping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Grace insisted. Everyone, right down to her two daughters and their kids, refused to believe her. But she wasn\u2019t keeping him. She wasn\u2019t! It was out of the question. Grace didn\u2019t have the time or inclination for training a puppy. The fact that Beau followed her around like a pesky little shadow didn\u2019t influence her one bit.</p><p>\u201cDoes Beth have a home for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mine. She thinks she\u2019s so clever,\u201d Grace said, growing more animated as she spoke. \u201cShe came to me with this song and dance about being so busy shipping Christmas trees to Japan and Hawaii and wherever that she hasn\u2019t had time to look for another home and could I just hang on to him. She assumed that because I agreed to help her with this puppy I\u2019d want to keep him myself. Well, she\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Cliff say?\u201d</p><p>Grace narrowed her eyes as she stared intently across the table. \u201cOlivia?\u201d she murmured, her heart sinking. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should keep Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. He needs a good home and it isn\u2019t with me. I refuse to become attached to that dog. Besides, he\u2019s nothing but trouble. Did I tell you I found him chewing my new shoes the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you might have mentioned that once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d The more she thought about Beau, the more convinced she became that she didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize you talk about Beau quite a lot?\u201d</p><p>That was an exaggeration, but Grace was determined not to argue. \u201cMark my words, Olivia, I am not keeping that dog. If anything, I\u2019ll give him to Maryellen and Jon for the kids. If they\u2019ll agree... Katie and Drake are at the age where they\u2019ll love having a puppy. Beau will be happy with them.\u201d</p><p>Before her friend could pursue the subject further, Grace changed it. \u201cHow are things going for Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuying your mother\u2019s old house is a brilliant solution. Who came up with that idea? You or Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill. It\u2019s a tremendous help to Mom and Ben,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cEverything\u2019s working out beautifully. Will is moving into Mom and Ben\u2019s place, and Miranda will take over his apartment at the art gallery right after New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>A smile quivered at the edges of Olivia\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my brother\u2019s attracted to Miranda. She isn\u2019t the type who\u2019d normally interest him. She\u2019s not petite or demure. But she is his equal and isn\u2019t afraid to stand up to him. He\u2019s falling for her, and I can tell he isn\u2019t all that happy about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A smile became impossible to hold back. \u201cI had a feeling something was going on between those two. Who would\u2019ve believed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grace, she\u2019s just perfect for him.\u201d</p><p>Grace settled back and giggled like a schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t let him get away with anything,\u201d Olivia went on. \u201cShe sees right through him and calls his bluff. I don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s ever spoken to him the way Miranda does. Including his wife... In the beginning, I thought Will would lose it. I\u2019m pretty sure he fired her at least once, and I know for a fact that she walked out on him one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat must really have set him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t long before Will realized what an asset she is, so he had to humble himself and ask her to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill? Humble? Those are two words that don\u2019t mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t, which is why Mom and I think the world of Miranda.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, Miranda was going to be so good for Will. Because he was attractive and successful and sophisticated, Olivia\u2019s brother took pride in getting women to fall for him. His ego seemed to need it. She also wondered if he was one of those people who loved being in love, who was addicted to the excitement and unpredictability, the chase and the challenge. She\u2019d actually fallen for him herself after her first husband\u2019s death. Will had almost ruined her subsequent relationship with Cliff. Fortunately, she\u2019d broken off with Will, which he\u2019d made even more difficult by insisting he loved her. In retrospect Grace saw that he hadn\u2019t really loved her at all. Yes, he was fond of her but what he really enjoyed was being in control.</p><p>Miranda wouldn\u2019t be so easily manipulated and that would frustrate Will no end. But it was the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to him.</p><p>\u201cI do have to say Will\u2019s attitude has changed since he came back to Cedar Cove. That\u2019s been a surprise,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than anyone that my brother and I have had our differences over the years. I disapproved of some of the things he\u2019s done, but it\u2019s his life.\u201d Olivia raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could trust him after he moved back here.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew exactly what her friend meant... .</p> <p>\u201cBut he\u2019s made an effort to get involved in the community. And I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am that I don\u2019t need to deal with everything concerning Mom by myself.\u201d</p><p>Grace agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s been wonderful with your mother and Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to appreciate my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Goldie returned to their table with a coffeepot in one hand and a pot of hot water in the other. \u201cYou two ready for a refill?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Grace looked at her friend. \u201cNone for me. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty full, too.\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at the half-consumed slice of pie, Goldie asked, \u201cYou want me to wrap that up for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Goldie gave a disgusted snort. \u201cOkay, well, see you girls next week.\u201d</p><p>Next week. Same time. Same place. Grace would meet with Olivia, who\u2019d always been with her. Who shared her burdens and doubled her joys. Her friend for life.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>Linc stepped into his office and smiled at the stack of work orders on his desk. Sheriff Troy Davis had helped him immeasurably by sending business his way. The sheriff was active in a number of service organizations, such as Rotary Club and Lions, where he\u2019d made a point of spreading the word. At first, business had trickled in slowly, but as the weeks progressed, the auto body shop drew more and more work. As it stood now, Linc had all his employees working a forty-hour week.</p><p>The business wasn\u2019t the only thing going well in Linc\u2019s life. He was delighted with the duplex and his growing friendship with Mack. Most of all, he deeply loved Lori and looked forward to every minute he spent with her. If he\u2019d known marriage could be this satisfying, he would\u2019ve tried it a lot sooner, he\u2019d joked to Lori. Laughing, she\u2019d informed him that he never would\u2019ve found anyone who suited him nearly as well\u2014and she was right.</p><p>Thinking about Lori, he felt a twinge of sadness as he thought about the situation with her family. The conflict between him and his father-in-law remained unresolved. The fact that Leonard and Kate had separated over Leonard\u2019s reaction to their daughter\u2019s marriage was an additional burden.</p><p>Lori was in close contact with her mother once again. They talked nearly every day, but although Kate put a good face on it, Linc could tell how hurt and disappointed she was that Leonard had made no effort to get in touch with her.</p><p>Sitting down at his desk, Linc reached for the telephone directory and flipped through the pages. He quickly located the listing for Bellamy Enterprises in Bremerton.</p><p>A woman answered in a crisp professional voice. \u201cHow may I direct your call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to Leonard Bellamy\u2019s assistant,\u201d he responded in the same businesslike tones.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Helen,\u201d another woman said an instant later.</p><p>Linc drew in a breath. \u201cHelen, this is Lincoln Wyse.\u201d He paused, waiting for a reaction. When none came, he continued. \u201cWould it be possible to schedule an appointment with Mr. Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check his schedule.\u201d</p><p>Linc was put on hold for several minutes before the woman came back. \u201cMr. Bellamy said he\u2019s available in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Bellamy,\u201d Linc murmured. He hadn\u2019t counted on the assistant speaking directly with her employer. Glancing at his watch, he asked, \u201cFour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d It was already three-thirty. Linc realized that if he didn\u2019t leave right away, he\u2019d be late. No doubt Bellamy would add that to his list of crimes.</p><p>Linc washed up, then drove the entire distance above the speed limit, risking a ticket. He found a convenient parking spot, then ran to the downtown office complex. He\u2019d only been here once before, and an unpleasant scene between him and Bellamy had resulted.</p><p>Linc hadn\u2019t had enough time to consider what he wanted to say to Bellamy. All he could do was be as forthright and honest as possible.</p><p>He dashed up the steps to the building and caught an open elevator. Getting off on the top-floor lobby, he checked his watch and heaved a sigh of relief. Right on schedule.</p><p>A middle-aged woman sitting at the front desk glanced up as he approached. She had short salt-and-pepper hair and looked every inch the professional assistant she was. Her nameplate identified her as Ms. Helen McDonald.</p><p>\u201cLincoln Wyse,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Mr. Bellamy know you\u2019re here.\u201d Helen picked up her phone and curtly announced his name. When she\u2019d finished, she gestured toward a chair. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Linc did. Five minutes passed and then ten. So this was the game his father-in-law had chosen to play. Apparently Bellamy assumed Linc would lose patience and walk out. The fact was, Linc could be just as obstinate, just as unyielding. They had more in common than Leonard Bellamy realized.</p><p>A full hour went by before the phone buzzed. Helen answered and nodded in Linc\u2019s direction. \u201cMr. Bellamy will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Linc stood. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She led him to the private office and opened the door. Linc walked inside, gazing at the bookcases, the upholstered guest chairs, the desk of dark polished wood. Bellamy sat there, head bowed as he wrote. He didn\u2019t acknowledge Linc or give any indication that he knew Linc had entered the room.</p><p>Linc waited in front of the desk. He occupied himself by examining the family photographs, which stood in a row on the credenza behind his father-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still here,\u201d Bellamy said, not bothering to look up. He set down his pen and leaned back, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>Linc wished now that he\u2019d taken the time to go home and change out of his work clothes, although he hadn\u2019t had the opportunity. Getting here by four meant jumping right in his truck. No doubt if he\u2019d been a minute late, Bellamy would have refused to see him. Score one point for his father-in-law, making Linc cool his heels like that, and another for catching him in greasy coveralls.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked for the appointment, not me,\u201d Bellamy muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Linc tried to corral his thoughts. \u201cMostly I came because I need to know what you find so objectionable about me being married to your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy laughed. \u201cThe fact that you have to ask tells me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could understand it if I hadn\u2019t learned about your own background,\u201d Linc said. He sat down and crossed his legs, hoping to create the impression of being at ease.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bellamy asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea why you took such an instant dislike to me. I\u2019ll admit the circumstances leading up to Lori\u2019s and my wedding left a lot to be desired. We were foolish to rush into marriage... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d go back and meet both you and your wife and ask your blessing before I married Lori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have given it.\u201d Bellamy seemed to take grim pleasure in informing him of that.</p><p>\u201cPossibly not, but I hope you will now.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy glared at him across the desk. \u201cAre you out of your mind? What would ever make you think I\u2019d give you and Lori my blessing? Especially now that Kate\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, his lips pinched, as though he regretted mentioning his wife\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019ve proved myself to you,\u201d Linc said. \u201cYou threw a number of roadblocks in my way when I tried to establish my business in Cedar Cove.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cNevertheless I\u2019m making a go of it.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy didn\u2019t deny it, which only went to show what Linc already knew. His father-in-law had done everything he could to sabotage his auto body shop and had nearly succeeded. If not for his brother-in-law and Sheriff Davis, Bellamy would have succeeded.</p><p>\u201cWhat puzzles me most is why you object to me when the two of us are so much alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sincerely doubt it,\u201d Bellamy snapped.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I gather, your own father worked as a welder.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stiffened. \u201cThat means nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you came from a family with a strong work ethic, which is the same ethic my father taught me. As it happens, I followed in my father\u2019s footsteps. I might have chosen my own path, but that option was taken away from me when both my parents were killed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw a faster way of getting what you wanted by marrying my daughter,\u201d Bellamy interrupted.</p><p>Linc inhaled slowly in an effort to hold on to his temper. \u201cYou might find this hard to believe, but when I married Lori I didn\u2019t have a clue that she was from a wealthy family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, I don\u2019t find that hard to believe. I find it impossible to believe.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue, Linc said, \u201cMy point is this. Like you, I\u2019m willing to work hard. I\u2019m ambitious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re ambitious. That\u2019s the reason you married Lori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married your daughter because I\u2019m in love with her. Lori is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>Bellamy snickered loudly.</p><p>\u201cAll you have against me is that we didn\u2019t wait to get your approval before we married. By your own admission, it\u2019s unlikely you would\u2019ve given it, anyway, so it\u2019s a moot point, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he countered. \u201cAnd my situation was completely unlike yours. I fell in love with Kate the minute I set eyes on her. When I learned she was from one of the richest families in the state, my heart sank. I was afraid she\u2019d never go out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did.\u201d Now it was Linc\u2019s turn to interrupt and show his father-in-law that he wasn\u2019t completely in the dark. Thanks to Kate, he knew the family history now and had a better grasp of Bellamy\u2019s feelings toward him.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kate did accept when I asked her to a school dance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were college juniors.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stopped and glared at him. Linc might have squirmed under such scrutiny, but instead he smiled pleasantly and waited for Bellamy to continue.</p><p>\u201cI know darn well when we met,\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years,\u201d Leonard said, and grew wistful. \u201cI worked three jobs and saved every penny I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kate\u2019s father? How did he take to his daughter dating the son of a welder?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmbrose and I were...friendly.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate beyond that.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, perhaps, but that\u2019s not the way I heard it. Kate said that when you first started seeing each other, her father objected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI proved myself to Ambrose and to Kate\u2019s mother, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she told me.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the reference to Kate.</p><p>\u201cFive years I waited,\u201d he said, growing morose. \u201cFive torturous years. By the time I married Kate, I\u2019d purchased my first business complex and was saving for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping for the opportunity to prove myself to you,\u201d Linc said. \u201cThe way you proved yourself to Kate\u2019s family.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cUnfortunately, we started off on the wrong foot, but I\u2019m willing to let bygones be bygones if you are.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy laughed but there was little amusement. \u201cI\u2019ll wait five years to make my decision about you, the same way Ambrose did with me. Five years before he gave me permission to marry Kate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough, although I should tell you that Lori and I plan to have a family by then.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the comment.</p><p>\u201cKate wanted us to elope,\u201d Leonard murmured. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I had something to prove to her father first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you did in spades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to flatter me, young man.\u201d</p><p>Linc raised both hands. \u201cNo flattery intended.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy relaxed in his chair, hands folded across his middle. \u201cBefore he died, Ambrose claimed he couldn\u2019t have chosen a better husband for his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Linc carefully considered his response. \u201cMy hope is that one day you\u2019ll say the same thing about me.\u201d</p><p>Leonard scowled. \u201cI doubt that will happen.\u201d</p><p>Again, Linc didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to argue.</p><p>Shifting in his chair, Bellamy avoided eye contact. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve been talking with Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me so much as Lori.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori or Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, of course!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Linc enjoyed seeing the other man uncomfortable. \u201cFine, as far as I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to her lately?\u201d Linc asked, knowing Bellamy hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Feeling that the conversation had reached a natural end, Linc stood. \u201cI appreciate your taking the time to meet with me, Mr. Bellamy. I trust we understand each other now.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy stood, too. \u201cYou still have to prove yourself to me, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider that a personal challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, and if you happen to see...Kate in the next while, would you give her my best?\u201d</p><p>Linc hesitated on his way out the door. \u201cDoubt me if you will, Mr. Bellamy, but one fact you\u2019ll never be able to dispute is that I love your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He accompanied Linc to the door and opened it for him.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you right now that if Lori and I had a disagreement that caused her to leave me, I would move heaven and earth to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori isn\u2019t nearly as stubborn as her mother,\u201d Bellamy barked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d say she\u2019s far more like her father in that regard.\u201d With those words, Linc walked out of the office.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Dad and I painted the baby\u2019s bedroom. The text came on Rachel\u2019s cell phone.</p><p>Rachel texted back. What color?</p><p>Yellow.</p><p>Nice. Her connection with Jolene was still tenuous, although it had vastly improved in the past month. The process of rethinking their relationship was a slow one, but Rachel remained hopeful. So hopeful that she wanted to go home by the new year. January 1 was a symbolic time to start fresh. She hadn\u2019t believed it would happen but now...it seemed possible.</p><p>Jolene continued to see the counselor and seemed to be opening up more to Dr. Jenner. When they\u2019d last spoken, Bruce had said it wouldn\u2019t be long before the three of them could meet as a family. The fact that Jolene was texting her was a good sign.</p><p>No sooner had she pushed the send button than her phone rang. Caller ID identified Jolene.</p><p>Rachel answered right away. \u201cHello, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Bruce,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cCan I see you tonight? Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>Rachel had just gotten home from work and done little more than hang up her coat. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of any reason to refuse; even if she had, she would\u2019ve accepted his invitation. \u201cWill Jolene be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rachel hesitated. \u201cHow does she feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. This is about us, you and me.\u201d</p><p>No, it was about Jolene, too. \u201cLet me talk to her, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room.\u201d</p><p>Why would he try to keep her from speaking to his daughter? \u201cPlease put her on the phone.\u201d</p><p>A few anxious minutes passed before Jolene spoke. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d Her voice was low.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Your dad asked me to meet him for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsey and I are going to a movie later. That\u2019s what we usually do on Friday nights.\u201d</p><p>Rachel could hear Bruce in the background. \u201cWhat if you and I went out instead?\u201d Rachel suggested. The two of them needed to work on their relationship, rebuild the trust that had vanished.</p><p>\u201cDad wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s more important for you and me to spend time together than for your father and me to have a night out.\u201d</p><p>Rachel heard Jolene\u2019s sigh. \u201cDad wants to talk to you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see him after I drop you off at the theater.\u201d If he was disappointed about losing out on dinner, she\u2019d bring him something to eat.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d Jolene asked, displaying more enthusiasm now.</p><p>\u201cHow about Mexican?\u201d Rachel suggested, knowing that was Jolene\u2019s favorite, too. She couldn\u2019t tolerate spicy food herself at the moment, but she\u2019d order something fairly mild.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>For a couple of minutes they chatted about what they\u2019d have. \u201cCould you give the phone back to your father?\u201d Rachel asked when they\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>A moment later Bruce was on the line. \u201cYou\u2019re having dinner with Jolene and not me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop her off at the movies after dinner and then drive over to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t sound pleased by this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll put you in a better mood, I\u2019ll bring you take-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt anything\u2019s going to put me in a good mood,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>This didn\u2019t bode well. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMore of the same. We\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Dinner with Jolene had been an inspiration, Rachel decided a little while later. There was a new level of honesty on the girl\u2019s part and traces of the easy affection that used to exist between them. Her stepdaughter talked about seeing the counselor and admitted she\u2019d been jealous of Rachel\u2019s relationship with Bruce. Jolene\u2019s willingness to acknowledge her role in the separation was a huge step forward.</p><p>Jolene looked down at her plate. \u201cDad wants you to move back home,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rachel pushed aside her own half-eaten bowl of tortilla soup.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. I hope so. But not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad wants you home before Christmas, so we can be like a real family.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t comment one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not moving to Portland, Rachel,\u201d Jolene told her.</p><p>Rachel, who\u2019d been fishing inside her purse for her wallet, paused and looked up.</p><p>\u201cIf you left, that would be really hard on Dad...and I would\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>This was welcome news. \u201cDo you miss me now?\u201d</p><p>Jolene hung her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would, but I do. Before you and Dad got married, it was just him and me. But you were always there whenever I wanted to talk or do stuff. Everything changed after the wedding. I didn\u2019t like having to share you with him, or share my dad with you. And...well, I felt like the two of you were pushing me aside because all you needed was each other.\u201d She gulped noisily. \u201cI...I hated seeing the two of you all lovey-dovey.\u201d</p><p>Rachel understood why Jolene had reacted the way she had. They\u2019d all contributed to this situation. \u201cYour father wants us to be a family, and I want that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and now the baby changes everything all over again. The counselor and I talked about that. It helps that he listens and doesn\u2019t tell me I\u2019m bad for feeling like I do.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cYou have to understand your feelings before you can modify them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sound just like him,\u201d Jolene said with a quick grin. Then she grew serious again. \u201cI know that once the baby\u2019s born I\u2019m going to love him or her a lot, but right now I don\u2019t feel anything except...afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the baby getting all the attention,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do our very best to see that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Rachel wasn\u2019t sure how else to respond. \u201cBefore I drive you to the movies, I want you to know I\u2019m grateful you helped your father paint the nursery,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of fun.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Rachel checked her watch and realized that if they didn\u2019t leave within the next few minutes, Jolene would be late meeting Lindsey. She paid their bill and they hurried over to her car.</p><p>Jolene was quiet on the drive to the theater. When Rachel pulled up in front of the movie complex, Jolene reached for the door handle. \u201cI\u2019m glad it was just you and me for dinner,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI am, too. I\u2019m also glad you\u2019re being honest with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth can be painful, but I\u2019d rather know exactly what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene opened the car door and stepped outside, then leaned down, saying, \u201cIt is hard, and Dad doesn\u2019t like me telling him how I feel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has to hear it, though, and so do I.\u201d She waited until she saw Jolene connect with her friend before driving off.</p><p>Bruce stood by the living room window watching for her when Rachel parked in the driveway. He had the front door open by the time she was out of the car.</p><p>As soon as she was inside, Bruce drew her into his arms and simply held her. He didn\u2019t speak or make any effort to kiss her; all he did was hold her close. Finally he stepped back and brushed the hair from her face as if to get a better look at her.</p><p>\u201cI have missed you so much,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Sliding her arms around his waist, Rachel pressed her head against him. His heartbeat pulsed in her ear. How long they stood in the small entry like this was lost on her. It felt so good to be in her husband\u2019s arms.</p><p>Reluctantly Bruce let her go. \u201cHow was dinner with Jolene?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe had a nice time.\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly as he took her hand and led her into the living room. They sat on the sofa beside each other, still holding hands.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything to upset you, did she?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rachel reassured him. \u201cJolene was open and honest, and I appreciated that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you she wants you to move back home?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was uncertain how much of their conversation she should repeat. \u201cShe told me she was grateful I\u2019m not moving to Oregon.\u201d</p><p>His frown darkened. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s progress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you back here with us. Nothing feels right without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d she promised.</p><p>He studied her intently. \u201cIn time?\u201d he echoed. \u201cHow much time?\u201d</p><p>Rachel gestured vaguely. In her own mind, she\u2019d set January 1, but that date wasn\u2019t firm. Not until she was convinced they were ready would she come back home.</p><p>\u201cBefore Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Unable to respond, she exhaled slowly.</p><p>Bruce released her hand and stood, then walked around the coffee table, apparently composing his thoughts. \u201cWhen will you know?\u201d he asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cBruce, I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her long and hard. \u201cDo you want to move back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like that to me. In fact, I\u2019m beginning to think you and Nate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d She pointed her index finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t even suggest such a thing. Nate was a good friend when I needed one and I won\u2019t have you insinuating there was anything more between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, would I?\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s sudden jealousy was ridiculous. Hadn\u2019t he said he trusted her? \u201cLook at me, Bruce. Really look at me. I\u2019m married to you and pregnant with your child. Why would Nate be interested in me...especially now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful and...and wonderful. He was in love with you at one time, and those feelings don\u2019t entirely go away. They just don\u2019t. Once you commit your heart to someone, it\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you it is,\u201d she said, knowing that Bruce didn\u2019t give his heart easily. He loved deeply, completely, with his whole being. She\u2019d realized that if she married Bruce, it would be a lifetime commitment for both of them.</p><p>He shook his head as though he didn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYou commit yourself completely, but not everyone does.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cIs this a way of telling me you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce, how could you even ask a question like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said some people don\u2019t feel as strongly as you do, and Nate is one of them. I wasn\u2019t just the woman he wanted to marry\u2014I was the means to an end for him. His father is in politics and Nate is thinking along those lines himself. So he wanted a wife he felt ordinary voters\u2014\u201d she said this a bit sarcastically \u201c\u2014could relate to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, but what does that have to do with you moving back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d She could see that this conversation wasn\u2019t improving matters. Standing, she reached for her purse. \u201cI think it would be best if I left.\u201d</p><p>Bruce took her hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t, please.\u201d He breathed slowly, eyes closed. \u201cRachel, I\u2019m sorry. What I said about Nate was out of line.\u201d Then he opened his eyes, meeting hers, and tugged gently at her hand. \u201cLet me show you the bedroom Jolene and I painted for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel went with him to the third bedroom. When Bruce turned on the light, Rachel gasped in surprise. The baby\u2019s nursery was totally furnished.</p><p>\u201cJolene helped me pick out the crib and dresser and changing table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is...perfect. All of it.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the dresser, opened one of the drawers and pulled out a tiny T-shirt. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought anyone could possibly be this small?\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled. Bruce and Jolene had seen to everything.</p><p>\u201cWhen Jolene said you might be leaving the state, I had to do something. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve gone crazy. So I focused all my energy on preparing for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stood in the middle of the bedroom on the round white rug and looked steadily at her husband. \u201cI know this is hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard?\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Bruce. Do you think I wanted to leave you? Do you think it was easy to pack my suitcase and walk out that door? I can assure you, it wasn\u2019t. It nearly killed me to walk away from you and Jolene, but I had to because Jolene\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing better now. She\u2019s been to the counselor and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s come a long way,\u201d Rachel finished for him. \u201cBut she isn\u2019t quite ready and if we rush things now, like we did with the wedding last Christmas, we could be making another mistake. I\u2019d rather play it safe and wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t cater to Jolene\u2019s whims,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis is where you belong. You and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is where I want to be. But I don\u2019t feel that giving Jolene time to understand that she has to share you with me and the baby is catering to her.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Bruce walked out of the bedroom. She knew that wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d wanted to hear, but he had no choice other than to accept her decision.</p><p>Rachel found him standing in front of the fireplace with one hand braced against the mantel and his back to her. She stood behind him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bruce, but we really can\u2019t rush this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d only be gone a week or two, and that seemed unbearable. Now it\u2019s three months and you\u2019re still saying the time isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll never be right again. I feel like I\u2019ve lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, placing her hand on his back. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. More than anything I want to be with you and Jolene. I want our baby to be part of our family.\u201d</p><p>Bruce turned and studied her for a long time before he held out his arms to her. She slipped into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cWill you come back and visit again...soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext weekend. Jolene and I are putting up our Christmas tree and I\u2019d like you to be here.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. That would be especially revealing. She\u2019d be intruding on Christmas traditions that had always been reserved for Jolene and her father. If they could make it through that without Jolene getting upset and territorial, then maybe, just maybe, she could move back before Christmas.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Feeling good, Gloria climbed the steps to her second-floor apartment. She\u2019d had lunch out with her mother, who\u2019d recently returned from North Dakota. They\u2019d chatted about Christmas and a couple of family events planned for the season. Gloria loved being included. She felt more like family than at any other time since she\u2019d come into their lives.</p><p>As she inserted her key into the lock, Gloria noticed a woman getting out of a car in the parking lot below. She didn\u2019t think too much of it, although the blonde looked somewhat familiar.</p><p>She was inside and had just hung up her coat when there was a knock at her door. Checking the peephole, Gloria recognized the woman she\u2019d seen in the parking lot.</p><p>Seeing her up close Gloria realized why the blonde woman seemed familiar. This was Joni, the woman she\u2019d seen Chad kissing that day at the hospital in Tacoma. The woman he was dating.</p><p>Bracing herself for...she didn\u2019t know what, Gloria squared her shoulders and opened the door.</p><p>The two women stared at each other before Joni\u2019s eyes fell to Gloria\u2019s midsection.</p><p>Gloria didn\u2019t feel like uttering a bunch of meaningless niceties. \u201cWould you like to come in and talk?\u201d she asked, getting straight to the point. She wondered how Joni knew her name, how she\u2019d found her address. She decided not to ask. Chad could have told her. Or Joni could have followed him. She could have seen Gloria\u2019s name on his cell phone and looked up her address on the internet.</p><p>Ultimately it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Joni hesitated briefly before she responded. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Gloria stepped aside and held the door so the other woman could enter.</p><p>Joni looked out at the cove from Gloria\u2019s living room window, her hands deep in her coat pockets. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She folded her arms, not knowing what to expect. \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to be impolite, although she had the distinct feeling this wasn\u2019t a social call.</p><p>\u201cJust water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gloria went into her kitchen, filled a glass and brought it to the living room. Joni had taken a seat on her sofa. When she handed her the tumbler, she saw that the other woman\u2019s hand shook visibly.</p><p>Joni took a small sip and then wrapped both hands around the glass. \u201cChad doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Gloria would have been surprised if he had.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he was stopping by later today. His shift doesn\u2019t end until five, so he won\u2019t be here until almost six and I thought... I hoped maybe the two of us could talk before he arrived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Gloria tried to look relaxed, but the tension between her shoulders held her rigid.</p><p>\u201cI understand Chad told you about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Gloria didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cHe told me about you, too.\u201d</p><p>Gloria nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAnd about the baby,\u201d Joni added.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a good father,\u201d Gloria said. He\u2019d been so caring and thoughtful, and made it clear how much he already loved their baby.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d Leaning forward, Joni put her glass on the coffee table, taking a moment to position a coaster first. Now that her hands were free she didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with them. She clasped them in her lap and stared down at the carpet.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Gloria asked. She wanted to know where the other woman stood before they continued this awkward discussion.</p><p>Joni looked up and her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>Gloria felt like crying herself, but struggled to maintain her poise. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do, too,\u201d she admitted. Funny that she was so willing to tell the other woman how she felt about Chad, but couldn\u2019t tell him. It\u2019d taken her a long time to recognize the depth of her feelings. Now it might be too late.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt him badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in a good state of mind... . I regret what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby, too?\u201d Joni asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gloria answered. \u201cI\u2019ll never regret the baby.\u201d</p><p>Her answer made Joni frown. If anything, it appeared to affect her even more strongly. \u201cI... Chad loves the baby. That\u2019s all he talks about when we\u2019re together, and I suspect he loves you. No, I don\u2019t suspect. I know he does.\u201d</p><p>Gloria wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cChad and I met when I was at a low point in my life,\u201d Gloria began, feeling she needed to explain. \u201cI\u2019d just lost my adoptive parents. I was an only child and they were both only children, so I had no one. No aunts, no uncles, no cousins. No family. We... Chad and I felt an immediate physical attraction and, well...\u201d</p><p>Joni looked away and seemed to be studying the view outside the window. The Bremerton shipyard showed clearly in the distance, with the mothballed aircraft carriers and submarines against the backdrop of a metallic gray sky.</p><p>Gloria found her own attention wandering and forced herself to focus on her guest. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI came because I need to know how you feel about Chad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it matters a great deal.\u201d Joni picked up the water glass and took one long swallow. \u201cI know what I have to do now.\u201d She set the tumbler down in a decisive movement.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>Joni wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m ending my relationship with Chad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnding it,\u201d Gloria repeated. \u201cBut...you just finished telling me that you\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am...but I know the odds and they aren\u2019t in my favor. Chad loves you and pretty soon you\u2019ll give birth to his son. I care enough about him to bow out now.\u201d</p><p>Gloria had trouble believing the other woman was sincere, but the tears streaking Joni\u2019s cheeks told her she meant every word.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I need from you,\u201d Joni said, then paused to gather her composure. \u201cAll I ask is that you love Chad. He\u2019s a good man, and a caring physician. I just hope you appreciate what you\u2019ve got. If you don\u2019t, trust me, some other woman\u2019s going to do her best to steal him away and that...that other woman might well be me.\u201d</p><p>Gloria flattened her hand over her heart. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t say anything. Remember what I told you. If you hurt Chad again, you can\u2019t claim I didn\u2019t give you fair warning.\u201d Reaching for her purse she walked to the door.</p><p>Gloria followed her. \u201cYou really love him, don\u2019t you.\u201d It was a statement rather than a question.</p><p>\u201cMore than either of you will ever realize. It\u2019s only because I love him that I\u2019m willing to give him up. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing this for you or the baby. I\u2019m doing this for Chad. Just make him happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...will.\u201d</p><p>The apartment seemed to vibrate with the shock of Joni\u2019s declaration. Gloria stood by the door, hardly able to absorb what had happened. Chad loved her. She\u2019d sensed that he did, even though he\u2019d kept his distance, emotional and otherwise, since their last breakup.</p><p>Chad showed up at the apartment three hours later. Thankfully that meant she\u2019d had time to think about Joni\u2019s visit and analyze her own feelings.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said as he came in. He appeared ill at ease, not quite himself.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she returned. They\u2019d planned to go Christmas-tree shopping. Chad didn\u2019t want her hauling in a tree and decorating it while she was pregnant. She guessed that his offer was really an excuse to see her again. Not that she was complaining; she welcomed any and every opportunity to be with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we don\u2019t go shopping for a tree today?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We can do it another time.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the window and stood there, gazing into the night. Lights blinked out at sea.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked, wondering if he\u2019d lost a patient. He took any death personally, especially a child\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI had a visitor this afternoon,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gloria walked toward him until they were only a foot or so apart, both staring into the darkness. \u201cInteresting, because I did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoni.\u201d</p><p>Chad nearly dislocated his neck as he jerked toward her. \u201cJoni came to see you?\u201d</p><p>Gloria clenched her hands and nodded. \u201cShe needed the answer to an important question.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to continue.</p><p>It took Gloria a moment to find the courage to explain. \u201cShe came to ask me if I was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you answer her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her what happened when I first moved to Cedar Cove\u2014and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you left out the part about falling into bed together a few hours after we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His expression grim, he started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear my answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. You gave her an excuse for your behavior and left it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t leave it at that. I answered her question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked, sounding bored with the entire conversation. He seemed almost eager to escape.</p><p>\u201cI told her I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d She held herself straight, fearing his reaction. He might laugh in her face and say he didn\u2019t believe her. Certainly she hadn\u2019t done anything to reveal how she felt about him. On the contrary, she\u2019d tried over and over to prove that she had no affection for him whatsoever.</p><p>He said nothing. But he turned around, obviously studying her to see if she was telling the truth.</p><p>Gloria met his gaze boldly.</p><p>\u201cJoni came to see me, too,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI figured she might.\u201d The other woman had said she\u2019d be seeing Chad, although Gloria hadn\u2019t expected it to be this soon.</p><p>\u201cShe broke off our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Gloria felt almost sick to her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew it was over. It was from the minute I learned about the baby. The problem was, I didn\u2019t realize it myself, not until recently. I never stopped loving you, Gloria. I tried to get you out of my mind and my heart, but it didn\u2019t work. At night you haunted my dreams. During the day I imagined you around every corner. You\u2019ve had a grip on me from the night we met.\u201d</p><p>Gloria\u2019s experience had been the same, only she hadn\u2019t been willing to admit it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Chad,\u201d she whispered. She stepped closer and he did, too. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to do anything right when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>He broke into a smile. \u201cI disagree. You\u2019re giving me a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you my heart, too.\u201d</p><p>He opened his arms and she walked into them. He held her tight against him and whispered into her hair, \u201cIt took you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I fought you so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either.\u201d He kissed the top of her head and moved down the side of her face, finally reaching her lips.</p><p>When Chad pulled away minutes later, Gloria felt weak and breathless. She thought about taking him to her bedroom, which was how these sessions usually ended. But she wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen this time. They couldn\u2019t let sex confuse the issue or distract them from what they needed to work out.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you make me feel like this?\u201d She\u2019d never reacted physically to any man the way she did to Chad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care. Just don\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him, kissing him with tears running down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI want us to get married,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the romantic proposal she\u2019d always dreamed of, but it was good enough.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas?\u201d That was three weeks away!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll move in with me.\u201d</p><p>All these commands were given between lengthy, heated kisses. \u201cWith you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, move in with me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you move here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family\u2019s here. My job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a new family now. You, me and the baby. And there are jobs in Tacoma, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe, later on, I can join their police force.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be that far from Cedar Cove and the McAfees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss, this one even more potent and powerful. \u201cChad,\u201d she whispered, gasping for breath. \u201cI do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbout Joni...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. Another doctor is crazy about her.\u201d</p><p>He said more things, but everything else was lost on Gloria. All she knew was how happy she felt.</p><p>Thirty-Four</p> <p>Sunday afternoon, Grace and Cliff Harding were stringing Christmas lights around the roofline of the house. Cliff stood on the ladder while Grace held the lights and kept a careful eye on her husband. Beau was on his leash, which was tied to the porch railing.</p><p>A car appeared at the head of the long driveway between the two fenced pastures. Cliff\u2019s horses, lazily chewing grass, looked up at the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou expecting anyone?\u201d Cliff called down to Grace.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unusual for one of her daughters to stop by without phoning first, but neither of them drove an SUV. \u201cIt\u2019s Beth Morehouse\u2019s car,\u201d she told him a moment later.</p><p>\u201cHas she come for Beau?\u201d</p> <p>Grace had been adamant from day one that she wouldn\u2019t keep the puppy. He gnawed on her shoes and hid Cliff\u2019s socks and he was constantly underfoot. Besides, he insisted on following her everywhere she went.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Cliff called again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. They hadn\u2019t actually set a date for Beth to pick up the puppy. If she\u2019d found a good home for Beau then...great.</p><p>Beth parked in front of the barn, got out and walked over to them.</p><p>Cliff climbed down the ladder and placed his arm around Grace\u2019s shoulders, as Beau whimpered and barked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHi, Beth,\u201d Grace said. She bent down and scooped up Beau, who\u2019d been busily digging in her flower beds. His paws and face were smeared with dirt.</p> <p>\u201cHow about a glass of eggnog?\u201d Cliff suggested. \u201cGrace and I are ready for a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019d enjoy that, but I can\u2019t stay long. I need to get back to the farm. I\u2019ve got a full crew working. I had a couple of errands not far from here, so I thought I\u2019d see if you were home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Grace said unnecessarily as she led the way into the house. She stopped in the mudroom off the kitchen, washing Beau\u2019s face and paws and then her own hands, while Cliff took Beth into the kitchen and pulled out a chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the eggnog,\u201d Cliff said, taking three glasses from the cupboard. \u201cThis is Grace\u2019s family recipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make your own?\u201d Beth asked, turning to look at Grace, who came into the room drying her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. I\u2019ll be happy to pass along the recipe if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d love to have it.\u201d</p><p>As Cliff carried the filled glasses to the table, Grace brought a plate of sugar cookies she\u2019d baked with her grandchildren the day before.</p> <p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ve come for Beau?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>On hearing his name the puppy raced over to Grace, stretched up on his hind legs and set his front paws on her knees. He stared at her with such love and warmth that she was forced to look away. Almost against her will she petted his head, and when he whined she couldn\u2019t resist lifting him onto her lap. He licked her hand, then curled up tightly and went immediately to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWell...actually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a good home for him?\u201d Cliff broke in.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a home for him, period?\u201d Grace pressed. This was her big fear\u2014that Beth had come to depend on her keeping the puppy. Well, that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, no. I don\u2019t have a home for Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Grace cried.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Beth repeated, \u201cand now I have another problem.\u201d</p><p>Grace and Cliff exchanged a glance. \u201cConcerning Beau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... Well, yes. Indirectly. As you know, I\u2019ve rescued a few dogs and done some training, which I enjoy and seem to have a knack for.\u201d</p><p>That was a real understatement. Not only had Beth been her partner in the library reading program, she\u2019d started training dogs to visit with the sick and elderly.</p><p>\u201cApparently word\u2019s gotten around that I take in strays. Several people have brought me animals they\u2019ve found or can\u2019t keep and I do what I can to get them good homes but it\u2019s...it\u2019s become overwhelming.\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Has something happened?\u201d Grace asked, feeling anxious about Beth\u2019s obvious distress.</p><p>\u201cYes. Two totally unrelated and unexpected things. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to handle them. I\u2019m sorry to inflict this on you. It\u2019s just that...it\u2019s all too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us what\u2019s going on,\u201d Grace said gently. She\u2019d never seen her friend so disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cWell, first, it seems my ex-husband is coming here for Christmas. The girls will be home from college and he asked them if it\u2019s okay to visit and they really want him to.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI could turn him down but not them. Anyway, I talked to the Beldons, and they told me Kent has a reservation at their bed-and-breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Grace was aware that Beth was divorced but knew nothing of the circumstances.</p><p>Cliff sipped his eggnog, leaving the questions to her.</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Beth said bluntly. \u201cKent and I haven\u2019t spoken in three years\u2014well, except when it has to do with the girls. Bailey and Sophie are both away at school, so there hasn\u2019t been much need for us to communicate.\u201d</p><p>This was the most personal Beth had ever been, the most she\u2019d revealed about her divorce. Although Grace regarded her as a friend, Beth had never divulged many details about her life prior to Cedar Cove. Grace knew she spent her time with the dogs and running her farm. Her place was one of several in the area that sold live trees. In fact, the address\u20141225 Christmas Tree Lane\u2014couldn\u2019t have been more appropriate.</p><p>Cliff finally spoke up. \u201cWhy did your daughters arrange this?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.... Kent and I have always been civil. It wasn\u2019t a bitter divorce or anything. We just...grew apart. And like I said, we\u2019ve had very little to do with each other since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if the girls have some hope of a reconciliation,\u201d Grace mused, and didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d spoken out loud until she noticed both Cliff and Beth looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea for Kent to stay at the Thyme and Tide,\u201d Beth said, not responding to Grace\u2019s comment. \u201cReally, I couldn\u2019t have him at the house. It...it would be too uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I imagine it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does he arrive?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-third... This is all so unexpected\u2014and then there\u2019s Ted.\u201d</p><p>The only Ted she knew was the local vet. Considering how often Beth visited him, it made sense that they might have struck up a friendship. She gathered that Ted donated some of his services, since Beth was essentially running a charity.</p><p>\u201cThe vet,\u201d she said, confirming Grace\u2019s assumption. Beth nervously rubbed her hands together. \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of been...seeing each other. Nothing serious, though.\u201d</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t keep from smiling. She\u2019d hoped for something like this. Ted Reynolds was about Beth\u2019s age, attractive and unfailingly good-humored. Grace and Olivia had half-jokingly commented that Ted\u2019s single status was a waste. There weren\u2019t that many eligible, good-looking men around.</p><p>\u201cThen this morning...\u201d Beth stared down at the floor. \u201cRemember how I said people have been bringing me dogs?\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cWell, this morning I got a big surprise on my front porch.\u201d She let out her breath. \u201cA basket full of puppies. A large basket.\u201d</p><p>Grace could feel her pulse accelerate. If Beth had to find homes for a whole litter of puppies, then she wouldn\u2019t be keen to take Beau.</p><p>\u201cHow many puppies?\u201d Cliff asked. \u201cAnd what breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. And they seem to be black Labs. Or part Lab, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen puppies?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re adorable, but ten? How am I ever going to find homes for ten puppies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, make that eleven,\u201d Grace murmured.</p><p>\u201cEleven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Beau needs a home, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d Beth\u2019s eyes flew to Cliff.</p><p>Cliff responded with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cBeau,\u201d Grace repeated. For some time she\u2019d suspected that Beth and Cliff had joined forces against her, and this proved it. Well, they could scheme all they wanted, but they wouldn\u2019t change her mind. The puppy had to go.</p><p>\u201cBut...but didn\u2019t you say something about asking Maryellen and Jon to take Beau?\u201d Beth looked at her with desperate eyes.</p><p>\u201cI decided against it,\u201d Grace said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Cliff explained, \u201cGrace wants Beau to be adopted into a good family. But she doesn\u2019t want him going to one of our children for fear she\u2019ll see him on a regular basis. Because, unwilling though she is to admit it, she loves that dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d Grace insisted, but her argument fell on deaf ears. It was all too obvious that neither one believed her.</p><p>Even Beau\u2019s soft snore sounded more like a snort of disbelief. Seeing him curled up so contentedly on her lap made her realize how far she\u2019d lowered her guard when it came to this puppy.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll call Maryellen and ask if she\u2019ll take Beau for the kids,\u201d she said, hoping to dispel their skepticism. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll want him as a Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Beth said gratefully. She finished her eggnog and brought the empty glass to the sink. \u201cAnd thanks for the drink. I\u2019ll wait to hear from you about Beau. I apologize if I vented. It\u2019s just that everything seems to be coming down on me at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe completely understand,\u201d Cliff assured her.</p><p>Beth left a few minutes later and, the second the door closed, Cliff presented Grace with the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to call Maryellen and Jon?\u201d he asked, arching his brows. \u201cThe kids are old enough for a puppy. And Jon\u2019s certainly expressed an interest in getting a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it later,\u201d she told him, not ready to make the call. She couldn\u2019t understand why it had to be done right away. \u201cIn fact, I think it might be better if we waited until just before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted him to go to his new home as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen\u2019s busy,\u201d she said, knowing her daughter\u2019s hectic schedule. \u201cI\u2019ll call her next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d Cliff continued to hold out the phone, which only irritated her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, since it\u2019s so important to you.\u201d She grabbed the receiver and hit speed dial for her oldest daughter.</p><p>Maryellen answered on the first ring. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace\u2019s hand rested on Beau\u2019s head. \u201cCliff and I have a question for you about the kids\u2019 Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re each making a detailed list of toys they want Grandma and Grandpa Claus to buy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are.\u201d Grace liked nothing better than spoiling her grandchildren. While they were baking cookies yesterday, Katie and Drake had made a point of telling her which toys they were interested in for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think if Cliff and I got them a dog?\u201d There, it was out. Cliff didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d do it, but she had and it wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as she\u2019d expected. Beau would love the children and they\u2019d love him just as much. Watching them play with him on Saturday had told her that.</p> <p>\u201cA dog, Mom, or a puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA puppy,\u201d she clarified. \u201cI was thinking of letting them have Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d Maryellen sounded shocked. \u201cYou\u2019d give up Beau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I never intended to keep him. You knew that.\u201d Grace had certainly made her intentions clear to any and all who\u2019d listen.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but, Mom, he\u2019s your dog. He follows you everywhere. He\u2019s obviously decided you\u2019re his owner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll adjust,\u201d Grace said, refusing to let her resolve waver.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he will, but I\u2019m not so sure about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Grace didn\u2019t want to argue but found it annoying in the extreme that everyone insisted she wouldn\u2019t be able to give up Beau when the time came. They were wrong. Each and every one of them. \u201cNow, do you want him or not? Because if you don\u2019t, then...then Cliff and I will take him back to Beth Morehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, sure, we\u2019ll take Beau.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Grace\u2019s throat thickened. \u201cGood. We\u2019ll deliver him on Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>Cliff raised his hand, indicating that he wanted to say something.</p> <p>\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d Grace said, covering the mouthpiece.</p><p>\u201cWhy wait until Christmas Eve?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell Maryellen we\u2019ll bring him over this afternoon. We\u2019re headed that way later, and it would be convenient to drop him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to rush, is there?\u201d Grace muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s a Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Grace returned the phone to her ear. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard what Cliff just said. It\u2019d be great if you brought him today. He\u2019ll distract the kids from all the Christmas madness and keep them occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d Grace repeated slowly. \u201cAll right... Why not? We\u2019ll stop by this afternoon with Beau and all his paraphernalia.\u201d She was astonished by how much stuff they\u2019d managed to accumulate for one small puppy.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Come anytime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. See you later.\u201d Grace clicked off the phone and handed it back to Cliff. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d she lashed out.</p><p>He smiled, ignoring her waspish tone.</p><p>\u201cWipe that grin off your face. You think I won\u2019t be able to give up Beau? Well, you\u2019re in for a surprise, Cliff Harding. Let\u2019s go right this minute. The sooner this dog is out of my life, the better.\u201d She carefully set Beau on the floor, then hurried from room to room, shoving his chew toys and stuffed animals into a big plastic bag.</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t help, which infuriated her. This was his brilliant idea, so the least he could do was gather up Beau\u2019s food.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she snapped when she\u2019d finished. She had his toys and his bed, plus the new bag of dry puppy food she\u2019d picked up the day before. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to forget his vaccination records,\u201d she said, retrieving them at the last minute.</p><p>Beau climbed obediently into his carrying case. She\u2019d taken him to the library with her a number of times now. The moment he saw the carrier, he knew it meant a trip, and he loved being with Grace no matter where she was going.</p><p>Grace zipped up the carrier, and Beau lay down, resting his chin on his paws, perfectly content and trusting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking you to a new home,\u201d she told him. \u201cA home with children who\u2019ll run and play with you. Remember Katie and Drake? They already love you and you can play with them and...and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d Cliff said, coat on and car keys in hand.</p><p>Grace stood there, immobilized.</p><p>He waited at the door. \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She forced herself to take one step and then another. Each step required effort and determination. The carrier was still on the floor. She\u2019d have to reach down and pick it up... .</p><p>\u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>\u201cI said I was.\u201d Bending down, looking at Beau, with his dark eyes focused directly on her, she tried to reassure him and herself that this was for the best. \u201cKatie and Drake are going to love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Unblinking, Beau stared up at her.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d Cliff\u2019s voice was gentle. \u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>She started to assure him it was and then realized she couldn\u2019t. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I want at all.\u201d Just saying the words seemed to free her. \u201cI do love Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You couldn\u2019t help yourself any more than I could.\u201d Cliff came over and put his arms around her, hugging her. \u201cDoes that mean we can keep him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t Buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s Beau. Our Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Beau,\u201d she agreed. She knelt down, opening the zipper to his carrier.</p><p>Beau leaped right into her arms.</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about this,\u201d Lori told Linc as she set a tray of decorated sugar cookies on the coffee table. She rubbed her hands nervously together.</p><p>Linc had his own reservations, but was unwilling to say so. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Lori looked unconvinced. \u201cIf this is a disaster, then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept full responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d she said, coming to stand at his side. \u201cI went along with this idea of yours. So if everything goes down in flames, I\u2019m going down with you.\u201d</p><p>His wife didn\u2019t seem to hold out much hope. Linc, on the other hand, believed there was at least a chance this would all work out.</p><p>\u201cDad might not even come,\u201d Lori said, which was one objection she\u2019d raised when Linc had first suggested setting up a meeting between her parents. Kate didn\u2019t know her husband would be there, otherwise she\u2019d never have agreed to visit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you only talked to him that once. You said it hadn\u2019t gone well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and I still have some ground to cover, but one thing came through loud and clear. He loves your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mom\u2019s already filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure your father\u2019s heard about that.\u201d Linc\u2019s biggest concern was that Kate would be upset with Lori. Still, they\u2019d deal with that if they had to.</p><p>\u201cIs the coffee ready?\u201d Lori asked, glancing into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished brewing.\u201d So far they hadn\u2019t done much entertaining, not counting Mary Jo, Mack and Noelle. They were family, though... . Well, so were Kate and Leonard, but that was different. They were estranged family, which made everything a lot more tense.</p><p>Lori had cleaned the duplex until Linc thought she\u2019d scrub the paint off the walls. The kitchen floor shone so brightly he could almost see his reflection, and the furniture had been polished until it gleamed. They\u2019d put up their small Christmas tree the day before and Lori had spent hours decorating it. She\u2019d done a lovely job, too. Linc had tried to help but Lori wanted to do it her way and he was just as glad to let her.</p><p>At precisely two o\u2019clock the doorbell chimed. Lori jumped as though it had caught her completely off guard. She grabbed Linc\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou answer that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she muttered back.</p><p>Linc went to the door. Leonard stood on the other side, a frown darkening his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d</p><p>Linc didn\u2019t reply as he opened the screen door. \u201cI see you\u2019re right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get where I am in the world by showing up late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d Lori stood in the middle of the room, clenching her hands. \u201cWelcome to our home.\u201d</p><p>Leonard looked around and whether he approved or disapproved he didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to have a seat?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You said Kate would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be...\u201d Lori told him. \u201cUnless she recognizes your car and decides to leave.\u201d</p><p>Bellamy\u2019s gaze shot directly to Linc. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m coming?\u201d</p><p>Linc shook his head. \u201cWe figured it would be best not to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Leonard walked over to the window and gazed out. \u201cShe had divorce papers served to me on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lori said.</p><p>\u201cShe refuses to talk to me and then she has the gall to send a clerk from some Seattle law office to serve me with papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you grateful for the chance to talk to Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am. I\u2019ll give her a piece of my mind. We\u2019ve been married all these years and she can\u2019t talk to me? Her own husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Lori interjected sweetly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll do much good to yell at Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yelling,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Lori winced and Linc moved to her side. He\u2019d learned a valuable lesson about his father-in-law this past week. Bellamy barked loudly but rarely bit. However, when he did bite, he bit hard. Linc had the teeth marks to prove it.</p><p>\u201cMom doesn\u2019t like it when you yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently your mother finds more than the tone of my voice objectionable,\u201d Leonard said, lowering his voice.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a cup of coffee?\u201d Linc asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, we don\u2019t, especially this early in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take the coffee.\u201d He sat down on the sofa and let his hands fall between his parted knees. \u201cWhen should we expect your mother?\u201d He glanced at his watch as he asked.</p><p>\u201cAny minute,\u201d Linc said from the kitchen. Ever the optimist he poured four cups. No sooner had he finished than the doorbell rang again.</p><p>Lori answered it this time. Linc remained in the kitchen and watched as Bellamy got to his feet.</p><p>Kate stepped inside, stopping abruptly when she saw her husband. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there\u2019d be other guests,\u201d she said coldly. She stiffened as if to prepare for a confrontation. \u201cI wondered if that was your car out there, but I didn\u2019t think it could be. I can\u2019t believe my own daughter would set me up like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lori looked anxious but Leonard ignored the comment. \u201cHello, Kate.\u201d</p><p>Linc sighed with relief. At least Leonard wasn\u2019t yelling.</p><p>She gave a curt nod. \u201cLenny.\u201d</p><p>Linc suspected Kate was the only woman in the world who could address Bellamy as \u201cLenny.\u201d He carried the coffee into the living room and handed Leonard and Kate each a mug before returning for the other two. Both declined cream or sugar.</p> <p>Earlier he\u2019d brought two kitchen chairs into the small living room so there\u2019d be four places to sit. Linc and Lori sat down on the chairs, leaving Kate and Leonard no choice but to take the sofa. They sat as far away from each other as possible.</p><p>\u201cWould anyone like a cookie?\u201d Lori asked, hopping to her feet a moment later and picking up the plate.</p><p>Kate shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNone for me.\u201d Leonard held up his hand, palm out.</p><p>Lori sat down as though disappointed. She turned to Linc, her eyes pleading with him to say or do something to ease the tension in the room.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to propose a toast,\u201d Linc said.</p><p>The two older people regarded him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cTo marriage.\u201d Linc didn\u2019t wait for anyone to chime in, but raised the mug to his lips.</p><p>They each took a small sip. Linc noticed that Kate clung tightly to the mug handle and focused all her attention on her coffee. Leonard, on the other hand, kept staring at his wife as if he couldn\u2019t stop himself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you were aware of the fact that I went to see Leonard this week,\u201d Linc said to his mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate told him. \u201cLori didn\u2019t say anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have, Mom, but anytime I mentioned Dad you said you didn\u2019t want to hear his name again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Rather than allow the two women to get sidetracked, Linc continued. \u201cWe had a nice, long chat. Isn\u2019t that right, Leonard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, uh, did,\u201d Bellamy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat I found interesting was the story of your courtship.\u201d Linc paused and waited for some reaction. \u201cKate had talked about a few things, but Leonard filled in the blanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d Kate said, then added pointedly, \u201cWhen I was young and foolish and didn\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were both young and foolish.\u201d Leonard took another sip of coffee and set the mug aside.</p><p>For just an instant, Linc feared the other man was about to walk out. Fortunately, though, Leonard sat back, crossing his arms over his chest.</p> <p>\u201cThat conversation made me understand why Leonard and I started off on the wrong foot.\u201d Linc reached between the two chairs to link hands with Lori. \u201cLeonard worked hard to prove himself to your family, didn\u2019t he, Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she agreed begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cHow many years did it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few... I\u2019ve forgotten now.\u201d</p><p>Linc would bet that Kate knew, right down to the day.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d Bellamy supplied. \u201cFive long years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori and I didn\u2019t wait,\u201d Linc said. \u201cWe each saw what we wanted and went for it. That was a mistake, and one I\u2019ve regretted ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret marrying me?\u201d Lori asked, wide-eyed with shock.</p><p>Linc squeezed her hand. \u201cNot for one second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive yourself time,\u201d her mother interjected. \u201cThe regrets will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Leonard said in a sharp voice. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how much in love these two are? Don\u2019t disillusion them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I regret, Lori,\u201d Linc said to clarify his statement, \u201cis that I didn\u2019t go to your parents and give them an opportunity to meet me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to meet them,\u201d Lori insisted.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Linc said, \u201cbut I shouldn\u2019t have listened. I should\u2019ve followed my instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want him to meet us?\u201d Kate asked, staring at her daughter, her expression aghast.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Lori said again. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d tell me what bad judgment I\u2019d shown with Geoff and that you couldn\u2019t trust me to find a good man and...and I didn\u2019t want you to try to talk me out of marrying Linc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you didn\u2019t care what we thought,\u201d Leonard said. His arms remained crossed.</p><p>\u201cI did but...\u201d Lori didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cNone of that\u2019s important now,\u201d Linc continued. \u201cLori and I are married, and while Leonard and I still have some way to go in building a relationship, I believe we\u2019ve come to terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we, now?\u201d Bellamy arched his brows.</p><p>\u201cI believe we have,\u201d Linc returned calmly. \u201cWe just got off to a rocky start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re willing to forgive and forget everything my husband\u2014my soon-to-be-ex-husband\u2014did to sabotage you and your business?\u201d Kate asked aggressively.</p><p>Linc met his father-in-law\u2019s look head-on. \u201cI\u2019m willing to forget it because when I stopped to analyze Leonard\u2019s reasoning I could see his point.\u201d</p><p>Leonard uncrossed his arms and leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cThis was a man who loved his daughter enough to put an upstart like me to the test. Hopefully I passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t see why he felt it was necessary to test you at all,\u201d Kate said. \u201cAll he had to do was read the investigator\u2019s report to know you\u2019re a good man. But he wouldn\u2019t believe that. Oh, no, he was prepared to risk our relationship with our daughter just to prove he was right. He was absolutely convinced you\u2019d turn out to be underhanded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat investigator\u2019s report?\u201d Lori blurted.</p><p>Leonard ignored her question. \u201cThat was before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the two of us talked this week,\u201d Linc finished for him.</p><p>Leonard nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, while I was talking to Leonard in his office, there was something else I learned. Something that struck me as profound.\u201d</p><p>Leonard leaned forward again. Kate, too, seemed interested.</p><p>\u201cI discovered how much Leonard loves his wife and family. He\u2019s an example of the kind of husband and father I want to be to Lori and our children.\u201d While that was a stretch, it was close enough to the truth. The essential part of his remark was genuine. Leonard might be arrogant and controlling but at heart he wanted the best for his family. His intense desire to protect them sometimes made him oblivious to their desires and to their ability to make independent decisions about their own lives.</p><p>Kate glanced at her husband and Leonard met her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love my wife and my children.\u201d As though he couldn\u2019t stay seated any longer, he jumped to his feet and began to pace. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s why what happened on Friday came as such a shock. I never thought my wife would stop loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Kate retorted. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you all these years, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman who serves her husband with divorce papers brings that into question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you got the message.\u201d</p><p>Leonard turned to face her. \u201cI got it all right, loud and clear. You want to end our marriage and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Lori said, cutting off her father. \u201cDo you still love Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. That\u2019s a ridiculous question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you still love me if we\u2019re divorced?\u201d Leonard asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019d learn not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you seem quite willing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult, but I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult and completely unnecessary,\u201d Linc inserted. He gestured toward Leonard. \u201cWhen I went to his office, I found a man who\u2019s lost and broken without his wife.\u201d</p><p>Leonard opened his mouth to contradict Linc, but apparently changed his mind.</p><p>Kate shook her head. \u201cOne thing Lenny\u2019s never been is lost or broken. His pride would carry him for the rest of his life before he\u2019d admit he was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Leonard challenged, glaring at her.</p><p>Kate glared right back at him. \u201cCan you admit you made a mistake? And that you regret the way you\u2019ve treated our daughter and her husband?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Leonard looked from his wife to Linc and Lori. \u201cI...might\u2019ve been a bit hasty in judging Linc\u2019s motives for marrying Lori.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Kate muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s still not convinced.\u201d She stood and carried her mug into the kitchen. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to admit he\u2019s wrong in over thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...may have jumped to conclusions on occasion,\u201d Leonard said in a loud voice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to yell, Lenny. My hearing is perfectly good.\u201d She left the kitchen and strode to the front door. \u201cHe simply can\u2019t acknowledge when he\u2019s made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Linc frowned at his father-in-law. If Leonard didn\u2019t stop Kate now, there was nothing more Linc could do.</p><p>Kate was opening the door when Leonard shouted, \u201cOkay! Okay. Fine, if it\u2019s so important for me to say the words, then I will. I was wrong about Linc and Lori. There. Are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Kate froze, one foot inside and the other out the door.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Leonard asked.</p><p>Slowly she turned toward her husband, her head held high. \u201cCan you apologize?\u201d</p><p>Leonard hesitated and his jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Kate murmured.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Linc, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll is forgotten,\u201d Linc said, and they exchanged a handshake.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied now?\u201d Leonard asked Kate.</p><p>Instead of answering, Kate looked at Lori.</p><p>Leonard sighed. \u201cLori, you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, what?\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy.\u201d Lori walked over and gave her father a hug. He returned her hug and held his daughter close.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d he asked Kate.</p><p>She offered him a smile. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so difficult, was it?\u201d</p><p>Leonard shrugged. \u201cActually, it was, but now that I\u2019ve done it, I feel a lot better.\u201d He reached out and squeezed Lori\u2019s hand. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy, I know.\u201d She leaned forward and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love your mother, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she leaves me, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be talked into reconsidering,\u201d Kate broke in. \u201cUnder certain conditions, of course.\u201d</p><p>Leonard\u2019s features softened. \u201cWould it be possible to talk right now, just the two of us?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled and then nodded. \u201cI think that would be very nice.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they left together, in their own cars. Linc didn\u2019t hear where they planned to go but it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if it was the family home, where they both belonged.</p><p>\u201cOh, Linc,\u201d Lori said, slipping her arms around his waist. \u201cThat went so well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew it would.\u201d His in-laws would be fine, and so would he and Lori.

Luckily a unit had become available, and over the weekend they\u2019d moved Charlotte and Ben into their new apartment. The most difficult aspect of the move was deciding which furniture to take. So many pieces were part of their family history.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Will had said, \u201cyou\u2019ve go to do something with all this dead relatives\u2019 furniture. I have my own stuff\u2014I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t just get rid of it,\u201d Charlotte had moaned.</p><p>In the end, they fit what they could into the small apartment and what didn\u2019t fit was doled out to him, Olivia and Justine, with a few pieces held back for James. That appeared to satisfy Charlotte. All she wanted was to know that those antique sofas and chairs and cabinets would be loved and treasured the way they\u2019d once been. They wouldn\u2019t have the same sentimental value for him or Olivia, but he wouldn\u2019t sell them on eBay, either.</p><p>A good portion of what hadn\u2019t been allocated was stored in his basement. It could stay there indefinitely as far as Will was concerned. Being single and without children, he hadn\u2019t accumulated a lot of possessions, other than basic furniture, a TV and so on.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Mom?\u201d Will asked his sister.</p><p>\u201cI did. She\u2019s doing all right so far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, too.\u201d</p><p>The transfer of the house on Eagle Crest was a simple matter of a few signatures and a check. The house was in good shape, especially with the new kitchen. Will was happy to return to his childhood home, and even happier to be helping his mother and Ben. He\u2019d come full circle, he mused. He\u2019d lived in this old house during his childhood, and now he was back. With this move came a sense of rightness, of completion. He\u2019d been away from Cedar Cove for most of his adult life, had faltered and failed. He\u2019d disappointed himself. Moving home had given him a fresh start, a new perspective, a chance to become the man he\u2019d always wanted to be.</p><p>Miranda\u2019s decision to rent his small apartment might not be the best plan, he thought. Will frowned slightly. He had a real love-hate relationship with his assistant. She was an asset to the gallery and he\u2019d come to rely on her knowledge of art and of the community. Half the time he was convinced she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of him. Then she\u2019d do something to throw him off balance\u2014like kissing him. If that wasn\u2019t shocking enough, he\u2019d kissed her, too. And enjoyed it.</p><p>Miranda Sullivan wasn\u2019t like any of the women he\u2019d been attracted to in the past. Including Shirley... In fact, she was their opposite. That confused him, although he tried not to think about it. Sometimes he and Miranda laughed at the same things; sometimes they had lively discussions. Since they were together practically every day, it was understandable that they\u2019d grown comfortable with each other. They\u2019d developed a mutual respect\u2014and maybe even a fondness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d Olivia commented. \u201cAre you worried about Mom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...I was thinking about Miranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still taking the apartment, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she said.\u201d</p><p>Her sister eyed him warily. \u201cThen why the frown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo real reason,\u201d he said, dismissing the question. Actually, he\u2019d prefer not to discuss Miranda. It was hard enough to analyze his own feelings about her, let alone explain them to anyone else.</p><p>As soon as Charlotte and Ben walked out of the elevator, their mother broke into a huge grin. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe arranged this earlier, Mom,\u201d Olivia reminded her as she kissed their mother\u2019s cheek. She caught Will\u2019s eye. Charlotte would continue to suffer memory lapses. The appointment with the gerontologist was in January. Then they\u2019d know the extent of her memory loss and what, if anything, could be done.</p><p>\u201cBut I was talking about the singing. There\u2019ll be home-baked cookies and old-fashioned wassail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have the papers for you to sign, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cFor the sale of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know, but does that need to be done right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get everything in order. It won\u2019t take long, I promise.\u201d Olivia had her briefcase; fortunately, as a lawyer, she was qualified to handle the paperwork.</p><p>Charlotte looked at Ben. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be late for the singing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother has a lovely voice,\u201d Ben told them, as if they weren\u2019t aware of their mother\u2019s talent.</p><p>His mother had often sung him to sleep, and it was a memory Will would always hold dear.</p><p>\u201cThe choral group\u2019s asked me to join them,\u201d Charlotte said, obviously pleased by the invitation. \u201cWe sing at special events, like this Christmas gathering. We also sing at church services every week right here in the complex.\u201d</p><p>As promised, it took only a few minutes to sign the necessary papers, which they did in Charlotte and Ben\u2019s apartment. When they\u2019d finished, Olivia handed him the house keys.</p><p>\u201cSo when\u2019s moving day for you?\u201d she asked on their way out the door an hour later. They\u2019d stayed for cookies and part of the singing but left during the break. Olivia needed to get home, because she and Jack had a social engagement that evening. And Will was eager to start shifting some of his things over to the house. He wasn\u2019t especially happy to be moving in December, but there was no avoiding that. He\u2019d be out of the apartment in time for Miranda to move in January 2.</p><p>The gallery was officially closed when Will returned, although Miranda was in the office, going through some invoices.</p><p>\u201cHow did everything go with Charlotte and Ben?\u201d she asked, looking up from the desk.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I even got a few cookies out of the deal and listened to some Christmas songs.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good. Better than we expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Then, before he could change his mind, he asked, \u201cWould you like to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at the question. \u201cYou...and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I just bought a house. I\u2019m in the mood to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Shirley\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>At her comment and its implication, Will shook his head. \u201cWhat does Shirley have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I suppose, except she\u2019s the one you were hot to trot with, not me.\u201d</p><p>Will couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d heard that expression and it made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou find that amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes. Hot to trot? Give me a break.\u201d As her eyes narrowed, he quickly added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not looking at you as her replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dinner invitation wasn\u2019t meant as an insult, Miranda. However, considering your reaction, I withdraw the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The woman continually sent him mixed messages. He feared he was guilty of sending a few of those himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks for staying.\u201d He turned his back on her and hung his coat on a peg by the office door. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She reached for her coat and purse and was gone.</p><p>\u201cWell, so much for that,\u201d Will muttered. It was probably better not to waste time dining out, but he wasn\u2019t looking forward to dragging boxes from one residence to another.</p><p>Once he\u2019d loaded up his car and driven it over to the house, he spent the next half hour unloading. The house had been professionally cleaned and smelled of pine-scented cleanser. His sister had arranged this on his behalf and Will was grateful.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the living room, hands on his hips, he surveyed the home that was so familiar to him. He\u2019d make it his own, he decided, turn it into a place that suited his adult personality.</p><p>Walking into the master bedroom that had once belonged to his parents, he had to smile. As a kid a trip into this room usually meant he was due for a walloping by his father. He\u2019d gotten his share of those growing up. Olivia, too, although his father was always much gentler with her than with Will.</p><p>He relived other memories as he walked from room to room, feeling a mix of nostalgia and melancholy. This house had been a place of happiness much of the time. His parents had high expectations of him and his sister, but nothing was more important than family. He\u2014</p><p>The doorbell chimed, surprising him. He suspected it might be one of the neighbors, coming to check in. No doubt his mother had told everyone in the vicinity that he\u2019d be taking up residence.</p><p>He discovered Miranda Sullivan on the porch. She held a bucket of fried chicken in her hand and looked more than a little uncomfortable. \u201cI brought you dinner,\u201d she said, shoving the bucket at him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that.\u201d Her thoughtfulness caught him unawares.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She was about to leave when Will stopped her. \u201cWould you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and then nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much furniture in the house yet.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to mind. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten sitting on the ground more than once in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Although Will couldn\u2019t remember the last time. A picnic, probably, and that would\u2019ve been years ago. He didn\u2019t have much interest in that sort of thing.</p><p>They sat in front of the gas fireplace. Will turned it on with the flick of a switch. That was a good thing because he doubted he was capable of building a fire. A lot of years had passed since he was a Boy Scout.</p><p>The chicken was delicious. Will didn\u2019t make a habit of eating fried foods so this was a rare treat. The biscuits were good, too, especially drizzled with honey.</p><p>\u201cWhat prompted this?\u201d he asked, setting a leg bone aside and reaching for a second piece.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... . I was halfway home and trying to figure out what I should do for dinner when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you realized how foolish you\u2019d been to turn down an invitation for a meal with me,\u201d Will finished for her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought about you hauling those boxes to the house by yourself and...\u201d She paused and shook her head. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d And to his astonishment he meant it. Until the doorbell rang, Will had been wrapped up in memories of his childhood and starkly aware that he was alone. His mother had Ben, plus him and his sister. Olivia had Jack, her two children and a handful of grandkids. The reminder that he was by himself, in his sixties and without a family of his own, had left a hollow ache in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Miranda polished off a piece of chicken and wiped the grease from her hands with a paper napkin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should be completely moved within the next week,\u201d Will said, making small talk.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be settled before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea. You can start bringing your stuff over to the apartment anytime after that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Christmas?\u201d he asked, knowing she didn\u2019t have children.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure yet. Shirley and her kids are going to California to be with Larry.\u201d She seemed to be watching him for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be nice for them,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cIt\u2019ll be their first Christmas together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will, and I\u2019m pleased for Shirley, really pleased. She found the right man for her and...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be alone at Christmas. Olivia\u2019s family would include him, but much as he loved his sister and Justine and everyone, he couldn\u2019t help feeling like an obligatory guest. Uncle Will, who had nowhere else to go.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Miranda said, interrupting his thoughts, \u201cwell, this is totally selfish of me to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead,\u201d Will urged. He\u2019d begun to feel that this impromptu dinner was a turning point in his relationship with Miranda.</p><p>\u201cWell, Shirley almost always had me over for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be alone this year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have other friends,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. But as it happens, I\u2019ll be alone, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Miranda seemed stunned at the prospect. \u201cWhat about Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll invite me for dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m intruding on her family time.\u201d They\u2019d all make an effort to involve him in their activities. Yet it wasn\u2019t the same as having a family of his own, belonging to someone. Even during the worst years of his marriage, he\u2019d felt as though he belonged.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Miranda said in a low voice.</p><p>She glanced down at the carpet, and Will realized she wasn\u2019t just saying that, she really did understand how he felt, because she\u2019d experienced the same feeling herself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d he began. \u201cNo, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose what?\u201d Miranda asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re alone. I\u2019m alone.\u201d He paused, waiting for a sharp retort, a negative comment. When he saw none, Will continued. \u201cWould you like to get together here at the house, make dinner together, share Christmas Day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of us?\u201d she asked, as if she couldn\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. If you\u2019re game, I am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkey, stuffing, the whole nine yards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d He\u2019d never been much good in the kitchen but he was willing to give it a try.</p><p>She seemed to be mulling over the idea. \u201cI think we could do that,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a date. You and me and Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me and Christmas,\u201d Miranda said with a smile.</p><p>Thirty-Seven</p><p>\u201cRemember, Dad, when we used to string popcorn and put it around the Christmas tree?\u201d Jolene asked, her voice elevated with excitement as she climbed into the front seat of the car.</p><p>\u201cI remember that you ate a lot more popcorn than you managed to thread.\u201d Smiling, Bruce slid into the driver\u2019s seat and turned on the ignition.</p><p>Jolene giggled. \u201cWhere are we going to buy the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else? On Christmas Tree Lane.\u201d That was their tradition. \u201cBut first, we\u2019re meeting Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d Jolene instantly sobered.</p><p>\u201cWe invited her, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sort of. To decorate. But it\u2019s always just been the two of us when we went to get the tree.\u201d</p><p>Bruce did his best not to show how disappointed he was in her response. \u201cI want her to come with us. Can you deal with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d But she let it be known that she wasn\u2019t completely happy.</p><p>It was times like these that made Bruce want to groan with frustration. Just when it seemed they were making progress, something would happen to remind him how far they still had to go.</p><p>He drove to the terminal, where the foot ferry from Bremerton docked. Rachel had texted him earlier to say she was taking the eleven o\u2019clock ferry. He\u2019d texted back that he\u2019d be there, with Jolene, to pick her up. Then they\u2019d drive to the Christmas tree farm and select their tree. Once they got home, they\u2019d set it up; after that, they\u2019d spend the rest of the afternoon decorating it. As a family.</p><p>Jolene had received a special ornament every year since her birth. Stephanie had started that tradition, and he\u2019d continued it. Each year it was those ornaments that Bruce brought up from the basement first. With great ceremony Jolene would place them on the tree.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d mentioned that Rachel would be with them, Jolene had grabbed her cell phone and started texting.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you texting?\u201d he asked, glancing over at her in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, she was over yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was?\u201d Bruce didn\u2019t remember seeing anyone at the house.</p><p>\u201cWell, she might\u2019ve left before you got home from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bruce wasn\u2019t keen on his thirteen-year-old daughter coming home to an empty house. He\u2019d felt much better about it when Rachel lived with them. For one thing, Rachel had a day off during the week; for another, she was diligent about keeping in touch with Jolene after school. But there was no alternative as long as Rachel lived in Bremerton.</p><p>She was standing by the totem pole when Bruce pulled up. He waited for Jolene to get out of the front seat and go to the back. Instead, she stayed where she was.</p><p>\u201cJolene,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cGive Rachel that seat.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had already opened the rear door and slipped inside. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound like herself but before Bruce could say anything, Jolene said, \u201cRachel doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s happy mood was quickly whirling downward, but he had to choose his battles carefully and there were bigger ones to wage. So he dropped the issue.</p><p>He turned on the radio, which played Christmas music, and soon both he and Jolene were humming along. Rachel didn\u2019t join in. He glanced into the backseat and she offered him a tentative smile, which he returned. Still, he sensed that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>When they arrived at Beth Morehouse\u2019s farm on Christmas Tree Lane, Jolene was the first one out of the car. Beth served hot cocoa while her crew directed customers to various areas, depending on the type and size of Christmas tree they wanted. His daughter got in line for her cup of cocoa.</p><p>When Bruce came around to open Rachel\u2019s door, she had her hands over her stomach and was deathly pale.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>She gave him the same tentative smile she had earlier. \u201cI think so. I had a bad night, but I\u2019m a little better this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He was growing concerned.</p><p>\u201cNothing...I\u2019m just under the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed home,\u201d he said, crouching beside the car.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, Dad?\u201d Jolene raised a cup of hot cocoa at him.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be with you and Jolene,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week. I\u2019ve never cut my own tree before. It sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Jolene again.</p><p>Bruce glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in the car.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he stood. He didn\u2019t feel good about leaving her alone, especially if she was ill. The farm took up quite a few acres and he could be away as long as an hour, searching for the perfect tree.</p><p>Jolene joined him and looked anxiously at Rachel. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a little while. You two go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cYou can come, really. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled. \u201cI appreciate it, but I\u2019m just not feeling that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should leave you,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Rachel insisted again. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get back. Now go.\u201d</p><p>Still, Bruce hesitated, worried about her pale, clammy skin and obvious discomfort. In the end he and Jolene went in search of a tree, only his heart wasn\u2019t in it. Halfway up the hill, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Jolene asked, clearly disappointed.</p><p>\u201cRachel is my wife,\u201d he told his daughter. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong. I can feel it. You can go on by yourself if you want to. I\u2019m taking Rachel to the doctor or the hospital or whatever she needs. I\u2019m sorry our day got ruined, but Rachel\u2019s more important than a Christmas tree.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d She turned back and walked over to another tree.</p><p>Bruce wasn\u2019t waiting. He headed toward the road, moving quickly. The scent of cut evergreens mingled with the soft mist falling, but he barely noticed. By the time he reached the parking lot he was running. At some point he\u2019d realized that Jolene was right behind him.</p><p>Once he was at the car, he jerked open the back door to find Rachel curled up in the backseat. She looked at him and sobbed. \u201cI think you\u2019d better get me to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the baby?\u201d Jolene asked over his shoulder, her voice frightened.</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t answer, and Bruce saw tears streaking her face. A sense of urgency filled him as he raced around the car and jumped into the front seat. Jolene threw herself in beside him and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Dad!\u201d she cried. \u201cPlease hurry.\u201d</p><p>How they made it to the Bremerton hospital without causing an accident or getting a ticket, Bruce didn\u2019t know. He roared to a stop at the emergency entrance and dashed inside.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is pregnant and needs help!\u201d</p><p>A minute later, Rachel was whisked onto a stretcher and into an exam room, where she was seen by a physician.</p><p>\u201cIs the baby going to be okay?\u201d Jolene asked him, sounding as worried as Bruce.</p><p>He paced the waiting area restlessly, wondering how long this would take. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>He was, too, but for his daughter\u2019s sake tried to act confident and composed.</p><p>An eternity passed before the doctor came into the waiting room and called for Bruce. Jolene went with him.</p><p>\u201cYour wife has food poisoning,\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cAs far as we can tell, it was something she ate yesterday afternoon. It isn\u2019t serious but she\u2019s badly dehydrated. We\u2019d like to keep her overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the baby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour child appears to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Bruce closed his eyes, so grateful for his wife\u2019s health and his child\u2019s that it felt as if his knees might go out from under him. He slumped into a chair.</p><p>Jolene sat down next to him. \u201cWhy did Rachel come with us if she was sick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bruce placed his arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBecause she wanted to be with us\u2014to do something together as a family. Rachel never had this opportunity as a child. Her aunt didn\u2019t ever buy a tree. At Christmas she gave Rachel money and had her buy her own gift.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene dropped her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get Rachel some flowers and apologize?\u201d</p><p>Bruce squeezed her shoulders. \u201cFlowers are a nice idea, but what\u2019s more important to Rachel, and to me, is bringing her and the baby into our family. That\u2019s where they belong.\u201d</p><p>Jolene considered this over for a moment and then nodded. \u201cAt first, when I was afraid Rachel was in labor, I thought she might lose the baby. I\u2019m looking forward to when the baby comes and I felt sick inside because I know it\u2019s too early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could have lost more than the baby,\u201d he said, pressing his cheek against Jolene\u2019s hair. \u201cWe could have lost Rachel.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with both hands and started to weep. Her shoulders heaved convulsively as she buried her face in Bruce\u2019s side and gave way to her tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she gulped. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>He patted her back and whispered soothing words. He\u2019d give anything to make things right between his wife and his daughter. Counseling had helped a little, but for every step forward they seemed to take two back.</p><p>After several minutes of comforting Jolene, Bruce stood and approached the nurses\u2019 station. \u201cCan I see my wife?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll take you and your daughter back. We\u2019re getting her a bed right now. It shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bruce and Jolene followed the woman to a cubicle, where Rachel lay on a gurney. She was on her side, doubled up in almost the same position as she\u2019d been in the backseat of the car. An IV bottle was attached to her arm.</p> <p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Jolene whispered, touching her hand.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes fluttered open. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispered back, and attempted a smile.</p><p>\u201cThe doc says they want to keep you overnight,\u201d Bruce said, putting his hand on her forehead, needing to touch her, needing reassurance that she was going to be all right. Rachel and their baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined your Christmas tree outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go again when you\u2019re not so sick, okay?\u201d Jolene said as if talking to a child.</p><p>Rachel smiled again. \u201cI\u2019ll help decorate the tree, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, you can put up my special ornaments with me. I want to get one for the baby next year. One that says Baby\u2019s First Christmas\u2014just like the ornament my mom got for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be your Christmas gift for your little sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a sister!\u201d Jolene grinned at Bruce. \u201cI was hoping for a sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl?\u201d Bruce said. This was news to him. \u201cI thought you wanted to be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did, too, but I asked at my last ultrasound. I was saving the news until Christmas. This is close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl,\u201d Bruce repeated in awe. \u201cRachel, junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel, junior,\u201d Jolene muttered, shaking her head. \u201cNo way are you going to stick my sister with a name like Junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>\u201cMadison,\u201d Jolene said without a pause.</p><p>\u201cNot my daughter,\u201d Bruce said just as quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the name Corinne,\u201d Rachel told them both.</p><p>\u201cCorinne Rachel,\u201d Bruce mused. \u201cThat\u2019s a name I could live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you come home for Christmas?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cYou need someone to look after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Rachel murmured.</p><p>Bruce noticed the way they locked eyes, reading each other.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I want to do it, too. Dad needs you, and so does Baby Corinne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>Tears formed in Jolene\u2019s eyes and ran down her face. She nodded. \u201cI need you most of all.\u201d</p><p>Rachel held open her arms and Jolene went into them, sliding her own around Rachel\u2019s neck and sobbing loudly. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d Rachel whispered.</p><p>The nurse came into the cubicle. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here? Is everyone okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d Bruce smiled. And once they brought Rachel home, it would be a hundred percent true.</p><p>\u201cWe can take your wife to her room now,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>Jolene released Rachel and held on to her hand as they wheeled the gurney out of the cubicle and down the hospital corridor. As they rounded the corner, Rachel\u2019s eyes met Bruce\u2019s.</p><p>Christmas was two weeks away. They would be together as a family. And when Rachel was out of the hospital, when she\u2019d regained her strength, they\u2019d return to Christmas Tree Lane and cut down that evergreen and have a real family Christmas. He and Rachel, Jolene and...and their daughter-to-be. </p> </body></html>"]
