His name was King Lockedheart....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>LONDON</p> <p>FEBRUARY 1737</p><p>A woman abroad in St. Giles at midnight was either very foolish or very desperate. Or, as in her own case, Temperance Dews reflected wryly, a combination of both.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis said the Ghost of St. Giles haunts on nights like this,\u201d Nell Jones, Temperance\u2019s maidservant, said chattily as she skirted a noxious puddle in the narrow alley.</p><p>Temperance glanced dubiously at her. Nell had spent three years in a traveling company of actors and sometimes had a tendency toward melodrama.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no ghost haunting St. Giles,\u201d Temperance replied firmly. The cold winter night was frightening enough without the addition of specters.</p> <p>\u201cOh, indeed, there is.\u201d Nell hoisted the sleeping babe in her arms higher. \u201cHe wears a black mask and a harlequin\u2019s motley and carries a wicked sword.\u201d</p><p>Temperance frowned. \u201cA harlequin\u2019s motley? That doesn\u2019t sound very ghostlike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ghostlike if he\u2019s the dead spirit of a harlequin player come back to haunt the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor bad reviews?\u201d</p><p>Nell sniffed. \u201cAnd he\u2019s disfigured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would anyone know that if he\u2019s masked?\u201d</p> <p>They were coming to a turn in the alley, and Temperance thought she saw light up ahead. She held her lantern high and gripped the ancient pistol in her other hand a little tighter. The weapon was heavy enough to make her arm ache. She could have brought a sack to carry it in, but that would\u2019ve defeated its purpose as a deterrent. Though loaded, the pistol held but one shot, and to tell the truth, she was somewhat hazy on the actual operation of the weapon.</p><p>Still, the pistol looked dangerous, and Temperance was grateful for that. The night was black, the wind moaning eerily, bringing with it the smell of excrement and rotting offal. The sounds of St. Giles rose about them\u2014voices raised in argument, moans and laughter, and now and again the odd, chilling scream. St. Giles was enough to send the most intrepid woman running for her life.</p><p>And that was without Nell\u2019s conversation.</p><p>\u201cHorribly disfigured,\u201d Nell continued, ignoring Temperance\u2019s logic. \u201c\u2019Tis said his lips and eyelids are clean burned off, as if he died in a fire long ago. He seems to grin at you with his great yellow teeth as he comes to pull the guts from your belly.\u201d</p><p>Temperance wrinkled her nose. \u201cNell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say,\u201d Nell said virtuously. \u201cThe ghost guts his victims and plays with their entrails before slipping away into the night.\u201d</p><p>Temperance shivered. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnvy,\u201d Nell said matter-of-factly. \u201cHe envies the living.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe in spirits in any case.\u201d Temperance took a breath as they turned the corner into a small, wretched courtyard. Two figures stood at the opposite end, but they scuttled away at their approach. Temperance let out her breath. \u201cLord, I hate being abroad at night.\u201d</p><p>Nell patted the infant\u2019s back. \u201cOnly a half mile more. Then we can put this wee one to bed and send for the wet nurse in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Temperance bit her lip as they ducked into another alley. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll live until morning?\u201d</p><p>But Nell, usually quite free with her opinions, was silent. Temperance peered ahead and hurried her step. The baby looked to be only weeks old and had not yet made a sound since they\u2019d recovered her from the arms of her dead mother. Normally a thriving infant was quite loud. Terrible to think that she and Nell might\u2019ve made this dangerous outing for naught.</p><p>But then what choice had there been, really? When she\u2019d received word at the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children that a baby was in need of her help, it had still been light. She\u2019d known from bitter experience that if they\u2019d waited until morn to retrieve the child, it would either have expired in the night from lack of care or would\u2019ve already been sold for a beggar\u2019s prop. She shuddered. The children bought by beggars were often made more pitiful to elicit sympathy from passersby. An eye might be put out or a limb broken or twisted. No, she\u2019d really had no choice. The baby couldn\u2019t wait until morning.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d be very happy when they made it back to the home.</p><p>They were in a narrow passage now, the tall houses on either side leaning inward ominously. Nell was forced to walk behind Temperance or risk brushing the sides of the buildings. A scrawny cat snaked by, and then there was a shout very near.</p><p>Temperance\u2019s steps faltered.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s up ahead,\u201d Nell whispered hoarsely.</p><p>They could hear scuffling and then a sudden high scream.</p><p>Temperance swallowed. The alley had no side passages. They could either retreat or continue\u2014and to retreat meant another twenty minutes added to their journey.</p><p>That decided her. The night was chilly, and the cold wasn\u2019t good for the babe.</p><p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d she whispered to Nell.</p><p>\u201cLike a flea on a dog,\u201d Nell muttered.</p><p>Temperance squared her shoulders and held the pistol firmly in front of her. Winter, her youngest brother, had said that one need only point it and shoot. That couldn\u2019t be too hard. The light from the lantern spilled before them as she entered another crooked courtyard. Here she stood still for just a second, her light illuminating the scene ahead like a pantomime on a stage.</p><p>A man lay on the ground, bleeding from the head. But that wasn\u2019t what froze her\u2014blood and even death were common enough in St. Giles. No, what arrested her was the second man. He crouched over the first, his black cloak spread to either side of him like the wings of a great bird of prey. He held a long black walking stick, the end tipped with silver, echoing his hair, which was silver as well. It fell straight and long, glinting in the lantern\u2019s light. Though his face was mostly in darkness, his eyes glinted from under the brim of a black tricorne. Temperance could feel the weight of the stranger\u2019s stare. It was as if he physically touched her.</p><p>\u201cLord save and preserve us from evil,\u201d Nell murmured, for the first time sounding fearful. \u201cCome away, ma\u2019am. Swiftly!\u201d</p><p>Thus urged, Temperance ran across the courtyard, her shoes clattering on the cobblestones. She darted into another passage and left the scene behind.</p><p>\u201cWho was he, Nell?\u201d she panted as they made their way through the stinking alley. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>The passage let out suddenly into a wider road, and Temperance relaxed a little, feeling safer without the walls pressing in.</p><p>Nell spat as if to clear a foul taste from her mouth.</p><p>Temperance looked at her curiously. \u201cYou sounded like you knew that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew him, no,\u201d Nell replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen him about. That was Lord Caire. He\u2019s best left to himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Nell shook her head, pressing her lips firmly together. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be speaking about the likes of him to you at all, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Temperance let that cryptic comment go. They were on a better street now\u2014some of the shops had lanterns hanging by the doors, lit by the inhabitants within. Temperance turned one more corner onto Maiden Lane, and the foundling home came within sight. Like its neighbors, it was a tall brick building of cheap construction. The windows were few and very narrow, the doorway unmarked by any sign. In the fifteen precarious years of the foundling home\u2019s existence, there had never been a need to advertise.</p><p>Abandoned and orphaned children were all too common in St. Giles.</p><p>\u201cHome safely,\u201d Temperance said as they reached the door. She set down the lantern on the worn stone step and took out the big iron key hanging by a cord at her waist. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a dish of hot tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put this wee one to bed,\u201d Nell said as they entered the dingy little hall. It was spotlessly clean, but that didn\u2019t hide the fallen plaster or the warped floorboards.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Temperance removed her cloak and was just hanging it on a peg when a tall male form appeared at the far doorway.</p><p>\u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and turned. \u201cOh! Oh, Winter, I did not know you\u2019d returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d her younger brother said drily. He nodded to the maidservant. \u201cA good eventide to you, Nell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d Nell curtsied and looked nervously between brother and sister. \u201cI\u2019ll just see to the, ah, children, shall I?\u201d</p><p>And she fled upstairs, leaving Temperance to face Winter\u2019s disapproval alone.</p><p>Temperance squared her shoulders and moved past her brother. The foundling home was long and narrow, squeezed by the neighboring houses. There was one room off the small entryway. It was used for dining and, on occasion, receiving the home\u2019s infrequent important visitors. At the back of the house were the kitchens, which Temperance entered now. The children had all had their dinner promptly at five o\u2019clock, but neither she nor her brother had eaten.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to make some tea,\u201d she said as she went to stir the fire. Soot, the home\u2019s black cat, got up from his place in front of the hearth and stretched before padding off in search of mice. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of beef left from yesterday and some new radishes I bought at market this morning.\u201d</p><p>Behind her Winter sighed. \u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>She hurried to find the kettle. \u201cThe bread\u2019s a bit stale, but I can toast it if you like.\u201d</p><p>He was silent and she finally turned and faced the inevitable.</p><p>It was worse than she feared. Winter\u2019s long, thin face merely looked sad, which always made her feel terrible. She hated to disappoint him.</p><p>\u201cIt was still light when we set out,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>He sighed again, taking off his round black hat and sitting at the kitchen table. \u201cCould you not wait for my return, sister?\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked at her brother. Winter was only five and twenty, but he bore himself with the air of a man twice his age. His countenance was lined with weariness, his wide shoulders slumped beneath his ill-fitting black coat, and his long limbs were much too thin. For the last five years, he had taught at the tiny daily school attached to the home.</p><p>On Papa\u2019s death last year, Winter\u2019s work had increased tremendously. Concord, their eldest brother, had taken over the family brewery. Asa, their next-eldest brother, had always been rather dismissive of the foundling home and had a mysterious business of his own. Both of their sisters, Verity, the eldest of the family, and Silence, the youngest, were married. That had left Winter to manage the foundling home. Even with her help\u2014she\u2019d worked at the home since the death of her husband nine years before\u2014the task was overwhelming for one man. Temperance feared for her brother\u2019s well-being, but both the foundling home and the tiny day school had been founded by Papa. Winter felt it was his filial duty to keep the two charities alive.</p><p>If his health did not give out first.</p><p>She filled the teakettle from the water jar by the back door. \u201cHad we waited, it would have been full dark with no assurance that the babe would still be there.\u201d She glanced at him as she placed the kettle over the fire. \u201cBesides, have you not enough work to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lose my sister, think you that I\u2019d be more free of work?\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked away guiltily.</p><p>Her brother\u2019s voice softened. \u201cAnd that discounts the lifelong sorrow I would feel had anything happened to you this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNell knew the mother of the baby\u2014a girl of less than fifteen years.\u201d Temperance took out the bread and carved it into thin slices. \u201cBesides, I carried the pistol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Winter said behind her. \u201cAnd had you been accosted, would you have used it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said with flat certainty.</p><p>\u201cAnd if the shot misfired?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. Their father had brought up all her brothers to debate a point finely, and that fact could be quite irritating at times.</p><p>She carried the bread slices to the fire to toast. \u201cIn any case, nothing did happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis night.\u201d Winter sighed again. \u201cSister, you must promise me you\u2019ll not act so foolishly again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Temperance mumbled, concentrating on the toast. \u201cHow was your day at the school?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she thought Winter wouldn\u2019t consent to her changing the subject. Then he said, \u201cA good day, I think. The Samuels lad remembered his Latin lesson finally, and I did not have to punish any of the boys.\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced at him with sympathy. She knew Winter hated to take a switch to a palm, let alone cane a boy\u2019s bottom. On the days that Winter had felt he must punish a boy, he came home in a black mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said simply.</p> <p>He stirred in his chair. \u201cI returned for luncheon, but you were not here.\u201d</p><p>Temperance took the toast from the fire and placed it on the table. \u201cI must have been taking Mary Found to her new position. I think she\u2019ll do quite well there. Her mistress seemed very kind, and the woman took only five pounds as payment to apprentice Mary as her maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod willing she\u2019ll actually teach the child something so we won\u2019t see Mary Found again.\u201d</p><p>Temperance poured the hot water into their small teapot and brought it to the table. \u201cYou sound cynical, brother.\u201d</p><p>Winter passed a hand over his brow. \u201cForgive me. Cynicism is a terrible vice. I shall try to correct my humor.\u201d</p><p>Temperance sat and silently served her brother, waiting. Something more than her late-night adventure was bothering him.</p> <p>At last he said, \u201cMr. Wedge visited whilst I ate my luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wedge was their landlord. Temperance paused, her hand on the teapot. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll give us only another two weeks, and then he\u2019ll have the foundling home forcibly vacated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>Temperance stared at the little piece of beef on her plate. It was stringy and hard and from an obscure part of the cow, but she\u2019d been looking forward to it. Now her appetite was suddenly gone. The foundling home\u2019s rent was in arrears\u2014they hadn\u2019t been able to pay the full rent last month and nothing at all this month. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have bought the radishes, Temperance reflected morosely. But the children hadn\u2019t had anything but broth and bread for the last week.</p><p>\u201cIf only Sir Gilpin had remembered us in his will,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Sir Stanley Gilpin had been Papa\u2019s good friend and the patron of the foundling home. A retired theater owner, he\u2019d managed to make a fortune on the South Sea Company and had been wily enough to withdraw his funds before the notorious bubble burst. Sir Gilpin had been a generous patron while alive, but on his unexpected death six months before, the home had been left floundering. They\u2019d limped along, using what money had been saved, but now they were in desperate straits.</p><p>\u201cSir Gilpin was an unusually generous man, it would seem,\u201d Winter replied. \u201cI have not been able to find another gentleman so willing to fund a home for the infant poor.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance poked at her beef. \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lord shall provide,\u201d Winter said, pushing aside his half-eaten meal and rising. \u201cAnd if he does not, well, then perhaps I can take on private students in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already work too many hours,\u201d Temperance protested. \u201cYou hardly have time to sleep as it is.\u201d</p><p>Winter shrugged. \u201cHow can I live with myself if the innocents we protect are thrown into the street?\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked down at her plate. She had no answer to that.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Her brother held out his hand and smiled.</p><p>Winter\u2019s smiles were so rare, so precious. When he smiled, his entire face lit as if from a flame within, and a dimple appeared on one cheek, making him look boyish, more his true age.</p><p>One couldn\u2019t help smiling back when Winter smiled, and Temperance did so as she laid her hand in his. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us visit our charges,\u201d he said as he took a candle and led her to the stairs. \u201cHave you ever noticed that they look quite angelic when asleep?\u201d</p><p>Temperance laughed as they climbed the narrow wooden staircase to the next floor. There was a small hall here with three doors leading off it. They peered in the first as Winter held his candle high. Six tiny cots lined the walls of the room. The youngest of the foundlings slept here, two or three to a cot. Nell lay in an adult-sized bed by the door, already asleep.</p><p>Winter walked to the cot nearest Nell. Two babes lay there. The first was a boy, red-haired and pink-cheeked, sucking on his fist as he slept. The second child was half the size of the first, her cheeks pale and her eyes hollowed, even in sleep. Tiny whorls of fine black hair decorated her crown.</p><p>\u201cThis is the baby you rescued tonight?\u201d Winter asked softly.</p><p>Temperance nodded. The little girl looked even more frail next to the thriving baby boy.</p><p>But Winter merely touched the baby\u2019s hand with a gentle finger. \u201cHow do you like the name Mary Hope?\u201d</p><p>Temperance swallowed past the thickness in her throat. \u201c\u2019Tis very apt.\u201d</p><p>Winter nodded and, with a last caress for the tiny babe, left the room. The next door led to the boys\u2019 dormitory. Four beds held thirteen boys, all under the age of nine\u2014the age when they were apprenticed out. The boys lay with limbs sprawled, faces flushed in sleep. Winter smiled and pulled a blanket over the three boys nearest the door, tucking in a leg that had escaped the bed.</p><p>Temperance sighed. \u201cOne would never think that they spent an hour at luncheon hunting for rats in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Winter answered as he closed the door softly behind them. \u201cSmall boys grow so swiftly to men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do indeed.\u201d Temperance opened the last door\u2014the one to the girls\u2019 dormitory\u2014and a small face immediately popped off a pillow.</p><p>\u201cDid you get \u2019er, ma\u2019am?\u201d Mary Whitsun whispered hoarsely.</p><p>She was the eldest of the girls in the foundling home, named for the Whitsunday morning nine years before when she\u2019d been brought to the home as a child of three. Young though Mary Whitsun was, Temperance had to sometimes leave her in charge of the other children\u2014as she\u2019d had to tonight.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mary,\u201d Temperance whispered back. \u201cNell and I brought the babe home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Mary Whitsun yawned widely.</p><p>\u201cYou did well watching the children,\u201d Temperance whispered. \u201cNow sleep. A new day will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Mary Whitsun nodded sleepily and closed her eyes.</p><p>Winter picked up a candlestick from a little table by the door and led the way out of the girls\u2019 dormitory. \u201cI shall take your kind advice, sister, and bid you good night.\u201d</p><p>He lit the candlestick from his own and gave it to Temperance.</p><p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have one more cup of tea before retiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay up too late,\u201d Winter said. He touched her cheek with a finger\u2014much as he had the babe\u2014and turned to mount the stairs.</p><p>Temperance watched him go, frowning at how slowly he moved up the stairs. It was past midnight, and he would rise again before five of the clock to read, write letters to prospective patrons, and prepare his school lessons for the day. He would lead the morning prayers at breakfast, hurry to his job as schoolmaster, work all morning before taking one hour for a meager luncheon, and then work again until after dark. In the evening, he heard the girls\u2019 lessons and read from the Bible to the older children. Yet, when she voiced her worries, Winter would merely raise an eyebrow and inquire who would do the work if not he?</p><p>Temperance shook her head. She should be to bed as well\u2014her day started at six of the clock\u2014but these moments by herself in the evening were precious. She\u2019d sacrifice a half hour\u2019s sleep to sit alone with a cup of tea.</p><p>So she took her candle back downstairs. Out of habit, she checked to see that the front door was locked and barred. The wind whistled and shook the shutters as she made her way to the kitchen, and the back door rattled. She checked it as well and was relieved to see the door still barred. Temperance shivered, glad she was no longer outside on a night like this. She rinsed out the teapot and filled it again. To make a pot of tea with fresh leaves and only for herself was a terrible luxury. Soon she\u2019d have to give this up as well, but tonight she\u2019d enjoy her cup.</p><p>Off the kitchen was a tiny room. Its original purpose was forgotten, but it had a small fireplace, and Temperance had made it her own private sitting room. Inside was a stuffed chair, much battered but refurbished with a quilted blanket thrown over the back. A small table and a footstool were there as well\u2014all she needed to sit by herself next to a warm fire.</p><p>Humming, Temperance placed her teapot and cup, a small dish of sugar, and the candlestick on an old wooden tray. Milk would have been nice, but what was left from this morning would go toward the children\u2019s breakfast on the morrow. As it was, the sugar was a shameful luxury. She looked at the small bowl, biting her lip. She really ought to put it back; she simply didn\u2019t deserve it. After a moment, she took the sugar dish off the tray, but the sacrifice brought her no feeling of wholesome goodness. Instead she was only weary. Temperance picked up the tray, and because both her hands were full, she backed into the door leading to her little sitting room.</p><p>Which was why she didn\u2019t notice until she turned that the sitting room was already occupied.</p><p>There, sprawled in her chair like a conjured demon, sat Lord Caire. His silver hair spilled over the shoulders of his black cape, a cocked hat lay on one knee, and his right hand caressed the end of his long ebony walking stick. This close, she realized that his hair gave lie to his age. The lines about his startlingly blue eyes were few, his mouth and jaw firm. He couldn\u2019t be much older than five and thirty.</p><p>He inclined his head at her entrance and spoke, his voice deep and smooth and softly dangerous.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>SHE STOOD WITH quiet confidence, this respectable woman who lived in the sewer that was St. Giles. Her eyes had widened at the sight of him, but she made no move to flee. Indeed, finding a strange man in her pathetic sitting room seemed not to frighten her at all.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI am Lazarus Huntington, Lord Caire,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, studying her. She knew him, yet did not recoil in horror? Yes, she\u2019d do quite well. \u201cI\u2019ve come to make a proposition to you, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>Still no sign of fear, though she eyed the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen the wrong lady, my lord. The night is late. Please leave my house.\u201d</p><p>No fear and no deference to his rank. An interesting woman indeed.</p><p>\u201cMy proposition is not, er, illicit in nature,\u201d he drawled. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s quite respectable. Or nearly so.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked down at her tray, and then back up at him. \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. Tea? When had he last been offered something so very prosaic by a woman? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>But he replied gravely enough. \u201cThank you, no.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThen if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand to indicate permission.</p><p>She set the tea tray on the wretched little table and sat on the padded footstool to pour herself a cup. He watched her. She was a monochromatic study. Her dress, bodice, hose, and shoes were all flat black. A fichu tucked in at her severe neckline, an apron, and a cap\u2014no lace or ruffles\u2014were all white. No color marred her aspect, making the lush red of her full lips all the more startling. She wore the clothes of a nun, yet had the mouth of a sybarite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The contrast was fascinating\u2014and arousing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Puritan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her beautiful mouth compressed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He noted she did not say she was Church of England either. She probably belonged to one of the many obscure nonconformist sects, but then he was interested in her religious beliefs only as they impacted his own mission.</p> <p>She took a sip of tea. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMrs. Dews and her brother are well-known for their good deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her tone was dry. \u201cI was not aware we were so famous beyond the boundaries of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>She might look demure, but there were teeth behind the prim expression. And she was quite right\u2014he would never have heard of her had he not spent the last month stalking the shadows of St. Giles. Stalking fruitlessly, which was why he\u2019d followed her home and sat before this miserable fire now.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the back door was unlocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her brown eyes met his over her teacup. They were an odd light color, almost golden. \u201cWhy are you here, Lord Caire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to hire you, Mrs. Dews,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She stiffened and set her teacup down on the tray. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the task for which I wish to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past midnight, my lord, and I\u2019m not inclined to games even during the day. Please leave or I shall be forced to call my brother.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cNot a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m widowed, as I\u2019m sure you already know.\u201d She turned to look into the fire, presenting a dismissive profile to him.</p><p>He stretched his legs in what room there was, his boots nearly in the fire. \u201cYou\u2019re quite correct\u2014I do know. I also know that you and your brother have not paid the rent on this property in nearly two months.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, merely sipping her tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay handsomely for your time,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She looked at him finally, and he saw a golden flame in those pale brown eyes. \u201cYou think all women can be bought?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his thumb across his chin, considering the question. \u201cYes, I do, though perhaps not strictly by money. And I do not limit it to women\u2014all men can be bought in one form or another as well. The only trouble is in finding the applicable currency.\u201d</p><p>She simply stared at him with those odd eyes.</p> <p>He dropped his hand, resting it on his knee. \u201cYou, for instance, Mrs. Dews. I would\u2019ve thought your currency would be money for your foundling home, but perhaps I\u2019m mistaken. Perhaps I\u2019ve been fooled by your plain exterior, your reputation as a prim widow. Perhaps you would be better persuaded by influence or knowledge or even the pleasures of the flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t said what you want me for.\u201d</p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t moved, hadn\u2019t changed expression at all, her voice had a rough edge. He caught it only because he had years of experience at the chase. His nostrils flared involuntarily, as if the hunter within was trying to scent her. Which of his list had interested her?</p><p>\u201cA guide.\u201d His eyelids drooped as he pretended to examine his fingernails. \u201cMerely that.\u201d He watched her from under his brows and saw when that lush mouth pursed.</p><p>\u201cA guide to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a guide?\u201d</p><p>Ah, this was where it got tricky. \u201cI\u2019m searching for... a certain person in St. Giles. I would like to interview some of the inhabitants, but I find my search confounded by my ignorance of the area and the people and by their reluctance to talk to me. Hence, a guide.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had narrowed as she listened, her fingers tapping against the teacup. \u201cWhom do you search for?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cNot unless you agree to be my guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is all you want? A guide? Nothing else?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, watching her.</p><p>She turned to look into the fire as if consulting it. For a moment, the only sound in the room was the snap of a piece of coal falling. He waited patiently, caressing the silver head of his cane.</p><p>Then she faced him fully. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Your money does not tempt me. It\u2019s a stopgap measure that would only delay our eventual eviction.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, watching as she carefully licked those lush lips, preparing her argument, no doubt. He felt the beat of the pulse beneath his skin, his body\u2019s response to her feminine vitality. \u201cWhat do you want, then, Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze levelly, almost in challenge. \u201cI want you to introduce me to the wealthy and titled people of London. I want you to help me find a new patron for our foundling home.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus kept his mouth firmly straight, but he felt a surge of triumph as the prim widow ran headlong into his talons.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Now, King Lockedheart was a very proud man. For though he had been born to a small and insignificant kingdom, he had, through courage, guile, and daring, defeated the surrounding larger countries until he controlled a vast and powerful kingdom. To the north were mountains rich in minerals and sparkling gems. To the east, fields of golden grains and fat cattle. To the south lay tall hardwood forests. And to the west was an ocean overflowing with silver fish. A man could start from the capital city and walk a month in any direction and not leave the lands belonging to King Lockedheart....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance caught her breath, feeling suddenly as if the jaws of a trap had slammed shut around her. She didn\u2019t let her gaze waver, however. Lord Caire struck her as something of a predator, and it wouldn\u2019t do to show fear in his presence. Instead, she leaned forward and gently poured herself another dish of tea. She noted with some pride that her hands were steady.</p><p>When she\u2019d taken a sip, she looked at him, this exotic creature lounging in her drab little sitting room, and squared her shoulders. \u201cLet us discuss the particulars of our arrangement, my lord.\u201d</p><p>His wide, sensuous lips quirked as if he found her amusing. \u201cSuch as, Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Naturally, she\u2019d never made a pact such as this in her life, but she did bargain regularly with the butcher and the fishmonger and the various tradespeople one dealt with when running a foundling home. And she fancied she was not such a bad bargainer.</p><p>Temperance set down her teacup. \u201cI\u2019ll need money for living expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving expenses?\u201d His black eyebrows arched up his forehead.</p><p>She felt a bit brash asking for money when they\u2019d already settled on his introducing her to potential patrons as his part of the bargain. But the truth was that the home needed the money. Desperately.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, lifting her chin. \u201cAs you yourself noted, our rent is in arrears. In addition, the children haven\u2019t had a proper meal in days. I need money to buy some beef, vegetables, bread, tea, and milk. Not to mention both Joseph Tinbox and Joseph Smith need new shoes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph Tinbox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd most of the younger Marys need new chemises,\u201d Temperance finished in a defiant rush.</p><p>For a moment, Lord Caire merely watched her with those mysterious sapphire eyes. Then he stirred. \u201cExactly how many children do you house in this home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven and twenty,\u201d Temperance said promptly, then remembered tonight\u2019s work. \u201cI beg your pardon. Eight and twenty with the addition of Mary Hope\u2014the babe I brought home tonight. We also have two infants who are under the care of wet nurses at the moment outside the home. When they are weaned, they\u2019ll come to live here as well. And, of course, I live here with my brother, Winter, and our maidservant, Nell Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly three adults for so many children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Temperance leaned forward in her eagerness. \u201cYou see why we need a patron? If we had proper funding, we could hire another nursemaid or two and perhaps a cook and a manservant. We could serve meat at both luncheon and dinner, and all the boys could wear decent shoes. We could pay a good apprenticeship fee and outfit each child in new clothes and shoes when they leave the home. They\u2019d be so much better prepared to face the world.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI can well afford to maintain your home if you wish to renegotiate my part of this bargain.\u201d</p><p>Temperance pursed her lips. She didn\u2019t know this man. How could she be certain that he\u2019d take the position of patron responsibly? Or that he wouldn\u2019t abandon them after only a month or two?</p><p>And, of course, there was an even more important consideration. \u201cThe home\u2019s patron must be respectable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I see.\u201d She expected him to be insulted, but he merely gave her an ironic half smile. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll stand you the monies needed to pay your home\u2019s rent as well as enough for the various expenses the children have. In return, however, I will expect you to be ready to lead me into St. Giles tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>So soon? \u201cOf course,\u201d Temperance replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said, his voice dangerously soft. \u201cI will expect you to serve me until such time as I no longer have need of your services.\u201d</p><p>Temperance blinked, feeling wary. Surely it was the height of foolishness to bind herself to a stranger for an indefinite length of time? \u201cHow long do you think your search will take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must have an end date in mind? If you don\u2019t find what you want, say, within a month, you\u2019ll give up your search?\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her, a small smile flickering at the corner of his mouth, and it crashed down on her\u2014again\u2014that she didn\u2019t know this man. She knew nothing about him, in fact, beyond Nell\u2019s ominous warning about him. For a moment, Temperance felt fear creep on little spider feet up her spine.</p><p>She straightened. They\u2019d made a bargain, and she\u2019d not dishonor herself by reneging on it. The home and all the children in it depended on her.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI will help you for an indefinite time. But I will need forewarning when you wish to go into St. Giles. I have duties within the home and will have to find someone to take my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mainly search at night,\u201d Lord Caire drawled. \u201cIf you require a replacement for your work at the home, I will fund that as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut if we are to go out at night, then the children should already be abed. Hopefully, I will not be needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon will you be able to take me to meet potential patrons for the home?\u201d She would somehow have to find a new dress and shoes at the very minimum. Her usual black stuff workday clothes wouldn\u2019t do for meeting the wealthy of society.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA fortnight? Perhaps more. I may need to go begging for invitations to the more sedate parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d A fortnight was not very much time, but then again, the home needed immediate help. She couldn\u2019t afford to wait longer.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen I believe our negotiations are concluded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d she said.</p><p>He halted in the act of raising his hat to his head. \u201cIndeed, Mrs. Dews? You yourself have said I\u2019ve been generous. What more do you need?\u201d</p><p>The tiny smile was gone from his mouth, and he was looking rather intimidating, but Temperance swallowed and lifted her chin. \u201cInformation.\u201d</p><p>He merely cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the name of the person you are looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cDo you know what they look like or the areas where they habitually frequent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this person a man or a woman?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled, deep lines incising themselves into his lean cheeks. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath, not a little frustrated. \u201cHow do you expect me to find this person for you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cI merely expect you to help me search. I\u2019d think that there would be several sources of gossip in St. Giles. Lead me to them and I will do the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She already had an idea of who might be a good source of \u201cgossip.\u201d Temperance stood and held out her hand. \u201cI accept your bargain, Lord Caire.\u201d</p> <p>For an awful moment, he merely stared at her out-thrust hand. Perhaps he found the gesture too masculine or simply silly. But then he stood as well, and in the small space, she had to tilt her head to look him in the face. She was suddenly aware of how much bigger he was than she.</p><p>He took her hand, a strangely frozen expression on his face, shook it quickly, and let go as if her palm had burned him.</p><p>She was still puzzling over the odd little moment when he placed his hat on his head, swirled his cape about his shoulders, and nodded. \u201cI shall come for you tomorrow evening in the alley outside your kitchen door at nine o\u2019clock. Until then, I bid you good night, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>Temperance blinked and then hurried out to the kitchen to bar the back door. Soot got up from the hearth as she entered.</p> <p>\u201cThat door was locked. I know it,\u201d she muttered to the cat. \u201cHow did he get in?\u201d</p><p>But the cat merely yawned and stretched lazily.</p><p>Temperance sighed and went back to her sitting room for her tea things. As she entered the room, she glanced at the chair in which Lord Caire had lounged. There, in the middle of the seat, was a small purse. Temperance snatched it up and opened it. Gold coins spilled into her palm, more than enough to pay Mr. Wedge his rent.</p><p>Lord Caire had paid in advance, it seemed.</p><p>BASHAM\u2019S COFFEEHOUSE WAS boisterously loud by the time Lazarus entered the doors late the next afternoon. He wound his way past a table of elderly gentlemen in full-bottomed wigs arguing heatedly over a newspaper and made his way to a solitary gentleman in a gray wig in the corner. The man sat peering through half-moon spectacles at a pamphlet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ruin your eyes trying to read that dreck, St. John,\u201d Lazarus said as he took a chair across from his old friend.</p> <p>\u201cCaire,\u201d Godric St. John murmured. He tapped the pamphlet. \u201cThis writer\u2019s thesis isn\u2019t entirely unimaginable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly partially? I am relieved.\u201d Lazarus snapped his fingers at one of the youths flying back and forth with loaded trays of coffee. \u201cOne here.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to find St. John gazing at him over his spectacles. With his somber tie wig, spectacles, and plain dress, others sometimes mistook St. John for a grandfather. In fact, he and St. John were of the same age\u2014four and thirty. On closer examination, one noticed St. John\u2019s clear gray eyes, his strong jaw, and his dark brows. Only the truly perceptive saw the ever-present sorrow that wrapped St. John like a death shroud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a translation for you to look at,\u201d Lazarus said. He withdrew a sheaf of papers from his coat pocket and handed it to the other man.</p><p>St. John peered at the papers. \u201cCatullus? This will set Burgess\u2019s back up.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus snorted. \u201cBurgess thinks he\u2019s the foremost authority on Catullus. The man has as much knowledge of Roman poetry as the average snot-nosed schoolboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, naturally.\u201d St. John lifted an eyebrow behind his spectacles, looking faintly amused. \u201cBut you\u2019ll start a nasty brawl with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope so,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cCan you glance at it and give me your opinion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>There was a shout at the next table, and a tankard of coffee was flung to the floor.</p><p>Lazarus looked up. \u201cAre they discussing politics or religion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolitics.\u201d St. John glanced at the arguing gentlemen dispassionately. \u201cThe newspapers are saying that Wakefield is calling for yet another gin bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think by now he would have learned that too many of his fellow peers\u2019 fortunes depend upon the sale of gin.\u201d</p><p>St. John shrugged. \u201cWakefield\u2019s argument is sound. When so many of the poor become enfeebled by gin, it hurts London\u2019s industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and no doubt the fat country baron faced with either selling his excess grain to a gin distiller or letting it rot will put London\u2019s health before money in his pocket. Wakefield\u2019s a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idealist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I repeat, a fool,\u201d Lazarus drawled. \u201cHis ideals do nothing but make him enemies. He\u2019d do better pounding his head against a stone wall than trying to get Parliament to pass an effective gin bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have us simply sit back and let London go to rot?\u201d St. John inquired.</p><p>Lazarus waved a hand. \u201cYou ask as if there is another option. I submit there is not. Wakefield and his ilk would like to believe that they can change the course we sail, but they are deluded. Mark me well: pigs will sprout feathered wings and fly about Westminster before gin is taken away from the London rabble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe depth of your cynicism is breathtaking as always.\u201d</p><p>A boy slid a tankard of coffee in front of Lazarus.</p><p>\u201cThank you, you young imp.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus tossed a penny, and the coffee boy handily caught it before scampering back to the stall where the coffee was brewed. Lazarus took a sip of the hot liquid, and when he lowered his tankard, caught St. John examining him like an insect under a magnifying glass.</p><p>\u201cYou stare at me as if I had pox sores on my face,\u201d Lazarus said.</p><p>\u201cSomeday you no doubt will,\u201d St. John replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve bedded enough whores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have needs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have indulgences,\u201d St. John interrupted quietly, \u201cand you make no effort to rein them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why should I?\u201d Lazarus asked. \u201cDoes the wolf mourn his joy at running down his prey? The hawk the desire to soar and then dive to catch the hare in his talons? It is in their nature, just as my... needs... are in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf and the hawk have no conscience, no soul, as you very well know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women I use are paid quite well for their time. My needs hurt no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d St. John asked softly. \u201cI wonder if they hurt you, Caire.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus curled his upper lip. \u201cThis is an old argument and one that neither one of us has yet to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I give up the argument, I give up you as well.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus rapped his fingers against the worn tabletop, saying nothing. Damned if he\u2019d submit to St. John\u2019s worries. His needs were unusual\u2014strange, even\u2014but certainly not morbid.</p><p>Of course, St. John had no problem with probing where he wasn\u2019t wanted.</p><p>The other man shook his head and leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou were out last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious me! Have you become a fortune-teller? Or were you \u2019round my town house last night and found me absent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d St. John calmly pushed his spectacles up onto his forehead. \u201cYou wear the same look as last time I saw you, a kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeariness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to say desperation.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus took a sip of the hot coffee, damnably aware that he was buying time, but in the end, all he could reply was, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had such a flair for the dramatic. Desperation seems to overstate the case by miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d St. John peered absently into his own tankard of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019ve worn that look since Marie\u2019s death. Do you deny that you were searching for her killer last night yet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lazarus sat back in his chair, regarding his old friend from beneath half-lowered eyelids. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed, man.\u201d St. John said the words evenly, which somehow only gave them more impact. \u201cShe\u2019s been dead nearly two months, and you\u2019ve spent every night looking for her murderer. Tell me, Lazarus, when will you give up the hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would you give up if Clara were murdered?\u201d Lazarus shot back.</p><p>The only sign of how deeply the arrow hit was a small tic on St. John\u2019s jaw. \u201cNever. But the cases are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Because you are married to your woman whilst Marie was merely my mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d St. John said gently. \u201cBecause I love Clara.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus looked away. However much a mean-spirited part of him wanted to deny that difference, he couldn\u2019t in truth do it. For St. John was right: he did love his Clara.</p><p>Whereas Lazarus had never loved anyone at all.</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE this, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t like it at all,\u201d Nell said late that night in the foundling home kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your disapproval quite plain,\u201d Temperance muttered as she tied her cloak under her chin.</p><p>Nell was undeterred by the reminder. \u201cWhat if he has designs upon your virtue? What if he seduces and abandons you? Or worse\u2014what if he sells you to a whoremonger? Oh, ma\u2019am! Terrible things could happen to you!\u201d</p><p>Temperance suppressed a shiver at the thought of Lord Caire doing \u201cterrible things\u201d to her. It should have been a shiver of revulsion. Instead, the thought of Lord Caire\u2019s sexual proclivities made her unnaturally curious. That wicked wanton part of her sat up and twitched its nose, eager as ever to be let loose. That she couldn\u2019t let happen. Once, long ago, she\u2019d let her base nature take control and had committed an unforgivable sin. Ever since, she\u2019d lived every day knowing she must atone and refrain from letting her demons loose again.</p><p>Temperance yanked her hood over her head. \u201cI very much doubt Lord Caire is interested in doing anything at all to me\u2014terrible or not\u2014and besides, I\u2019ve brought the pistol.\u201d</p><p>Nell moaned. \u201cHe\u2019s not like other gentlemen, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Temperance hefted the soft bag that concealed the pistol. \u201cYou\u2019ve made these mysterious hints before. Tell me now\u2014in what way is Lord Caire different from other men?\u201d</p><p>Nell bit her lip, stood on one foot and then the other, and finally squeezed her eyes shut and said quickly, \u201cHis bedsport.\u201d</p><p>Temperance waited, but no other explanation was forthcoming from the maidservant. Finally she sighed, keeping a firm rein on the part of her that had leapt at the word bedsport. \u201cThe home is in danger of closing. I can\u2019t let what Lord Caire does in his bedchamber keep me from using his assistance.\u201d</p><p>Nell\u2019s eyes popped wide in alarm. \u201cBut, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201d</p><p>Temperance opened the back door. \u201cRemember: If Winter asks, I\u2019ve gone to bed early. And if he presses, tell him it\u2019s a female matter. That\u2019ll stop any questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, ma\u2019am!\u201d Nell called as Temperance pulled the door closed behind her.</p><p>A blast of wind whistled around the corner. Temperance shivered and pulled her cloak tighter, turning to go down the alley. A broad male chest loomed suddenly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire drawled in his dark, ominous manner. His cloak swirled about his legs in the wind.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that,\u201d Temperance said, rather too sharply.</p><p>But he only looked amused. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPop out at me like a footpad.\u201d She glared up at him, watching as his wide mouth curled at the corner. She had a ridiculous urge to smile back at him, but she suppressed it ruthlessly. Tonight his silver hair was contained in a queue under a black cocked hat. Her belly trembled and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder in exactly what way Lord Caire was different in the bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he\u2019d turned and begun striding down the alley. \u201cI do assure you that I\u2019m no footpad, ma\u2019am.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder, and she saw the flash of his blue eyes as she hurried to catch up. \u201cIf I had been, you\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not giving me any encouragement to come with you,\u201d Temperance muttered.</p><p>He stopped suddenly and she nearly ran into him again. \u201cYou\u2019re here, are you not?\u201d</p><p>Wretched man! \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p> <p>He bowed extravagantly, his silver-tipped walking stick in his outstretched hand, his black cloak sweeping the filthy ground. \u201cThen lead on, fair lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Temperance faced forward and began trotting down the alley, aware that he followed close behind her, a large dark presence.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you take me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Was it her imagination or did she feel his hot breath on the back of her neck?</p><p>\u201cIt was rather hard to decide, since you refused to tell me much of anything about who it is you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>She waited for an explanation, but he didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>Temperance sighed. \u201cYou said only that you were searching for someone, which, I must tell you, my lord, was no help at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I sense you still have a destination in mind,\u201d Lord Caire murmured.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d They\u2019d come to the end of the alley, and she ducked through a crumbling archway into an even narrower alley.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d There was a trace of amusement in Lord Caire\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d she said with some satisfaction. Really she was rather pleased with herself for coming up with a source for him on such little information.</p> <p>They stood in front of a building without any windows. Only a swinging wooden sign with a painted candle on it indicated that this was a chandler\u2019s shop. Temperance pushed open the door. Inside, the shop was tiny. A counter ran along one side. The goods were displayed here and there, in heaps and piles and hanging on the walls. Candles, tea, tin cups, salt and flour, string, lard, a few knives, a ragged fan, some new brooms, buttons, one little plum tart, and, of course, gin. At the far end of the counter, two women huddled over their cups. Behind the counter stood Mr. Hopper, a small, dark man who might\u2019ve grown to his exact size so that he might fit inside his shop.</p><p>Selling gin without a license was illegal, of course, but licenses were exorbitantly dear and few could afford them. Besides, the magistrates relied on paid informers to bring unlicensed gin sellers to the courts\u2014and no informer would dare set foot in St. Giles. The last had been attacked by a mob, dragged through the streets, savagely beaten, and finally left to die of his injuries, poor man.</p><p>\u201cWhat might I do for you t\u2019night, Mrs. Dews?\u201d Mr. Hopper asked.</p><p>\u201cGood evening to you, Mr. Hopper,\u201d Temperance replied. \u201cMy friend is looking for someone, and I wonder if you might help him?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hopper squinted at Lord Caire suspiciously, but he said cheerfully enough, \u201cAye, I might. Who be you lookin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA murderer,\u201d Lord Caire replied, and every head in the room swiveled toward him.</p><p>Temperance caught her breath. A murderer?</p><p>The gin drinkers silently slipped out of the shop.</p> <p>\u201cNearly two months ago, a woman was murdered in her rooms in St. Giles,\u201d Lord Caire continued, unperturbed. \u201cHer name was Marie Hume. Do you know anything about her?\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Hopper was already shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t have no truck with murder. An\u2019 I\u2019ll thank you to take this gentleman out of here, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>Temperance bit her lip, glancing at Lord Caire.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem particularly put out. \u201cA moment, please,\u201d he said to the shopkeeper.</p><p>Mr. Hopper reluctantly looked at him.</p><p>Lord Caire smiled. \u201cMight I have that tart?\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper grunted and handed him the plum tart, pocketing tuppence in return before pointedly turning his back. Temperance sighed, feeling rather irritable. It was obvious that she\u2019d have to find another informant for Lord Caire.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve warned me,\u201d she muttered outside the shop. The wind blew her words back in her face and she shivered, wishing she were by her own cozy fire.</p><p>Lord Caire seemed unaffected by the cold. \u201cWhat difference would it have made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, I wouldn\u2019t have tried Mr. Hopper.\u201d She stomped across the street, making sure to dodge the sludge in the channel.</p><p>He easily caught up with her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Mr. Hopper is respectable and your inquiries obviously aren\u2019t,\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cWhy ever did you buy that tart?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d He bit into the pastry with relish.</p><p>She watched him lick purple syrup from the corner of his mouth and swallowed in reaction. The tart did look awfully good.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a bite?\u201d he asked, his voice deep.</p><p>She shook her head firmly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, eyeing her as he swallowed another mouthful. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she snapped, and began walking.</p><p>He cut in front of her, making her come to an abrupt halt or run the risk of running into him. \u201cIt\u2019s a plum tart, Mrs. Dews, not riches or drink or any other decadent sin. What can it hurt? Have a bite.\u201d</p><p>And he broke off a piece, holding it with his fingers to her lips. She could smell the sweet fruit, almost taste the flaky pastry, and before she knew it, she had opened her lips. He fed her the bite, the plum tangy on her tongue, the syrup sugary sweet, exquisitely delicious here in the dark St. Giles street.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered. \u201cTasty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped open\u2014when had she closed them?\u2014and she stared in near horror at him.</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cWhere to now, Mrs. Dews? Or was Mr. Hopper and his shop your only source?\u201d</p><p>Temperance lifted her chin. \u201cNo. I have another idea.\u201d</p><p>She stepped around him and began walking swiftly, the taste of sweet plums still on her tongue. This part of St. Giles was one of the worst, and she wouldn\u2019t have dared to come here during the day, let alone at night, if it weren\u2019t for the presence of the large male trailing silently behind her.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Temperance stopped before a crooked door, set two steps down.</p><p>Lord Caire looked at the door, his blue eyes narrowed with interest. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease does business,\u201d Temperance replied just as the crooked door popped open.</p><p>\u201cOut wi\u2019 ye!\u201d a tall, gaunt woman bawled. She wore an old red army coat over leather stays so filthy they were black. Beneath was a black-and-red-striped linsey-woolsey petticoat, the hem ragged and caked with mud. Behind her, dim firelight flickered, giving her the appearance of standing at the mouth of hell. \u201cNo coin, no drink. Get out of me \u2019ouse, then!\u201d</p><p>The object of her ire was a thin woman who might\u2019ve been pretty had it not been for her blackened teeth and an open sore on one cheek.</p><p>The pitiful creature cringed and held up her arms as if to ward off a blow. \u201cI\u2019ll gi\u2019 ye a penny an\u2019 a ha\u2019penny tomorrow. Just gi\u2019 me the gin tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo an\u2019 earn yer pennies,\u201d Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease said, and shoved the unhappy woman into the alley. She turned and propped her large, red-knuckled fists on her hips, looking Lord Caire up and down with greedy eyes. \u201cNow, then, what\u2019re ye doin\u2019 here, Mrs. Dews? I don\u2019t reckon this\u2019s yer part of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware St. Giles was divided into territories,\u201d Temperance replied stiffly.</p><p>Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease flicked beady eyes at her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Temperance cleared her throat. \u201cMy friend would like to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><p>Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease grinned at Lord Caire, revealing missing front teeth. \u201cBest come inside, \u2019adn\u2019t you, then?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t glance at Temperance again, her avarice obviously focused on Lord Caire. Nevertheless, he stood back to allow Temperance entrance first. She ducked inside the door and descended the steep wooden steps leading to a cellar.</p><p>The front room was low, long, and dark, lit only by a fire roaring in the rear. Above, the rafters were blackened by smoke. To one side, a warped board was thrown over two barrels to make a counter. Behind it stood a one-eyed girl, the only barmaid. Here Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease sold her namesake: gin, a penny and a half a cup. A score of soldiers in tall meter hats were laughing drunkenly at a table in the corner. Beside them, two shady-looking fellows hunched their shoulders as if trying to become invisible. One wore a triangular leather patch to hide a missing nose. Across the room, a quarrel had broken out between three sailors playing cards, while nearby, a solitary man in a too-large wig smoked serenely. A man and a woman sat together against the wall on the bare dirt floor, their small tin cup cradled in their hands. They might sleep the night here\u2014if they each paid Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease another five pence for the privilege.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, \u2019ow can I \u2019elp a fine-lookin\u2019 gent like yerself?\u201d Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease shouted over the din of the arguing sailors. She rubbed her fingers together suggestively.</p><p>Lord Caire took a purse from beneath his cloak and opened it. He smiled as he extracted a half crown and placed it in the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the murder of a woman in St. Giles. Her name was Marie Hume.\u201d</p><p>Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease had lost her smile, her lips pursing thoughtfully. \u201cThat kind o\u2019 information will cost ye just a bit more, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Did she know Lord Caire, or was the woman merely flattering a potential money source?</p><p>Lord Caire raised his eyebrows at the demand but silently fished another half crown from his purse. He tossed the coin to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease, and it disappeared along with its mate down the top of her stays.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ave a seat, m\u2019lord.\u201d Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease gestured to an empty chair, a rickety wooden thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a murdered woman, you say?\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire ignored the attempt at hospitality. \u201cShe was thirty years or so, blond hair, fair of face and form but with a red birthmark the size of a penny just here.\u201d He tapped the outer corner of his right eye. \u201cDo you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, there\u2019re quite a lot of pretty wenches about, and a birthmark might be hidden,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnything else particular about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was gutted,\u201d Lord Caire said.</p><p>Temperance inhaled sharply, all of Nell\u2019s warnings flooding back. Dear God.</p><p>Even Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease blinked at the blunt choice of words. \u201cGutted like a pig,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThat one I remember. Fancy sort, wasn\u2019t she? Found in a bare little room in a house in Tanner\u2019s Court, the flies abuzzin\u2019 in her black blood.\u201d</p><p>If Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s words were meant to shock Lord Caire, they failed. His expression remained curious, amused, even, as he cocked his head. \u201cYes. That\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease shook her head in mock sorrow. \u201cI can\u2019t help you with that, then, m\u2019lord. I didn\u2019t know the wench.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire held out his hand. \u201cGive me back my coins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up there, m\u2019lord,\u201d the woman said hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the murder, but I know who might.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire stilled, his eyes narrowing slightly as if he\u2019d sighted prey. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha Swan.\u201d Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease smiled a twisted, evil smile and crooned, \u201cThe last woman to see her alive.\u201d</p><p>THE WIND TOOK away her breath as Temperance climbed back up Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s outer steps. Lord Caire was behind her, eerily silent. Who was the murdered woman? And why was he asking about her murder? She shuddered, remembering the way he\u2019d described the woman as \u201cgutted.\u201d Dear Lord, what had she involved herself in? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are unusually quiet, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire observed in his deep voice.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know what is usual with me, my lord?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou hardly know me.\u201d</p><p>He breathed a soft chuckle behind her. \u201cAnd yet I sense that you are a loquacious woman when you are with those you are comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>She halted and turned, arms crossed to hold in her heat, but also perhaps to reassure herself. \u201cWhat type of game are you playing with me?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d stopped as well, much too near to her. His queue was coming undone, and strands of his long silver hair blew across his face. \u201cGame, Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, game.\u201d She glared, refusing to be afraid of him. \u201cYou tell me that you\u2019re searching for someone in St. Giles, but when I take you to Mr. Hopper\u2019s shop, you ask about a murdered woman, and now at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s, you ask about a gutted murdered woman.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, broad shoulders moving under his cape. \u201cI did not lie to you. I do seek someone\u2014her murderer.\u201d</p><p>Temperance shivered as the wind blew icy droplets of rain against her frozen cheeks. She wished she could see his eyes, but they were hidden under the brim of his hat. \u201cWho was she to you?\u201d</p><p>His wide, sensuous mouth curled up into a half smile. He did not answer.</p> <p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she muttered low, a question she realized belatedly that she should\u2019ve asked the night before. \u201cHow did you find me? Why did you choose me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you about,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cas I\u2019ve searched in St. Giles. You were always hurrying, always in black, always so very... determined. When I saw you last night, I followed you to your home.\u201d</p><p>She stared. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You chose me on a whim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a whimsical man. You are cold, Mrs. Dews. Come.\u201d</p><p>And he set off again, this time leading the way, his steps assured.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she called after him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to find Martha Swan?\u201d</p> <p>He halted and turned toward her. \u201cMother Heart\u2019s-Ease said she frequented Hangman\u2019s Alley. Do you know the direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s half a mile or more that way.\u201d She gestured behind them.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen we\u2019ll save Mistress Swan for another night. It\u2019s late and it\u2019s time you were home.\u201d</p><p>He started off again without waiting for her answer.</p><p>Temperance trotted after him like an obedient terrier. He\u2019d answered her questions but in a way that made new ones crop up in their place. There were hundreds of women in St. Giles. Granted, many were prostitutes or engaged in other illicit activities. But had he wished, he could\u2019ve found a dozen or more willing women to lead him about. Why had he chosen her? Temperance frowned and hurried to keep step with him. He might be a stranger with dark secrets, but she still felt safer walking these alleys with him by her side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we can trust Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease,\u201d she said, gasping a bit as the cold wind snatched away her words.</p><p>\u201cYou doubt there is a Martha Swan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s probably real enough,\u201d Temperance muttered. \u201cBut whether she actually has any information is a different matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is it you know Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease. Gin is the demon of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung and old drink it. Some make it their only meal.\u201d Temperance hesitated. \u201cBut that is not the only reason I know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She raised a hand to pull her hood more closely about her face. \u201cNine years ago, when I first came to the home, Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease sent us a message. She had a young girl of about three years of age. I don\u2019t know where she got the child from, but it was certainly not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe offered to sell the toddler to us.\u201d Temperance paused, for her voice had begun to shake\u2014not from fear or sorrow, but from rage. She remembered her hot anger, her contempt at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s mercenary cynicism.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lord Caire\u2019s voice was soft, but she heard it clearly. It almost vibrated in her bones.</p><p>\u201cWinter and Father were against buying the child. They said it would only encourage Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease to sell more orphaned children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>Temperance inhaled. \u201cI hated to pay her, but she made it quite plain that she would find another buyer if we did not give her the price. Someone who would not care for the child\u2019s welfare at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whoremonger.\u201d</p><p>She glanced swiftly at him, but his face was in profile to her, cold and remote. They\u2019d crossed into a larger lane, one in which she could walk beside him. This wasn\u2019t the way she\u2019d taken Lord Caire to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s cellar. Idly she wondered if he was lost.</p><p>Then she faced forward again. \u201cYes, a whoremonger, most probably, though Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease never actually said the words. She simply hinted horribly.\u201d Temperance\u2019s head was down, remembering that ghastly negotiation. She\u2019d still been a little naive then. She\u2019d had no idea how black a woman\u2019s soul could be.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t paying enough attention to the way. Her toe caught on something, and her hands shot out as she stumbled, trying to regain her balance. There was an awful second when her belly dove, and she knew she was going to hit the ground.</p><p>And then he caught her, hard hands\u2014painful hands\u2014gripping her elbows but keeping her safe. She looked up and he was there, right in front of her, his blue eyes gleaming like a demon\u2019s. He drew her closer, almost into an embrace. Like a friend. Like a lover.</p><p>All her worst desires clamored to the surface.</p><p>He whispered, his breath brushing her lips, \u201cSo you bought the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glared at him, this unfeeling aristocrat. Why did he want to hear this story? Why did he insist on ripping open old wounds? Why was he searching for a dead woman\u2019s murderer? \u201cYes, I paid the price. I sold the only bit of jewelry I had\u2014a gold cross my husband had once given me\u2014and I bought the babe. I named her Mary Whitsun for the Whitsunday on which I first held her.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, his blue, blue eyes asking the question.</p><p>She sobbed, fury and sorrow welling up from that place where she carefully controlled all the emotions she couldn\u2019t afford to feel. Temperance trembled as she tried to beat her passion down. Trap it and conceal it.</p><p>He shook her as if to dislodge the answer he waited for.</p><p>\u201cWinter was right,\u201d she gasped. \u201cThe baby girl was safe, but two months later, Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease came to us again with another baby, a boy this time. And his price was twice what the girl\u2019s had been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She closed her eyes in defeat. \u201cThe price was too high; we hadn\u2019t the money. We\u2014I\u2014could do nothing. I begged, I got on my knees and pled with that witch, and she sold him anyway.\u201d</p><p>She bunched the edges of his cloak in her fists, shaking them as if to impress the awfulness of the memory on him. \u201cShe sold that sweet baby boy, and I could do nothing to save him.\u201d</p><p>One moment she was crying in fury up at him and the next he\u2019d swooped down and caught her mouth. Hard, with no mercy. She gasped at the shock. He ground his mouth against her soft lips. She felt his teeth, tasted his hot tongue, and that part of herself, that wretched, sinful, wrong, part broke free and went running. Reveling in his savagery. Rejoicing in his blunt sexuality.</p><p>Completely out of her control.</p><p>Until he raised his head and looked down at her. His lips were wet and slightly reddened, but otherwise he showed no sign of that devastating kiss.</p><p>He might\u2019ve just relieved himself against a wall for all the emotion he displayed.</p><p>Temperance tried to pull from his grasp, but his hands held strong.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a passionate creature,\u201d he murmured, examining her from beneath half-lowered eyelids. \u201cSo emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d she whispered, horrified at the mere notion.</p><p>\u201cYou lie. I wonder why?\u201d He raised his eyebrows in amusement and let her go so suddenly she stumbled back a step. \u201cShe was my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe murdered woman, the one gutted like a pig at the butcher\u2019s. She was my mistress of three years.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him, stunned.</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cUntil tomorrow evening. Good night, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>And he walked away, disappearing into the night shadows.</p><p>Temperance turned, her mind whirling, and saw it, not twenty steps away. The door to the foundling home.</p><p>Lord Caire had brought her safely home after all.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>King Lockedheart lived in a magnificent castle that sat on the top of a hill. In his castle there lived hundreds of guards, a swarm of courtiers, and a multitude of servants and courtesans. The king was surrounded day and night, and yet none were close to his heart. In fact, the only living thing that was important to the king was a small blue bird. The bird lived in a jeweled golden cage, and sometimes it would sing or chirp. In the evening, King Lockedheart fed the bird nuts through the bars of its cage....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>The sun never seemed to shine in St. Giles, Silence Hollingbrook reflected the next morning. She glanced up and caught sight of only a handspan\u2019s width of blue amongst the overhanging second stories, signs, and roofs. St. Giles was far too crowded, the houses built one on top of another and the rooms divided and then subdivided again until the people lived like rats in warrens. Silence shivered, glad for her own neat rooms in Wapping. St. Giles was a terrible place to live one\u2019s life. She wished her elder brother and sister could find another place for the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children. But then St. Giles was where Father had founded the home, and St. Giles was where the poorest of the poor lived in London.</p><p>She stopped before the worn stoop and knocked loudly on the thick wooden door. The foundling home had had a bell until last Christmas, when someone had stolen it. Winter had not had a chance to replace it yet, and sometimes she knocked for several minutes before being heard.</p><p>But today the door was opened almost at once.</p><p>She looked down into scrubbed pink cheeks, black hair scraped back from a wide forehead, and sharp brown eyes. \u201cGood morning to you, Mary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>Mary bobbed a curtsy. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d</p><p>Silence entered the narrow hall and hung up her shawl. \u201cIs my sister about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am is in the kitchen,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Silence smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll find her, then.\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded solemnly and marched up the stairs to whatever work she\u2019d been interrupted at.</p><p>Silence hoisted the flat-bottomed basket she\u2019d brought and walked back to the kitchens. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she called as she entered.</p><p>Temperance turned from a huge pot boiling over the fire. \u201cGood morning, sister! What a nice surprise. I didn\u2019t know you were to call today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Silence felt her cheeks heat guiltily. She hadn\u2019t been to the home in over a week. \u201cBut I bought some dried currants at market this morning and thought I\u2019d bring some over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how thoughtful! Mary Whitsun will like that,\u201d Temperance said. \u201cShe has a fondness for currant buns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Silence set the basket on the old kitchen table. \u201cShe seems to have grown another inch since I last saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has indeed.\u201d Temperance wiped at the sweat on her temples with her apron. \u201cAnd she\u2019s quite lovely, though I don\u2019t tell her so to her face. I don\u2019t want her to become vain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence smiled as she uncovered the basket. \u201cYou sound proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Temperance asked absently. She\u2019d turned back to the steaming pot.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Silence hesitated a moment before continuing apologetically. \u201cShe\u2019s of age to apprentice out, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Almost past the age, in fact.\u201d Temperance sighed. \u201cBut she\u2019s of such use about the home. I haven\u2019t begun looking for a position for her yet.\u201d</p> <p>Silence took the items from her basket without comment. Temperance knew better than she that becoming too fond of the foundling children could only lead to hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got more than currants there,\u201d Temperance said, coming to the table.</p><p>\u201cI brought some stockings I made as well.\u201d Silence shyly presented her workmanship\u2014three pairs of tiny stockings. True, none of them were quite the same size as the other, but at least they matched in shape. More or less. \u201cI was making a pair for William and some wool remained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d Temperance set her hands on her hips and arched her back, stretching. \u201cI\u2019d quite forgotten that Captain Hollingbrook was to return soon.\u201d</p><p>Silence felt the ripple of quiet joy spread through her at just the mention of her husband\u2019s name. William had been away at sea for months, captaining the Finch, a merchant ship returning from the West Indies.</p> <p>She ducked her head as she replied to her sister. \u201cHe\u2019s due any day now. I hoped that when he returns, you and Winter would come and sup with us in celebration.\u201d</p><p>When Temperance didn\u2019t respond immediately, Silence looked up. Her sister was frowning down at a pile of turnips on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Silence asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Temperance glanced up quickly, her face smoothing. \u201cOh, nothing, dear. You know Winter and I would be pleased to dine with you and Captain Hollingbrook. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re so busy with the home right now....\u201d Her words trailed away as she looked about the big kitchen.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, then, it is time to hire more help. Nell works hard, but she\u2019s only one woman.\u201d</p><p>Temperance laughed, but the sound was hard and short. \u201cIf we had a patron to supply the home with money, we would. As it is, we were just able to finally pay this month\u2019s rent and last\u2019s today. If we\u2019re late again, Mr. Wedge may well evict us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Silence sank into a kitchen chair. \u201cI have nearly a pound left from my grocery money. Would that help?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled. \u201cNo, dear. That would only help us for a little while, and I don\u2019t want to take Captain Hollingbrook\u2019s money. I know how you and he scrimp and save.\u201d</p><p>Silence colored a little. William was a wonderful husband, but a merchant ship\u2019s captain didn\u2019t make all that much, especially when he had a wife and an elderly mother and spinster sister to keep.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Concord?\u201d</p><p>Temperance was shaking her head. \u201cWinter says the brewery has lost money since Father\u2019s death. And besides, Concord has his own family to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Silence shook her head. She\u2019d had no idea Concord was in financial straits, but then the men of the family didn\u2019t always like to talk business with their women. Concord and his wife, Rose, had five adorable children and another on the way.</p><p>She looked up. \u201cAnd Asa?\u201d</p><p>Temperance grimaced. \u201cYou know Asa has always been scornful of the home. I think Winter hates the thought of going to him again with hand outstretched.\u201d</p> <p>Silence pulled the turnip toward herself and picked up a knife to chop off the greens. \u201cWinter is the least prideful man I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but even the most humble of men have just a touch of pride. Besides, even if Winter did ask Asa, there\u2019s no guarantee he would help.\u201d</p><p>Silence wanted to protest that of course Asa would help if he could, but the truth was that she was uncertain. Asa had always walked apart from their family, secret and alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall you do?\u201d Silence began dicing a turnip, her little pieces more odd lumps than squares. She\u2019d never been very good at dicing.</p><p>Temperance took up another knife but she hesitated. \u201cAs to that, I already have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must promise not to tell our brothers.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Verity either,\u201d Temperance said. Verity was the eldest of the Makepeace family.</p><p>Silence stared. What secret would Temperance want to keep not only from their brothers, but also their sister?</p><p>But Temperance\u2019s expression was almost fierce. If Silence wanted to know, she\u2019d have to promise. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Temperance set down the knife and leaned close to whisper, \u201cI\u2019ve met someone who will introduce me to the influential and wealthy people of London. I\u2019m going to find a new patron for the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Silence knit her brows.</p><p>Their family was a humble one. Father had been a beer brewer, and on their father\u2019s death, Concord had taken over the family business. Father had believed deeply in learning and had seen to it that all her brothers were very well educated in religion, philosophy, and Greek and Latin. She supposed in that way they might be called intellectuals, but that didn\u2019t take away from the fact that they worked for their living. The kind of people Temperance was talking about were well out of their league.</p><p>\u201cWho is this powerful friend?\u201d Silence saw the moment when something shifted behind her sister\u2019s eyes. Temperance was a wonderful person, which was perhaps why she was also a terrible liar. \u201cTemperance, tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her sister tilted her chin. \u201cHis name is Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>Silence\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cAn aristocrat? How in the world did you find an aristocrat to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he found me.\u201d Temperance pursed her lips, her eyes firmly fixed on the growing mound of chopped turnip roots. \u201cDo you think anyone really likes turnips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemperance...\u201d</p><p>Temperance poked the tip of her knife into a white cube and held it up. \u201cThey are very filling, of course, but really, when was the last time you heard someone say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so very fond of turnips\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Silence set down her knife and waited.</p><p>The lid of the pot over the fire rattled, and Temperance\u2019s knife thunked against the table for perhaps a half minute before she broke.</p><p>\u201cHe followed me home the night before last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Silence gasped.</p><p>But her sister was speaking rapidly. \u201cThat sounds worse than it is. He was quite harmless, I assure you. He merely asked me for my help in speaking to some people in St. Giles. In return, I requested that he introduce me to the people he knew who were wealthy. It\u2019s a very practical arrangement, truly.\u201d</p><p>Silence eyed her sister skeptically. The picture Temperance drew was altogether too rosy. \u201cAnd I suppose this Lord Caire is an ancient gentleman, white-haired and bony-kneed?\u201d</p><p>Temperance winced. \u201cHis hair is white, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I stare at a gentleman\u2019s knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemperance...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very well, he\u2019s a young and rather handsome man,\u201d Temperance said not very graciously. Her cheeks had pinkened.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord.\u201d Silence stared with concern at her sister. Temperance was a widow of eight and twenty, but sometimes she behaved with all the circumspection of a silly girl. \u201cThink. Why would Lord Caire pick you in particular to lead him about St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must tell Winter. This thing sounds like a made-up story to entice you. Lord Caire might have dreadful plans for you. What if he lures you into debauchery?\u201d</p><p>Temperance wrinkled her nose, drawing attention to a speck of soot at the tip. \u201cI hardly think that\u2019s likely. Have you looked at me recently?\u201d</p><p>She spread her arms wide as if to emphasize the ridiculousness of an aristocrat wanting to seduce her. Silence had to admit that standing in her kitchen, her hair half down, and with soot on her nose, Temperance certainly didn\u2019t look like someone particularly tempting to a seducer.</p><p>But she replied loyally. \u201cYou\u2019re quite pretty and well you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of the sort.\u201d Temperance let her arms drop. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the beauty of the family. If a dastardly lord were to corrupt anyone, it would be you.\u201d</p><p>Silence looked sternly at her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance sighed and sank into a kitchen chair. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, Silence, please don\u2019t. I\u2019ve already accepted Lord Caire\u2019s money to pay the rent\u2014that is how we paid off our debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Winter is sure to find out eventually. How did you explain paying the rent to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him that I sold a ring that Benjamin had given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Temperance!\u201d Silence covered her mouth in horror. \u201cYou lied to Winter?\u201d</p><p>But Temperance shook her head. \u201cIt was only a small lie. This is the only hope we have for the home. Think what it would do to Winter should the home close.\u201d</p><p>Silence glanced away. Of all their brothers, Winter had been the most devoted to their father and his charitable works. It would disappoint him terribly to have the home fail under his watch.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Silence,\u201d Temperance whispered. \u201cFor Winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Silence nodded once. \u201cI won\u2019t tell our brothers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless,\u201d Silence continued, \u201cI feel you are in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be. That I can promise.\u201d</p><p>LAZARUS WOKE ON a silent scream. His eyes opened wide, and for a moment he simply lay there and looked about the room, straining to remember where he was. Then he recognized his own bedroom. The walls were a dark brown, the furniture old and impressive, and his bed hung with dark green and brown curtains. His father had slept here before him, and Lazarus hadn\u2019t bothered changing anything when he\u2019d inherited the title. He felt each muscle in his body slowly relax as he glanced at the window. The light there was a pale gray; dawn couldn\u2019t be too far away\u2014and he never went back to sleep after a nightmare. He stretched and rose, nude, then padded to the tall dresser to splash cold water on his face. He donned a yellow brocaded banyan and sat at the elegant cherrywood desk in the corner\u2014the only piece of furniture in the room that he\u2019d brought with him. His father would\u2019ve disapproved heartily of writing in dishabille.</p><p>Lazarus grinned at the thought. Then he uncapped his inkwell and began work on his current translation project. Catullus was particularly scathing of Lesbia in this poem. He wanted to find the right word\u2014the perfect word\u2014that, when correctly set, would shine like a diamond in an exquisite ring. It was exacting, meticulous work, and it could consume him for hours at a time.</p><p>His valet, Small, entered sometime later, and Lazarus looked up to see that the room was bright with sunshine.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, my lord,\u201d Small said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no consequence,\u201d Lazarus replied, his gaze back on his translation. The words were calling him, but he hadn\u2019t quite found the right arrangement yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring to have your breakfast sent up, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re ready for your toilet?\u201d</p><p>Bah! The thing was lost now. Lazarus threw down his pen impatiently and leaned back in his chair. Small immediately laid a steaming cloth over the lower half of his face. The valet\u2019s movements were quick and efficient, his hands delicate like a woman\u2019s.</p><p>Lazarus closed his eyes, relaxing as the moist heat soaked into his skin. He remembered Mrs. Dews\u2019s light brown eyes last night. The way they\u2019d closed in bliss when he\u2019d fed her the plum tart. The way they\u2019d narrowed in anger when he questioned why she wouldn\u2019t take it from him initially. For one such as he\u2014a man who could not feel emotion\u2014her moods were irresistibly alluring. The flare of her temper had created a heat he could almost feel. He\u2019d been drawn to it as surely as a cat was to the warmth of a hearth. Her emotion was foreign, wild and exciting, and entirely fascinating\u2014and she tried so very hard to hide it. Why? He wanted to spend time with the source of such powerful emotion. Wanted to experiment, poke and prod, see what else made her cheeks flush, her breath come fast. What would make her laugh? What frightened her? How would her eyes look at the point of orgasm? Would she try to hold back, or would the bodily sensation overwhelm her defenses? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought was oddly arousing this early in the morning. He\u2019d never cared one way or the other about a woman\u2019s response. She was but the vessel for his own lust. But with Mrs. Dews, it was the woman herself who was the interesting part.</p><p>Small removed the cloth and brushed warm lather over Lazarus\u2019s jaw. Lazarus kept his eyes closed, refusing to flinch at the first scrape of the razor against his bare cheek. Surreptitiously he gripped the arms of the chair. To let another touch him was a ghastly physical trial, which was part of the reason he permitted this ordinary intimacy each morning. It gave him a kind of satisfaction to confront this most basic fear and overcome it daily.</p><p>The valet finished his left cheek, and Lazarus tilted his head to receive the razor on the right, repressing a shudder of revulsion. He\u2019d had this loathing of another\u2019s touch for as long as he could recall. No. That wasn\u2019t correct. Lazarus couldn\u2019t repress a wince as Small ran the razor over his upper lip. Once upon a time, when he\u2019d been a very small child, there had been a touch that did not cause him fear and loathing and outright pain.</p><p>But that was long ago and that person long dead.</p> <p>Small wiped the last of the soap foam from Lazarus\u2019s face, and Lazarus opened his eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>If the valet had any idea of the pain he\u2019d caused his master, the knowledge did not show in his placid expression. \u201cWhat shall you wear today, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black silk breeches and coat with the silver worked waistcoat.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus stood and dropped the banyan to the chair. Small handed him the clothing and he dressed himself\u2014there was a fine point between endurance and self-torture.</p><p>\u201cMy stick as well,\u201d Lazarus said as he allowed the valet to club back his hair with a black velvet ribbon.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d Small looked doubtfully at the window. \u201cYou have an appointment so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to visit my mother.\u201d Lazarus smiled without humor. \u201cAnd that is a task best done as early as possible.\u201d</p><p>He took the stick that Small proffered and strode from the room without waiting for the valet\u2019s reply.</p><p>The master bedroom led out into a wide upper hall paneled in dark, intricately carved wood. This town house had been in the Caire family since his grandfather\u2019s time. It wasn\u2019t in the most fashionable part of London anymore, but it was big and grand and fairly reeked of old money and power. Lazarus descended the stairs, trailing his hand down the pink banister. The stone was imported from Italy, carved and polished until it shone nearly like a mirror. He should feel something touching the cold, smooth stone, he knew. Pride perhaps? Or nostalgia? But instead he felt as he always did.</p><p>Nothing at all.</p><p>He reached the lower hall and took his cape and tricorne from the butler. Outside it was windy, the chairmen shivering a bit as they waited for him. His sedan chair was new, especially built for his height, the outside enameled in black and silver, the inside fitted with plush crimson cushions. One of the men held the top open as Lazarus stepped between the rails to enter. The front door was shut and latched and the top lowered. The men hefted the chair, and then they were jogging through the London streets.</p> <p>Lazarus wondered idly what had caused his mother to summon him. Would she ask for more money? That seemed unlikely since she had a generous allowance from him as well as a few estates of her own. Perhaps she\u2019d taken up gambling in her waning years. He snorted aloud at the thought.</p><p>The chairmen halted and Lazarus descended. The town house he\u2019d bought for his mother was small but fashionable. She\u2019d complained\u2014still complained\u2014when he\u2019d forced her to move out of Caire House, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d live with the woman.</p><p>Inside, the butler escorted Lazarus to an outrageously gilded sitting room. There he sat for a good half hour, contemplating the golden curlicues on the top of the Corinthian columns guarding the door. He would\u2019ve left but then he\u2019d merely have to repeat this farce another day. Best to get it over with.</p><p>She entered the room as she always did\u2014pausing just a fraction of a second inside the doorway to let the full impact of her beauty fill those within with awe.</p><p>Lazarus yawned.</p><p>She tittered, the sound not quite hiding the anger beneath. \u201cHave you lost all sense of propriety, my son? Or is it fashionable now to no longer rise on a lady\u2019s entrance?\u201d</p><p>He rose with just enough languor to make the movement an insult, and then bowed as briefly as possible. \u201cWhat do you want, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Which was a mistake, of course. Showing his impatience only gave her reason to draw this meeting out.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Lazarus, must you be so rude?\u201d She lowered herself to carefully lounge on one of the delicately painted settees. \u201cIt becomes tiresome. I\u2019ve ordered tea and cakes and such\u201d\u2014she waved a hand vaguely\u2014\u201cso you must stay for that at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust I?\u201d he asked softly, the edge in his voice making the two words grit.</p><p>A fleeting look of uncertainty crossed her beautiful face, but then she said firmly, \u201cOh, I think so.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus sat back down, conceding for the moment to his lovely, vapid mother. He watched her as they waited for the promised tea. He hated tea, always had. Did she not know or\u2014more likely\u2014did she serve it to him merely to provoke?</p><p>Lady Caire had been a famous beauty in her youth, and time had been gracious to her. Her face was a perfect, serene oval, her neck long and graceful. Her eyes were like his, a clear blue, faintly tilted at the corners. The forehead above was white and unmarred. Her hair was the same startlingly premature white as his own, but instead of trying to dye it or wearing a wig, she flaunted the unusual color. She favored dark blue gowns to highlight the white and wore black or dark blue caps, decorated with lace and jewels.</p><p>She had always known how best to draw the eye.</p><p>\u201cAh, here\u2019s the tea,\u201d his mother said as two maids entered bearing trays. Was there relief in her voice?</p><p>The servants set the repast silently and then quietly left. Lady Caire straightened to pour. Her hand hesitated over the teacup. \u201cSugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her aplomb was restored. She handed him the cup. \u201cI remember now\u2014neither sugar nor cream.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows and set aside the teacup untasted. What game was she playing?</p><p>She seemed not to notice his lack of enthusiasm for the tea, resuming her languid pose with her own cup. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been seen with the elder Miss Turner. Have you interest in that direction?\u201d</p><p>He blinked for a moment, truly surprised, and then burst out laughing. \u201cHave you decided to matchmake for me now, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>A line of irritation appeared between her brows. \u201cLazarus\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he interrupted her, his words quick and light, belying the edge they held. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll vet and approve a select group of fillies, line them up for my inspection. Of course, it might be difficult, what with the rumors of my... proclivities flying about London society. All but the most mercenary families make sure to keep their virgins away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crude.\u201d She set down her teacup with a moue of distaste.</p><p>\u201cFirst rude, then crude,\u201d he drawled. His patience had worn out. \u201cReally, madam, it is a wonder you can stand my company at all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at that. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in need of funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any other pressing matter to discuss with me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazarus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worry over business?\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYour lands or servants?\u201d</p><p>She simply stared at him.</p><p>\u201cThen I fear I must go, Lady Caire.\u201d He rose and bowed without meeting her eyes. \u201cI bid you good morning.\u201d</p><p>He was already at the door when she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know what it was like.\u201d</p><p>His back was to her, and he didn\u2019t turn to acknowledge her before closing the door behind him.</p><p>MARY HOPE WAS not improving.</p><p>Temperance watched anxiously as the wet nurse, Polly, tried once again to get the infant to latch on to her nipple. The baby\u2019s tiny, lax mouth opened about the tip of the nipple, but she lay unresponsive, her eyes closed.</p><p>Polly tched and looked up, her face sad. \u201cShe\u2019s not suckin\u2019, ma\u2019am. I can \u2019ardly feel her on me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance straightened, wincing at a crick in her back. She\u2019d been hovering over Polly and the baby for what seemed like hours now. Polly sat in an old armchair with the infant. The chair was the nicest piece of furniture in her little rented room\u2014Temperance had given it to Polly when she\u2019d hired her as one of the foundling home\u2019s wet nurses. The wet nurses didn\u2019t live in the home. Instead they took their tiny charges to their own homes, whatever that may be.</p><p>Since Temperance didn\u2019t directly oversee the wet nurses, it was imperative to find women she could trust, and Polly was the best. Not much over twenty, the wet nurse was dark-eyed, dark-haired, and rather pretty. But Polly had the pragmatic air of a woman twice her age. Her husband was a sailor, coming home only often enough to sire two children with his wife. In between his infrequent appearances, Polly fended for herself and her little family.</p><p>Besides the chair, Polly\u2019s room held a table, a curtained bed, and a cheap print on the wall depicting gaily dressed ladies. Over the mantel of the fireplace, a round polished mirror hung to reflect what little light there was back into the room. Polly had set her few possessions on the mantel: a candlestick, a pot for salt and one for vinegar, a teapot, and a tin cup. In a corner of the wretched room, Polly\u2019s babies played, a toddler and a child who had just learned to crawl.</p><p>Temperance returned her gaze to Mary Hope. Polly\u2019s small room might be poor, but it was spotlessly clean, and Polly herself was neat and sober. Unlike many of the women who made their living wet-nursing, she didn\u2019t drink, and she actually seemed to care for her tiny charges while they were with her.</p><p>That made her worth her weight in gold.</p><p>\u201cCan you try again?\u201d Temperance asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll put \u2019er to the pap, but whether she\u2019ll suck or not...\u201d Polly trailed off as she positioned the babe again. She\u2019d partially unlaced her leather stays and pulled aside her woolen chemise, uncovering one breast.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we drip milk into her mouth?\u201d</p><p>Polly sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve made some milk flow into the wee one\u2019s mouth, but she swallows naught but a drop or two.\u201d</p><p>She demonstrated, and Temperance watched as the fresh milk dribbled out the side of the baby\u2019s mouth. If she swallowed any, it was hard to tell.</p><p>The smallest of Polly\u2019s babies had crawled over and now pulled herself up to stand against the chair, crying.</p><p>\u201cCan you take her a mo\u2019 while I see to my own?\u201d</p><p>Temperance swallowed, reluctant somehow to take the fragile infant, but Polly was already putting Mary Hope in her arms. Temperance held her stiffly. The baby seemed as light as a bird. She watched as Polly pulled her baby into her lap. Her child immediately went to the nipple, sucking contentedly with great gulps as she idly held one stockinged toe with her chubby fingers. Temperance looked from the obviously well-fed child to the sallow cheeks of Mary Hope. The baby had opened her eyes, but she stared over Temperance\u2019s shoulder vaguely, the wrinkles around her eyes in marked contrast to Polly\u2019s plump, healthy baby.</p><p>Temperance quickly averted her gaze, her chest clogging with some emotion she refused to identify. She would not feel for this dying baby, she would not. She\u2019d been burned once in the past by giving her love too freely, and now she held it safely locked away in her breast.</p><p>\u201cThere, ducks, aren\u2019t you happy now?\u201d Polly crooned to the child in her arms. She looked up at Temperance. \u201cLet me try again with that one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery well, but don\u2019t neglect your own,\u201d Temperance said, handing Mary Hope over with relief. She\u2019d heard of wet nurses who\u2019d starved their own children to feed a paying baby.</p><p>\u201cNever fear,\u201d Polly said stoutly. \u201cI\u2019ve enough for all.\u201d</p><p>She suited action to word by taking down her chemise from her other breast, placing Mary Hope there while allowing her own baby to continue suckling from the first breast.</p><p>Temperance nodded. \u201cThank you, Polly. I\u2019ll leave a little extra this week. Make sure you spend it on food for yourself, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, I will,\u201d Polly replied, her head already bent to the ailing baby.</p><p>Temperance hesitated a moment, but in the end, she simply bid Polly good night and left. What more could she do? She made her way through the crowded rooms of the house in which Polly rented her room. She\u2019d hired the best wet nurse available and had even paid the woman extra out of the home\u2019s meager funds.</p><p>The rest was in the hands of God.</p><p>Outside, the light was beginning to dim as the day fled St. Giles. Temperance shivered. A woman passed her, balancing a wide flat basket on her head that held a few leftover clams and a pewter cup for measuring. Winter had sent word that he would work late at the school tonight, but she still had to cook her own supper and settle the children before meeting Lord Caire.</p><p>A big shadow moved in a doorway as she passed, and for a moment her heart stuttered.</p> <p>Then Lord Caire\u2019s deep voice reached her. \u201cGood evening, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, her arms akimbo in exasperation. \u201cWhatever are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She could see his dark eyebrows rise beneath the brim of his tricorne. \u201cWaiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou followed me!\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head, unperturbed at her accusatory tone. \u201cIndeed, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>She huffed in exasperation and started forward again. \u201cYou must be very bored to play such a childish trick.\u201d</p> <p>He breathed a chuckle behind her, so close she thought she felt his cloak brush against her skirts. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She remembered suddenly that kiss he\u2019d pressed on her\u2014hard and hot and not at all gentle. How it had made her heart speed, her skin dampen with sweat. He was a danger to her and all the emotions she held in such tenuous check. Her voice was sharp when she replied. \u201cI\u2019m not a diversion for a bored aristocrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say you were?\u201d he asked mildly. \u201cWho did you go to see in that house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolly.\u201d</p><p>He was so silent behind her that he might\u2019ve been a ghost.</p><p>Temperance inhaled. Any other gentleman\u2014especially an aristocratic gentleman\u2014would\u2019ve given up on her at her tart words and turned and left her in outraged male anger. Whatever the game Lord Caire played, he was patient.</p><p>And besides, the home still needed a patron.</p><p>\u201cPolly is our wet nurse,\u201d Temperance said more calmly. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember the night we met, I brought a new baby to the home. I\u2019ve placed the baby, a frail child, with Polly to nurse. Her name is Mary Hope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou seem...\u201d He trailed off as if analyzing the tone of her voice. \u201cUnhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Hope will not suck,\u201d Temperance said. \u201cAnd when Polly dribbles milk into her mouth, she hardly swallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the child will die,\u201d he said, his voice remote.</p><p>She stopped and whirled on him. \u201cYes! Yes, Mary Hope will die if she cannot take sustenance. Why are you so uncaring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so caring?\u201d He\u2019d stopped with her, too close as usual, and the wind blew his cloak forward, wrapping around her skirts like a living thing. \u201cWhy feel so much for a child you hardly know? A child you must\u2019ve known was ailing, perhaps already dying, when you brought her to your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is my work,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I get up in the morning, the reason I eat, the reason I sleep\u2014to provide for these children. To keep the home running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? You do not love the child herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She turned and continued walking. \u201cI... I care for each of the children, of course I do, but to let oneself love a dying child would be the height of foolishness. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo selfless,\u201d he said, his voice deep and mocking. \u201cSuch a martyr to those poor, wretched infants. Why, Mrs. Dews, you might as well be a saint. All you need is the halo and the bloody palms.\u201d</p><p>A hot retort was on the tip of her tongue, but Temperance pressed her lips together, swallowing the words.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Lord Caire mused somewhere close behind her, \u201cI wonder if it is possible to stop yourself from loving a child. For some it might be easy, but for you, Mrs. Dews, I very much doubt it.\u201d</p><p>She quickened her steps in irritation. \u201cYou consider yourself an authority on emotion, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI rarely feel anything. But like the legless man, I\u2019m unaccountably fascinated by those who can dance.\u201d</p><p>She turned the corner, thinking. They were walking away from the home now. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>She paused to look up at him curiously. \u201cThen why spend so much time searching for the murderer of your mistress?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved cynically. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. A whim, merely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who lies?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked away as if in irritation. \u201cI notice we\u2019re not going toward your home.\u201d</p><p>She was oddly disappointed at his deflection of the subject. If he truly felt no emotion, then why spend months looking for a murderer on a \u201cwhim\u201d? Did Lord Caire feel more than he would admit? Or was he really the cold, uncaring aristocrat he painted himself?</p><p>But he was silent, obviously waiting for her reply. Temperance sighed. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to Hangman\u2019s Alley, where Martha Swan supposedly lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t your brother worry for you if you don\u2019t return home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can go and come back in the next hour, I\u2019ll say that I was checking on the other wet nurses,\u201d Temperance muttered, setting off again.</p><p>\u201cTsk, Mrs. Dews, lying to your own brother?\u201d</p><p>This time she simply ignored him. Night had fallen fully now, the streets emptying as the hunters came out, and she was glad she\u2019d brought the pistol, tucked into a bag hanging beneath her skirts. Half an hour later, they turned into Hangman\u2019s Alley, a gathering place for footpads, thieves, and pickpockets. She wondered if Lord Caire knew just how dangerous this area was. When she looked at him sideways, she noticed that he walked with a predator\u2019s grace, his ebony stick held in one fist like a club.</p><p>He caught her glance. \u201cWhat a lovely neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d But despite her dismissive tone, Temperance was relieved that he looked so formidable. \u201cThere \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to a worn sign depicting a shoe. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease had said that Martha Swan lived over a cobbler\u2019s shop. The building was dark, the alley before it deserted. Temperance pulled her cloak closer about herself, feeling surreptitiously for the pistol under her skirts. They should have stopped for a lantern.</p><p>Lord Caire stepped forward and knocked against the door with his stick. It echoed hollowly, but no movement came from within.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s a pickpocket or a prostitute, she may be out,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Lord Caire replied, \u201cbut having come so far, I suggest we at least look.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, about to protest, but over his shoulder, she saw a movement in the shadows. Her breath caught on a scream as three figures scuttled from an alley, moving fast.</p><p>Moving with obvious deadly intent.</p><p>She would\u2019ve called a warning to Lord Caire, but there was no need. His eyes sharpened on her face. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>And then he was whirling, putting her behind him near the building as he faced the attackers. They spread as they came at him, the outer two men going to either side of Lord Caire, the center man raising a knife. Lord Caire hit the center man\u2019s wrist with his stick, deflecting the first blow. He withdrew a short sword from his stick, and then they were on him in a flurry of rapid blows and kicks, three against one.</p><p>It was only a matter of time until Lord Caire went down, even armed.</p><p>She had her pistol. Temperance hauled up her skirts, fumbling for the sack. She withdrew the pistol, letting her skirts drop.</p><p>She looked up in time to see Lord Caire grunt and half turn as if he\u2019d been hit. One of the men staggered away, but the remaining closed in. She brought the pistol up, but the combatants were too close together. If she fired, she might hit Lord Caire.</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t, the assailants might kill him.</p><p>As she watched, one of the men feinted with a dagger on one side of Lord Caire while another raised a knife on his other side. She couldn\u2019t wait any longer. They were going to kill him.</p><p>Temperance fired.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Once a year, it was King Lockedheart\u2019s custom to give a speech to his people. But because he was a man more used to wielding a sword than a pen, the king made a habit of practicing his speech. Thus one morning, King Lockedheart paced the balcony of his magnificent palace, declaiming his speech to the open air and the caged blue bird.</p><p>\u201cMy people,\u201d the king declared, \u201cI am proud to be your leader, and I know that you are proud to live under my rule. Indeed, I know that I am beloved of you, my people.\u201d</p><p>But, sadly, here King Lockedheart was interrupted\u2014by a giggle....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>The pistol shot came from behind him. A wild fury filled Lazarus\u2019s chest at the sound. They couldn\u2019t, they hadn\u2019t the right to hurt the little martyr. She was his plaything.</p><p>He lunged in vicious anger at the attacker to his right, driving his sword deep into the other\u2019s gut. He saw the man\u2019s eyes widen in shocked surprise, and at the same time Lazarus sensed the rush from his left. He whirled, leaving his sword behind, and slammed the other half of his stick against his attacker\u2019s wrist. The man howled, cradling his injured wrist as the knife spun out of his hand. Unarmed, the attacker realized his vulnerability. He swore and skipped back, darting down an alley. He was gone as suddenly as he\u2019d appeared. Lazarus turned to the third man, but he had disappeared as well. Suddenly the night was quiet.</p><p>Only then did he look behind him at his little martyr. His Mrs. Dews.</p><p>She stood still and prim, a pistol in one hand by her side.</p><p>Not hurt, then. Not killed. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you run?\u201d he asked very softly.</p><p>She tilted her chin, damn her, in obstinate martyrish dignity. She was quite composed, not a hair out of place\u2014and her mouth was red and inviting. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said as he advanced on her, \u201cyou could have and you should have. I ordered you to run.\u201d</p><p>She seemed completely unmoved by his ire, looking down as she shoved her enormous pistol into a pathetic sack. \u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t take orders from you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take orders,\u201d he sputtered like an overwrought old woman. One part of his brain was amused at what an ass he was being, while another part found it very, very important that she know that she had to obey him. \u201cLet me tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He moved to take her arm, but she jerked it away. Pain flamed up his shoulder. \u201cGod\u2019s blood!\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Where his concern had driven her away, his weakness pulled her closer. Contrary creature. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you cry out in pain?\u201d</p><p>He looked up impatiently from peering under his cloak. \u201cBecause, Mrs. Dews, I seem to have received a knife wound.\u201d He could feel hot blood soaking his coat now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gasped, visibly paling. \u201cOh, dear Lord. That\u2019s not nothing! Why didn\u2019t you say so? Perhaps you should sit and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>They both turned to see a crooked little woman peering from the door to the cobbler\u2019s shop. She squinted and cocked her head. \u201cI heard a pistol shot.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus stepped toward her, but at his movement, she made as if to withdraw inside. Not damned likely. Lazarus reached around her and shut the door swiftly, cutting off her escape. \u201cWe came to see Martha Swan.\u201d</p> <p>The woman shrank back at the name. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she cried, peering from one side to the other. She was obviously blind or near blind. \u201cI\u2019ll have no truck with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews took one of her hands. \u201cWe mean you no harm. We were told Martha Swan lives here.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews\u2019s touch seemed to calm her, but the woman\u2019s thin chest still heaved as if she\u2019d take flight if she could. \u201cMartha lived here, aye.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews looked disappointed. \u201cThen she\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d The woman cocked her head again. \u201cShe was found dead just this morn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d Lazarus narrowed his eyes. His arm was soaked now with blood, but he needed this information.</p><p>\u201cThey say she was slit open,\u201d the woman whispered. \u201cSlit from top to bottom, her innards all strewn about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Mrs. Dews gasped. Her grasp on the woman\u2019s hand must have loosened. The little woman turned and opened the door, darting into the house.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Mrs. Dews cried.</p><p>\u201cLeave her,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cShe\u2019s told us what we needed anyway.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews opened her mouth as if to argue, but then closed it into a flat line. He waited a moment to see if her ire would win out over her control, but she simply stared at him.</p> <p>\u201cSomeday you\u2019ll break,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd I pray to God I\u2019m there when it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t any idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d He turned and placed his boot deliberately on the chest of the man he\u2019d stabbed. With a grunt of pain, Lazarus withdrew his short sword from the body. The man lay facing upward, the light from a nearby window reflecting off his open, sightless eyes. He wore a leather patch over the place his nose should\u2019ve been. Had he thought that the day might end with him lying dead in the filth of a street gutter? Doubtful.</p><p>But then only a fool mourned the death of his own assassin.</p><p>Lazarus bent to wipe the blade on the man\u2019s coat before sheathing it in the other half of his black walking stick. He glanced at Mrs. Dews. She stood watching his movements with concern in her wide eyes. \u201cBest we get you back to the relative safety of your home, madam.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, falling into step beside him. Lazarus walked rapidly, his stick held firmly in his right hand. He had no desire to look like an easy mark to their attackers should they return\u2014or to any other predators who might be prowling the streets of St. Giles. The night was black as pitch, clouds hiding the moon. He made his way by instinct and the inconsistent light of the buildings they passed. Mrs. Dews was a slim shadow by his side, her pace not slowing him. He had a reluctant admiration for her. She might\u2019ve refused his command earlier, but she hadn\u2019t flinched at either the fight or the news that he was wounded. In fact, she\u2019d had the forethought to bring along a weapon, even if it had been useless.</p><p>\u201cYou need to practice if you\u2019re to carry a gun to protect yourself,\u201d he said. He felt her stiffen beside him.</p><p>\u201cI think I was quite capable when I fired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou missed.\u201d</p><p>Her face swiveled toward him, and even in the dark, he could sense her outrage. \u201cI fired into the air!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he halted, catching her arm.</p><p>She tried to jerk away again and then seemed to remember his wound. Her mouth thinned with irritation. \u201cI fired into the air because I feared hitting you should I aim at your assailants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d he hissed, his heart speeding again with fear. Silly little martyr.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time\u2014if there is a next time\u2014aim at the attackers and damn the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook her arm. \u201cDo you have any idea what they would\u2019ve done to you had I failed in driving them off?\u201d</p><p>Her head cocked in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019d rather I shoot and possibly hit and kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He let her go and continued down the alley. His shoulder was throbbing with pain now, and his shirt was growing cold from the wet blood.</p><p>She skipped to remain by his side. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life can\u2019t possibly be worth more than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think my life is worth anything at all?\u201d he inquired politely.</p><p>That seemed to silence her, at least for the moment. They tramped through an alley and to a wider street.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d Mrs. Dews muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Lazarus was careful to keep his head up, his eyes alert.</p><p>\u201cThat Martha Swan should be killed in the exact way your mistress was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not strange at all if the killer is the same person.\u201d He felt more than saw her quick glance.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was the same murderer?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, and then had to bite back a gasp as his shoulder shrieked with pain. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it would be very odd if there were more than one murderer in St. Giles with that particular method of killing women.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to think for several minutes and then said slowly, \u201cMy maidservant, Nell Jones, says that the Ghost of St. Giles disembowels his victims.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus laughed despite the growing ache in his shoulder. \u201cHave you seen this ghost, Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think this ghost is merely a tale told to frighten little children on dark nights. The man I look for is of flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>They walked in silence for what seemed like a very long time before the back door to the foundling home came within sight.</p><p>Lazarus grunted, relieved and light-headed at the same time. \u201cThere you are. Make sure you bar the door behind you when you\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d She caught his good arm.</p><p>For a moment he froze. His sleeve shielded his flesh from her hand, but no one touched him without his permission. He usually reacted with sarcasm, with violence and rejection. With her he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>While he stood there, stunned, Mrs. Dews had set down her sack, brought a key out from somewhere under her cloak, and unlocked the back door to the home. \u201cWe have to see to your wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d he began drily.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, and somehow he found himself inside the old kitchen. He\u2019d stolen through it the other night when he entered her little sitting room. Then it had been empty and dark save for the embers of the fireplace. Now it was lit with a roaring fire and occupied by a swarm of urchins of all sizes.</p><p>And one man.</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am, you\u2019re home!\u201d the eldest girl exclaimed.</p><p>At the same time, the man rose from the kitchen table, looking quizzical. \u201cTemperance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter, you\u2019ve returned early,\u201d she said distractedly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m home again, Mary Whitsun, all safe and sound, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say the same for his lordship. Can you please fill a bowl with hot water from the hearth? Joseph Tinbox, bring me the rag bag. Mary Evening, can you please clear a space at the table? And you sit here.\u201d</p><p>The last command was directed at Lazarus. He chose the better part of valor and sank meekly into the indicated chair. Mrs. Dews\u2019s brother eyed him sharply, and Lazarus attempted to look weak, wounded, and helpless, though he had a feeling it didn\u2019t quite convince the man.</p><p>The kitchen was hot, the low, plastered ceiling reflecting the heat of the blazing fire. He saw now that the children must\u2019ve been in the midst of making some type of meal. There was a huge kettle over the fire, tended by one of the older girls, and there was some type of dough on the table. All the children were busy except for one small boy who stood on one foot, staring at him with a limp black cat over his arm.</p><p>Lazarus arched an eyebrow at the urchin, and he scuttled to hide behind Mrs. Dews\u2019s skirts, cat and all.</p><p>\u201cWho is this gentleman, Temperance?\u201d Winter Makepeace asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cLord Caire,\u201d Mrs. Dews said as she helped the child named Mary Evening remove a bowl with flour from the table. The urchin mirrored her moves, always mostly hidden in her skirts. \u201cHe\u2019s wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Makepeace asked, only a little more sharply. \u201cAnd how did that happen?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a fraction of a second\u2014so briefly that perhaps only Lazarus saw it\u2014and darted a glance at him.</p><p>He smiled, baring his teeth. He had no urge to help her out of her obvious dilemma when her explanation might be so much more interesting.</p><p>Mrs. Dews pursed her lips. \u201cLord Caire was attacked but a quarter of a mile from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Makepeace tilted his head in a familiar gesture, waiting for the rest of his sister\u2019s explanation.</p><p>\u201cAnd I brought him home so we could tend to him.\u201d She smiled swiftly and blindingly at her brother.</p><p>But the man was more used to her charming wiles than Lazarus. He merely raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou simply happened upon Lord Caire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no...\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews must indeed be a favorite of God. The small boy she\u2019d sent for the \u201crag bag\u201d returned at that moment, saving the need for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cOh, good, Joseph Tinbox. Thank you.\u201d She took the bag and placed it on the table next to the steaming bowl of water the girl called Mary Whitsun had provided. Then she turned stern eyes on him. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, mimicking her brother. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Oh, there were gods who would punish him for his delight. Her cheeks darkened to a pretty rose.</p><p>\u201cTake off your, er, upper garments, my lord,\u201d she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>He hid a grin as he took off his hat and bent to unfasten his cloak. He threw the cloak off and had to bite back an oath at the stab of pain the movement gave his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d She was suddenly by his side, helping him ease out of his coat and waistcoat. Her proximity was distracting, and oddly sweet. He found himself leaning toward her as they both worked, drawn perhaps by the tender curve of her neck, the faint scent of lavender and woman.</p><p>He raised his arms grudgingly, letting her pull his shirt over his head, and then he was nude to the waist. When he looked up, a ring of curious small children surrounded him. Even the urchin had emerged from her skirts.</p><p>The boy held the cat by its upper body, its lower limbs stretched and hanging. It looked dead, except for the fact that it was purring. \u201cHis name is Soot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d Lazarus replied. He hated cats.</p><p>\u201cMary Whitsun,\u201d said Makepeace, \u201ckindly take the younger children into the dining room. You may hear them recite their Psalms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the child said, and herded her brethren from the room.</p><p>Mrs. Dews cleared her throat. \u201cPerhaps you should oversee them, Winter. I can manage here by myself.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled far too benevolently. \u201cMary Whitsun will do well enough on her own, I believe, sister.\u201d</p><p>Makepeace resumed his seat across the table from her, but as she turned her back to rummage in a cupboard, he shot a look at Lazarus\u2014one that Lazarus had no difficulty in reading. Winter Makepeace might be ten years his junior and have the appearance of an aesthetic monk, but if Lazarus harmed his sister, Makepeace would do his damnedest to send him to hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TEMPERANCE TURNED BACK from the cupboard with the jar of salve in her hands. She tried not to wince at the sight of Lord Caire\u2019s wound. Blood painted his shoulder and trailed in trickles down to his wrist, startlingly crimson against his white skin. Fresh blood dripped down his chest from where they\u2019d reopened the wound when they removed his shirt. Her eyes followed the bloody trail helplessly, down over his surprisingly muscled chest, lightly sprinkled with black hair, over the shocking brown of his nude nipple, to a line of black hair that began at his navel and disappeared into the waistband of his breeches.</p><p>Good Lord.</p><p>Her eyes snapped up hastily and she turned her back, attempting to remember what she had been doing. There was a jar of healing salve in her hands. His wound. Right. She had to clean and dress it.</p><p>Temperance swallowed and bustled to the table with the jar of salve, and caught sight of Winter glaring at the aristocrat. She looked swiftly between the men, her eyes narrowed. Winter had resumed an aspect of patient innocence while Lord Caire returned her stare, his wide mouth quirked, a devilish gleam of amusement in his eyes. Had he seen her ogling his bare body?</p> <p>Oh, bother. Now was not the time to be embarrassed by missish nerves.</p><p>Temperance drew a calming breath, carefully keeping her gaze focused away from Lord Caire\u2019s mesmerizing chest. \u201cWould you like some wine, my lord? This procedure may be painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I wouldn\u2019t want to grow faint.\u201d His words were innocent, but the tone held irony.</p><p>She reproved him with a look even as Winter got up to fetch their only bottle of wine, hoarded and saved for a special occasion. Well, physicking a lord in their kitchen was certainly special.</p><p>Temperance found a clean rag in the rag bag and moistened it with the hot water. She turned determinedly to Lord Caire. Winter had returned and uncorked the wine. He poured a cup and handed it to Lord Caire. She dabbed at the blood around the wound as he took a mouthful of wine. Lord Caire\u2019s skin was warm and smooth. He stiffened beneath her fingers and set the wineglass down abruptly. She darted a glance at his face. He was staring straight ahead, his eyes glazed.</p> <p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d she asked in concern. She hadn\u2019t even touched the wound yet, but some people were more sensitive to pain than others. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t been jesting about growing faint.</p><p>There was a pause, almost as if he hadn\u2019t heard her, and then he blinked. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not in pain.\u201d</p><p>His voice was cold, all humor gone from his eyes. Something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t tell what.</p><p>Temperance turned her attention back to the wound. She had a strange feeling that he was keeping himself from shoving her away only by a great effort. She pressed the cloth over the wound itself, half expecting that he would react violently. Instead he seemed to unbend a little at the pain.</p><p>How odd.</p><p>She raised the cloth and examined the cleaned wound. It was only a few inches across, but it was obviously more deep than wide. Fresh blood seeped steadily and the edges gaped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to sew this shut,\u201d she said, looking up.</p><p>He was so close, his face only inches from hers. She could see a small muscle twitching next to his mouth, the involuntary movement in sharp contrast to the rest of his still countenance. Something lurked, deep at the back of his bright blue eyes. Something that looked like suffering.</p><p>Temperance drew in her breath with shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your kit,\u201d Winter said from across the table.</p><p>Temperance jerked her head up. Her brother was already rising from the table, his expression serene. Had he not noticed the pain in Lord Caire\u2019s eyes? Or the look they\u2019d exchanged?</p><p>Evidently not.</p><p>She released her breath, rummaging in the rag bag to give her hands something to do. They were trembling. She\u2019d sewed up innumerable small cuts, tended scrapes and bumps and fevers, but she\u2019d never caused the kind of pain that marked Lord Caire\u2019s eyes. She wasn\u2019t even sure she could continue.</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Lord Caire murmured.</p> <p>She looked at him, startled. Had he somehow read her thoughts?</p><p>He was watching her, his expression wary. \u201cJust sew me up quickly and I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>She glanced across the room, but Winter was still searching a cupboard for her kit. She looked back at Lord Caire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His wide mouth twitched, but it was hard to tell if it was a wince or a smile. \u201cI assure you, Mrs. Dews, that whatever you do, it cannot make my pain worse.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and knew that the pain he spoke of had nothing to do with the wound in his shoulder. What had...?</p><p>\u201cEverything is in order, I believe,\u201d Winter said, setting her kit on the table. \u201cTemperance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She looked up, smiling blindly. \u201cYes, thank you, brother.\u201d</p><p>He glanced suspiciously between her and Lord Caire, but took his seat again without comment.</p><p>Temperance breathed a sigh of relief. The last thing she needed was Winter questioning her now. She opened her kit, a small tin box where she kept large needles, catgut, a fine, pointed pair of tweezers, scissors, and other implements useful for repairing small children who fell down quite often. She was glad to see that her fingers no longer shook.</p><p>Threading a sturdy needle, she turned to Lord Caire\u2019s shoulder and pinched the edges of the wound together. She placed the first stitch. Children often had to be held down when she did this. Some screamed or wept or grew hysterical, but Lord Caire was obviously made of sterner stuff. He drew a breath as she pierced his skin, but made no other indication that she was hurting him. In fact, he seemed more relaxed now than he had when she was wiping the wound clean.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t think of that right now. Temperance leaned a little closer, making sure her stitches were small, neat, and firm. They needed to hold the flesh together so it would heal properly, but stitches badly placed could make a scar more misshapen.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief as she cut the catgut on the last one.</p><p>\u201cThere. Almost done,\u201d she murmured, as much to herself as to the man she tended.</p><p>He made no comment, sitting as still as a statue as she opened the small jar of greasy salve. But when she dabbed the salve on his wound\u2014lightly, with one finger\u2014he shuddered. She snatched her hand away, startled, and her gaze flew to his face.</p><p>His brow shone with sweat. \u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but she could hardly leave the wound undressed. Biting her lip, she spread the salve as swiftly as possible, aware that his breathing had quickened. She drew a large piece of old cloth from the rag bag and folded it into a pad, then began winding a long length about his chest. This required that she lean close to him, wrapping her arms about his torso. Lord Caire drew in a breath and seemed to hold it, turning his face away as if her proximity revolted him.</p><p>His obvious distress should\u2019ve dulled her own body\u2019s reaction to his nearness, but it did not. The warmth of his skin, the pulse that beat at the side of his neck, even his male odor all combined to arouse her old demons. Temperance was trembling again by the time she tied the bandage off.</p><p>The minute she turned away, Lord Caire was up and out of his chair. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>She stared. \u201cBut your shirt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs a rag now for your bag.\u201d He grimaced as he swung his cloak over his naked shoulders and grabbed his tricorne. \u201cAs are my waistcoat and coat. Again, Mrs. Dews, I thank you and bid you good night. Mr. Makepeace.\u201d</p><p>He nodded briefly to them both before striding to the back door.</p><p>Temperance straightened, an odd panic in her throat. Surely he wasn\u2019t going to journey home in the dark? \u201cYou\u2019re wounded, my lord, and alone. Perhaps you should consider spending the night with us here?\u201d</p><p>He pivoted, his black cape swirling about his legs, and touched the tip of his black walking stick to the brim of his hat. She noticed for the first time that the silver head of his cane was worked into the shape of a perched hawk. \u201cYour concern is flattering, madam, but I do assure you that I can make it home to my own bed safely.\u201d</p><p>And with that he was gone.</p><p>Temperance let out a sigh, feeling oddly deflated.</p><p>That is, until Winter slowly turned in his chair, making it creak. \u201cI think I need an explanation, sister, as to how you came to know the infamous Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>HE WAS A creature of the night, unfit for the company of humans.</p><p>The gloom of the St. Giles night enveloped Lazarus as he strode rapidly away from Maiden Lane and Mrs. Dews\u2019s innocent little home for children. He was no more suited to that place than a falcon was a dovecote. He leapt over the stinking channel that ran down the middle of the street and turned down another smaller lane, heading west. What must she think of him, a wretched twisted animal that couldn\u2019t even stand the touch of his own kind? A shadow moved in a doorway ahead and he charged toward it, welcoming the possibility of violence. But the shadow separated from the darkness about it, and a slight figure fled away into the night.</p><p>Lazarus slowed his steps to a walk again, cursing the missed opportunity for distraction. He felt a trickle of moisture tickle his side\u2014he\u2019d reopened the wound with his exertion. But that wasn\u2019t why he looked for diversion.</p><p>He was hard and throbbing and had been ever since Mrs. Dews had touched his bare skin with her slim, pale hands. Her touch had brought not only desperate mental pain, but also an erotic lust so intense that it lasted into the coldness of the night. He laughed silently. The little martyr would no doubt be disgusted if she knew what she\u2019d done to him. She\u2019d be even more appalled if she knew his preferred method for easing such bodily urges. If the blood wasn\u2019t soaking into his breeches, he\u2019d find a female amenable to his demands. He\u2019d take his selection to some rooms nearby and...</p><p>The image of his last lover pushed itself into his head. Marie. Marie was dead, her body torn into a grotesque pile of offal. She\u2019d been murdered in the rooms he\u2019d rented for her here in St. Giles. The place had been at her insistence, and at the time\u2014two years ago now\u2014he hadn\u2019t thought much about the location beyond the fact that it was rather inconvenient for himself. But now it was evident that St. Giles held the key to her murder. It wasn\u2019t only because of his wound that he didn\u2019t take the time to relieve the lust Mrs. Dews had engendered\u2014he\u2019d been targeted tonight. The assassin with the leather nose patch had been at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s last night. Perhaps he\u2019d merely been a footpad intent on a purse, but Lazarus didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Someone didn\u2019t want him to find Marie\u2019s murderer.</p><p>\u201cYOU KNOW LORD Caire?\u201d Temperance stared at her brother.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cI may be a mere schoolmaster, sister, but even I hear the gossip in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down at her hands as she automatically cleaned and put away her needle and scissors. Her mind had gone completely blank except for the thought that everyone seemed to have heard of Lord Caire save herself.</p><p>Winter sighed and got up. He crossed to a cupboard and took down two glasses. They were fragile things that had once belonged to their mother, two of what had originally been a set of six. He brought them to the table and carefully poured two small glasses of the red wine.</p><p>Then he sat and took a sip, closing his eyes as he swallowed. He tilted back his head, the lines about his mouth deepening. \u201cThis wine is atrocious. I\u2019m surprised Lord Caire didn\u2019t dash it against the wall.\u201d</p><p>Temperance reached for her own glass and tasted, the sweet, acidic liquid warming her belly. The wine might be cheap, but she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d always thought it a funny quirk that Winter, the most ascetic of men usually, should be picky about wine.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me where you met the infamous Lord Caire?\u201d Winter asked quietly, his eyes still closed.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHe came to visit me two nights ago.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened then. \u201cHere?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wrinkled her nose, setting her wineglass carefully on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know about this visit?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, avoiding his eyes. \u201cYou were asleep when he called.\u201d She held her breath, wondering if she\u2019d have to explain how Lord Caire had called.</p><p>But Winter had other concerns. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me, Temperance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew that you\u2019d disapprove.\u201d She sighed and sat in the chair that Lord Caire had vacated. The seat was already cold. She\u2019d known that she would have to have this conversation with Winter eventually, but she\u2019d been cravenly putting it off. \u201cI don\u2019t know why exactly he\u2019s notorious, as you say, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t like me associating with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tilted her chin up, ignoring her twinge of guilt. \u201cI made a deal with him. He\u2019ll help me find a patron for the home, and in return I\u2019ll help him find the murderer of his mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve already paid the rent with the money he provided.\u201d</p> <p>There was a shocked silence. Temperance swallowed and looked down, avoiding the awful expression of hurt on Winter\u2019s face. She was doing this for him, she reminded herself. For Winter and the home.</p><p>After a moment, her brother sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve gotten yourself involved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me.\u201d She glanced up sharply. \u201cI know that the home will close even if you work yourself to death. I know I can\u2019t sit back and let that happen. I know I can help. I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Caire is notorious for his sexual perversions,\u201d Winter said, the flat, precise words interrupting her heated speech.</p><p>Temperance stared, closing her mouth. If she was a good woman, a chaste and pious woman, the words would repel her. Instead she felt a thrill, low and deep and forbidden. Dear God.</p><p>He continued. \u201cBe careful, sister. I cannot stop you, so I will not try. But if I ever think you are in danger, I will bring this matter to Concord.\u201d</p> <p>She drew in her breath but said nothing.</p><p>Winter\u2019s brown eyes, usually so calm and caring, had become hard and determined. \u201cAnd mark you this: Concord will stop you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Now, below King Lockedheart\u2019s balcony was a stone terrace with a door that led into the castle. In the room inside, there was a very small and very insignificant maid kneeling at the hearth. Her name was Meg, and it was her duty to clean the castle grates. It was a dirty job, but Meg did it cheerfully, for she was glad of the work. But because Meg was so very insignificant, the other inhabitants of the castle never noticed her at her work. Thus she\u2019d overheard more than a few conversations.</p><p>So when the king from his balcony above proclaimed how beloved he was, Meg couldn\u2019t help but giggle. She immediately clapped a hand over her mouth, but by then it was far too late....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Silence opened her eyes two mornings later and was greeted by the most wonderful sight in the world: the dear face of her husband, William. He was asleep, his full lips slightly parted, his brilliant green eyes closed. Fine white lines radiated from the corners of his eyes, in contrast to the sunburned skin of his face. His nightcap sat slightly ajar over his freshly shaven head. A light dusting of reddish stubble on his jaw glinted in the morning sunlight. Red curls shot with gray peeked at the top of his white nightshirt in delicious contrast to the strong column of his throat. She clenched internally at the sight. She wished she could push aside the nightshirt collar, kiss the base of his neck, and perhaps trail her tongue over his lovely, clean skin.</p><p>She blushed at the wanton thought. William preferred their bedsport at night after the candles had been put out, and he was quite right. Only a lustful creature would want to make love in the light of day on the morning after she\u2019d been so thoroughly satisfied by her husband\u2019s enthusiastic efforts the night before.</p> <p>So she rose, careful to not wake William. She refreshed herself with the pitcher of water on a chest of drawers and dressed quickly before quietly moving into the next room.</p><p>The rooms that William had found for them were not very big, but they were quite nicely appointed. Besides the tiny bedroom, they had a sitting room with a hearth on which Silence could cook. In the two years that she and William had been married, she\u2019d made their rooms cozy with small touches: a china shepherdess holding a pink lamb on the mantel, a lidded jar in the shape of an artichoke beside it\u2014Silence liked to hide pennies in there\u2014and curtains on the one window, scrimped and saved for and sewn herself. True, the curtains were a bit lopsided and didn\u2019t altogether close in the middle, but they were a lovely shade of peachy orange that always made her feel like sitting down to tea.</p><p>It was a nice home and she was proud of it.</p><p>Humming to herself, Silence built the fire up again and set a kettle of water on to make tea. By the time William emerged, yawning, from the bedroom, she had their little table laid out with hot tea and warmed buns and butter.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d William said, sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, my husband.\u201d Silence placed a kiss on one bristly cheek before pouring him a cup of tea. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I did,\u201d he replied as he broke apart one of the buns. They were only a little burned, and she had scraped off the worst bits. \u201cAmazing how much more pleasant it is to sleep on a bed that isn\u2019t rocking.\u201d</p><p>His grin was quick and flashed white teeth, and he looked so handsome it made her breath catch.</p><p>Silence looked down at her own bun, realizing she was squashing it between her fingers. She hastily set it on her plate. \u201cWhat will you do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to oversee the unloading of the Finch. We\u2019ll lose half our cargo to mudlarks if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, of course.\u201d Silence took a sip of her tea, trying to hide her disappointment. She\u2019d hoped that he could spend the day with her after so many months at sea, but that was a silly wish. William was the captain of a merchant ship, an important man. Naturally his responsibilities to his ship should come first.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t completely tamp down a twinge of disappointment.</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen it. William caught her hand in a rare show of open tenderness. \u201cI should have started unloading last night. Had I not such a beautiful young wife, I would have too.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the slow heating of her cheeks. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He nodded solemnly, but there was a twinkle in his green eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I was quite unable to withstand your temptation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, William.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep a silly grin from spreading over her face. They may\u2019ve been married for two years now, but over half that time her husband had been at sea. Each time he returned, it was like a honeymoon anew. Would that ever change? She certainly hoped not.</p><p>William squeezed her hand. \u201cThe quicker I\u2019m done with my duties, the quicker I can escort you to a park or a fair or even perhaps to a pleasure garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. I quite look forward to spending a day with my lovely wife.\u201d</p><p>She smiled into his eyes, feeling her heart flutter with happiness. \u201cThen you\u2019d better eat your breakfast, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and set to the bun and tea. Too soon he rose and finished dressing, donning a white wig in the process that gave him an air of stern authority. William kissed Silence on the cheek and then he was gone.</p><p>She sighed and looked about the room. There were dishes to wash and other chores to be done if she were to dally with her husband for a day. She set to work with determination.</p><p>Two hours later, Silence was darning a hole in one of William\u2019s white stockings and wondering if yellow yarn had been really the right color to use even if she had run out of white, when she heard running footsteps in the hall outside. She glanced up, frowning.</p><p>She\u2019d already risen by the time the pounding came at their doors. Silence hurried over and unlatched the door, pulling it open. William stood in the doorway, but she\u2019d never seen her husband in such a state. He was pale beneath his sunburn, his eyes stark.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she cried, her heart in her throat. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Finch...\u201d He staggered into the room, but then stood, his hands by his sides, staring wildly as if he knew not what to do. \u201cI\u2019m ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVERY GOOD, MARY Whitsun,\u201d Temperance said as she watched the girl place a careful stitch in her embroidery. They sat together in a corner of the kitchen while some of the other children made dinner. Mary\u2019s needlework was exquisite, and Temperance loved to help her with it when she had time. Unfortunately, there was rarely time. \u201cPerhaps we can place you with a mantua maker. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>Mary bent her head lower over her work\u2014the decoration on the edge of an apron. \u201cI\u2019d rather stay here with you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Temperance felt a familiar pang at the girl\u2019s whispered words. Her hand rose to stroke Mary\u2019s hair, but she caught herself in time and folded her fingers into a ball before withdrawing her hand. It was wrong to give false hope to the girl.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cIf we kept every child at the home, we\u2019d soon overflow.\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded, her face hidden by her down-bent head, but her shoulders trembled.</p><p>Temperance watched helplessly. She\u2019d always felt closer to Mary Whitsun than the other girls, though she knew she should not. Temperance had come to help work at the home after the death of Benjamin, her husband. She\u2019d saved Mary Whitsun not long after. The little girl had climbed into her lap that day, sitting there, warm and soft and comforting. At the time Temperance had needed someone to hold. Ever since then, she\u2019d known Mary Whitsun was special, no matter how Temperance tried to fight the feeling.</p><p>\u201cOh, ma\u2019am, you\u2019ll never guess,\u201d Nell cried, panting as she entered the kitchen.</p><p>Temperance looked up and arched an eyebrow at the maidservant. \u201cNo, I probably won\u2019t, so you had better tell me.\u201d</p><p>Nell held out a folded square of paper that she\u2019d obviously already read. \u201cLord Caire is escorting you to a musicale this evening!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Temperance took the paper, opening it blindly. She hadn\u2019t heard from Lord Caire since the night of his injury, and while she\u2019d been terribly worried for his health, at the same time she hadn\u2019t been entirely sure if sending a letter to inquire would be quite the thing. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d She trailed off as she read the elegant handwriting.</p><p>He was calling for her at four this afternoon. Temperance\u2019s gaze flew to the old clock on the kitchen mantel. The hands read just past noon. She was conscious that the kitchen had become suddenly silent, all the children staring at her.</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d For a moment, she was frozen, the missive crumpled in her hand. \u201cI have nothing to wear.\u201d She thought she\u2019d have at least a week to find a new dress!</p><p>Nell blinked and straightened like a soldier called to arms. \u201cMary Evening, you are in charge of the kitchen. Mary Whitsun, Mary St. Paul, and Mary Little, come with me. And you\u201d\u2014Nell pointed a stern finger at Temperance\u2014\u201cgo to your little sitting room and take off your dress.\u201d</p><p>Nell left with her minions marching behind her.</p><p>Temperance looked down at the sheet of paper in her hands, carefully smoothing it straight. Lord Caire\u2019s words jumped out at her, bold and firm. She would see him tonight. She\u2019d accompany him to a respectable entertainment. She\u2019d be on his arm. Oh. Oh, goodness. She felt her cheeks flush at just the thought, and while the majority of her emotions were fear and trepidation, there was a small but very definite part that leapt in excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Temperance snatched up a candle and hurried into her small sitting room. She swiftly stripped off her shawl, dress, and shoes. By the time Nell came back with her troops, Temperance stood in only shift and stays.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this for five years or more,\u201d Nell said as she entered with a bundle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to part with it even when I was at my most desperate.\u201d</p><p>She laid the bundle on a chair and unwrapped it. Shimmering red silk slithered across the chair\u2019s cushion. Temperance stared. The dress was beautiful\u2014bright and colorful and far, far too bold.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear that,\u201d she blurted before she could think of Nell\u2019s feelings.</p> <p>But Nell merely set her arms akimbo. \u201cAnd what else might you be wearing, Mrs. Dews? You can hardly go in that.\u201d</p><p>That being Temperance\u2019s usual black stuff dress, lying now across the back of the armchair. Temperance had exactly three dresses, and all were practical black stuff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d she began, but was immediately muffled as Nell threw the red dress over her head. She fought her way through the sleeves and bodice and emerged sputtering. Nell ran around behind her and began hooking up the back.</p><p>Mary Whitsun cocked her head critically. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty color, ma\u2019am, but the bodice doesn\u2019t quite fit.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked down, realizing she\u2019d never before seen so much of her bosom on display before. The bodice was extremely low. \u201cOh, no. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you certainly can\u2019t.\u201d Nell came around to examine her. \u201cNot like this anyway.\u201d And she plucked the loose fabric at the bodice, pulling it forward to two points in front of Temperance\u2019s own smaller breasts. Nell let the silk go and it sagged in the front. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll have to take it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about down here?\u201d Mary Whitsun asked. She\u2019d bent to peer at Temperance\u2019s hem, which unfortunately was several inches off the floor.</p><p>Nell grunted. \u201cThat too. Ladies, we have a busy afternoon ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>And they did. All afternoon, Nell and her company tugged and stitched and cut.</p><p>Nearly four hours later, Temperance stood in the kitchen for a last inspection. In the intervening time, she\u2019d bathed and washed her hair. Nell had set it expertly, threading a bit of crimson ribbon through her hair. The cherry-red dress almost glimmered in the firelight as Temperance attempted to yank up the neckline. It was still far too low for her tastes.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d Nell batted at her hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll pull out the stitches.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance froze. The last thing she needed was the dress to completely fall off of her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity you don\u2019t have proper slippers,\u201d Mary Whitsun said.</p><p>Temperance pulled aside her skirts to look at her sturdy black buckle shoes. \u201cWell, these will just have to do. And with the addition of the ruffle Nell added to the hem, I think they\u2019ll hardly be noticeable.\u201d The ruffle was black silk and had once been one of Papa\u2019s nicer coats.</p><p>\u201cIt does look lovely,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Temperance\u2019s mouth trembled. \u201cThank you, Mary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>She was absolutely terrified. Only now did the full implication of her bargain with Lord Caire bear upon her. She was going to rub shoulders with the aristocracy\u2014with those sparkling people, so elegant and bright they hardly seemed human. Would they think her a figure of fun?</p><p>How could they not?</p><p>Well, Lord Caire was certainly human enough. Temperance squared her shoulders. What did it matter what these exotic creatures thought of her? She was attending the musicale to save the home. For Winter and Nell and Mary Whitsun and all the other children. For them she could certainly endure one night\u2019s humiliation.</p> <p>So she smiled at her audience of small children and said, \u201cThank you all. You\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door!\u201d One of the little boys scurried to the front door.</p><p>\u201cJoseph Tinbox.\u201d Temperance started after him into the front hallway. \u201cDo not run. It hardly matters if\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Joseph Tinbox unlatched the door at that point and pulled it open, revealing not Lord Caire, but Silence.</p><p>Temperance halted. Her sister\u2019s face was pale and she wore no cap. Her lovely russet hair was windblown, her hazel eyes tragic. Silence never even glanced at the beautiful cherry-red dress.</p><p>\u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Temperance whispered.</p><p>Silence put her hand to the door frame as if to brace herself. \u201cWilliam\u2019s cargo has been stolen.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS PAST four by the time Lazarus\u2019s carriage pulled up at the end of Maiden Lane. The lane itself was too narrow for the carriage, so he descended the steps and told the coachman and footmen to wait before walking to the door of Mrs. Dews\u2019s foundling home. The sunlight hadn\u2019t yet completely faded, but he was sure to keep his fist firmly on his ebony walking stick. He caught the movement of a shadow out of the corner of his eye, a strange flicker of black and red, but when he turned, the thing\u2014a man?\u2014was gone.</p><p>After two nights of rest, his shoulder felt even worse than it had the evening he was wounded. It throbbed with a low, continual beat of pain. At the sight of the wound this morning, Small had broken his usual reserve to suggest that his master might do well to spend the evening abed\u2014a suggestion that Lazarus had discarded after only a moment\u2019s consideration. He owed Mrs. Dews an event in which she might go hunting a patron for her home. In addition, he was oddly eager to see her again, a state of mind that a dark inner part of himself found vastly amusing. He\u2019d nearly forgotten about the musicale invitation, but once remembered this morning, he knew it was one of the few events to which he might take Mrs. Dews.</p><p>Most of his invitations were considerably less benign than a musicale.</p><p>Lazarus used the head of his stick to rap upon the home\u2019s wooden door. It was opened almost at once by a small female urchin with an abundance of freckles over her cheeks and snub nose. She stood back without a word and he entered the pitiful hallway. It was empty save for themselves.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow at the child. \u201cWhere is Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>The child stared back, apparently stricken mute by his presence in her home.</p><p>Lazarus sighed. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>There was another awkward silence during which the child inserted a thumb into her mouth, and then they were both rescued by the clicking of advancing heels.</p><p>\u201cMary St. Paul, please return to the kitchen and tell Nell she must bar the door well behind me,\u201d Mrs. Dews said.</p><p>She was lit from behind by the light in the kitchen, and she seemed to come toward him in a glowing nimbus cloud. She wore a crimson frock, a startlingly bright color that contrasted to the severity of her usual attire. Her bosom was framed by a low, round neckline, the expanse of smooth white skin nearly glowing.</p><p>His groin had the predictable reaction.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cMrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Her gaze focused on him as if she\u2019d only now noticed him, and his vanity reared in disbelief.</p><p>He straightened, deliberately holding out his arm for her. It was expected, of course, the offering of his elbow to a lady, an everyday polite gesture. For him, however, with his peculiar aversion to touch, it\u2019d always been a source of discomfort and thus avoided if at all possible. But right now he seemed to yearn for her touch. Odd, that. She placed her fingers on his sleeve. He felt the jolt, even through the stiff fabric, but whether it was of pain or some more indefinable sensation, he was unable to tell.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he asked rhetorically.</p><p>But she seemed to hesitate, glancing back toward the home\u2019s kitchen. \u201cI think... Yes, I think so.\u201d She looked at him squarely for the first time, and he thought he detected a faint flush high on her cheeks. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and escorted her out the door. The night was chill, and she drew a thin wrap about her shoulders. The wrap was gray and coarse, obviously more her usual style, and looked even poorer contrasted to the rich red of her silk dress. Lazarus frowned, wondering where she\u2019d gotten the dress. Had she always had it, saving it for special occasions, or had she been forced to purchase it for this evening?</p><p>Mrs. Dews cleared her throat. \u201cYour letter said that it is a musicale we\u2019ll be attending.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d drawn abreast of the carriage, and one of the footmen had already jumped down to set the step. Lazarus took Mrs. Dews\u2019s fingers in his gloved hand, assisting her into the carriage.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he was glad to have her no longer touching him or not. \u201cThe hostess is Lady Beckinhall, a veritable lioness in London society. There should be many wealthy guests at her house tonight.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews settled herself on the cushions across from him. Lazarus knocked on the roof and took his own seat.</p><p>She was frowning down at her lap. \u201cYou make me sound mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He tilted his head, studying her. She was nervous and distracted tonight, but he didn\u2019t think it was at the prospect of attending such a rarefied social event. What had upset her? \u201cI don\u2019t mean to, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look out the darkened windows, staring at her own reflection, perhaps. \u201cI suppose I am mercenary, but it\u2019s for the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d For a moment, he felt an odd tenderness toward her, his little martyr.</p><p>Then she looked back at him. \u201cHow do you know Lady Beckinhall?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cShe is a good friend of my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d Her eyebrows had winged up her white forehead.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I emerged fully formed from my father\u2019s thigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She raised a hand to her bosom and then let it drop. \u201cYour mother is alive, then?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you have brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>He remembered wide brown eyes, too solemn for her age, and a touch that had never brought pain.</p><p>Lazarus blinked away the phantom. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, eyeing him doubtfully.</p><p>He made himself smile. \u201cTruly. I am the last of my family save my lady mother.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI have three brothers and two sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Makepeaces are obviously quite fertile,\u201d he replied drily.</p><p>She pursed her lips, as if in disapproval, but continued. \u201cI have a younger sister. Her name is Silence.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows but had the intelligence not to comment.</p><p>She leaned forward a little, the movement making her wrap slide off one ivory shoulder. He found himself wondering if she\u2019d made the movement intentionally.</p><p>\u201cSilence is married to a ship\u2019s captain, Mr. William Hollingbrook. He returned recently to port. Last night the cargo of his ship was stolen.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and watched him with those odd light brown eyes, as if waiting for a reaction.</p><p>He tried to think what would be usual, were this situation usual and he an ordinary man. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, his reply obviously inadequate. \u201cIf the cargo is not recovered, at least in part, Captain Hollingbrook will be ruined. Silence will be ruined.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his thumb over the silver falcon on his stick. \u201cWhy? Had he invested in the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but apparently the ship\u2019s owner is accusing him of complicity with the thieves.\u201d</p><p>He contemplated that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever heard of an entire ship\u2019s cargo being stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is rather extraordinary. Apparently it\u2019s not unusual for a portion of the cargo to go missing, but everything on board...\u201d She shrugged and sank back into the squabs as if weary.</p><p>He watched her, this woman from another world. He didn\u2019t know why she had chosen to confide her worries to him, but it pleased him irrationally to be the recipient of her confidence. His mouth twisted at his own idiocy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to burden you with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled suddenly, her lips trembling. \u201cI haven\u2019t thanked you for your invitation tonight.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our bargain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, I am grateful for your kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cThe very last thing I am is kind.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and turned her face away from him.</p><p>Damn it, he\u2019d spoken too rashly. He wanted to see her eyes, hear her telling him her worries again.</p><p>Lazarus cleared his throat, his voice gruff. \u201cI did not mean to speak so harshly.\u201d</p> <p>A corner of her mouth curved a little, though she did not deign to show him her full face. \u201cAre you apologizing to me, Lord Caire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I were?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cWould you accept my obeisance?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyelashes. \u201cI have no need to have you at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cThen perhaps it is my needs that would find me there.\u201d</p><p>He watched as a blush slowly stole up her neck.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d he whispered, \u201cyou might care to kneel before me?\u201d</p> <p>She drew in a quick breath as if insulted and looked at him, her eyes wide. It was to be expected\u2014his suggestion was crass and ungentlemanly. She should be insulted. But it wasn\u2019t insult that quickened her breath, made her sweet breasts press against her bodice with each inhale. It was something far more primitive.</p><p>Lazarus dropped his eyes as he felt the heat rise in his own body. He\u2019d hunted like this before, sighted and circled prey before diving and catching in his talons, but this... this was far more intense than any other hunt.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t... shouldn\u2019t talk to me that way,\u201d she said, her voice trembling\u2014but not with anger.</p><p>He stared at her from under his brows. \u201cWhy not? It amuses me to discuss these things with you. Does it not you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. He could see the movement of her throat clearly in the lantern\u2019s light. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do like it. I think you have the same image in your mind as I do. Shall I tell you what I see?\u201d</p><p>She had her hand at her throat, but she was mute, staring at him, her eyes glazed.</p><p>He let his gaze drop deliberately to the upper slopes of her exposed breasts. \u201cI see you in that dress, madam, kneeling before me, your skirts spread in a shining pool of crimson. I see myself standing before you. You look up at me, your golden eyes half closed as they are now, your lips reddened and wet from your tongue\u2014or perhaps mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned, her voice so low he only knew her words from the movement of her lips.</p><p>\u201cI see myself taking your hand and placing it on the fall of my breeches.\u201d His cock was hard, throbbing with his own words and her reaction to them. \u201cI see your slim, cool fingers carefully undoing each button as I stroke your bound hair. I see\u2014\u201d</p><p>The carriage jerked to a halt.</p><p>Lazarus inhaled softly and parted the curtains to glance out. Lady Beckinhall\u2019s town house blazed with light.</p><p>He let the curtain fall and looked across the carriage at Mrs. Dews. Her eyes were wide, her cheeks flushed, and he\u2019d wager his life that she was wet beneath those shimmering crimson skirts.</p><p>A corner of his mouth quirked up, but it wasn\u2019t humor he felt. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Shall we descend?\u201d He watched as she became aware, as white teeth bit that plump, lower lip. His voice lowered to gravelly depths. \u201cOr shall I tell the coachman to drive on?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>King Lockedheart bellowed for his guards to bring him the miscreant who had the temerity to laugh at him. Within seconds, Meg was dragged before him, bedraggled and sooty.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d roared King Lockedheart.</p><p>\u201cMeg, if it please Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her. \u201cAnd what did you find so amusing in my speech?\u201d</p><p>The guards and the courtiers, drawn by the commotion, all expected the small maid to throw herself at his feet and plead for her life.</p><p>But Meg rubbed the end of her sooty nose and decided since she was already damned, she might as well speak the truth. \u201cOnly that you think you are beloved by your people, Your Majesty.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>He was temptation personified.</p><p>Temperance stared at Lord Caire, feeling the rapid beat of her heart, the ache between her thighs. She\u2019d avoided men for the last nine years precisely because of her sinful desires. Yet here, now, she found herself seated across from a man far more seductive than any other she\u2019d ever met. He knew exactly how to rouse her demons, how to taunt and thrill until she was at feverish pitch, and the awful, terrible thing was that a part of her wanted\u2014needed\u2014to give in. To submit to the allure of his blue eyes. To kneel before him and touch that most earthly part of a man. To do the forbidden and open her mouth around him in an act that in no way could be about reproduction.</p><p>An act that was purely carnal.</p><p>No.</p><p>Temperance broke contact with his mesmerizing stare, drawing a shaky breath. \u201cLet me out.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t blink, simply stared at her with sapphire eyes that seemed to burn her exposed skin. Her breath caught at the look and the possibility that he wouldn\u2019t let her go, that he\u2019d take her and make her do those wicked things he\u2019d spoken of in that deep voice.</p><p>Then he sighed. \u201cVery well, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>He stood and opened the door to the carriage, descending first and holding out a hand to help her alight. Temperance placed her trembling fingers in his grasp, and for a long second, his hand closed over hers, hot and possessive, even through his glove. Then her feet touched the ground and he let go, offering his arm again instead. She took it, inhaling to steady herself, aware that he\u2019d shuddered at her touch. Around them, fashionable ladies stepped from carriages emblazoned with gilded coats of arms. The cherry-red dress that Nell had worked so hard on all afternoon suddenly seemed old and too obvious, the ribbon in her hair simply gauche. She swallowed in sudden trepidation. She didn\u2019t belong here. She was a house sparrow among peacocks.</p><p>Lord Caire leaned over her. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave even when entering a den of lions,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Inside, Lady Beckinhall\u2019s town house fairly sparkled with white marble, gilt, and crystal. Overhead, a chandelier shone with hundreds of candles. Temperance absently surrendered her old gray wool wrap to a footman, not even caring when he grimaced and took it with thumb and forefinger. The town house was like a fairy-tale castle. She trailed her fingers on the marble banister as Lord Caire led her upward. How many servants spent their days on hands and knees to keep the white marble clean?</p><p>At the top of the staircase, they followed the stream of brightly plumed people into a long room, mirrored along one entire wall so that there seemed to be thousands of gorgeously gowned ladies escorted by innumerable dauntingly elegant gentlemen. Had she been by herself, Temperance might\u2019ve fled, but Lord Caire\u2019s arm was solid and warm beneath her fingers.</p><p>\u201cCourage,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy dress,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cYour dress is fine,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI would not have let you enter otherwise. More importantly, you have nothing to be ashamed of in this crowd. You are just as well spoken as these ladies, just as quick-witted. And you have something they don\u2019t: you know how to make your way in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not usually something to be proud of,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cPerhaps it should be. Hold your head high.\u201d</p><p>One of the sophisticated ladies turned at their entrance and slowly strolled their way. Her dress was a deep blue, and as she drew nearer, Temperance could see that what she\u2019d at first taken for embroidered flowers on her skirts were, in fact, rubies and emeralds sewn into the fabric.</p><p>Dear God.</p><p>\u201cLazarus,\u201d the otherworldly creature drawled, \u201chow unexpected to find you here.\u201d</p><p>She was exquisitely beautiful, like some goddess come to earth to amuse herself at the expense of mortals. This close, Temperance could see that she wore two lovely pins in her hair, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies fashioned into birds. Small diamonds on the end of delicate wires trembled whenever the lady moved her head.</p><p>It was all Temperance could do to keep from gaping, but evidently Lord Caire had no such awe for the lady. He inclined his head in a bow so brief it was insulting.</p><p>The lady\u2019s lovely lips thinned, and her gaze turned to Temperance. \u201cAnd who is this... person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I introduce Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire said shortly.</p><p>Temperance noticed that he didn\u2019t introduce the other woman to her.</p><p>Apparently the lady noticed it as well. She stiffened. \u201cIf you\u2019ve brought one of your bawds to Lady Beckinhall\u2019s home...\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire arched an eyebrow. \u201cYour imagination does you no credit, my lady. I assure you that Mrs. Dews is likely the most respectable person here.\u201d</p><p>The lady\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cCareful, Lazarus. You tread a fine line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this woman to you?\u201d</p><p>Temperance felt her cheeks heat at the lady\u2019s obvious dismissal of her. She talked as if Temperance was a dog or a cat, a dumb beast unable to communicate.</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The lady blinked as if honestly startled at her ability to speak.</p><p>\u201cI said I am a friend of Lord Caire\u2019s,\u201d Temperance said firmly. \u201cAnd you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazarus, tell me this is a prank.\u201d She\u2019d turned back to Lord Caire, dismissing Temperance as thoroughly as she no doubt did a downstairs maid.</p><p>\u201cNo prank.\u201d Lord Caire smiled thinly. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought you of all people would be happy I chose a respectable lady to escort to this assemblage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespectable!\u201d The lady closed her eyes as if disgusted by the word. Then her sapphire eyes snapped open. \u201cSend her away and let me introduce you to one of your own rank. There are several unmarried\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Lord Caire had already started to guide Temperance away.</p><p>\u201cLazarus!\u201d the lady hissed behind them. \u201cI am your mother.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire stiffened and turned, a cruel smile on his lips. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told. Madam.\u201d</p><p>He sketched a bow. A fleeting expression crossed the lady\u2019s face as they turned away. Something vulnerable and unpracticed. Hurt, perhaps? And then her expression was controlled and cold again, and they were past her.</p><p>Temperance glanced at Lord Caire, aware that her cheeks had flamed. \u201cThat was your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, yes,\u201d he replied, and yawned behind an elegant fist.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d She would never have guessed their relationship from the open hostility that Lord Caire had shown the lady. Did he hate his own mother? She frowned as she remembered something else. \u201cDid she really think I was your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he clipped. He glanced at her and his voice gentled. \u201cDon\u2019t let it worry you. Anyone else has merely to look at you to know you would never let yourself be corrupted by me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced away, unsure if he teased or not, and that was when it happened. As she placed her foot down, she felt a catch and heard a rip. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced down at her frock, hoping she wasn\u2019t too obvious. \u201cI\u2019ve torn my hem.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cIs there somewhere I might repair it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and in a moment had procured the direction to the ladies\u2019 retiring room from a footman. The room was down a short hall, and Temperance carefully lifted her skirts as she made her way there. She looked around when she entered\u2014the room was well lit and nicely appointed with low chairs for a lady to rest on\u2014but no one was about. She stood, nonplussed for a moment. Weren\u2019t there supposed to be maids to assist the ladies? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shrugged and sat to inspect her hem.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>Temperance lifted her head, expecting to see a maid, but a lady had entered the room. She was tall and pale, her posture as correct as a queen\u2019s, and her hair was a lovely shade of light red. She wore a splendid gown\u2014a muted gray-green, overembroidered in silver thread.</p><p>Temperance blinked.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s face became bland. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to intrude....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Temperance said hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I was expecting a maid or... or... well, not a lady in any case. My hem is torn.\u201d</p><p>The woman wrinkled her straight nose. \u201cI hate when that happens.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cLady Kitchen is having an attack of hysterics or nerves I believe. No doubt that\u2019s where all the maids have gone to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Temperance glanced again at the black ruffle on her hem. It sagged quite sadly.</p><p>But the lady was kneeling before her now, her green and silver skirts spread about her like a shining cloud.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please don\u2019t,\u201d Temperance said instinctively. This woman was obviously aristocracy. What would she do if she knew Temperance was the daughter of a beer brewer?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the lady said quietly. She hadn\u2019t taken offense at Temperance\u2019s outburst. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few pins....\u201d</p><p>Deftly she flipped the hem up, pinned the ruffle in place, and flipped it back again. The pins didn\u2019t even show.</p><p>\u201cGoodness! You do that so well,\u201d Temperance exclaimed.</p><p>The lady rose and smiled shyly. \u201cI\u2019ve had practice. Ladies should stick together at these social events, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled in return, feeling confident for the first time since receiving Lord Caire\u2019s invitation. \u201cYou\u2019re so kind. Thank you. I wonder\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The door burst open and several ladies entered, maids fluttering about them. Apparently it was Lady Kitchen and her hysterics. In the confusion, Temperance was separated from her new friend, and by the time she made the hall outside the ladies\u2019 retiring room, the other woman was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Still Temperance returned to Lord Caire with a lighter step, having been warmed by the stranger\u2019s kindness. She found him leaning against a wall, surveying the company with a cynical gaze.</p><p>He straighten when he saw her. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She beamed. \u201cYes, quite.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in answer. \u201cThen let\u2019s find your prey.\u201d</p><p>They strolled to the far end of the room where gilded chairs had been placed in rows facing a beautifully painted piano. No one had yet taken a seat. Lord Caire led her to a trio of gentlemen.</p><p>\u201cCaire.\u201d A cadaverously thin gentleman in a white, full-bottomed wig nodded as they neared. \u201cI had not thought this your type of entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but my tastes are diverse.\u201d Lord Caire\u2019s lips curled. \u201cMay I introduce Mrs. Dews? Mrs. Dews, this is Sir Henry Easton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir.\u201d Temperance made her best curtsy as the older gentleman bowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd these are Captain Christopher Lambert and Mr. Godric St. John. Gentlemen, Mrs. Dews, along with her brother, Mr. Winter Makepeace, runs the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children in the East End, a most Christian and charitable institution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Sir Henry raised bushy eyebrows, looking at her in interest. Captain Lambert had also turned his gaze to her. In contrast, Mr. St. John, a tall man in a gray wig, had cocked an eyebrow over half-moon spectacles at Lord Caire.</p><p>For a moment, Temperance wondered what the connection was between Lord Caire and Mr. St. John.</p><p>Then Sir Henry asked, \u201cHow many foundlings does your institution house, Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled her most charming smile, intent on catching one of these fine gentlemen for the sake of the home.</p><p>\u201cWHAT ARE YOU about, Caire?\u201d St. John hissed out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lazarus kept his eyes on his little martyr as she used all of her Christian wiles to seduce Lambert and Easton into supporting her foundling home. \u201cI have no idea to what you refer.\u201d</p><p>St. John snorted softly and half turned so as to be heard only by Lazarus. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously as respectable as you claim, which means that you\u2019re either using her for some ends of your own or your debauchery has descended to the rape of innocents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, sir,\u201d Lazarus drawled, placing his fingertips over his heart. He knew he looked ironic\u2014jaded, even\u2014but oddly, inside his chest, he did feel a twinge of something that might\u2019ve been hurt.</p><p>St. John had leaned close to whisper, \u201cWhat do you want from her?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhy? Will you play her gallant knight and steal her away from my dastardly arms?\u201d</p><p>St. John cocked his head, his normally mild gray eyes sharpened to granite. \u201cIf need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you that I\u2019d truly allow you to take from me something I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk of Mrs. Dews as if she\u2019s a plaything.\u201d St. John\u2019s expression had turned analytical. \u201cWould you break her in a fit of spoiled temper?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus smiled thinly. \u201cIf I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d St. John murmured. \u201cYou are not so lost to humanity as you sometimes like to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus no longer smiled. He glanced at Mrs. Dews, discussing her charity home with earnest enthusiasm. Had she made the slightest sign of acquiescence in the carriage, she might at this moment be accepting his cock into her sweet saintly mouth. Wasn\u2019t the debauchery of a saint the work of a devil? He looked back at St. John, the only man in this world who he might call a friend. The room had grown damnably hot, and his shoulder sent sharp shards of pain down his arm.</p><p>\u201cA word to the wise: make no wagers on my humanity.\u201d</p><p>St. John arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ll not sit back and watch you hurt an innocent. I will take her away from you if I think she needs my help.\u201d</p><p>The anger shot through him so quickly Lazarus had bared his teeth before he realized.</p><p>St. John must\u2019ve seen the murder in his eyes. He actually stepped back. \u201cCaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Lazarus hissed. \u201cNot even in jest, St. John. Mind your own lady. Mrs. Dews is mine to do with as I please.\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s glance flicked between him and Mrs. Dews. \u201cAnd does she have no say in this matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lazarus growled, aware that he sounded like a dog standing guard over a bone.</p><p>St. John raised his eyebrows. \u201cDoes she know your intent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will.\u201d And Lazarus turned and caught Mrs. Dews\u2019s arm, interrupting her in midspeech. \u201cExcuse me, gentlemen. I wish to find Mrs. Dews the best seat possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sir Henry murmured, but Lazarus was already steering her away from the others.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d Mrs. Dews looked none too pleased with him. \u201cI had just begun discussing the amount of fresh vegetables we buy every month for the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA most interesting topic, I have no doubt.\u201d He needed to sit down, to rest a bit. Damn the wound in his shoulder.</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cWas I boring them? Is that why you intervened?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched in amusement. \u201cNo. They seemed more than happy to listen to you lecture them on clothing and feeding urchins for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. Then why did you take me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause \u2019tis always better to leave the buyer wanting,\u201d he whispered into the dark hair over her ear. The silly red ribbon twined in and out of the glossy locks, and for a wild moment, he wanted to tug it free. To watch as her hair came tumbling down about her shoulders.</p><p>She turned and looked up, so close he could see the flecks of gold in her light brown eyes. \u201cAnd have you sold very many things, Lord Caire?\u201d</p><p>She was teasing him, this proper Christian woman. Did she have no fear of him? Did she not sense the darkness that bubbled deep within him?</p><p>\u201cNot things so much as... ideas,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She cocked her head, those gilded eyes curious. \u201cYou\u2019ve sold ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d he said as he guided her toward two chairs at the end of a row near the front. \u201cI belong to a number of philosophical and scientific societies.\u201d He seated her and flicked apart the skirts of his coat to sit beside her. \u201cWhen one argues a point, one is in effect selling it to the opposition, if you understand me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mention the other type of \u201cselling\u201d he did\u2014the luring of sexual partners into performing actions they would in other circumstances never contemplate.</p><p>\u201cI think I comprehend your meaning.\u201d Mrs. Dews\u2019s eyes lit with amusement. \u201cI confess, I\u2019d not seen you in the role of idea merchant, Lord Caire. Is that what you do with your days? Argue with other learned gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd translate various Greek and Latin manuscripts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry, mostly.\u201d He glanced at her. Did she really find this interesting?</p><p>But her golden eyes sparkled as she cocked her head. \u201cYou write poetry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI translate it\u2014quite different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I would think it somewhat similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t poets have to worry over meter, rhyme, and the proper words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and smiled, making him catch his breath. \u201cI would think the translator would have to worry over those things as well.\u201d</p><p>He stared. How did she know, this simple woman from another walk of life entirely? How had she with one sentence articulated the passion he found in his translations? \u201cI suppose you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hide a poet\u2019s soul well,\u201d she said. \u201cI would never have guessed it.\u201d</p><p>She was definitely teasing him now.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He stretched his long legs before him. \u201cBut then there\u2019s quite a lot you don\u2019t know about me, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d Her gaze skipped over his shoulder, and he knew she looked at his mother in conversation with Lady Beckinhall in the corner. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an unnatural fondness for marzipan sweetmeats.\u201d</p><p>He felt more than heard her giggle, and the small, innocent sound sent a frisson of warmth through him. She hid her emotions so well usually, even the joyous ones.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had marzipan sweetmeats in ages,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He had a sudden urge to buy her a boxful just to watch her eat them. Her red lips would become sprinkled with the sugar and she\u2019d have to lick them clean. His groin tightened at just the thought.</p><p>\u201cTell me something else about yourself. Something true.\u201d She watched him, those pale brown eyes mysterious. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShropshire.\u201d He looked away, watching as his mother made some comment to another lady. The jewels in her white hair sparkled as she tilted her head. \u201cMy family\u2019s seat is near Shrewsbury. I was born at Caire House, our ancestral home. I\u2019m told that I was a puling, weakly babe, and my father sent me away to the wet nurse with little hope that I would live out the sennight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as if your parents were worried for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly, the knowledge as old as his bones. \u201cI stayed with my nurse for five years, and in that time, my parents saw me only once a year, on Easter day. I remember because my father used to scare me witless.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea why he told her this; it hardly showed him in a heroic light.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He glanced at her curiously. \u201cShe accompanied my father, of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014her brows knit together again as if she were trying to puzzle something out\u2014\u201cwas she affectionate?\u201d</p><p>He stared. Affection? He looked again at his mother, now making her way to a seat. She moved gracefully, the embodiment of cold elegance. The thought of her showing affection for anyone, let alone him, was ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said patiently, as if explaining the intricacies of the English monetary system to a Chinaman. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come to express affection.

Was she affectionate toward you?\u201d</p> <p>The question sent a nasty wave of pain through him, the sensation exquisitely awful, and his shoulder throbbed in the aftermath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he lied.</p><p>She opened her mouth as if to question him further, but he\u2019d had enough. \u201cAnd you, Mrs. Dews? What was your upbringing like?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips for a moment as if she wouldn\u2019t let him lead her into a different conversational avenue. Then she sighed. \u201cI was born here in London, not far from the foundling home, actually. Father was a brewer. There are six children in my family: Verity; Concord, who runs the brewery now; Asa; myself; Winter; and my youngest sister, Silence. Father met the acquaintance of Sir Stanley Gilpin when I was quite young, and with his patronage, Father established the foundling home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pretty tale,\u201d Lazarus drawled, watching her face. She\u2019d recited the story almost by rote. \u201cYet, it tells me very little about you.\u201d</p> <p>She looked startled. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t much to tell beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think there is,\u201d he murmured softly. The chairs about them were beginning to fill, but he was loath to give up this discussion so soon. \u201cDid you work in the home as a child? Were you schooled at all? And where and when did you meet your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent my childhood at home mostly,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cMother schooled me until she died when I was thirteen years of age. Thereafter, my elder sister, Verity, took over the chore of raising us younger children. The boys were sent to school, of course, but there wasn\u2019t enough money to send the girls. I fancy, though, that our education was quite adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t mentioned the late Mr. Dews. In fact, I\u2019ve never heard you speak of your husband.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, her face paling, a reaction he found infinitely fascinating.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dews\u2014Benjamin\u2014was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of my father\u2019s,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBenjamin had studied for the church but decided to join Father in his work to help the orphans of St. Giles instead. I met him when I was seventeen, and we married shortly thereafter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sounds like quite the saint,\u201d Lazarus said, irony dripping from his words.</p><p>Mrs. Dews was somber, though. \u201cYes, he was. He worked incredibly long hours at the foundling home. He was always gentle and patient with the children; he was kind to everyone he knew. I once saw him take off his own coat and give it to a beggar who had none.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus gritted his teeth, leaning close to hiss, \u201cTell me, Mrs. Dews, do you have a shrine in your rooms to commemorate your dead saint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She turned a shocked face to him.</p><p>It only inflamed his urge to hurt her more. To make her feel so that he could revel in her reflected emotions. \u201cDo you kneel before his shrine and genuflect? Does his memory keep you warm in your lonely bed at night? Or do you have to resort to other, less spiritual means of satisfaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d Her eyes sparked at his crude insinuation.</p><p>His corrupted heart crowed at the sight of the rage his words had provoked. She made to stand, but he caught her arm in a hard grip, forcing her to remain seated.</p><p>\u201cHush, now,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThe music is about to begin. You wouldn\u2019t want to storm out now and destroy all the progress you made earlier with Captain Lambert and Sir Henry, would you? They might think you a fickle creature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loathe you.\u201d She pressed her lips together, turning her face away as if the very sight of him revolted her.</p><p>But despite her words, she remained by his side, and that was all that mattered in the end. He cared not a whit if she loathed him, even wanted him dead, as long as she felt something for him. As long as he could keep her close.</p><p>HOW DARE HE?</p><p>Temperance stared at her balled hands in her lap as she struggled not to show her rage. What had provoked Lord Caire\u2019s disgusting attack on her and the memory of Benjamin? They\u2019d been having a simple conversation about everyday things and suddenly he\u2019d erupted. Was he insane? Or was he so jealous of a normal man\u2014a man who could feel kindness and sympathy\u2014that he must lash out at merely the thought?</p><p>Lord Caire\u2019s hand still gripped her elbow, hot and hard, and he tightened it at her shiver. \u201cDon\u2019t even think of it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother replying to him. The truth was that a part of her anger had dissipated when she thought of his loveless childhood.</p><p>Not, of course, that she meant to tell him that.</p><p>Temperance looked away from him, watching as the guests found seats. Lady Caire let herself be seated by a handsome gentleman in a bag wig. The man was obviously younger than she, but he attended her quite tenderly. Temperance wondered suddenly if they were lovers. What odd morals the aristocracy had. Her gaze wandered to where Sir Henry sat beside a stout matronly lady, obviously his wife. She looked like a pleasant lady.</p><p>Temperance caught a flash of silver out of the corner of her eye, and her head turned to follow the movement. Her breath caught. The elegant young lady from the retiring room was strolling toward the chairs. She seemed to be all alone, her pale green and silver gown a perfect foil for her bright red hair and graceful, long white throat. All eyes were upon her as she neared the chairs, but she seemed unaware as she sank into a seat.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Temperance whispered, forgetting for the moment that she wasn\u2019t talking to Lord Caire.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d the impossible man drawled.</p><p>How could he not know? Half the room was gawking at her. \u201cThe lady in silver and green.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire twisted his neck to look and then leaned unnecessarily close. Heat seemed to radiate off his body. \u201cThat, my dear Mrs. Dews, is Lady Hero, the sister of the Duke of Wakefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sister of a duke?\u201d Temperance breathed. Goodness! What a very good thing she hadn\u2019t known that when the lady had been helping her.</p><p>She\u2019d once stood on a corner for three hours just to catch a glimpse of His Majesty\u2019s carriage in a procession, but that had been years ago. Besides, all she\u2019d seen was a bit of white wig that may have\u2014or may not have\u2014been the king\u2019s head. Lady Hero was right here in the same room.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Lord Caire sounded amused. \u201cAnd the daughter of a duke as well, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>She turned and opened her mouth to set him down, but he placed a warm finger across her lips. \u201cHush. They are about to begin.\u201d</p><p>And she saw he was right. A gentleman in a splendid white wig and gold-trimmed coat had seated himself before the piano. A younger man stood by his side to turn the pages of the sheet music.</p><p>Lady Beckinhall stood at the front of the room and made some type of announcement, no doubt introducing the pianist, but Temperance hardly paid her mind. Her gaze was fixed on the gentleman at the piano. He sat quietly, unsmiling even when Lady Beckinhall gestured to him. He merely nodded once curtly and waited as she seated herself. He stared at the piano keys before him, seemingly oblivious to the guests who still chattered behind him. Then abruptly he began to play.</p><p>Temperance caught her breath, leaning slightly forward. The piece was unfamiliar to her, but the fine chords, the flying notes, lifted something inside of her. She closed her eyes, savoring the sweet swelling in her chest. Moisture pricked at her eyes. It had been so long since she\u2019d heard music like this.</p><p>So long.</p><p>She drifted, her entire being focused on the music until at last it drew to a close. Only then did Temperance open her eyes and sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou liked it,\u201d a deep voice said next to her.</p><p>She blinked at Lord Caire and realized that her hand was grasped in his. She looked down at their intertwined fingers, puzzled. Had she taken his hand or had he reached for hers? She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>He tugged gently. \u201cCome. Walk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but...\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the piano, but the pianist had already left. Around them the other guests were standing or strolling, none of them appearing at all affected by the music.</p><p>She turned back to Lord Caire.</p><p>His blue eyes were intent, his high cheekbones ruddy. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>She rose and followed him silently, paying no attention to where he led until he opened a door and ushered her into a small sitting room, lit by a fire.</p><p>Temperance frowned. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>But Lord Caire closed the door behind her, and she turned to see him advancing toward her. \u201cYou liked the music.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in confusion. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no of course.\u201d His sapphire eyes seemed to glitter in the firelight. \u201cMost who come to a musicale pay little or no attention to the music. But you... you were entranced.\u201d</p><p>He was so intent upon her that she backed up a step and found herself against a settee.</p><p>Still he came closer, heat blasting from him like a furnace. \u201cWhat did you hear? What did you feel in that music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d she stuttered. What did he want of her?</p><p>He caught her shoulders. \u201cYes, you do. Tell me. Describe your emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt free,\u201d she whispered, her heart beating hard. \u201cI felt alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d His face was angled, his eyes examining her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know!\u201d She placed her palms on his chest, pushing, but though he stiffened at her touch, he didn\u2019t budge. \u201cHow can one describe music? It\u2019s an impossible task. One either feels the wonder or one doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re one of the few who does feel it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was on hers. Hot, insistent, working as if he meant to draw from her bodily what he couldn\u2019t in words. She gripped his arms, unable to defend herself from this onslaught so soon after the ecstasy of the music.</p><p>Eagerly she opened her mouth, wanting to taste, wanting to feel without guilt, just this once. He thrust his tongue into her mouth, withdrawing and thrusting again until she moaned and caught his tongue, sucking on it, tasting wine, tasting him. She wanted to pull the coat from his shoulders, to rip off his shirt and feel again the smooth skin beneath. To place her mouth against his nipple and lick him.</p><p>Dear God, she\u2019d lost her mind, her balance, and her morals, and she no longer cared. She wanted to be free again, to feel without thought or horrible memory. She wanted to be born anew, pure and without sin. She ran her hands up his arms, squeezing, testing the hard muscles beneath until she reached his shoulders, then\u2014</p><p>\u201cDamnation!\u201d The word was a groan as Lord Caire ripped his mouth from hers.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She\u2019d forgotten his injured shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She reached for him, not sure what she could do, perhaps only wanting to offer comfort.</p><p>But he shook his head, beads of sweat on his upper lip. \u201cDon\u2019t worry yourself, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>He straightened from where he\u2019d leaned against the settee back, but then swayed.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sit,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss,\u201d he murmured irritably, but his voice was weak. Something dark stained the shoulder of his coat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Temperance felt a thrill of fear. His face was too red, the heat of his body too hot. She swallowed, keeping her voice calm. In her experience, gentlemen never wanted to admit weakness. \u201cI... I find myself weary. Would you mind terribly if we left?\u201d</p><p>To her relief, he didn\u2019t argue over her obvious stratagem. Instead, Lord Caire straightened and offered her his arm. He led her back to the musicale room. There he made his way far too leisurely through the guests, pausing to exchange banter with other gentlemen, before making his excuses for his early departure to the hostess. All the while, Temperance watched him anxiously, aware that sweat slicked his brow. By the time they retrieved her wrap, he was leaning heavily on her. She wasn\u2019t even sure he was conscious of it or not.</p><p>\u201cTell the coachman to drive to Lord Caire\u2019s town house,\u201d she told the footman as he helped Lord Caire up the steps to the carriage. \u201cTell him to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the footman said, and slammed the carriage door.</p> <p>\u201cSuch drama, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire drawled. His head lolled against the squabs, his eyes closed. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to return to your foundling home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it best that we get you to your home as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Temperance braced as the carriage swung hard around a corner. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. Because despite her light words, she knew her worry was well founded. She very much feared Lord Caire\u2019s wound was infected.</p> <p>And infection could kill a man.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>At Meg\u2019s words, all within the room gasped.</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d the king roared. \u201cI am beloved by my people. Everyone tells me this is so.\u201d</p><p>Meg shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty, but they have lied to you. You may be feared but you are not loved.\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI will prove to you that I am loved by my people, and when I have done so, I will have your head to decorate my palace gates. Until then, you may reside in my dungeons.\u201d</p> <p>And with a wave of his hand, Meg was dragged away....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Infection could kill within days\u2014hours if the wound turned putrid rapidly.</p><p>Temperance couldn\u2019t keep the morbid thought from her mind as Lord Caire\u2019s carriage rumbled through the dark London streets. She didn\u2019t even know where he lived or if they had a long ride or one of only minutes. Perhaps she should\u2019ve insisted he stay at Lady Beckinhall\u2019s town house, despite his obvious desire to conceal his illness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire said slowly from across the carriage. \u201cI vow, it makes me nervous. What plots have you worked for me in that Puritanical mind of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wondered how soon we would arrive at your house.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his head, squinting out the window as night lights flashed by. After a bit, he closed his eyes again. \u201cI can\u2019t tell where we are. Halfway to Bath, for all I know. But never fear, my coachman is a humorless man. He\u2019ll see us safely home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you like dancing as well?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>Was he delirious? \u201cI don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally not,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMartyrs dance only upon crosses. I\u2019m surprised you let yourself enjoy even something as innocent as piano music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to have a spinet as a young girl,\u201d she said absently. Surely they must be nearly there?</p><p>\u201cAnd you played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She remembered suddenly the feel of the smooth, cool piano keys beneath her fingers, the sheer joy of producing music. That time seemed so innocent and far away now.</p><p>His eyes cracked lazily. \u201cBut you no longer play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sold the spinet after my husband\u2019s death.\u201d She waited for him to make a cutting remark about Benjamin again.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The simple question startled her enough that she glanced at him. He was watching her through slitted eyes, the blue of his irises glittering even in the dim carriage.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy sell the piano you so obviously treasured? Did you fear you\u2019d be tempted by the small pleasure of the music? Or was it something else?\u201d</p><p>Temperance clenched her hands together in her lap, but her voice was calm as she replied with a half-truth. \u201cWe needed the money for the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you did,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you sold your spinet. You enjoy punishing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a nasty thing to say.\u201d She turned her face away from him, feeling the heat in her cheeks. Prayed he couldn\u2019t see her in the dim carriage.</p><p>\u201cYet you don\u2019t deny the accusation.\u201d He grunted in pain as the carriage rocked.</p><p>She glanced swiftly at him, only to inhale as she met his sharp gaze. Even in his weakened state, she felt as if she were pinned by a predator.</p><p>\u201cWhat imagined sin do you punish yourself for?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cDid you covet another female\u2019s bonnet once as a child? Gorge yourself on sweetmeats? Felt a naughty thrill at a lout brushing up against you in the street?\u201d</p><p>Raw rage, sharp and unexpected, washed over her, making Temperance shake. She restrained herself from shouting a retort only with difficulty. Instead, she breathed deeply, staring at her fists in her lap. To let herself speak now would be the height of stupidity. She\u2019d say too much, reveal too much. He was perilously close to her secret shame as it was.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Lord Caire\u2019s obnoxiously calm voice drawled, \u201cperhaps the sin was more grave than those I cite.\u201d</p><p>She remembered that long-ago thrill when she\u2019d catch sight of a certain man, his crooked smile making her heart leap so unbearably. The memories were shadows of her ancient emotions and desires, still lurking long after their progenitor had died.</p><p>Temperance lifted her head, staring into his wicked blue eyes, her jaw clenched. A slight smile played about his wide mouth, sensuous and seductive. Did he torture her out of curiosity? Did he enjoy her pain?</p><p>The carriage halted and Lord Caire broke their stare. \u201cAh. We\u2019ve arrived. Thank you for accompanying me home, Mrs. Dews. Once I alight, the coachman will take you to your own home. I bid you good night.\u201d</p><p>She was terribly tempted to simply leave him here. He\u2019d taunted and prodded her like a little boy poking sticks at a caged monkey, purely for his own amusement. And yet when he stood and swayed, half slumping against the carriage doorway, she jumped up.</p><p>\u201cI loathe you, Lord Caire,\u201d Temperance said through gritted teeth as she took his arm.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve informed me already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not finished.\u201d She staggered as he leaned heavily against her. A young footman opened the carriage door, and he immediately took Lord Caire\u2019s other arm to help him down. \u201cYou\u2019re an impossibly rude man, without morals or even manners, as far as I can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop, I beg you, Mrs. Dews.\u201d Lord Caire grunted. \u201cYou\u2019ll turn my head with this flattery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Temperance continued, ignoring his words, \u201cyou\u2019ve behaved abominably to me since the moment we met\u2014when you broke into my home, might I remind you.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire had made it to the street, where he paused, panting, his hand on the shoulder of the young footman who gaped at the two of them. \u201cIs there a point to this diatribe, or are you merely venting your spleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a point,\u201d Temperance said as she helped him up the steps to his imposing town house. \u201cDespite your treatment of me and your own foul personality, I intend to stay with you until a doctor sees to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattered though I am by your martyrish impulses, Mrs. Dews, I have no need of your help. Bed and a brandy will no doubt see me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Temperance eyed the idiot man, swaying on his own doorstep. Sweat dripped down his reddened face, the hair at his temples was plastered to his head, and he literally shook against her.</p><p>In one swift move, Temperance elbowed him in his wounded shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s blood!\u201d Lord Caire doubled over, choking.</p><p>\u201cSend for a doctor,\u201d Temperance ordered the butler, who was standing wide-eyed at the door next to another footman. \u201cLord Caire is ill. And you two\u201d\u2014she jerked her chin at the footmen\u2014\u201chelp Lord Caire to his bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d gasped Lord Caire, \u201care a vindictive harpy, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d Temperance said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m merely doing my Christian duty.\u201d</p><p>The sound he made at her words might\u2019ve been either a laugh or a grunt of pain; it was hard to tell. In any case, Lord Caire made no more argument as the footmen helped him up the stairs to his room.</p><p>Temperance followed behind, and although her motives for making sure that Lord Caire was properly seen to were almost entirely altruistic, she still couldn\u2019t help herself from noting his home. The staircase they mounted was marble, but even more grand than the one at Lady Beckinhall\u2019s town house. It curved elegantly into the upper floor. Huge portraits of men in armor and haughty women in fabulous jewels lined the walls, their eyes seeming to examine with disapproval her intrusion into this home. Beneath her feet, a lush crimson carpet lined the stairs, cushioning their footsteps. In the upper hallway, life-sized marble statues peered eerily out of niches along the walls. Tall double doors were thrown wide as their procession neared. A slight servant of middling years stood anxiously by as they entered Lord Caire\u2019s rooms.</p><p>Temperance turned to him as the footmen took Lord Caire to the massive bed in the center of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re Lord Caire\u2019s valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He looked between her and Lord Caire. \u201cMy name is Small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Temperance turned to the footmen. \u201cFetch some water, as hot as possible, and clean cloths, please. Also, a bottle of strong spirits.\u201d</p><p>The footmen left hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cJust let me be, man!\u201d Lord Caire\u2019s irritable voice rose from the bed.</p><p>Temperance turned to see the valet backing away from his master. Lord Caire sat on the side of the bed, his head hanging, his body listing against the green and brown embroidered bed curtains.</p><p>\u201cBut, my lord... , \u201d the poor valet protested.</p><p>She sighed. What a very exasperating gentleman Lord Caire was!</p><p>She advanced on the bed with determination. \u201cYour wound has grown foul, my lord. You must let Small and me help you.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire swung his head sideways and glared at her out of the corner of his eye like a wild thing. \u201cI\u2019ll let you take care of me, but Small must leave the room. Unless you enjoy an audience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be disgusting,\u201d she said, far too gently, as she raised his uninjured arm and drew the coat sleeve off him. She frowned at the stain on his right shoulder. \u201cThis will be painful, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire had closed his eyes but he smiled crookedly. \u201cAll touch gives me pain. And besides, I have no doubt that any pain you cause me will at least bring you vast amusement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a terrible thing to say.\u201d Temperance was unaccountably wounded. \u201cYour pain brings me no joy.\u201d</p><p>She gently eased the coat sleeve from his shoulder, but despite her efforts, he hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered as Small deftly unbuttoned Lord Caire\u2019s waistcoat. Caire seemed to have forgotten that he\u2019d ordered the manservant to leave, and she was relieved\u2014undressing him would be hard enough with just the two of them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Lord Caire murmured. \u201cPain has always been my friend. It reminds me when I venture too near the edge of reason.\u201d</p><p>He sounded delirious. Temperance frowned as she examined his shoulder. His wound was seeping and the poisonous fluids had glued his shirt to his body. She looked up to meet the gaze of the valet. From the manservant\u2019s anxious expression, he\u2019d seen the problem as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The footmen returned with the hot water and cloths at that moment, trailed by the short, stout butler.</p><p>\u201cSet it there,\u201d Temperance directed, pointing to a table by the bed. \u201cHas the doctor been sent for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the butler said in a sonorous voice.</p><p>Small cleared his throat, and when Temperance looked at him, he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019d best not wait for the doctor, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s unreliable after seven of the clock.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance glanced at the elegant gold clock on the bedside table. It was nearing eight at night. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drinks,\u201d Lord Caire slurred from the bed. \u201cAnd his hands shake. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019d let the blighter near me in that state in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t there another doctor we can send for?\u201d Temperance asked. For goodness\u2019 sake! Lord Caire was wealthy. He should have plenty of people to look after him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make inquiries, ma\u2019am,\u201d the butler said, and left.</p><p>Temperance took up one of the clean linens, soaked it in the near-boiling water, and gently placed it on Lord Caire\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>He jerked as if she\u2019d laid a white-hot poker against his bare skin. \u201cGod\u2019s blood, madam, do you mean to parboil the flesh from my bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Temperance replied. \u201cWe need to loosen your shirt from the wound so we don\u2019t tear open the stitches when we remove it.\u201d</p><p>He swore rather foully.</p><p>Temperance chose to ignore that. \u201cIs it true what you said before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat all touch pains you?\u201d Terrible of her to take advantage of his condition to quiz him, but she was curious.</p> <p>He closed his eyes. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Temperance stared at him, this wealthy, titled aristocrat. How could the touch of another human being possibly hurt him? But perhaps the pain he spoke of wasn\u2019t purely physical.</p><p>She shook her head and looked at the valet. \u201cIs there anyone we should send for? A relative or a friend of Lord Caire\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>The valet hummed under his breath and his eyes slid from hers. \u201cAh... I\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her, Small,\u201d Lord Caire rumbled. His eyes were closed, but his hearing apparently was quite acute.</p><p>Small gulped. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Temperance frowned, rinsing out the linen and applying it afresh. \u201cI know you\u2019re estranged from your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cSurely there\u2019s someone, Caire?\u201d</p><p>Both men were silent. Oddly the valet seemed more embarrassed than Lord Caire. Caire merely looked bored.</p><p>\u201cWhat about, er\u201d\u2014Temperance kept her eyes on the hot linen she was holding to his shoulder, the heat rising in her cheeks\u2014\u201ca... a female you might be close to?\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire chuckled softly and opened his eyes. They were far too bright. \u201cSmall, when was the last time you saw a female other than a maidservant step foot in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d The valet\u2019s eyes were fixed on his shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first lady to cross my threshold in ten years, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lord Caire drawled. \u201cThe last one was my mother, the day I ushered her from my home. On the whole, I think you ought to be flattered, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>LAZARUS WATCHED AS pink suffused Mrs. Dews\u2019s face. The color was becoming, and even in his weakened state, he felt a stirring in his loins, a longing that was more than sexual. For a moment, there seemed to be a twinge in his breast, a strange wish that his life, his person, could in some way be different. That he could somehow deserve a woman such as her.</p><p>Mrs. Dews took away the cloth from his shoulder, wrung it out, and replaced it, the sharp sting of the heat rousing him from his reverie. His head ached, his body felt weak and hot, and his shoulder was on fire. He wished to simply lie down and sleep, and if he never awakened... well, would that be such a very great loss to the world?</p><p>But Mrs. Dews had no intention yet of letting him escape. \u201cYou have no one at all to take care of you?\u201d</p><p>She touched, whether by accident or design, his hand, and he felt the familiar burning pain. He kept his hand still only with an effort of will. Perhaps with repeated applications, he might become used to the pain of her touch\u2014like a dog so often cuffed he no longer flinched at the blow. Perhaps he might even come to like the sensation.</p><p>Lazarus laughed, or at least tried to. The sound emerged more like a croak. \u201cOn my word, Mrs. Dews, no one. My mother and I talk as little as possible, I count but one man I could call a friend, and he and I fell out recently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question\u2014damned if he\u2019d send for St. John tonight. \u201cAnd despite your romantic notions, even if I had replaced my mistress, I\u2019d not call her to my sickbed. The ladies I employ thus have other, ah, uses. As I\u2019ve said before, I do not bring them into my home.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together at that information.</p><p>He eyed her sardonically. \u201cI am at your tender mercy, I fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She frowned down at him as she took off the cloth and tested the shirt beneath.</p><p>He hissed as the material pulled away from his wound.</p><p>\u201cIt has to come off,\u201d she murmured to Small, as if Lazarus was an infant they were taking care of between them.</p><p>The valet nodded and they took off his shirt\u2014an excruciating operation. By the time they\u2019d finished, Lazarus was panting. He didn\u2019t need to look at his bare shoulder to know that the thing was gravely infected. It pulsed and boiled against him.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, the doctor,\u201d one of the footmen said from the door.</p><p>Behind him the quack swayed, his greasy gray bob wig sliding off the back of his shaved head. \u201cMy lord, I came as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Lazarus murmured.</p><p>The physician approached the bed with the overly careful gait of a man drunk. \u201cWhat have we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wound\u2014can you help him?\u201d Mrs. Dews began, but the doctor brushed past her to peer closely at the wound.</p><p>The stink of cheap wine washed over Lazarus\u2019s face.</p><p>The doctor straightened abruptly. \u201cWhat have you done, woman?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI... I...\u201d</p><p>The doctor snatched the bit of rag she\u2019d been using from her fingers. \u201cInterfering with the natural healing process!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the pus\u2014\u201d Mrs. Dews began.</p><p>\u201cBonum et laudabile. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood and laudable,\u201d Lazarus muttered.</p><p>\u201cQuite right, my lord. Good and laudable!\u201d the doctor cried, nearly tipping himself over with his vigor. \u201c\u2019Tis well known that the pus is what heals the wound. It must not be interfered with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is feverish,\u201d Mrs. Dews protested.</p><p>Lazarus closed his eyes. What mattered the method of physicking as long as it ended soon. He\u2019d let his martyr and the quack argue it out.</p><p>\u201cI shall let some blood and thus draw away the heat in his body,\u201d the doctor pronounced.</p><p>Lazarus opened his eyes to watch as the doctor fished in his bag. He produced a lancet and turned toward Lazarus, holding the sharp instrument in a palsied hand. Lazarus swore, struggling weakly to stand. Bloodletting was one thing, but to allow a drunk to wield a knife against his person was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>Damn it, the room was spinning about him. \u201cSend him away.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews bit her lip. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well throw me to the lions yourself as put me in his tender mercies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, my lord...\u201d The doctor had turned conciliatory.</p><p>Mrs. Dews met Lazarus\u2019s eyes, her own worried and unsure.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He was too weak, too feverish to enforce his will. She had to do it for him. \u201cI\u2019d rather die by your hand than a drunken quack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly she nodded and Lazarus sagged against the bed in relief. Mrs. Dews took the doctor\u2019s arm and with a mixture of firmness and bewitching sweetness got the quack out of the room. She handed him over to the butler and then returned to Lazarus\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ve made the right decision,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI have no training, only the practical skills of a woman who has taken care of many children.\u201d</p><p>As he looked into her extraordinary gold-flecked eyes, it occurred to Lazarus that he might very well be entrusting his life to this woman.</p><p>He lay back on his bed, his mouth twisted in amused irony. \u201cI have complete faith in you, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>And though his words were said in his usual sarcastic tone, he was surprised to discover that they were true.</p><p>TEMPERANCE STARED DOWN at Lord Caire\u2019s infected shoulder, aware that his avowal of trust had caused sweat to break out along her spine. The last man who\u2019d trusted her had had his faith horribly betrayed.</p><p>Now was not the time to think of the past, though. Temperance mentally shook herself. The wound was red and puffy, the edges swollen and inflamed with streaks of red radiating from it.</p><p>\u201cHave the footmen bring fresh hot water,\u201d she muttered to the valet as she wrung out the cloth again. This time she placed it directly on the wound. Sometimes the infection could be drawn out by heat.</p><p>Lord Caire stiffened at her touch, but otherwise he made no sign that he felt what must be awful pain.</p><p>\u201cWhy does the touch of others cause you pain?\u201d she asked him softly.</p><p>\u201cMight as well ask why a bird is attracted to the sky, madam,\u201d he slurred. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when you touch someone else?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThere is no pain as long as I am the initiator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were always thus?\u201d She frowned at the cloth, pressing it into the wound. Despite the doctor\u2019s philosophy, she\u2019d always followed her mother\u2019s teachings on wound healing, and Mama had not liked pus, \u201cbonum\u201d or not.</p><p>Caire gasped and closed his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She glanced quickly at his face before taking up the cloth and wiping away the liquid that had oozed from the wound. \u201cYou said before that there has never been anyone who didn\u2019t cause you pain.\u201d</p><p>The words were a statement, but she meant them as a question, for she remembered his slight hesitation before.</p><p>He was silent as she rinsed the cloth in the lukewarm water and reapplied it. For a moment, she thought he wouldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Then he whispered, \u201cI lied. There was Annelise.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up and she stared at him, feeling an odd spike of something that might\u2019ve been jealousy. \u201cWho is Annelise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAnnelise was my younger sister. Five years younger. She took after our father in looks\u2014a plain little thing with mousy brown hair and gray-brown eyes. She used to follow me about even though I told her... I told her...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed away as Small silently replaced the basin of water with a fresh one. Temperance rinsed the cloth in it, the water so hot it reddened her hands. She laid the hot cloth against his wound and pressed, but he seemed not to even notice now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Lord Caire murmured without opening his eyes.</p><p>She leaned closer to him, staring at his long nose, his firm, almost cruel mouth. Surely such a sarcastic, nasty man could not be defeated by something as mundane as a putrid wound?</p><p>Fear made her belly clench. \u201cCaire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he muttered irritably, half opening his eyes.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhat did you tell Annelise?\u201d</p><p>His shook his head against the pillows. \u201cShe\u2019d follow me, spy upon me when she thought I wasn\u2019t watching, but she was so much younger than me. I always knew. And she would take my hand, even when I told her not to. Told her not to touch me. Yet her touch never hurt... never hurt...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Temperance reached out and did something she never would have done had he been in his right senses: She gently stroked back his beautiful silver-white hair from his forehead. It was soft, almost silken, beneath her fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>His sapphire eyes suddenly opened wide, looking as lucid, as calm, as they had the day before he was hurt. \u201cI told her to go away, and she did. She caught a fever not soon afterward and died. She was five and I was ten. Do not endow me with romantic virtue, Mrs. Dews. I have none.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze for a moment, wanting to argue the point, wanting to comfort a little boy who\u2019d lost his younger sister so long ago. But she straightened instead, withdrawing her hand from his hair. \u201cI\u2019m going to bathe your wound with strong spirits. It will hurt a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled almost sweetly. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>And somehow, with the help of Small, she accomplished the horrible job. She bathed his wound in brandy, dried it, and dressed it once again, all the while conscious that she was causing him excruciating pain. By the time she\u2019d finished, Lord Caire was breathing heavily under his covers, unconscious. Small looked disheveled, and Temperance was fighting sleep.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s done at least,\u201d she whispered wearily as she helped the manservant gather the soiled cloths.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d the little valet said. He darted a worried glance at the bed and its inhabitant. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done without you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is something of a handful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, ma\u2019am.\u201d The manservant\u2019s words were fervent. \u201cWould you like me to have the maids make up a room for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go home.\u201d Temperance stared at Lord Caire. His face was still red, and though she\u2019d washed his brow, it was beaded with sweat again.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll pardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d Small said. \u201cHe might need you in the night, and in any case it\u2019s very late for a lady to be traveling out alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she murmured, grateful for the excuse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Cook make a tray for you,\u201d Small said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Temperance replied as the manservant slipped from the room. She sank into a tall chair pulled close to the bed and propped her head against her fist, meaning to merely rest her eyes while the little valet fetched her supper.</p> <p>When Temperance next woke, the fire had died low on the grate. Only a single guttering candle on the bedside table gave light to the room. She stretched a little, wincing at the ache in her neck and shoulders from having slept in such an awkward position, and glanced at the bed. Somehow she wasn\u2019t surprised to find glittering blue eyes watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like,\u201d Lord Caire asked softly, \u201cyour paragon of a husband?\u201d</p><p>She knew she should refuse to answer him, that the question was far too personal, but somehow, here in the depths of night, it seemed reasonable and right.</p><p>\u201cHe was tall, with dark hair,\u201d she whispered, remembering that long-ago face. It had been so familiar once and was so faded now. She closed her eyes, concentrating. It seemed so wrong to forget Benjamin and all he was. \u201cHis eyes were a lovely dark brown. He had a scar on his chin from a fall as a boy, and he had a way of stretching his fingers and gesturing with his hands when he talked that seemed elegant to me. He was very intelligent, very proper, and very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow ghastly,\u201d he said. \u201cHe sounds a prig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he make you laugh?\u201d he asked quietly, his voice roughened from sleep or pain. \u201cDid he whisper things in your ear that made you blush? Did his touch send shivers down your back?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply at his rude, too-personal questions.</p> <p>But he continued, his voice impossibly deep now. \u201cDid you grow wet when he looked at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she cried, her voice loud in the room. \u201cPlease, stop it.\u201d</p><p>Caire merely watched her, his eyes much too knowing, as if he knew she\u2019d grown wet\u2014but at his look, not at the old memories of her husband.</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cHe was a good man\u2014a wonderful man\u2014and I didn\u2019t deserve him.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire closed his eyes and for a moment seemed to have fallen asleep. Then he murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve never been married, but I think it would be quite awful to have to deserve one\u2019s spouse.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from him. This subject made her chest ache, brought a depressing melancholy to her brain.</p><p>\u201cWere you in love with him,\u201d Lord Caire asked, \u201cthis husband you didn\u2019t deserve?\u201d</p><p>And whether it was because she still half drifted in dreams or because they were curiously intimate in the near dark, she answered truthfully. \u201cNo. I loved him, but I was never in love with him.\u201d</p><p>The room suddenly brightened, all at once it seemed, and she realized that the dawn had arrived unnoticed while they talked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new day,\u201d Temperance said stupidly.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Lord Caire replied, and the satisfaction in his voice made her shiver.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Well! This was a very unfortunate turn of events for poor Meg, for the dungeons of King Lockedheart were not very pleasant. The walls dripped with fetid water, and rats and other vermin skittered across the corridors. There was no light and no heat, and in the distance could be heard the cries of the other sad inhabitants of that place. Things looked very desperate, but as Meg had never had it very easy in her life, she resolved to face this crisis with as much bravery as she could summon.</p><p>And she vowed as well that whatever happened, she would tell nothing but the truth....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance rode home in Lord Caire\u2019s carriage as the new day dawned on London. She fell asleep during the journey, waking only when the carriage halted at the end of Maiden Lane. In fact, she was so exhausted from tending Caire that the consequences of a night spent away from home never even occurred to her until they descended like a great heavy boulder on her head when she entered the home.</p><p>\u201cWhere,\u201d Concord, her eldest brother, inquired in a deeply disapproving voice, \u201chave you been?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was unfair to compare Concord to a great boulder, but finding him just inside the foundling home\u2019s doorway was something of a shock. He nearly filled the hallway, his displeasure palpable.</p><p>\u201cI... uh,\u201d Temperance stuttered, not very eloquently.</p><p>Concord frowned heavily, his bushy gray and brown eyebrows meeting over his stern nose. \u201cIf you were held against your will by this aristocrat Winter has told us about, we will seek reparations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll beat his bloody face in is what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Asa, her next eldest brother, growled from behind Concord.</p><p>Temperance blinked at the sight of Asa. She hadn\u2019t seen him in months. Oh, dear, this was not good. Asa and Concord rarely agreed on anything and, in fact, had made pains to speak to each other as little as possible for years. This morning, however, they stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the narrow foundling home hallway, united in their anger toward Caire\u2014and their unhappiness with her. Concord was the taller of the two, his graying brown hair clubbed back and, like all her brothers, unpowdered.</p><p>Asa\u2019s hair, in contrast, was a deep golden-brown, the color of a lion, and though he was several inches shorter than Concord, his broad shoulders nearly took up the width of the hall. His shirt and coat strained over his chest as if he did some physical labor every day of his life. Yet no one in the family knew exactly how Asa earned his living, and he was quite vague when asked. Temperance had long suspected that her other brothers feared to press him too closely in case his work was not entirely respectable.</p><p>\u201cLord Caire did not hold me against my will,\u201d she said now.</p><p>Concord scowled. \u201cThen what were you doing at his house all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Caire was ill. I merely stayed to help nurse him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIll in what way?\u201d Asa asked.</p><p>Temperance glanced down the hallway, toward the kitchen behind her brothers. Where was Winter?</p><p>\u201cHe had an infection,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>Asa\u2019s green eyes sharpened. \u201cAn infection of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shoulder wound.\u201d</p><p>Her brothers exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u201cAnd how was he wounded?\u201d Concord rumbled.</p><p>Temperance winced. \u201cHe was attacked the other night by footpads. One stabbed him in the shoulder.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, both of her brothers merely stared at her, and then Concord\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou spent the night with an aristocrat who gets himself attacked by footpads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hardly his fault,\u201d Temperance protested.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Concord began pedantically.</p><p>Fortunately, Asa interrupted him. \u201cShe looks half dead, Con. Let\u2019s continue this discussion in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Concord glared at his younger brother, and Temperance thought he might refuse out of sheer contrariness. Then he pursed his lips. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stomped off down the hall. Asa gestured for Temperance to precede him. His eyes were unreadable. Temperance inhaled, wishing she could have this confrontation when she\u2019d had more sleep.</p><p>The foundling home kitchen was usually bustling in the morning\u2014it was only a little after eight of the clock\u2014but today only a single figure sat at the long table.</p><p>Temperance stopped short in the doorway, staring at Winter. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at the school?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his dark brown eyes shadowed. \u201cI closed the school today after searching all night for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Winter, I am so sorry.\u201d Guilt swept away what little vigor she still had. Temperance sank into one of the kitchen chairs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave him last night, truly. He had no one to help him.\u201d</p><p>Concord snorted not very nicely. \u201cAn aristocrat? His home wasn\u2019t crawling with servants to tend him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were servants, yes, but no one to ca\u2014\u201d She almost said care for him, but at the last second Temperance bit back the words. \u201cNo one to take charge.\u201d</p><p>Asa looked thoughtfully at her, as if he knew the word she\u2019d cut off.</p><p>But Concord merely pulled at his chin, a habit he had when distressed. \u201cWhy have you sought the company of this man in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Her head felt achy and dull. She stared at Winter, trying to think of some probable excuse for her friendship with Lord Caire. But in the end she was simply too tired to prevaricate.</p><p>\u201cHe took me to a musicale last night,\u201d Temperance said. \u201cI wanted to meet someone we could persuade to become a patron for the home. We are in need of funds to continue to keep the home open.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Winter as she ended her explanation and saw him close his eyes. Asa\u2019s mouth had compressed while Concord was frowning thunderously. There was a heavy silence.</p><p>Then Concord spoke. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you informed us of your distress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we knew you would want to help, brother, even if you could ill afford to do so,\u201d Winter said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd me?\u201d Asa said softly.</p><p>Winter looked at him mutely. Though they had debated asking Concord for help, they had never once discussed going to Asa.</p><p>\u201cYou never seemed interested in the home,\u201d Temperance said softly. \u201cWhen Father would talk of it, you almost scoffed. How were Winter and I to know that you might help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would help you, despite what you think of me, but at the moment I\u2019m somewhat short of funds. In another three months perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have three months,\u201d Winter stated.</p><p>Asa shook his head, a lock of tawny brown hair falling from his queue, and went to stand by the fire, separating himself from their family as he always seemed to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Concord turned back to Winter. \u201cAnd you allowed this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not like it,\u201d Winter replied shortly.</p><p>\u201cYet you let our sister whore herself for this home.\u201d</p><p>Temperance gasped, feeling as if her brother had slapped her across the face. Winter was on his feet, speaking in a grim voice to Concord and Asa was shouting, but all she heard was a muffled roar in her ears. Did Concord truly think her a whore? Was her greatest shame written on her face for all to see? Perhaps that was why Caire had made his suggestive comments. Perhaps he\u2019d seen with one glance that she could be so easily corrupted.</p> <p>She covered her mouth with a shaking hand.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Asa had raised his voice to flatten his brothers\u2019 argument. \u201cWhether Winter is at fault or not, Temperance is near fainting with fatigue. Let us send her to bed while we discuss this further. Whatever happens, it\u2019s obvious that she can no longer see this Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Winter said, though he would not look at Concord.</p><p>\u201cNaturally not,\u201d her elder brother said ponderously.</p><p>Well, this was wonderful\u2014all her brothers were in agreement for once. Temperance almost felt a pang of guilt. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Asa stared at her.</p><p>She rose from the table, placing her palms flat against the surface to steady herself. Any sign of weakness on this point would be fatal. \u201cNo, I will not stop seeing Lord Caire. No, I will not give up my search for a patron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d Winter murmured in warning.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIf my reputation has already been compromised as Concord says, then what is the point in giving any of it up? The home needs a patron to survive. You all may protest Lord Caire and my virtue, but you cannot argue that fact. Furthermore, none of you have a solution for the problem, do you?\u201d</p><p>She looked from Winter\u2019s weary, lined face to Asa\u2019s watchful eyes, and finally to Concord\u2019s disapproving countenance.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she demanded again softly.</p> <p>Concord abruptly stamped from the room.</p><p>She let out her breath, feeling almost giddy. \u201cThat\u2019s answer enough, I think. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m to bed.\u201d</p><p>She turned to make a grand exit but was stopped by a figure in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cBeggin\u2019 your pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d Polly muttered.</p><p>The wet nurse held a bundle in her arms, and Temperance caught her breath at the sight. No. No, she couldn\u2019t take another heartache. Not now.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Temperance breathed. \u201cIs she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d the wet nurse said hurriedly. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t that at all.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back a corner of the blanket, and Temperance saw dark blue eyes staring back at her curiously. The relief hit her so hard she hardly heard the wet nurse\u2019s words.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to tell you that Mary Hope is feeding at last,\u201d Polly said.</p><p>SHE\u2019D BURNED THE joint of beef.</p><p>Silence waved a cloth over the smoking meat that night, trying to dispel the acrid odor. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. She should have been more alert to the dinner, instead of staring off into space worrying about their future, hers and William\u2019s. Silence bit her lip. The problem was that it was so very hard not to think about their troubles.</p><p>The door to their rooms swung open and William came in. She looked up eagerly but could see at once that he\u2019d not recovered the shipment. William\u2019s face was lined with worry, his complexion gray even with his tan from the sea. His shirt was rumpled, and his neckcloth was askew as if he\u2019d been pulling at it in his agitation. Her husband seemed to have aged years in the last few days.</p><p>Silence hastily went to him, taking his cloak and hat and hanging them on a peg by the door. \u201cWill you sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d William replied absently. He ran his hand over his head, forgetting he wore his wig. He swore an oath he\u2019d normally never utter in her presence, and took the thing off, throwing it to the table.</p><p>Silence picked up the wig and carefully draped it over a wooden form on the dresser. \u201cIs there any news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of use,\u201d William muttered. \u201cThe two sailors left to guard the ship are missing\u2014either dead or run away with their bribe money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Silence stood uselessly by her husband\u2019s side until the stench of burned meat reminded her of the dinner.</p><p>Hurriedly she set the table with their pewter plates. At least the bread was fresh from the baker this morning, and the boiled carrots looked appealing. She set out William\u2019s favorite pickles and poured his ale before bringing the beef to the table. She carved the small joint and placed some on his plate with nervous trepidation, but he didn\u2019t even seem to notice that the meat was charred on the outside while still red inside. Silence sighed. She was such a pitiful cook.</p><p>\u201cIt was Mickey O\u2019Connor,\u201d William muttered suddenly.</p><p>Silence looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMickey O\u2019Connor was behind the theft of the cargo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s wonderful! If you know the thief, surely you can inform a magistrate?\u201d</p><p>William laughed, a harsh sound. \u201cNone of the London magistrates would dare touch Charming Mickey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Silence asked, perplexed. \u201cIf he\u2019s a known thief, surely it is their job to bring him before a court of law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost magistrates are in the pay of the thieves and other lawbreakers themselves.\u201d William stared down at his dinner. \u201cThey only bring in the ones too poor to pay their bribes. And the remaining magistrates are so fearful of O\u2019Connor that they\u2019ll not risk their lives to bring him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who is he? Why are the magistrates afraid of him?\u201d</p><p>Her husband pushed his plate away untouched. \u201cCharming Mickey O\u2019Connor is the most powerful dock thief in London. He controls the night horsemen\u2014the thieves who steal at night. Every ship that docks in London pays a bribe to Mickey; he calls it a tithe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blasphemy,\u201d Silence whispered, shocked.</p><p>William nodded, closing his eyes. \u201cIndeed it is. \u2019Tis said he lives in a falling-down house in St. Giles, the rooms furnished for a king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey call this monster charming?\u201d Silence shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very handsome and the ladies like him, so \u2019tis said,\u201d William said quietly. \u201cMen who cross Charming Mickey disappear or are found floating in the Thames, a noose about their necks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one will touch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>Silence stared at her own plate, no longer hungry. \u201cWhat shall we do, William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her husband replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The owners are saying now that I must have had a hand in the theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d William was one of the most honest men Silence had ever known. \u201cWhy are they accusing you?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes wearily. \u201cI left the ship early the night we docked. Left it with only two guards. They say I must\u2019ve been bribed to help.\u201d</p><p>Silence clenched her fists under the table. William had left the ship early to return to her. Guilt made her chest ache.</p><p>\u201cThey need a scapegoat, I fear,\u201d William said heavily. \u201cThe owners are talking about prosecuting me for theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear.\u201d William had finally opened his sad green eyes. \u201cI brought this catastrophe upon us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, William. Never.\u201d Silence laid her palm on her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cThis is not your fault.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, that horrible croaking sound she was beginning to hate. \u201cI should\u2019ve put more men on to guard the cargo, should\u2019ve stayed to make sure the cargo was safe. If not my fault, then whose is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Charming Mickey\u2019s, that\u2019s who,\u201d Silence said in sudden anger. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who makes his living off the backs of honest men. He\u2019s the one who stole this cargo out of greed.\u201d</p><p>William shook his head, withdrawing his hand from hers as he rose from the table. \u201cThat may be, but we have no way of seeking redress from the man. He has no care for us or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He stood a moment looking at her, and for the first time, Silence saw hopeless despair in his face. \u201cWe are doomed, I fear.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room, closing the bedroom door behind him.</p><p>Silence stared at the pitiful meal she\u2019d prepared. She wanted to sweep the old dishes, the burnt meat, and mushy carrots to the floor. She wanted to scream and cry, to pull at her hair and let the world know her despair. But she didn\u2019t do any of that. None of those actions would help the man she loved. If William was correct, no one she knew could help them. She and William were on their own. And if she couldn\u2019t find a way to get the cargo back from Charming Mickey, then William would either die in prison or be hanged as a thief.</p><p>Silence squared her shoulders. She would never let that happen.</p><p>IT TOOK A week for Lazarus to recover from his wound. At least it was a week until he felt well enough to seek out Mrs. Dews. He\u2019d been out of bed for days before that, but he was damned if he\u2019d let the little martyr see him so weak again. So he\u2019d bided his time, patiently eating the pap Small insisted was fit for the sickroom. Another doctor was called for, but Lazarus shouted at him when the quack started mumbling about bloodletting. The man beat a hasty retreat, but not before leaving a bottle of noxious liquid \u201cmedicine.\u201d Lazarus threw the bottle out, uncaring that he\u2019d no doubt be billed for the elixir later.</p><p>He spent the rest of his confinement chafing at the delay in seeing Mrs. Dews again. Somehow the woman had crept into his blood as surely as the poison from his wound. During the day, he reviewed conversations they\u2019d had, remembering the look of hurt in her gilded eyes when he\u2019d said something particularly crass. The pain he\u2019d caused her provoked a strange tenderness. He wanted to heal the hurt and then hurt her again just to make it better. It was impossible to keep thoughts of her gentleness, her wit, and her acerbity from his mind. His dreams at night were far more basic. Even with his illness, he woke each morning with the flesh between his legs straining for her.</p><p>Perhaps he should\u2019ve let the quack bleed him. Perhaps then his body would rid itself of not only the poison, but also of Mrs. Dews.</p><p>He considered abandoning her help and not seeing her again, but the thought was fleeting. On the night Small deemed him recovered, Lazarus prowled the alley behind the foundling home.</p><p>He\u2019d not sent word ahead for her to expect him, and he felt an uncharacteristic uncertainty of his reception. The night was dark and cold, the wind blowing his cloak about his legs. Lazarus hesitated in the fetid alley. He laid a hand against the wood of the kitchen door as if in this way he could feel the woman within.</p><p>Nonsense.</p><p>He contemplated stealing in as he had before, but in the end, prudence made him rap sharply on the door. It was thrown almost immediately open. Lazarus stared down into light brown eyes gilded with golden stars. Mrs. Dews looked startled, as if she\u2019d not expected him at the door, and indeed her hair was down about her shoulders, curling damply in the heat of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou were washing your hair,\u201d he said stupidly. The thought of such a mundane intimacy stirred a longing not only at his groin but in his chest as well.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pink was suffusing her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said, because her hair was beautiful, thick and nearly to her waist. It waved and curled with reckless abandon. How she must hate that.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glanced down and then over her shoulder. \u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched in amusement at her unease, but he said as gently as was possible for him, \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The foundling home kitchen was humid and hot tonight. The fire was banked below a blackened kettle. Mrs. Dews\u2019s regular acolyte, Mary Whitsun, frowned at him over a basin of water at the table, while beside her stood a small boy. A plump young woman with a cheery red face and white-blond hair sat in the corner nursing a tiny infant. She looked up at his entrance and casually pulled a scarf over her exposed breast.</p><p>\u201cThis is Polly, our wet nurse,\u201d Temperance said distractedly. \u201cShe brought Mary Hope and her children to spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it best since they\u2019re holding a wake in the rooms next to mine,\u201d Polly said. \u201cIt can get a bit loud and wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Lazarus inclined his head. He eyed the kicking infant. \u201cThe babe is better, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s doing lovely, sir, that she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus propped himself against a wall, watching as Mrs. Dews and the girl cleared the table. While their backs were turned, the boy inched closer. His face was freckled, and to Lazarus\u2019s unskilled eye, he looked a bit of a rapscallion.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big stick,\u201d the boy observed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sword stick,\u201d Lazarus said cordially. He twisted the head and withdrew the sharp sword.</p> <p>\u201cCoo!\u201d the boy exclaimed. \u201cHave yer killed anyone with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozens,\u201d Lazarus said loftily. He pushed the image of the noseless attacker\u2019s staring, dead eyes out of his mind. \u201cI prefer to first disembowel them and then chop off their heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArr!\u201d the boy said.</p><p>Lazarus chose to take the odd syllable as a mark of high esteem.</p><p>\u201cLord Caire!\u201d Mrs. Dews had evidently overheard the last of their exchange.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lazarus widened his eyes in innocence.</p> <p>The boy saw fit to giggle.</p><p>Mrs. Dews sighed.</p><p>Polly pulled the baby from under her scarf. \u201cCan you hold her a moment, ma\u2019am, while I set myself to rights?\u201d</p><p>The wet nurse held out the sleeping babe, but Mrs. Dews quickly backed away. \u201cMary Whitsun can take her.\u201d</p><p>The girl accepted the baby without hesitation. Neither she nor Polly seemed to think Mrs. Dews\u2019s actions were unusual, but Lazarus watched her speculatively.</p><p>Polly straightened her clothing and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll take Mary Hope now. She\u2019s due for a nap, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>So saying, she carried the babe from the kitchen.</p><p>Mrs. Dews nodded at Mary Whitsun. \u201cPlease tell Mr. Makepeace that I intend to go out tonight\u2014and take Joseph Tinbox with you.\u201d</p> <p>Both children obediently left the room.</p><p>\u201cYou never informed your brother of your intentions before.\u201d Lazarus prowled to the fireplace and glanced inside the kettle there. A puddle of some type of soup sputtered at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked from behind him.</p><p>He turned in time to watch her stroke a comb through that wonderful hair. \u201cYou never invited me in before.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, but at that moment, Winter Makepeace strode into the room. He didn\u2019t seem surprised to see Lazarus, but the sight didn\u2019t bring him any joy either.</p><p>\u201cMind you take your pistol,\u201d he told his sister.</p><p>Mrs. Dews nodded, not looking at Makepeace. \u201cI\u2019ll just put up my hair.\u201d</p><p>She slipped from the room.</p><p>The brother was suddenly beside Lazarus. \u201cI would have you make sure that nothing happens to her.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus arched his brows at the order from the younger man. \u201cYour sister has never been hurt in my company.\u201d</p><p>Makepeace grunted, looking sour. \u201cWell, see to it that your luck continues. Temperance needs to be home before first light of day.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus inclined his head. He had no intention of keeping Mrs. Dews out in St. Giles any longer than necessary.</p><p>She reappeared at that moment, her hair safely confined and hidden under a white cap. She looked sharply between Lazarus and her brother, and he could only hope the younger man had wiped the expression of animosity from his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, and took up a cloak.</p><p>Lazarus glided to her side and plucked the ragged thing from her fingers. He held it out. She looked at him uncertainly before donning the garment. Lazarus opened the door.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Makepeace called behind them.</p><p>The night was damp, a grimy mist immediately slicking his face. Lazarus pulled his cloak about his shoulders. \u201cStay close to me. No doubt your brother would have me drawn and quartered should I bring you back with even a hair on your head misplaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe worries for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lazarus glanced around and then down at her. \u201cAs do I. That attack we suffered last time was apurpose.\u201d</p><p>Her gold-flecked eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and began walking. \u201cI saw one of the assassins at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s shop. That\u2019s quite a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>She stopped suddenly, making him stop as well or risk outpacing her. \u201cBut that means someone tried to kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d He hesitated and then said slowly, \u201cTwice now, I think. The night we first met, I was attacked by what I thought was a common footpad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man we saw you kneeling over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cNow I wonder if he was after my life instead of my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d She looked down at her toes thoughtfully. \u201cIf the man without a nose was at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s, then it stands to reason that the murderer was there as well.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head, watching her.</p><p>She met his eyes, her own fearless. \u201cThen we should return to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease and see if she knows the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is my hope,\u201d he said as he set out again. \u201cBut I want to impress upon you the seriousness of this business. Before, I merely had to deal with the everyday dangers of St. Giles. Now it seems I may actually have caught the attention of a ruthless murderer.\u201d He glanced sideways at her. \u201cIf you wish to quit this hunt, Mrs. Dews, I will still honor my side of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>The hood of her cloak obscured most of her profile, but he could still see her lips purse primly. \u201cI\u2019ll not renege on our bargain.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, bending his head to hers. \u201cThen you had better stay close to my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She looked up at him, and he saw that her eyebrows were knit. \u201cWho had you spoken to the night we met\u2014the night you were first attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Marie\u2019s neighbors, a prostitute.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cOr at least I\u2019d tried to talk to her. The woman slammed her door in my face, once she found out what I sought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must be linked somehow\u2014the prostitute and Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s gin shop, but I don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s only the area\u2014the murderer found out I was questioning Marie\u2019s neighbor and also knew I\u2019d questioned Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019d have to be very quick to take fright, then, if he sent an assassin after you merely for asking questions. No, I think you must\u2019ve found something out.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in question.</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I don\u2019t know what it is myself.\u201d He laughed a little grimly.</p><p>They walked the rest of the way to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s shop in silence. Lazarus kept an alert eye out but saw no followers unless one counted a mangy cur, mostly skin and bones, that shadowed them for a minute or more.</p><p>When he ducked into the low doorway of the gin shop, the heat and smell hit Lazarus in the face. He caught Mrs. Dews\u2019s arm, scanning the crowded room. A fire roared on the hearth in the back, and a group of sailors were singing drunkenly at one long table. The one-eyed barmaid scurried between tables, avoiding all eyes, especially his own. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease was not in sight.</p><p>Mrs. Dews tugged at his arm and stood on tiptoe to shout in his ear over the noise of the room. \u201cGive me some coins.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his eyebrow arched, and then took out his purse and shook some shillings into her hand. She nodded and without a word began weaving her way through the throng, patiently stalking the barmaid. Lazarus wasn\u2019t about to leave her side in this company. He trailed behind, watching her movements, glaring when a sailor tried to catch her hand.</p><p>Mrs. Dews finally ran the one-eyed barmaid to ground near the fireplace. The girl reluctantly turned, looking a bit more interested when Mrs. Dews pressed a coin into her palm. There was a whispered conferral and the barmaid slipped away.</p><p>Mrs. Dews turned back to Lazarus. \u201cShe says that Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease is in the back room.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus glanced at the curtained doorway. \u201cThen let\u2019s seek her out.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the curtain and led the way. Behind the door was a short, dark passageway. A young man leaned against the wall, cleaning his fingernails with the wickedly pointed tip of a knife.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother glancing up at their entrance. \u201cThis \u2019ere\u2019s private like. Go on back to th\u2019 bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease,\u201d Lazarus said evenly.</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t very big, but he looked like he might be quick. Before he could reply, Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease opened a door behind him. A young girl slipped out, tottering on her heeled slippers. She glanced at the guard dismissively but slowed when she saw Lazarus. He turned sideways to let her pass, and she thanked him with a cheeky grin and a wink. He was quite sure that had he shown any sign of interest, she\u2019d be amenable to a quick t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in a corner of the gin shop. He shot a glance at Mrs. Dews and was unsurprised to see her lips pursed primly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dews,\u201d Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease called from her door. \u201c\u2019Aven\u2019t you enough to busy yourself with at that little home you run? \u2019Tis twice now in but a fortnight you\u2019ve visited my part of St. Giles. And with Lord Caire, I see. I wasn\u2019t expectin\u2019 you back, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus smiled. \u201cBecause you thought I would be killed at Martha Swan\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>The woman tilted her head and smiled coquettishly\u2014a rather repulsive sight. \u201cI\u2019d \u2019eard you met with some trouble there. Poor Martha Swan! It\u2019s dangerous, walking the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t find it suggestive that she was gutted in the same way as Marie Hume?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged bony shoulders as wide as a man\u2019s. \u201cMany a lass \u2019as come to a bad end in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Lazarus studied the old bawd. She was undoubtedly playing some kind of game, but whether it was for money, simply to protect her own mysterious interests, or because she had a more sinister intent, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cBe that as it may, the man who attacked me was sitting in your gin house the night I came to question you. He wore a patch over his nose.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAye, I\u2019ve seen \u2019im about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who might\u2019ve hired him to kill me? Who doesn\u2019t want Marie Hume\u2019s killer to be found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill you?\u201d She hawked and spat into the filthy straw on the floor. \u201cLook \u2019ere, it\u2019s not my business what folk do after they leave my place. \u2019E probably caught sight of that purse you were wavin\u2019 about that night and thought you were a soft mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if he has any friends? Men he drank with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care.\u201d She shrugged again and turned away. \u201cI \u2019ave a business to run, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus watched as she shut the door behind her. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease had seemed eager enough for his payment the first night they\u2019d come, but tonight she\u2019d not even hinted at money. Was she afraid? Had someone warned her off? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mrs. Dews sighed beside him. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll tell you more.\u201d</p><p>The young man who had been leaning against the wall all this time cleared his throat. Lazarus looked at him, but the boy\u2019s eyes were on Mrs. Dews. \u201cYou want to know about Marie Hume?\u201d</p><p>His mouth barely moved, his words all but inaudible. Still Mrs. Dews nodded silently and placed the rest of the coins Lazarus had given her into the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a house in Running Man Courtyard. D\u2019you know it?\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Dews stiffened, but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cAsk for Tommy Pett and don\u2019t tell anyone where you got \u2019is name. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Mrs. Dews turned and left the back hall.</p><p>Lazarus waited until they\u2019d climbed the stairs and walked into the cold night air. \u201cYou know the way to this Running Man Courtyard?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together as if not well pleased. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Lazarus glanced up and down the dark street. \u201cDo you know that young man? Can we trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met him before.\u201d Mrs. Dews pulled her cloak about her shoulders. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a wild-goose chase.\u201d Lazarus frowned. \u201cMother Heart\u2019s-Ease may\u2019ve ordered him to whisper that information to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, damn it.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know the players in any of this. I\u2019m too much the outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it helps, I thought his fear of her overhearing him was genuine.\u201d</p> <p>Lazarus felt a sudden smile tug at his lips. He bowed low, sweeping his hat from his head. \u201cIn that case, Mrs. Dews, lead on.\u201d</p><p>She almost smiled\u2014he would\u2019ve sworn it on his life\u2014but she schooled her expression and set off, walking briskly, her shoes echoing off the cobblestones. Lazarus trailed close behind, keeping an alert eye out. The mist furled about the corners of buildings and dimmed what lanterns had been set out. This would be a good night for an ambush, he thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I returned from your house last week, I was met by my elder brothers,\u201d she said suddenly. Her head was turned away, so he could not read her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they didn\u2019t want me to go with you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are.\u201d They rounded a corner into a wider street. \u201cShould I be flattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said shortly. \u201cI do this for the home, nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, naturally.\u201d</p> <p>A party of three men staggered out of a doorway farther down the street, obviously drunk. Lazarus reached forward and pulled her back toward him, ignoring her squeak of surprise. He halted in the shadows and wrapped her in his cloak until she was nearly hidden.</p><p>Lazarus bent his head to murmur in her ear, \u201cThe sad thing about being virtuous is that when one tries to lie, it doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and he caught the glint of anger in her eye, but the drunkards were passing by.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he breathed across her ear. This close, he could smell the sweet herbs she\u2019d used when she washed her hair. He wanted to draw her even closer, to press her hips to his, to lick that delicate ear.</p><p>But the toughs had passed them by and he let her go instead.</p><p>She immediately leapt back and glared up at him. \u201cI have no desire to be with you. I only do this for the home and the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very noble, Mrs. Dews. You sound quite the saint.\u201d He felt himself smile, not very pleasantly. \u201cWill you tell me now what this house is in Running Man Courtyard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s house,\u201d she muttered before turning quickly and marching off.</p><p>Lazarus felt his eyebrows wing up in honest surprise as he hurried to catch up to his guide. This should be very interesting, indeed.</p><p>For Mrs. Whiteside ran the most notorious brothel in St. Giles.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Very early the next morning, Meg was roused from her sleep by four burly guards. They hustled her up a winding staircase until she was once again in the king\u2019s room. He sat sprawled on a golden throne, his black beard and hair shining in the morning sunlight. Before him were several dozen guards standing at attention in strict rows.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d the king snapped. \u201cNow, then, I shall prove to you my people\u2019s love.\u201d He turned to the assembled guards. \u201cMy guards, do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sire!\u201d cried the guards with one strong voice.</p><p>King Lockedheart smirked at Meg. \u201cYou see? Admit now your folly and I might grant you your life.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance felt her cheeks heat as she continued walking. She knew about most of the houses of ill repute in St. Giles\u2014they were where many of her charges came from, after all\u2014but she\u2019d never set foot in one after dark. And Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s house was rather notorious for the types of amusements one could find there.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lord Caire murmured from behind her. \u201cI believe I have knowledge of this place.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cThen perhaps you have no further need of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>He caught hold of her suddenly, making her gasp. \u201cYou swore you would not renege on our compact, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, truly puzzled. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lead on.\u201d</p><p>Temperance gathered the edges of her cloak together and did just that. The wind was bitter tonight, numbing her cheeks. She didn\u2019t know what to make of this man anymore. He\u2019d teased and kissed her, probed for her most shameful secret, and then held her against his warm body to shield and protect her. She still trembled from the scent of his throat, the steel of his arms.</p><p>They crossed into another alley, this one smaller. Signs swung overhead, creaking in the wind. She heard laughter, sudden and close, and then it moved away. They passed a thin woman in a worn cloak carrying something in a bucket. The woman avoided their eyes as she hurried past. The alley widened abruptly into a courtyard with overhanging upper floors, making the square space seem close and cramped. Light flickered behind the shutters on each floor, and odd, muffled sounds leaked through\u2014a cutoff laugh, a muttered word, rhythmic banging, and what sounded like moans.</p><p>Temperance shuddered. \u201cThis is Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d Lord Caire murmured before raising his stick to knock upon the only door in the courtyard.</p><p>It swung open to reveal a hulking guard, his broad, plain face marked with pox scars. His narrow little eyes showed no expression. \u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Lord Caire said smoothly. \u201cI wish to speak to Tommy Pett.\u201d</p><p>The man began to close the door.</p><p>Lord Caire stuck his stick in the doorway with one hand and pressed his palm flat against the door with the other. The door halted, causing the guard to look faintly surprised.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Lord Caire said with a hard smile.</p><p>\u201cJacky,\u201d a deep voice rasped from behind the guard. \u201cLet me see our visitor.\u201d</p><p>The guard stepped aside. Lord Caire entered immediately, pulling Temperance behind him. She peered around his shoulder.</p><p>The hall inside was a small, square space, hardly big enough for the stairs leading to the upper levels. Immediately to the right was an open door that revealed a neat sitting room beyond. In the doorway was a woman in a pink satin gown, strewn with ribbons and bows. Her head barely came past Caire\u2019s waist, and her body was thick and squat, her brow heavy and deformed.</p><p>She flicked clever eyes at Caire. \u201cLord Caire. I\u2019ve often wondered when you might visit our house.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire bowed. \u201cAm I speaking to Mrs. Whiteside?\u201d</p><p>The dwarf threw back her head and laughed in a voice as deep as a man\u2019s. \u201cDear me, no. I am merely an employee of that lady. You may call me Pansy.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire nodded. \u201cMistress Pansy. I would be very grateful for a moment\u2019s conversation with Tommy Pett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has some information I need.\u201d</p><p>Pansy pursed her lips and cocked her head. \u201cWhy not? Jacky, go and see if Tommy is free.\u201d</p><p>The guard lumbered off and Pansy gestured to the sitting room behind her. \u201cWill you sit, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They entered the little sitting room, and Lord Caire sank into a worn velvet settee, pulling Temperance down beside him. Across from them was a wide, low chair padded in sumptuous purple and pink. Pansy hitched one hip up and hopped backward into the chair. Her feet, shod in elegant heeled slippers, dangled inches from the floor.</p><p>She laid her pudgy hands on the chair\u2019s arms and looked at Caire with a smile playing about her mouth. \u201cYou really ought to stop awhile with us, my lord, after you finish your business with my boy Tommy. I can offer you a special price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, no,\u201d Caire said with no inflection in his voice.</p><p>Pansy cocked her head. \u201cWe make a specialty of providing for the, ah, unusual requirements of gentlemen such as yourself. And, of course, your friend may participate as well.\u201d</p><p>Temperance\u2019s eyes widened as Pansy tilted her chin at her. She had no idea what Caire\u2019s unusual requirements were, but she knew she should be disgusted at the mere suggestion that she would indulge in them with him. Except she was still trying to figure out her feelings when a pretty young man entered the room. He was slim with golden hair that fell in silken waves to his shoulders. He hesitated inside the doorway, eyeing Lord Caire uneasily.</p><p>Pansy smiled at him. \u201cTommy, this is Lord Caire. I believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever Mistress Pansy had been about to say was cut short by Tommy darting from the room. Lord Caire surged off the settee, flying after the boy silently. There was a scuffling sound in the hall, a thump and a curse, and then Lord Caire reentered the room, holding Tommy firmly by the collar of his coat.</p><p>\u201cAll right! All right!\u201d the boy panted. \u201cYou got me fair and square. Let me go an\u2019 I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d Lord Caire drawled. \u201cI\u2019d rather keep a firm grip on you while you talk.\u201d</p><p>Pansy had watched this byplay with narrowed but unsurprised eyes. She stirred now. \u201cTommy\u2019s night isn\u2019t over yet, my lord. I do hope you\u2019ll bear that in mind when you handle him? His price goes down if he\u2019s bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of hurting your employee as long as he tells me what I want to know,\u201d Lord Caire said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d the dwarf asked softly.</p><p>\u201cMarie Hume,\u201d Lord Caire said. \u201cWhat do you know about her death?\u201d</p><p>For a boy who made his living in a St. Giles brothel, Tommy was a terrible liar. He looked away, licked his lips, and said, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Temperance sighed. Even she could see that Tommy had some knowledge of Lord Caire\u2019s mistress\u2019s death.</p><p>Lord Caire merely shook the boy. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Pansy raised her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your use of Tommy\u2019s time is costing me revenue, Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Lord Caire reached into his coat pocket and withdrew a small purse. He tossed it at Pansy and she caught it deftly. After peering inside, she closed the purse again and hid it on her person.</p><p>She nodded at Tommy. \u201cThat\u2019ll do nicely. Now talk to the gentleman, my lamb.\u201d</p><p>Tommy sagged in Lord Caire\u2019s grip. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything. She was dead when I found her.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked quickly at Lord Caire at this news, but if he was surprised to hear that Tommy, not Martha Swan, had found Marie, he gave nothing away.</p><p>\u201cWere you the first to find her dead?\u201d Lord Caire asked.</p><p>Tommy shot him a confused look. \u201cWeren\u2019t no one else there, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did you find her?\u201d</p><p>Tommy screwed up his face. \u201cIt was a while back\u2014two months or more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d Tommy darted a look at Pansy. \u201cSaturday morn is my day off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what time did you arrive at Marie\u2019s rooms?\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugged. \u201cMaybe nine of the clock? Or ten? Before noon anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire shook him again. \u201cDescribe it.\u201d</p><p>Tommy licked his lips, glancing at Pansy as if for permission. The little woman nodded her head.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHer rooms were on the second floor at the back of the house. \u2019Twern\u2019t no one about when I went to climb the stairs, save a charwoman scrubbing the front step. I was going to knock at her door\u2014Marie\u2019s\u2014but it gave under my hand. It wasn\u2019t latched, so I went in. The front room was neat as a pin; Marie liked to keep her things orderly, but the bedroom...\u201d</p> <p>Tommy halted his narrative, staring at the floor. He gulped visibly. \u201cThere was blood all about. On the walls and floor and even the ceiling. Lord, I\u2019ve never seen such blood in my life. Her mattress was black with it and Marie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marie?\u201d Lord Caire\u2019s voice was soft, but Temperance didn\u2019t mistake it for gentleness or pity.</p><p>\u201cShe were slit open,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cFrom throat to her privates. I could see her insides peeking out like gray snakes.\u201d</p><p>He gulped once more, his face having turned ashen. \u201cI cast up what I had inside me then, all over the floor. Couldn\u2019t help it. The smell was that terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d Lord Caire asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I ran from the room,\u201d Tommy said, but his eyes slid away again.</p> <p>Lord Caire shook him. \u201cYou never thought to search the room? She had jewels\u2014a diamond hair pin and pearl earrings\u2014as well as diamond chip buckles for her shoes and a garnet ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014\u201d Tommy began, but Lord Caire shook him so hard he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cTommy, my darling lamb.\u201d Pansy sighed. \u201cAnswer Lord Caire truthfully or I won\u2019t have any use for you.\u201d</p><p>Tommy hung his head sullenly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need them no more. She was dead right enough. And if I\u2019d left them there, they would\u2019ve just been stole by her landlord. I had more right to them than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Temperance asked.</p><p>Tommy lifted his head, staring at her as if seeing her for the first time. \u201cWhy? Because I was her brother.\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced at Lord Caire. He was expressionless, but he\u2019d frozen as if in surprise. She returned her attention to Tommy. \u201cYou were Marie Hume\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, haven\u2019t I just said so,\u201d the boy sputtered. \u201cHad the same mother, we did, though Marie was ten or more years older than me.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance frowned. She caught a fleeting glance between Lord Caire and Pansy. Something didn\u2019t make any sense. She felt like she was missing some information that everyone else had in the room. \u201cThen you knew her well?\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cFairly well, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have any other visitors other than Lord Caire and yourself?\u201d Temperance asked.</p><p>\u201cAs to that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Tommy said slowly. \u201cI saw her but once a week.\u201d</p><p>Temperance leaned forward. \u201cBut surely you talked about each other\u2019s lives? She must have told you about her days?\u201d</p><p>The boy looked at his toes. \u201cMostly I asked for money from her.\u201d</p><p>Temperance blinked, appalled at his lack of fraternal love. She would\u2019ve thought that the boy was prevaricating to avoid giving more information were he not such a terrible liar.</p><p>\u201cCan you guess who might\u2019ve killed her?\u201d Lord Caire asked suddenly.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShe was tied to the bed, her arms stretched above her head, her legs spread apart, and her face was covered with a hood. I knew at once who had killed her.\u201d</p><p>Lord Caire stared down at the boy. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Tommy smiled, but somehow his lips twisted in a way that took away all his beauty. \u201cWhy, you, my lord. Isn\u2019t that how you liked to enjoy my sister?\u201d</p><p>LAZARUS STARED AT the pretty boy. Truly he hadn\u2019t expected this charge\u2014although he should have. He let the boy go, careful to keep from glancing at Mrs. Dews. What would she make of the boy\u2019s revelation? What could she make of it, other than horror and disgust?</p><p>\u201cI have no further need of you,\u201d he said, dismissing the boy.</p><p>A look of disappointment crossed Tommy\u2019s face. No doubt he\u2019d expected an argument or even flustered denials.</p><p>Damned if Lazarus would give the boy that.</p><p>Tommy glanced at Mistress Pansy. She nodded at him, her odd face expressionless, and Tommy left.</p><p>When the door had closed behind the boy, she turned to Lazarus. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He crossed to the small fireplace and stared into the flames, trying to think. This was a dead end in his investigations. If the boy\u2014Marie\u2019s brother, of all people\u2014didn\u2019t know who\u2019d killed her, where could he turn now? He absently twisted his stick in his fist. And then the realization dawned. He knew he hadn\u2019t tied Marie up in such a manner; therefore, some other man had\u2014a man who in this, at least, shared his proclivities.</p><p>He turned to Mistress Pansy. \u201cYou said this establishment catered to the whims of men like me.\u201d</p><p>The little woman raised her dark eyebrows. \u201cYes, of course. Would you like to see a selection of our wares?\u201d</p><p>He was aware that Mrs. Dews had drawn in her breath sharply. Though he still hadn\u2019t looked at her, he knew she stood as if frozen in a corner of the room. Perhaps she was frozen in disgust.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. What I want is information.\u201d</p><p>Mistress Pansy cocked her overlarge head, her eyes intelligent and sparkling now with the possibility of profit. \u201cWhat kind of information, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know the names of the men who like to use the ties and hood.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her dark eyes considering. Then she abruptly shook her head. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t give out the names of our customers.\u201d</p><p>He took out a purse from his pocket\u2014larger than the one he\u2019d given her before\u2014and tossed it to the table at her elbow. \u201cThere\u2019s fifty pounds in there.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows and picked up the purse, spilling it into her lap to count the coins one by one. She paused when she was finished as if considering; then she put them back into the purse and tucked it into her bosom.</p><p>She sat back in her low, wide chair and looked at him. \u201cSome gentlemen find it enjoyable to watch the play of others.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, waiting.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to indulge?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus nodded once, his pulse speeding.</p><p>Pansy raised her voice. \u201cJacky!\u201d</p><p>The lackey appeared at the door.</p><p>She gestured with her fingers. \u201cPlease take this gentleman to the peepholes. I think you\u2019ll be most interested in room six, Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>Jacky turned without a word, and Lazarus strode over to grasp Mrs. Dews\u2019s wrist.</p><p>She pulled against him, but he held her firm as he hauled her to the door. \u201cWhat are you doing? I have no wish to see any \u2018play.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone,\u201d he growled under his breath. It was the truth, but not quite all of it. He wanted to show her what lurked deep within his soul. She\u2019d be repulsed by his truth, he knew that, but he had a morbid urge to find out for himself what her reaction would be. To lay his secrets bare before her and await her sentence.</p><p>Jacky led them up the narrow wooden stairs to a dim hallway above. Doors lined the hall, each marked with a crudely carved number. But instead of entering one, the man led them to the end of the hall to an unmarked door.</p><p>Jacky opened the lock with a key and gestured them inside. \u201cGo to th\u2019 end and turn. One hour. No more.\u201d</p><p>And he closed the door behind them.</p><p>Mrs. Dews started against Lazarus, and he could feel the tremble of her body. He bent to whisper in her ear, \u201cHush. The door is unlocked. We may leave whenever we wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go at once,\u201d she hissed back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His heart was beating fast, and he tightened his grip on her wrist.</p><p>They were in a low, narrow passage. He felt with his hand along one wall as he obeyed Jacky\u2019s instructions to go to the end. The passage made an abrupt turn here, and he squinted down it. At first it had seemed pitch-black, but as his eyes adjusted, he could make out tiny pinpricks of light at regular intervals along one wall. He neared the first and saw it was a peephole. Underneath, just visible in the light from the room beyond, was the number nine.</p><p>Mrs. Dews tugged on his wrist. \u201cPlease let us go.\u201d</p><p>He glanced through the peephole and turned to her, drawing her close. \u201cNo. Take a look.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but her resistance was weak as he guided her to the wall. He knew the moment she saw what was within, for her whole body went taut. She faced the wall, away from him, and he moved behind her.</p><p>He bent his head close to her ear. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>She trembled but was mute.</p><p>Not that he needed her words to know what was in the room beyond. He\u2019d seen it all when he\u2019d looked: a man and a woman, the man entirely naked, the woman still wearing a chemise. The woman knelt at the man\u2019s feet, his tool between her lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDoes it arouse you?\u201d</p><p>He felt her tremble against him, a hare within the hawk\u2019s grasp. She was so proper on the surface, but he knew, in a part of him beyond mind and spirit, that she had carnal depths that she struggled to hide. He wanted to explore those depths. Bring them to the light of day and revel in them. They were as much a part of her as the gold flecks in her eyes, and he longed to feast upon her cravings.</p><p>\u201cCome, let us see what else there is to see.\u201d He took her hand, less resisting now, and led her to the second peephole. A quick glance proved the room was empty.</p><p>But the next certainly was not.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he murmured, pressing her to the wall with his body. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but she whispered nonetheless, \u201cHe\u2019s... taking her from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a stallion covering a mare,\u201d he said low, his body hard against hers.</p><p>She nodded jerkily.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>But she refused to reply to that.</p><p>He drew her away, checking at the next little hole, the one Mistress Pansy had sent them to view. The sight within made him swallow convulsively. He turned and guided Mrs. Dews to the hole without a word. He knew the moment she understood. Her body stilled and the hand clutching his squeezed hard.</p><p>He moved behind her, covering and pressing her to the wall so that there was no escape possible. She was warm and soft beneath his larger body.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d he breathed against her ear.</p><p>She shook her head, but he took both her hands, spreading them wide against the wall, his own hands covering hers. He felt his cock, thick and throbbing, pressing against the fall of his breeches, pressing into her soft backside.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her swallow was audible in the quiet of the dark passage. \u201cThe woman is beautiful. She has red hair and white skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s naked and tied to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He smoothed his mouth against her neck. Her scent was strong this close, the scent of a woman. He wished he could cast off the plain white cap she wore, tear the pins from her hair, and bury his face in her tresses. \u201cTell me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hands are above her head, tied together to the top of the bed.\u201d Her voice was throaty, low and sensuous. \u201cHer legs are spread apart, her ankles tied to the posts at the end of the bed. She\u2019s quite naked and her... her...\u201d She gulped, unable to voice the word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer cunny?\u201d he drawled against her cheek. His hips surged instinctively against her at the word, as if seeking out that part of her.</p><p>\u201cYes, that. She\u2019s completely exposed.\u201d She whimpered as he licked the side of her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She took a breath as if to steady herself. \u201cShe has a scarf tied over her eyes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tall and dark, and he\u2019s completely dressed; even his wig is still in place.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her skin, grinding his hips into her bottom. He would raise her skirt right now, seek that soft, wet place at her center, if he was not sure it would draw her from her trance.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d He bit gently on her ear.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cHe\u2019s kneeling between her legs and he\u2019s\u2014Oh, God!\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cHe\u2019s worshipping her cunny, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s tonguing her, kissing her, licking right through her pink lips, tasting her essence.\u201d</p><p>She moaned and pressed back against him\u2014but not in escape. Her bottom rubbed his hard cock, and triumph leapt within him.</p><p>He tongued her ear, licking around the delicate outer edge. \u201cWould you like that? Would you like my mouth against your center, my tongue against your bud? I\u2019d lick you there, tasting you, savoring you, until you bucked beneath me, but I wouldn\u2019t let you go. I\u2019d hold you down, your thighs widespread, your cunny open to me, and I\u2019d lick you until you came over and over.\u201d</p><p>She struggled against him then, half turning in his grasp, and he bent and kissed her hard, his mouth grinding hers open, thrusting his tongue into her mouth as savagely as he wanted to thrust his cock into her body. God! He was in danger of coming in his breeches, and he didn\u2019t give a damn. She was finally breaking, his little martyr, and her surrender was sweeter than any honey.</p><p>He jammed his leg between hers, high so that she was forced to ride him. He caught at her skirts, yanking them up, his entire being on but one goal. He no longer cared where they were, who she was, and who he was and his own damnable past. All he wanted was her warm, wet flesh around him. Now.</p><p>But she dug her nails into his hair and pulled suddenly, surprising an exclamation of pain from him.</p> <p>It was all she needed. She darted, a fleeing hare before a hawk, wildly dashing down the dark corridor.</p><p>HE\u2019D BEWITCHED HER.</p><p>Temperance panted as she rounded the corner of the dark passage. Panic was a live thing in her throat, fluttering and threatening to choke off her air. To drive reason itself from her mind.</p><p>How had he known? Was her shame a blaze upon her face for all men to see? Or was he a wizard who could discern the sensual weaknesses of women? For she\u2019d been weakened. Her legs had quivered under him; her center had turned liquid with shameful want. She\u2019d gazed through that awful peephole and described the scene within, and dear God, she\u2019d liked it. The terrible words he\u2019d whispered in her ear as he thrust against her bottom had left her hot and lusting. She\u2019d wanted him to mount her like a rutting stallion in the sordid little passage of a brothel.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d already lost her mind.</p><p>The door to the outer hallway was unlocked. It sprang open at her touch, and then she was flying down the stairs, the heavy tread of Lord Caire\u2019s boots right behind her. She made the square little hall and heard him curse and stumble. Thank goodness! Whatever his delay, it gave her a few extra seconds. She flung open the door to the brothel and fled into the night.</p><p>The wind took her breath, and something small and mean and four-legged scuttled from her path. She ducked into a tiny covered alley, her footsteps echoing against the ancient stone walls. She ran without direction or thought, panic beating at her breast. If he caught her, he\u2019d kiss her again. He\u2019d press his length to her, and she\u2019d taste his mouth, feel his touch, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to break away a second time. She\u2019d succumb, wallowing in her own sinful nature.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p> <p>So when she heard him call her name behind her, she made herself slow down, made herself move more stealthily. The covered alley opened into a tiny courtyard. She glanced behind her and darted across it. Her breast was burning, and she wanted to gasp, but she made herself breathe slowly, softly, and look behind her. The courtyard was empty. His voice had been distant. Perhaps she\u2019d lost him.</p><p>Temperance crept through an alley, ducked into a side street, and then turned down another passage. The moon was out, giving her some feeble light. She\u2019d run so fast and in such a rush that she had no idea where she was now. The buildings to either side were dark. She crossed a street, running fast again, a thrill of fear bolting up her back. She paused for a moment in the shadows of a house, peering behind her. She couldn\u2019t see Lord Caire. Perhaps he\u2019d given up the chase? Except that didn\u2019t seem very like\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou fool!\u201d he hissed into her ear.</p><p>She yelped, an ignoble sound, but he\u2019d scared the wits out of her.</p><p>He took her upper arms and shook her, his voice rasping with rage. \u201cHave you no sense? I promised your brother I\u2019d take care of you, and then you go running willy-nilly into the worst part of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>She gaped up at him, stunned, her only thought that he was enraged because of fear for her. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d chased her out of sexual frenzy when all the time he\u2019d been concerned for her safety. Temperance couldn\u2019t help it. She threw back her head and laughed, the wind taking the sound from her lips and spinning it high.</p><p>Lord Caire frowned down at her. \u201cStop that. It\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>Which, of course, only made her laugh harder.</p><p>He sighed in male frustration and shook her again, but it was halfhearted. He began to pull her toward himself, and her fears of his attraction flooded back, sobering her. She placed her palms against his chest in weak protest.</p><p>And then he shoved her roughly behind him.</p><p>She stumbled at the sudden movement, then caught herself and looked up. A group of men had walked into the street, all of them armed with cudgels. Caire twisted and broke apart his walking stick. The short sword was in his right hand, the remainder of the stick in his left, and he didn\u2019t hesitate but flew at the attackers.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he bellowed to her as he charged the men.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t expected such an abrupt offensive. Two of the men fell back, one hesitated, but the remaining two closed on Caire. Temperance felt for her pistol. She\u2019d tied the sack she usually carried it in to her waist under her skirts, and she began hauling up the material.</p><p>There was a short scream, horribly cut off. She looked up in time to see one of Caire\u2019s attackers fall back, his face awash in blood. Caire was whirling gracefully, his cape flying out about him, as he thrust at another man.</p><p>\u201cTemperance! Obey me now. Run!\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, a thick arm wrapped around her neck, choking off her scream.</p><p>\u201cThrow down yer sword,\u201d a rough voice said near her ear, \u201cor I\u2019ll break \u2019er neck.\u201d</p><p>Caire turned, his eyes narrowing as he saw her plight, and then the man holding Temperance grunted and went limp. She scrambled away as he fell to the ground. She gasped and looked up and saw...</p><p>An apparition, moving silently and swiftly past her. The attackers never even knew he\u2014it?\u2014was there until one was run through. Was she dreaming? Had she been killed and not even known it? For the thing that fought silently and deadly beside Caire now was like nothing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He was tall and lean and wearing a black and red motley tunic. His breeches, jackboots, and wide-brimmed hat were all black. A black half-mask covered the upper part of his face, the nose grotesquely long, and eerie lines carved around the eyes and protruding cheeks. He held a glittering sword in one hand and a long dagger in the other, and he used both at once with deadly agility, skipping nimbly over the cobblestones as he fought.</p><p>Caire stood back-to-back with the apparition, both figures fighting with grim precision. Caire blocked a blow with the stick in his left hand and followed through with a jab from the sword in his right. The remaining attackers circled the two men like a pack of rabid dogs. But Caire and the harlequin moved together as if they\u2019d fought like this all their lives. No matter how the attackers tried to breach their defenses, they could find no hole. The apparition slashed a man across the chest even as Caire stabbed one in the thigh. One of the attackers gave a shout, and suddenly they fled, disappearing into the St. Giles night. Even the man who\u2019d caught her from behind had recovered enough to run away.</p><p>In the silence, Temperance could hear her own breath rasping in her throat. The pistol in her hands shook violently.</p><p>The apparition turned gracefully, his boots whispering against the cobblestones. He swept the hat from his head as he bowed low. A scarlet feather fluttered in his hat as he replaced it on his head.</p><p>Then he was gone as well.</p><p>Temperance stared at Caire. \u201cAre you badly hurt? Who was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d He shook his head. His silver hair had come down from its customary tie during the fight, and it fanned against his black cloak. \u201cBut it would appear that the Ghost of St. Giles is no rumor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Meg shook her head. \u201cThat, Your Majesty, is not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The king looked ominous. \u201cIf not love, then what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObedience,\u201d Meg said. \u201cYour guards tell you what you wish to hear out of obedience, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Well! You could\u2019ve heard the drop of a pin within the throne room. The little blue bird chirped, and the king let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cReturn her to the dungeons,\u201d he ordered the guards. He added to Meg, \u201cAnd when next you are in my presence, see to it you are properly washed.\u201d</p><p>Meg curtsied. \u201cTo wash, I\u2019ll need water, soap, and cloth, if it please Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>The king waved a hand. \u201cSee that it is done.\u201d</p><p>And the guards led her away....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>\u201cI knew the Ghost of St. Giles was real!\u201d Nell exclaimed later that evening.</p><p>Temperance turned to stare at the maidservant, aware that Winter, across the kitchen table from her, had turned at the same time.</p><p>Nell flushed at their combined stares. \u201cWell, I did! Did he have bloodred eyes?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled wearily at Nell\u2019s excitement. Caire had escorted her home after the attack, and she\u2019d been set upon by Winter and Nell shortly thereafter. She\u2019d spent the last quarter of an hour answering Winter\u2019s disapproving questions, interrupted now and then by Nell\u2019s exclamations.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see his eyes well,\u201d she answered truthfully. \u201cHe wore a black half-mask with a long, curving nose.\u201d</p><p>Winter snorted.</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cAnd he was wearing red and black motley, like a harlequin.\u201d</p><p>Her brother raised his eyebrows at that, looking vaguely interested. \u201cA theatrical costume? He sounds like a madman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mad actor.\u201d Nell shivered with delight.</p><p>\u201cHe fought very well for a madman,\u201d Temperance said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s merely a footpad with a flair for the dramatic,\u201d Winter said drily.</p><p>\u201cOr he really is a ghost, come back to avenge his death in St. Giles,\u201d Nell said.</p><p>Temperance shook her head. \u201cHe was no ghost. It was a flesh-and-blood man I saw tonight, tall and lean.\u201d She smiled whimsically. \u201cActually, his figure was rather like your own, brother.\u201d</p><p>Nell stifled a giggle.</p><p>Winter merely sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell, whoever he is,\u201d Temperance said hastily, \u201cI owe my life to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it is only prudent that you not see Lord Caire again,\u201d Winter replied.</p><p>Temperance winced, knowing she\u2019d just supplied ammunition for this argument. If only she weren\u2019t so terribly tired! She rubbed at her temple. \u201cWinter, please, can we save this discussion for the morrow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at her a moment, his sad, brown eyes grave; then he nodded and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll spare you the debate tonight, sister, but a night\u2019s sleep won\u2019t change my mind. Your association with this man has brought you into danger, made you neglect your duties to the home and the children, and, I fear, imperils your good sense and virtue. I don\u2019t want you seeing Lord Caire again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded politely and left the kitchen.</p><p>Temperance let her head sink into her hands.</p><p>Nell cleared her throat after a moment of silence. \u201cA cup of tea always sets me right, especially afore bed.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance had to blink back the tears that had welled in her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never exchanged heated words with Winter. Asa and Concord could be quite maddening in their stubborn inability to see other people\u2019s viewpoints, but Winter had never raised his voice to her. He was a thoughtful man, not easily roused to anger, and the realization that she\u2019d done just that tonight was extremely upsetting.</p><p>Nell placed a pot of tea on the table along with two cups, and sat opposite her. She poured the steaming tea into one of the cups. \u201cMr. Makepeace didn\u2019t mean to be so... so... ah...\u201d Nell trailed away, apparently unable to think of a word without disparaging her employer.</p><p>Temperance smiled wryly. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s right.\u201d Temperance reached across the table and took the full teacup, pulling it toward herself. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t leave him to go gallivanting about the East End with Lord Caire. I am neglecting my duties.\u201d</p><p>Nell poured a second cup of tea silently, stirring in a huge lump of sugar. She took a delicate sip and then placed her cup carefully back on the table, her eyes on the tea. \u201cLord Caire is a very... fair man, quite easy on the eyes, I find.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked at her.</p><p>Nell bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s that hair, I think, so long and thick and shining. And silver! It\u2019s just so very striking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like his eyes,\u201d Temperance admitted.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p> <p>There was a drop of tea on the table, and Temperance placed her fingertip in it and drew a circle on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen eyes so blue. And his eyelashes are so dark in contrast to his hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has quite a nice nose,\u201d Nell said with consideration.</p><p>\u201cAnd his lips are wide and curved at the ends. Have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Nell sighed, which seemed answer enough.</p><p>Temperance bit her lip. \u201cAnd they\u2019re so firm, yet so soft. They quite take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>She realized that she might\u2019ve said too much with that last confession and hastily took a sip of tea.</p><p>When she placed the cup back on the table, Nell was looking at her thoughtfully. \u201cHe seems to have a special... consideration for you.\u201d</p><p>Temperance\u2019s eyes dropped to the table again. Her tea circle had dried up. \u201cHow can you tell that? You\u2019ve never even met him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019ve heard from the children and Polly,\u201d Nell said. \u201cPolly says that the way he looks at you gives her thrills.\u201d</p><p>How did he look at her? Was Nell mistaking lust for caring? And why did it matter so much to her?</p><p>Temperance shook her head, placing her hands flat on the table. \u201cHis wants are unnatural. And even if they were not, what kind of a woman would I be to let my urges guide me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps an ordinary woman,\u201d Nell said gently.</p><p>Temperance was silent, remembering the red-haired woman with the scarf over her eyes. Remembering how excited she\u2019d been by the sight. She was so tired of trying to contain her urges, and here was Lord Caire who didn\u2019t try to contain them at all. He seemed to revel in them instead.</p><p>Nell cleared her throat. \u201cI once had a friend who liked a bit of adventure in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Nell hardly ever spoke of her previous profession.</p><p>Nell nodded. \u201cHe was an ordinary gentleman in other regards\u2014he made watch faces\u2014but in the bedroom, he liked to tie up the lady he was with.\u201d</p><p>Temperance kept her gaze carefully focused on the bit of table between her hands, even as she felt the heat rise in her cheeks. To have this discussion at all was horribly embarrassing, but to do so with Lord Caire in mind... oh, goodness!</p><p>\u201cDid...\u201d Temperance stopped and licked her lips. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d Nell said. \u201cMake no mistake, there are gentlemen who like to hurt the girls they\u2019re with, but my gentleman wasn\u2019t one of them. He just seemed to enjoy the whole thing more with me unable to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Temperance said in a small voice.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be thinking of this at all; it incited the worst impulses in her. But she felt rebellion rise in her breast. Was it so horrible to merely contemplate a sexual union with Caire? To wonder what the scarf would feel like? To guess at what he might do first if she was bound, helpless and open to him? To imagine giving in to her urges without guilt\u2014the way Lord Caire seemed to do?</p><p>She repressed a shudder. \u201cI thought you disapproved of Lord Caire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the man,\u201d Nell said carefully. \u201cI know only his reputation among the ladies of the night in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>Temperance frowned. \u201cThe fact that he has any reputation at all among those ladies should be cause enough for disapproval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Nell sighed. \u201cI know a man should remain pure if he\u2019s unwed. He shouldn\u2019t visit whores if he has impulses.\u201d</p><p>Temperance nodded jerkily. Of course not. Sexual congress outside the bonds of marriage was sinful.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, ma\u2019am,\u201d Nell said quietly. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked up quickly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Nell shrugged. \u201cWell, bedsport. I reckon all men and most women like it, even outside of marriage. Why is it so bad?\u201d</p><p>Temperance stared, unable to reply.</p><p>Nell leaned forward. \u201cIf bedsport brings joy, even for a little while, why condemn it?\u201d</p><p>ST. JOHN WAS in his study the next morning, frowning over a speech by Cicero, when Molder cleared his throat phlegmily at the door. \u201cLord Caire to see you, sir.\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve perhaps claimed to not be home, but Caire, damn him, was right behind the butler. St. John clenched his jaw, set down his pen, and waved Caire in.</p><p>Caire strolled in carrying a huge bouquet of daisies. \u201cYou won\u2019t credit who I met in St. Giles last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whore?\u201d St. John asked acidly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes.\u201d Caire scratched his chin. \u201cAt least I assume they were whores, but that is nothing new. No, I made the acquaintance of the infamous Ghost of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you, now?\u201d St. John busied himself rearranging the papers on his desk.</p><p>When he glanced up again, Caire was looking at him thoughtfully. He placed his posy on a table. \u201cA man in a harlequin\u2019s tunic, a floppy hat with a scarlet feather, and a black half-mask. Oh, and he was brandishing both a long and a short sword. Rather overly flamboyant, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>St. John snorted. \u201cAs if you\u2019re one to critique the flamboyance of others.\u201d</p><p>Caire ignored him. \u201cI think it was the scarlet feather that was too much.\u201d</p><p>St. John sighed. \u201cAnd what was the Ghost doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving my hide, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was attacked by five thugs last night. The ghost rather fortuitously intervened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Mrs. Dews with you?\u201d St. John asked softly.</p><p>Caire turned and looked at him silently.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d St. John pushed away from the desk. \u201cWhy do you persist in pursuing that lady? You\u2019re placing her in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike that fact as much as you. I\u2019ve decided that I can no longer take her into St. Giles without a guard of some sort.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet decided how to continue my inquiries with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should leave her be entirely.\u201d</p><p>Caire\u2019s mouth twisted humorlessly. \u201cI find I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d St. John shook his head. \u201cShe isn\u2019t even your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is my type?\u201d</p><p>St. John glanced away. They both knew well enough the kind of women Caire favored.</p><p>\u201cWhores?\u201d Caire asked softly. \u201cWomen who can be bought by jewels?\u201d</p><p>St. John looked at him helplessly.</p><p>Caire was pacing the room. \u201cPerhaps I tire of my type. Perhaps I wish to be in the company of a different sort of woman.\u201d</p><p>St. John sat forward, his voice low and intense. \u201cThen why her? There are innumerable ladies of our own social rank, intelligent, witty, and beautiful, who would be more than happy to have you call upon them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd each would be mentally assessing my annual income and my ancestry.\u201d Caire smiled a bit sadly. \u201cPerhaps I want a woman who cares naught for either. Perhaps I want a woman who, when she looks at me, sees nothing but a man.\u201d</p><p>St. John stared.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about her,\u201d Caire said in a low voice. \u201cShe cares for everyone about her, yet neglects herself. I want to be the one who cares for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ruin her,\u201d St. John said.</p><p>\u201cWill I? The lady is not unwilling no matter your protests. Cut line, Godric. Why does she bother you so much?\u201d</p><p>St. John was silent, a long-held sorrow welling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe reminds you of Clara, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Caire asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d St. John\u2019s eyes were stinging. \u201cDoes she remind you of Clara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Caire touched the bouquet of daisies with one fingertip. \u201cClara was always yours, right from the very start. I never thought of her as anything but a dear friend. I confess I cannot say the same for Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>St. John stared at his hands, clenched on his desk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve acted out of jealousy.\u201d St. John closed his eyes. \u201cYou have a healthy, strong lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is I who should apologize. Your burden is heavy.\u201d</p><p>St. John bent his head, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou know I would give my own life if I could take away her disease,\u201d Caire whispered.</p><p>Caire\u2019s steps moved away and St. John heard the door close gently.</p><p>St. John inhaled, opening his eyes. They were wet and he blotted them irritably upon his sleeve. Then he rose and crossed to the flowers Caire had brought. There were at least two dozen, bright white and gold daisies.</p><p>He picked them up and carried them out of his study.</p><p>Daisies were Clara\u2019s favorite flower.</p><p>IT WAS LATE that afternoon when Silence set out. If this Charming Mickey person was a thief who worked at night, it stood to reason that he\u2019d not be in the best of moods in the morning.</p><p>And she wanted to see him when he was in a good mood.</p><p>She walked quickly along the narrow street, taking care not to meet the eyes of any of the other people who roamed this area of London. Most were street hawkers, returning home after a long day calling their wares in more prosperous parts. They pushed wheelbarrows with wilting vegetables or carried trays empty now of pies and fruit. These people she did not fear. But there were others she did\u2014short men with shifting, mean eyes. Women in gaudy dresses, standing in doorways and at the entrance of alleys, lifting one side of their skirts as the men passed by to advertise their profession. These last two groups Silence hurried away from.</p><p>She was aware that her plain woolen skirt and simple lace cap were of far better quality than that worn by the other people around her. She\u2019d dressed neatly for this interview, wanting to impress without standing out, but even her second-best skirt drew looks from the whores on the corners. She pulled her cloak more firmly about her and ducked her head, walking quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was beginning to wonder if keeping this mission from her husband had been the best idea. But what other choice had she had? She couldn\u2019t sit by and watch William be condemned to prison. This was the only possible action, and since he would no doubt disapprove of it, she\u2019d seen no point in telling him in advance.</p><p>Silence drew a breath as she rounded the last corner. The building she\u2019d been directed to was an old structure, tall and narrow, the brick face crumbling. It stood between a cobbler\u2019s shop and a tenant house, looking no more distinctive than its neighbors. Except that two burly, big men loitered in the doorway outside while a third paced the street across from the building. Silence marched up to the door, her shoulders back, her chin lifted.</p><p>She kept William\u2019s dear face firmly in her thoughts as she looked at the guards. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201d</p><p>One of the men completely ignored her, acting as if he\u2019d not heard or seen her standing right in front of his nose. But the second man, who sported a huge mashed-in broken nose and a too-tight bottle-green coat, seemed amused by her request.</p> <p>He looked her up and down in a too-familiar but not unkind manner. \u201cYer not really \u2019is type, luv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Silence willed herself not to show embarrassment at the man\u2019s blunt assessment. \u201cBut I need to talk to him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, see, that\u2019s not likely, is it?\u201d Broken Nose replied.</p><p>His companion spoke for the first time, revealing a row of missing teeth in his upper jaw. \u201cWhat \u2019ave you got?\u201d</p><p>Silence blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>Broken Nose tilted his head at the other man. \u201c\u2019E wants to know \u2019ow much you can pay us, luv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Silence pulled the tiny purse hanging at her waist through a slit in her skirts. She opened it and looked back up at the two men. \u201cTuppence apiece?\u201d</p><p>Toothless snorted. \u201cNot less than a \u2019alf crown each.\u201d</p><p>Silence drew in her breath, but before she could protest, Broken Nose had turned on his companion.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Alf a crown? \u2019Ave you gone mad, Bert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I \u2019ave not, \u2019Arry,\u201d Bert replied. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2019alf a crown is quite fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf\u2019n she\u2019s the Countess of Suffolk herself, it is,\u201d Harry exploded. \u201cDoes she look to you like the Countess of Suffolk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, jus\u2019 a mo\u2019,\u201d Bert began heatedly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Silence said, rather loudly, for she was afraid the two men were about to come to fisticuffs.</p><p>Both Harry and Bert swung their faces toward her, but it was Harry who said, \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould a shilling each do?\u201d</p><p>Bert snorted again, loudly and with obvious contempt for the offering, but Harry was more generous. \u201cA shillin\u2019 each is quite fair.\u201d</p><p>Bert muttered under his breath something about soft hearts and soft heads, but he stuck out his hand readily enough when Silence opened her purse.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your pet,\u201d he said to Harry. \u201cBetter take \u2019er to \u2019imself.\u201d</p> <p>Harry nodded agreeably to Bert. \u201cI \u2019spect that\u2019s best. This way, miss.\u201d He held the door open for her.</p><p>Silence stepped inside the house and almost immediately stopped, gaping despite herself.</p><p>Behind her, Harry chuckled. \u201cBit unexpected, innit?\u201d</p><p>And she could only nod numbly. The walls were lined with gold.</p><p>The hall wasn\u2019t wide, but it arched high overhead and the gold rose from the floor to gild the ceiling as well. Beneath her feet was a mosaic of marble tiles in a rainbow of colors, laid randomly. Above, crystal chandeliers hung from the gold ceiling, and the lights were reflected in the glorious yellow metal over and over again until the whole was a dazzling display of wonder and wealth.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he fear thieves?\u201d she blurted without thinking.</p><p>Good Lord, she\u2019d never heard of anything as extravagant as this hallway. Even the king himself surely didn\u2019t have golden walls!</p><p>But Harry laughed. \u201cIt\u2019d be a right fool who\u2019d try and steal from Charming Mickey, miss. One who didn\u2019t mind meeting \u2019is maker on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>Silence gulped. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Harry sobered. \u201cYou sure you want to see Charming Mickey, miss? I can let you back out that door, no \u2019arm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Silence squared her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I see him.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged his big shoulders as if to say he washed his hands of the matter. He turned without further ado and led her through the fabulous hall. There was a curving staircase at the back, carved from the same multicolored marble as the floors, like something from an emperor\u2019s dream. Harry mounted the staircase ahead of her\u2014there wasn\u2019t really room for two abreast\u2014and led her to the upper hall. Here, two great double doors stood directly opposite the head of the stairs.</p><p>Harry knocked on one.</p><p>A tiny square window opened in one of the panels of the doors and an eye blinked out at them. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady to see \u2019imself,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>The eye swiveled to stare at Silence. \u201c\u2019Ave you searched the wench?\u201d</p><p>Harry sighed. \u201cDoes she look like an assassin to you, Bob?\u201d</p><p>Bob blinked. \u201cMight. Best kind o\u2019 assassin would be the kind you didn\u2019t think were one, if you get my meaning.\u201d</p><p>Harry merely looked at the eye.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Bob the Eye said after an awkward pause. \u201cBut it\u2019s on yer \u2019ead should she try anything.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at Silence. \u201cDon\u2019t try anything, \u2019ear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely. The realization of what she was about to do had closed her throat tight.</p><p>The great golden doors were opened by Bob, who turned out to be a skeletally thin man wearing a badly fitting white wig. He had a brace of pistols stuck in a broad, worn belt over his coat. But Silence hardly noticed the doorkeeper.</p><p>The room within was magnificent.</p><p>The glorious colored marble floor continued inside the large square room, but the golden walls were replaced with walls of sparkling white marble. Silence looked closer and gasped. The white marble was inlaid with jewels. Above, the ceiling was gold and a multitude of crystal lights hung from it, shining as bright as morning sunshine. And every corner, every inch of the room was jammed with riches. Bolts of bright silks were stacked on marble-topped tables. Inlaid secretaries were shoved against carved mahogany sideboards. Crates spilled straw, revealing china dishes and thinly carved jade. Exotic spices in oriental chests perfumed the air, and graceful marble statues stared dispassionately on the scene. At the far end of the fabulous treasure room stood a dais with a huge, tall-backed chair. It was overstuffed with red velvet, the arms carved and gilded; really, it could only be called a throne.</p><p>Which would make the man who sat upon it a king\u2014Pirate King.</p><p>He lounged, one leg thrown over a chair arm. His black hair was unclubbed, inky curls tumbling about his shoulders and brow. He wore a linen shirt, unbuttoned, fine lace framing the bare olive skin of his chest. His breeches were black velvet, and he finished his costume with polished jackboots that came to midthigh.</p><p>She might have laughed at such a ridiculously flamboyant figure, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the men about him obviously took him very seriously. To his right stood a thin little man, wigless, his bare head nearly bald, and wearing small, round spectacles. To his left were a half dozen or so rough men, lounging about, every one of them armed to the teeth. At his elbow was a small boy holding a silver tray of sweets. And directly in front of Charming Mickey, a hulking man kneeled before the throne, looking as if he feared for his life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d The man clenched fists as big as hams on his thighs. \u201cAs God is my witness, I\u2019m so sorry, sir!\u201d</p><p>The thin little man to Charming Mickey\u2019s right bent and whispered something in the river pirate\u2019s ear.</p><p>He nodded and looked at the supplicant before him. \u201cAn\u2019 you\u2019ll be understanding me, Dick, if I don\u2019t quite find your apology worth as much as a pile of dog shit.\u201d</p><p>The big man, Dick, actually shivered.</p><p>Charming Mickey regarded him for a moment, his right elbow propped on the chair\u2019s arm, lazily rubbing his thumb and middle finger together. Jeweled rings sparkled on his fingers.</p><p>Then he flicked his fingers at two of his men.</p><p>Immediately they came forward, even as the kneeling man began to howl.</p><p>\u201cNo! God, no! Please, I have children. My wife is expectin\u2019 our third!\u201d</p><p>The man screamed as he was dragged through a far door. The door closed and his scream was abruptly cut off. The sudden quiet echoed in the great hall.</p><p>Silence felt the breath she\u2019d held escape her lungs. Dear God, what had she let herself in for?</p><p>Harry took her elbow and they began to walk to the throne. As they neared, he hissed out of the corner of his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t show fear. \u2019E \u2019ates a coward.\u201d</p><p>And then she stood in front of Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, in the exact same spot where the unfortunate Dick had kneeled just seconds before.</p><p>Charming Mickey gestured to the boy holding the tray of sweets. The boy brought it forward, offering him some. Charming Mickey\u2019s ringed hand hovered over the tray as he made his selection\u2014a pink iced bonbon.</p><p>He held the sweet up between his elegant, ringed fingers and examined it. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded his head, unperturbed by the abrupt question. \u201cLady who wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Charming Mickey\u2019s eyes flicked up, and Silence saw that they were a brown so dark that they might as well be black. \u201cThat I can see, Harry, luv. What I\u2019m a-askin\u2019 is more along the lines of why she\u2019s in me throne room.\u201d</p><p>Silence glanced at Harry, who was looking uneasy for the first time, and decided to intervene for her champion. \u201cI\u2019m here about my husband, Captain William Hollingbrook, and the cargo you stole from his ship, the Finch.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Harry drew in his breath sharply. The boy holding the tray of sweetmeats flinched, and the thin man by Charming Mickey\u2019s side looked at her inquiringly over his round spectacles.</p><p>It occurred to Silence that perhaps she should\u2019ve spoken with better tact. But it was too late now. Charming Mickey\u2019s dark eyes were upon her, examining her in minute detail. He popped the pink sweet into his mouth and chewed slowly, the muscles of his jaw flexing and relaxing as his eyelids half lowered in enjoyment.</p><p>He swallowed and smiled, and suddenly Silence understood where he\u2019d gotten the epitaph of \u201ccharming.\u201d When he smiled, Mickey was the handsomest man she\u2019d ever seen. He couldn\u2019t be more than thirty years old, his skin smooth and olive-toned, his black brows tilted up at the outer corners. His nose was long and almost aristocratic, his lips full and curved and elegant. A dimple played about his cheek, near his mouth. When he smiled, Charming Mickey looked almost innocent.</p><p>Except Silence knew she couldn\u2019t fall into that trap. No matter what his smile said, this man was no innocent.</p><p>\u201cStole is such an ugly word, I find,\u201d Charming Mickey drawled. His Irish brogue made the words almost a caress. \u201cI must warn you, Mistress Hollingbrook, that I don\u2019t let many utter it in me presence.\u201d</p><p>Silence bit back the urge to apologize. This man\u2019s actions had imperiled her husband.</p><p>Mickey cocked his head, a long silky curl of ebony hair sliding across his shoulder. \u201cWhat might you be wantin\u2019 from me, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cI want you to return the cargo.\u201d</p><p>Mickey blinked as if bemused. \u201cAn\u2019 why on earth would I do such a foolish thing?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating so loudly she feared he must hear it, but she said steadily, \u201cBecause returning the cargo is the right thing to do. The Christian thing to do. If you don\u2019t, my husband will be sent to prison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mickey raised one black eyebrow, looking quite satanic. \u201cDoes your husband know you\u2019re here, luv?\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He beckoned the sweetmeats boy over again and selected another.</p><p>Silence began to open her mouth, but Harry nudged her, so she took his warning and shut it again.</p> <p>Mickey ate the sweet slowly while those in the throne room waited. Silence noticed that a black marble statue of some Roman goddess stood slightly behind him. She wore a tiara, and long strands of pearls were draped over her naked bosom.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is the way of it, luv,\u201d Mickey said so suddenly that Silence jumped. He smiled that innocent smile again. \u201cThe owner of the ship your husband captains and I have had a bit of a falling out, see. He thinks it well and good to not be payin\u2019 me my proper tithe from his cargos, and I... well, I can\u2019t agree with that tack. Shows a lack of respect, in me own humble opinion. So I\u2019ve taken the liberty of confiscatin\u2019 the Finch\u2019s cargo, sort of to get the man\u2019s attention, like. You might call it a drastic move, and I\u2019d have to agree, but there it is, all the same. The man made his bed and now he must lay upon it.\u201d</p><p>And Charming Mickey shrugged gracefully as if to say the matter was out of his hands.</p><p>That was it, then. Her audience was at an end. Harry had laid his hand on her arm to lead her away, and Charming Mickey was already tilting his head to hear something the thin little man was whispering to him. But she couldn\u2019t give up. She had to at least try one more time. For William.</p><p>Silence took a deep breath, and even as she did so, she felt Harry\u2019s hand tighten on her arm in warning. \u201cPlease, Mr. O\u2019Connor. You have said yourself that your grievance is with the ship\u2019s owner, not my husband. Can you not return the cargo for his sake? For my sake?\u201d</p> <p>Mickey slowly turned his head to look at her, no longer smiling now. His dark eyes were oddly dispassionate, and without his smile, his lips had a cruel edge. \u201c\u2019Ware, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ve let you play about me claws once and run away unharmed. If you skip back into them again, you\u2019ll have naught to blame but yourself.\u201d</p><p>Silence swallowed. His whispered warning made the hairs rise on the back of her neck, and for the first time she realized that she was truly in mortal danger. She wanted nothing more than to turn tail and run.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. \u201cPlease. I beg of you. If you will not do it for my husband\u2019s sake or mine, then do it for yours. For the sake of your immortal soul. Do me this favor and I promise you, you will never regret it.\u201d</p><p>Charming Mickey stared at her, cold, remote, and expressionless. The room was so silent that each breath Silence took sounded in her ears. Beside her, Harry seemed to have stopped breathing altogether.</p><p>Then Mickey slowly smiled. \u201cYou must love him very much, this Captain Hollingbrook, this wonderful husband of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Silence said with pride. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd does he love you in return, me darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Silence\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Charming Mickey murmured, \u201cthen there might be another way for us to work this matter out to our mutual benefit, yours and mine.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Harry stiffened.</p><p>She knew. She knew that whatever Charming Mickey proposed, it would be very bad. She knew that she might not escape this room, this wild, gorgeous house, with her soul entirely intact.</p><p>\u201cThat is, of course,\u201d Mickey murmured like the devil himself, \u201cif you truly love your husband.\u201d</p><p>William was everything in the world to her. There was nothing she would not do to save him.</p><p>Silence looked the devil in the eye and lifted her chin. \u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Meg spent the rest of the day contentedly washing her person so that when she went to sleep that evening, she felt considerably neater. The next morning she was brought before King Lockedheart. He looked a bit surprised when he saw her\u2014perhaps he did not recognize her without her layer of soot?\u2014but his habitual scowl soon returned. In front of him stood a great company of courtiers, clad in rich furs, velvet, and jewels.</p><p>He asked the assembled dignitaries, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Well, the courtiers did not speak in one voice as the trained guards had the day before, but their answers were the same: yes!</p><p>The king sneered at Meg. \u201cThere! Confess now your foolishness.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>\u201cThen you mean to see him again?\u201d Winter asked quietly that night.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Temperance finished braiding Mary Little\u2019s fine flaxen hair and smiled down at the girl. \u201cThere, all done. Now off to bed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Mary Little curtsied as she\u2019d been taught and skipped out of the kitchen. Later, when all the children were settled in their beds, Winter would come up to hear their prayers.</p><p>\u201cNow you, Mary Church.\u201d The girl turned her back and Temperance took up the brush, concentrating on taming the thick, brown curls without pulling too much.</p><p>The remaining three Marys sat before the fire in their chemises, their hair drying as they bent their heads over their samplers. Bath day was always quite a chore, but Temperance enjoyed it nonetheless. There was something wonderfully soothing about all the children being clean and neat at once.</p><p>Or at least this time should be soothing.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI need to go tonight.\u201d</p><p>All the girls could hear their argument, even though both she and Winter took pains to keep their voices even and polite, but the main child she worried over was Mary Whitsun. That Mary sat beside her, combing out the curls of two-year-old Mary Sweet. Mary Whitsun kept her eyes on her task, but she had a frown between her brows.</p><p>Temperance sighed. Pity she couldn\u2019t have this discussion in private, but if she was going to attend the ball Caire had promised to take her to tonight, she would have to get the children safely to bed and then rush to dress in Nell\u2019s lent gown. She wished it were merely for the home that she looked forward to the evening. Already her heartbeat had quickened at the thought of seeing Caire again. She glanced worriedly at the old clock on the mantel. She\u2019d be cutting things perilously close as it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I hope to see a certain gentleman tonight.\u201d</p><p>Winter turned from staring into the fireplace. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Temperance frowned over a tangle in Mary Church\u2019s hair. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman Caire introduced me to at the musicale, Sir Henry Easton. He seemed quite interested in our home\u2014he asked me about apprenticing out the boys and the clothing we provide. Things like that. I\u2019m hoping to convince him to help the home.\u201d</p><p>Winter glanced at the girls, all avidly listening. \u201cIndeed? And what assurance do you have that he\u2019ll do as you hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Temperance pulled overhard on Mary Church\u2019s hair and the girl yelped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mary Church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemperance\u2014\u201d Winter began.</p><p>But she spoke, quick and low. \u201cI have no assurances, but I must go nonetheless. Can\u2019t you see that, brother? I must at least grasp at possibilities, even if they prove to be false hopes.\u201d</p><p>Winter\u2019s thin lips compressed. \u201cVery well. But be sure to stay by Lord Caire\u2019s side. I dislike the thought of you at one of these aristocratic balls. I\u2019ve heard\u201d\u2014he glanced at the girls and appeared to modify his words\u2014\u201cabout events that can take place at such balls. Be careful, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Temperance smiled at Winter and then transferred the smile to Mary Church. \u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Mary Church took Mary Sweet\u2019s hand, for the toddler was properly braided as well, and led her from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, only three little heads and six little braids to go.\u201d Winter smiled at the remaining girls by the fire.</p><p>They giggled at him. While Winter was always gentle, he didn\u2019t often speak in such light tones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up and begin reading the Psalm for the night,\u201d Winter said.</p><p>Temperance nodded. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She felt his hand, briefly laid on her shoulder as he passed, and then she breathed a sigh of relief. She hated his disapproval more than that of her other brothers. Winter was the brother closest to her in age, and they\u2019d become closer still by running the home together.</p><p>She shook her head and quickly finished braiding the other little girls\u2019 hair and sent each on their way until only Mary Whitsun remained. It was something of a ritual between the two of them that Mary Whitsun was the last to have her hair braided at night. Neither spoke as she worked the comb through the girl\u2019s hair, and it occurred to Temperance that she\u2019d been doing this for nine years\u2014since Mary had come to the home. Soon they\u2019d find an apprenticeship for Mary, though, and their nights together by the fire as she braided the girl\u2019s hair would be over.</p><p>Temperance\u2019s breast ached at the thought.</p><p>She was tying a bit of ribbon to Mary\u2019s braid when a knocking came at the front door.</p><p>Temperance rose. \u201cWho can that be?\u201d It was still too early for Lord Caire.</p><p>She hurried to the door, Mary Whitsun at her heels, and unbarred it. On the step was a liveried footman, holding a large covered basket.</p><p>\u201cFor you, miss,\u201d he said, and thrust it into her hands before turning away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Temperance called. \u201cWhat is this for?\u201d</p><p>The footman was already several yards away. He half turned. \u201cMy lord says you\u2019re to wear it tonight.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>Temperance closed and barred the door, and then took the basket into the kitchen. She set it on the table and pulled back the plain linen covering it. Underneath was a bright turquoise silk gown embroidered with delicate posies of yellow, crimson, and black. Temperance drew in her breath. The gown made Nell\u2019s wonderful scarlet dress look like a sack in comparison. Underneath the gown were fine silk stays, a chemise, stockings, and embroidered slippers. Nestled in the silk was a small jeweler\u2019s box. Temperance picked it up with trembling fingers, not daring to open it yet. Surely she couldn\u2019t accept such a gift? But, then, if she was going to a grand ball with Lord Caire, she didn\u2019t want to shame him with the modesty of her toilet.</p><p>That decided her.</p><p>She turned to Mary Whitsun, wide-eyed beside her. \u201cFetch Nell, please. I need to dress for a ball.\u201d</p><p>LAZARUS FELT THE hackles rise on the back of his neck when he entered the ballroom that night with Temperance on his arm. She was magnificent in the turquoise gown he\u2019d sent to her. Her dark hair was piled atop her head and held with the light yellow topaz pins he\u2019d included in the basket. Her breasts pressed against the shimmering silk bodice, mounded and tempting. She was beautiful and desirable, and every man in the room took note. And he was damnably aware of the other men taking note. He actually felt a growl building at the back of his throat, as if he\u2019d stand guard over her like some mangy dog over a scrap.</p><p>What a fool he was.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d he murmured to her.</p><p>He could see the movement of her throat as she swallowed nervously. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and began their perambulation through the overdecorated room. Temperance\u2019s quarry was by the far windows, but it wouldn\u2019t do to approach too eagerly.</p><p>Every notable presently residing in London was here, including, inevitably, his own mother. The Countess of Stanwicke was known for extravagant balls, and she\u2019d outdone herself tonight. A platoon of footmen, attired in orange and black livery, attended the gathering, each attesting to the money needed for both their gaudy clothes and their time. Hothouse flowers were mounded on every surface, already wilting in the heat of the ballroom. The scent of dying roses and lilies mingled with that of burning wax, sweating bodies, and perfume, the whole both nauseating and heady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI intend to return this gown to you after tonight,\u201d Temperance said, taking up the argument that had begun in the carriage ride here.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already told you I\u2019ll simply have it burned if you do,\u201d he replied smoothly, baring his teeth to a gentleman staring at her bosom. None of them would have ever noticed her in her usual drab black gowns. He was a fool for taking her out of her obscurity and bringing her into contact with these overdressed wolves. \u201cI must confess my disappointment in your waste, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an impossible man,\u201d she hissed under her breath while smiling at a passing matron.</p><p>\u201cI may be impossible, but I\u2019ve gained you entry into the most fashionable ball of the season.\u201d</p> <p>There was a short silence as he guided her around a pack of elderly ladies in far too much rouge.</p><p>Then she said softly, \u201cSo you have and I thank you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced swiftly sideways at her. Her cheeks were pink, but the color was not from any rouge pot. \u201cYou have no need to thank me. I\u2019m merely fulfilling the bargain we made.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, her gilded eyes mysterious and far too wise. \u201cYou\u2019ve done more than that for me. You\u2019ve given me this beautiful gown, the hairpins, slippers, and stays. Why shouldn\u2019t I thank you for all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve brought you into this den of wolves.\u201d</p> <p>He felt more than saw her startled glance. \u201cYou make a ball sound overly dangerous, even for one as inexperienced as I.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cIn many ways, this company is as dangerous as the people we\u2019ve met on the streets of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him skeptically.</p><p>\u201cOver there\u201d\u2014he tilted his chin discreetly\u2014\u201cis a gentleman\u2014I use the word in only its social sense\u2014who has killed two men in duels in the last year. Beside him is a decorated general. He lost most of his men in a vain and stupid charge. It\u2019s rumored that our hostess once beat a maid so badly she had to pay the woman over a thousand pounds to hush up the matter.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at Mrs. Dews, expecting shock, but she stared back, her expression open and frank and a little sad. \u201cYou\u2019re merely proving that money and privilege do not go hand in hand with good sense or virtue. That, I think, I already knew.\u201d</p><p>He bowed, feeling heat stealing up his cheeks. \u201cForgive me for boring you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never bore me as well you know, my lord,\u201d she replied. \u201cI only wish to point out that while money can\u2019t buy those things, it can buy food for the stomach and clothes for the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think the people here are happier than those in St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBeing hungry or cold does terrible things for the temperament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d he mused, \u201care the wealthy here any happier than a poor beggar on the street?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with disbelief.</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cTruly. I think a man may find happiness\u2014or discontent\u2014no matter if he has a full belly or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is true, it is very sad,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be happier with all their needs fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMan is a fickle, ungrateful creature, I fear.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at that\u2014finally! \u201cI don\u2019t think I can understand the people from your class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest not to,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou, for instance,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you have any more need of me in St. Giles, but you take me with you still. Why?\u201d</p><p>He looked ahead of them, examining the crowd, watching the other men watching her. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and though he didn\u2019t look at her, he was aware of her every movement. Of her restless fingers tracing the neckline of her bodice, of her pulse fluttering at her throat, of the moment she parted her lips again.</p><p>He leaned closer to her and repeated low, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cAt Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s house, you made me watch...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d They were in a damnably crowded room, the press of bodies almost suffocating. Yet at the same time he felt as if they existed in a closed glass sphere of their own.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked urgently. \u201cWhy did you make me watch? Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he murmured, \u201cyou draw me. Because you are kind but not soft. Because when you touch me, the pain is bittersweet. Because you cradle a desperate secret to your bosom, like a viper in your arms, and don\u2019t let go of it even as it gnaws upon your very flesh. I want to pry that viper from your arms. To suckle upon your torn and bloody flesh. To take your pain within myself and make it mine.\u201d</p><p>She trembled beside him; he could feel the quivers through the arm she kept on him. \u201cI have no secret.\u201d</p><p>He bent and whispered against her hair, \u201cSweet, darling liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now.\u201d A shiver ran up his spine, and he knew without even turning that his mother was approaching. They\u2019d neared Sir Henry, who stood with two other gentlemen. Deftly he inserted Temperance into the circle, made a slight excuse, and turned just as Lady Caire tapped him rather hard on the arm.</p><p>\u201cLazarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d He inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re still escorting that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad your memory is intact,\u201d Lazarus said smoothly. \u201cSo many begin to lose recollection as they age.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, frigid silence, and for a moment he was sure he\u2019d said enough to drive her away. He watched as Temperance leaned toward Sir Henry, and the man\u2019s eyes dropped to her bosom.</p><p>Then Lady Caire drew a trembling breath. \u201cWhat did I ever do to you to deserve this terrible sentiment you show toward me?\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her, blinking in honest astonishment. \u201cWhy, nothing.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThen why this constant hostility? Why this\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something snapped in him. He took a step toward her, using his height to tower over her smaller frame. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions when you don\u2019t truly want to know the answers, madam.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes, identical to his own, widened. \u201cLazarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing,\u201d he said quietly and hard. \u201cWhen Father abandoned me at the wet nurse, you did nothing. When he returned five years later and tore me screaming from her arms, you did nothing. When he whipped me for crying for the only mother I knew, you did nothing. And when Annelise lay dying of a childish fever\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut himself off, staring blindly toward Temperance. Sir Henry had his hand upon her arm, and there was a slight frown between her brows.</p><p>His mother laid her hand on his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I mourn Annelise\u2019s death as well?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her, swallowing, his mouth twisted in a sneer. \u201cWhen Annelise lay dying, desperately ill from fever, and my goddamned father refused to send for a physician because a five-year-old girl should learn strength, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>She merely stared at him, and he noticed for the first time the fine lines that radiated from her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you did. Nothing.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sir Henry draw Temperance away from the other gentlemen. Toward the back of the ballroom. \u201cNothing is what you always do, madam. Don\u2019t be surprised when I, in return, feel nothing for you.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand off his sleeve and threw it away from himself.</p><p>Lazarus turned swiftly, but Temperance and Sir Henry had vanished. Goddamn it! He began weaving through the ballroom, making for the far corner where he\u2019d last seen her. He should never have left her alone with the man. Should never have let himself be distracted. Someone caught his arm as he passed, but he shook off the hand and heard an exclamation of surprised displeasure; then he was at the corner where he\u2019d last seen her. He shoved aside a pyramid of dying flowers, expecting to find a passage or nook for lovers. But there was nothing. Only the blank wall behind the flowers.</p><p>Lazarus turned in a circle, searching the ballroom for a flash of turquoise, the proud tilt of her head. But he saw only the idiot faces of the cream of London society.</p><p>Temperance had disappeared.</p><p>TEMPERANCE KNEW ALMOST at once that she\u2019d made an unfortunate mistake in judging Sir Henry\u2019s character. As he led her into a darkened room, her pulse beat with alarm, but hope died hard. If she was mistaken, if he really was interested in the home, she\u2019d be a fool to insult him. On the other hand, if his interest wasn\u2019t in the home at all, she might be in very grave danger indeed.</p><p>Which was why she made sure to put a large armchair between herself and Sir Henry as they entered the room.</p><p>\u201cI sympathize with Caire your need for privacy, sir,\u201d she said as sweetly as possible, \u201cbut might we want to find a better-lit room at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan never be too sure, my dear,\u201d Sir Henry replied, not reassuring Temperance at all. \u201cI dislike to discuss my business where others might overhear.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door behind him, making the room quite black.</p><p>Temperance inhaled. \u201cYes, well, as to that. The Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children has only three staff at the moment: myself, my brother, Mr. Winter Makepeace, and our maid, Nell Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Sir Henry said, his voice sounding nearer.</p><p>Temperance thought it prudent to abandon her armchair and shift a bit to her left and closer to the door. \u201cYes. But if we had sufficient funds, we would be able to hire more staff and thus help more children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fled, my little mouse,\u201d Sir Henry singsonged in a nauseating voice.</p><p>\u201cSir Henry, are you at all interested in my foundling home?\u201d Temperance asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he replied, much too close.</p><p>She made a startled movement to her right, and male arms immediately closed about her. Horrid wet lips slid across her cheek. \u201cThe home will be a perfect cover for meeting you.\u201d</p><p>And then his lips were mashing hers against her teeth.</p><p>Sadly, the first thing Temperance felt at this assault was disappointment rather than outrage. She\u2019d spent the time since the musicale imagining how the home could benefit from Sir Henry\u2019s patronage. Now she\u2019d have to start the whole bloody process of finding a patron over again. In disgust, she shoved against his chest, but naturally he didn\u2019t give an inch. Instead he attempted to insert his thick tongue into her mouth, a truly revolting prospect.</p><p>Temperance had been disciplining males for a half score of years now. True, the males she dealt with were usually much shorter and less hairy than Sir Henry, but the principle, surely, was much the same.</p><p>She reached up, took a firm hold of his left ear, and twisted hard.</p><p>Sir Henry screamed like a little girl.</p><p>At the same time, the door to the room crashed open. Someone moving low and fast rushed in, shoving Temperance aside and slamming into Sir Henry. The two men went down. Temperance squinted in the dark. She heard the thud of fists, then Sir Henry\u2019s choked-off scream.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>Caire took her arm and escorted her roughly out the door. Temperance blinked as he began hauling her back down the passage. As they neared the ballroom, the sound of the crowd inside grew.</p><p>She attempted to withdraw her arm from his grasp. \u201cCaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing going to a dark room with that ass? Have you no sense?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. There was a reddened spot on his jaw, and he looked livid. \u201cYour hair has come undone.\u201d</p><p>He stopped suddenly, pushing her up against the wall of the passage. \u201cNever go anywhere with a man not of your family.\u201d</p><p>She arched her brows up at him. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe? I am far, far worse than Sir Henry.\u201d He leaned close, his breath brushing against her cheek. \u201cYou ought never to be near me again. You should run right now.\u201d</p><p>His bright blue eyes blazed and a muscle in his hard jaw twitched. He was truly a frightening sight.</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and brushed her lips against that tic. He jerked and then stood still. She felt the muscle jump once more beneath her mouth and then subside. She slid her lips toward his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d she whispered, and kissed him.</p><p>It was strange. Another man had just kissed her on the mouth, but this pressing of lips with Caire was entirely different. His mouth was firm and warm, his lips stubbornly closed against hers. She placed her hands on his wide shoulders for leverage and leaned a little closer. She could smell some kind of exotic spice on his skin\u2014perhaps he\u2019d rubbed it on after shaving\u2014and his mouth tasted of heady wine. She licked the seam of his lips, once, gently.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cOpen,\u201d she breathed across his lips, and he did.</p><p>She probed delicately, licking the inside of his lips, across his teeth, until she found his tongue. She stroked across it and retreated. He followed her tongue into her mouth, and she suckled him softly, raising her palms to frame his lean cheeks.</p> <p>Something in her shifted, crumbling apart and re-forming into a new and wonderful shape. She didn\u2019t know what that shape was, but she wanted to keep it. To stay here in this dim hallway and kiss Caire forever.</p><p>The murmur of voices came from the far end of the passage, drawing nearer.</p><p>Caire lifted his head, looking toward the ballroom.</p><p>A door opened and closed and the voices stopped.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA moment.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to look at her, one eyebrow raised, but she darted around him. His black velvet tie was nearly out of his hair. Carefully, she unknotted it and combed through the silver strands with her fingers before retying the ribbon.</p><p>When she came back around him, he still had that eyebrow cocked. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d She took his arm and he led her back to the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to begin anew,\u201d she said as they began circling.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cAre you willing to take me to another party or musicale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He\u2019d said it matter-of-factly, as if there\u2019d never been a question. \u201cAnd when will you be going into St. Giles again?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d expected him to reply at once, but he was silent for a moment as they walked. She looked at him. His eyebrows were slightly knit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019ve been attacked twice now. On the one hand, it must mean I\u2019m getting closer to Marie\u2019s murderer. On the other, I don\u2019t wish to put you at risk. I must think on the matter and decide how best to make further inquiries.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked down, smoothing her hand down the lovely turquoise gown. She\u2019d never felt material so fine and had gasped when she\u2019d seen her reflection in the little mirror in her room. Caire seemed so cynical, but in many ways his actions were thoughtful. She took a breath. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>He stopped, but she didn\u2019t look at him. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never loved anyone,\u201d he said.</p><p>That made her look up. He was staring ahead stiffly. \u201cNo one?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot since Annelise died.\u201d</p><p>Her heart contracted at the admission. How could one go through life without love at all? \u201cBut you\u2019ve spent months searching for Marie\u2019s killer,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe must have meant something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I search because she should have meant something. Because I should\u2019ve loved her.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m chasing a will-o\u2019-the-wisp of phantom emotion. Perhaps I\u2019m merely fooling myself.\u201d</p><p>She had an urge to take him into her arms, to comfort this cold, isolated man. But they stood in a crowded ballroom. Instead, she squeezed his arm. The contact might cause him pain, but no man could survive without another\u2019s touch, not even he.</p><p>They stopped at the side of the dance floor, and she watched as the beautiful figures moved past. Lady Hero, the sister of the Duke of Wakefield, was a striking figure in a silver tissue gown.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d Caire asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>He angled a glance down at her. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much call for it in a foundling home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He began towing her again.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to a dark room, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>They reached the back of the ballroom, where a double door stood cracked to let in some of the chill night air. Caire pushed through them and drew her out onto a long balcony that ran the length of the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d Caire stood next to her and raised their joined hands.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She suddenly realized what he was going to do. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not here?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo one is about.\u201d</p><p>That was true. The night was too cold for others to be out on the balcony.</p><p>She bit her lip, feeling foolish that she\u2019d never learned to dance when everyone else at the ball could dance as well as they could breathe. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her suddenly, handsome and wicked. \u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll see how clumsy you are?\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her tongue at him.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he said low, though the smile still played around his lips. \u201cI might abandon this lesson for one far more to my taste.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, unsure how to take his teasing tone.</p><p>\u201cCome, it\u2019s not so very hard.\u201d</p><p>His voice was gentle now\u2014and he was far too perceptive.</p><p>She inhaled, looking away from him, touched by his tenderness.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cThe main thing is to always look as if you have a poker up your\u201d\u2014he cast a sideways glance at her\u2014\u201cer, back. Watch.\u201d</p><p>And he patiently demonstrated the steps to the dance, coaching her to follow him as the music floated through the open balcony doors. Temperance studied his graceful movements, trying to imitate them, but what seemed inborn to him was a confusing series of steps to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I shall never be able to do this,\u201d she exclaimed after several minutes.</p><p>\u201cSo dramatic,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re doing quite well, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I keep confusing the steps,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make it seem so natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is natural\u2014to me,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI spent hours upon hours practicing these steps as a boy. If I misstepped, my dance master had a cane he would bring down on the back of my calves. I learned quickly not to misstep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said rather inadequately.</p><p>His world was so different from hers. While she\u2019d been learning to cook, mend, and pinch pennies as a child, he\u2019d learned to master these silly, intricate steps. She pictured him, a proud little boy, dancing all by himself in a large, elegant ballroom, his only company a cruel dance master.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>His brows knit. \u201cYou\u2019re cold. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>She nodded gratefully.</p><p>They stepped back into the ballroom, which seemed more crowded than ever.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some punch?\u201d Caire asked.</p><p>Temperance nodded again. He found an empty chair for her near a huge vase of flowers, and she sat while he went off in search of refreshment. The hour was growing late now, the scent of half-burned candles pervading the room. Temperance saw several ladies employ their fans and wished rather wistfully for one of her own. Then she was chiding herself for wanting more when Caire had already given her so much for this night. Perhaps he was right: perhaps no matter how much a person had, they could still be unhappy.</p><p>A movement out of the corner of her eye caught her attention, and she saw Sir Henry making his way through the crowd. Oh, goodness! How awkward if he should see her. Temperance turned her head away and lifted her hand to her coiffure as if checking to see if her jeweled pins were still in place.</p><p>\u201cHave you dropped something?\u201d a feminine voice said nearby.</p><p>Temperance looked up, startled, and met Lady Hero\u2019s wide gray eyes. She had taken the seat next to Temperance\u2019s, and while the lady didn\u2019t smile, her expression was quite pleasant.</p><p>Temperance realized she was staring and remembered that she\u2019d been asked a question. \u201cOh. Oh, no, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has told you who I am,\u201d Lady Hero said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lady Hero looked at her lap. \u201cIt was to be expected, I suppose.\u201d She glanced up and caught Temperance\u2019s eye, smiling a little crookedly. \u201cI find people treat me differently when they know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Temperance wasn\u2019t sure how exactly to respond to that, because, of course, Lady Hero was quite correct: A duke\u2019s daughter was treated differently. \u201cI am Temperance Dews.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero smiled more fully. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d This close, Temperance could see a fine sprinkling of freckles across her nose. They only served to highlight Lady Hero\u2019s smooth, white complexion.</p><p>Sir Henry chose that moment to walk past them. She met his embarrassed eyes before quickly looking away.</p><p>Lady Hero followed her gaze. \u201cThat man is a toad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Temperance blinked. Surely she hadn\u2019t heard correctly. Did the daughters of dukes call gentlemen toads?</p><p>Apparently they did. Lady Hero nodded. \u201cSir Henry Easton, yes? He looks agreeable enough, I\u2019ll grant you, but he has definite toad tendencies. I say\u201d\u2014her brows knit slightly\u2014\u201che hasn\u2019t done anything to you, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Temperance wrinkled her nose. \u201cWell, yes. He tried to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero winced. \u201cHorrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, really. And rather disappointing, too. You see, I thought he might be interested in my foundling home, but he wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid it was rather foolish of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lady Hero said, sounding wise. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should blame yourself, you know. Toadlike gentlemen generally try to kiss ladies entirely unprovoked. Or at least that is what I have been led to believe. No gentleman has ever attempted to press his unwanted attentions upon me, of course. Duke\u2019s daughter and all that.\u201d Lady Hero sounded just a tad disappointed.</p><p>Temperance smiled. She would never have guessed that a duke\u2019s daughter would be so delightful to talk to.</p><p>\u201cBut tell me about this foundling home,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a lady who managed one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Temperance felt a pleasurable rush of confusion. \u201cWell, the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children is in St. Giles, and we take care of eight and twenty children at the moment, but we could take care of ever so much more if only we had a patron for the home.\u201d Her shoulders slumped. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so hopeful of Sir Henry.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do you have both girls and boys at your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we keep them in separate rooms, of course, but we accept all children up to the age of nine. They\u2019re apprenticed out at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lady Hero said. Her hands were folded gracefully in her lap, and she made no movement, but she seemed somehow to be genuinely interested. \u201cBut then how\u2014oh, bother.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze had gone beyond Temperance\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Temperance glanced quickly and saw a rather stout matron gesturing imperiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cousin Bathilda,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cShe probably wants me to go in with her to dinner, and she\u2019ll only become more irate if I pretend not to notice her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you had best go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear so.\u201d Lady Hero inclined her head. \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you, Miss Dews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs.\u201d Temperance said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m widowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dews, then.\u201d Lady Hero rose. \u201cI do hope we meet again.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance watched her make her way to \u201cCousin Bathilda.\u201d</p><p>When she turned back, Caire was standing in front of her, a glass of punch in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in rarefied company in my absence.\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t credit how nice she is.\u201d</p><p>He glanced in Lady Hero\u2019s direction, then back at her, his expression indulgent. \u201cIs she? Come, drink up your punch and then I shall feed you some scandalously decadent dinner before I take you home. Your brother is bound to be pacing by the door as it is.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, it was nearly an hour before they finally made their way to Caire\u2019s carriage. Temperance was yawning widely after the rich food and richer wine. Caire settled her on a seat, knocked on the carriage roof, and then sat beside her, drawing her into his arms. He threw a fur across them both, and she drifted in and out of sleep as his carriage rumbled across London.</p> <p>It was like a dream world. She felt so safe and warm in his arms, and she could hear the strong beat of his heart under her ear. He was different from her, an aristocrat from a marvelous spun-sugar world, but his heart beat just like any other man.</p><p>The thought comforted her.</p><p>When next she was aware, the carriage had drawn to a halt and he was gently shaking her shoulder. \u201cUp, my sleeping beauty.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and yawned. \u201cIs it dawn?\u201d</p><p>He glanced to the window. \u201cIt soon will be. I have a feeling your brother will take a strip from my hide if I don\u2019t have you home before the first light.\u201d</p><p>That woke her up a bit more. She scrambled upright and felt to make sure her hair was still in place. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve lost a slipper.\u201d</p> <p>She bent to look on the floor, but he\u2019d already knelt and felt along the base of the seat. \u201cHere \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>He took her stockinged foot and gently slid the slipper back on. She stared, dazed, down at his silver head.</p><p>He must\u2019ve felt her look for he glanced up, his eyes darkening. But he merely said, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to trust her voice.</p><p>He helped her from the carriage and walked her to the door of the foundling home. The light had turned gray as they\u2019d approached, but no one yet stirred on the street. She turned as they reached the door, placing a hand on his chest.</p><p>\u201cCaire...\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure what she was about to say, but it didn\u2019t matter anyway.</p><p>He bent his head and brushed her lips with his, murmuring, \u201cGood night, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>He turned away.</p> <p>She watched his broad back blend into the gray mist; then she opened the door to the foundling home with her key. She yawned as she barred the door behind her, then hopped on first one foot and then the other as she removed her heeled slippers. Afterward, she wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>Four male heads swung around at her entrance. Temperance stared. Surely her brothers hadn\u2019t waited up all night just for her? But there was something else wrong. For the fourth male was her brother-in-law, William, and his eyes were red.</p><p>Her gaze flew to Winter. \u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>Winter looked drawn and years older than his true age. \u201cSilence has been missing since yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D TOLD HER to unlace her bodice and to take down her hair, so she had.</p><p>Silence walked from Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s bedroom with her hair trailing down her back. His bedroom was on the floor above the throne room, and in the hall outside, she came upon a maid\u2014the first female servant she\u2019d seen here. The woman stared at her and then looked quickly away again, back to her work of polishing the multicolored marble floor. For a moment, Silence wondered if the maid had any help in her chore, or if perhaps that was all she did? Polish yard after yard of amazing marble floor? If so, it was a task she did not envy the woman.</p><p>\u201cThis way, miss,\u201d a male voice called.</p><p>She looked up and saw that Harry waited for her. His eyes were filled with pity.</p><p>Silence straightened her shoulders. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The guard hesitated. \u201cWould you like to put yourself to rights?\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze firmly away from the tops of her breasts, revealed by her open bodice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Silence whispered. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Charming Mickey had made it plain that straightening herself was not allowed.</p><p>Harry looked at her helplessly for a moment and then nodded. He turned and led the way down the curving marble stairs. Other people were up by now, for it was well past dawn, and the expressions as they saw her varied. Some were pitying like Harry. Some\u2014mostly women\u2014looked envious. But the majority were merely contemptuous; one bold fellow even dared to wink at her before Harry shoved him hard into the wall. After that, most turned their faces away as she passed.</p><p>They came to the front door, and Harry held it open for her.</p><p>\u201cIf\u2019n you need anything, miss, just ask,\u201d he muttered as she passed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied politely, \u201cbut I have everything I came for.\u201d</p><p>And she walked into the bright, merciless sunshine.</p><p>Charming Mickey had been quite explicit in his instructions, so she placed one foot in front of the other and walked up the middle of the dingy St. Giles street, her long hair blowing in the wind. She didn\u2019t look left or right but kept her eyes focused straight ahead, even when the whores returning home called crude things to her.</p><p>She closed her ears and heart and heard nothing, saw nothing, until directly in front of her she saw Temperance\u2019s face, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>Then Silence gasped once and felt the sting of tears at her own eyes.</p><p>But by then she\u2019d made it to the end of the street, so it was quite all right. She\u2019d followed his instructions, done everything he\u2019d said, and he\u2019d honor his part of the bargain as well.</p><p>Except her life would never be the same again.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Meg sighed. \u201cThis is not love, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>King Lockedheart froze in the act of feeding a small morsel of cake to the little blue bird. \u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear,\u201d Meg said simply. \u201cYour courtiers fear you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>The king grunted and seemed pensive.</p><p>\u201cTake her back to the dungeons,\u201d he ordered the guards. \u201cAnd, Meg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care you comb your hair when next I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need a comb and pins to dress my hair,\u201d Meg said softly.</p><p>The king only nodded impatiently and once again Meg was led away....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance held Silence close and gently laced her bodice as the rented carriage rattled back to Wapping. Silence was limp, but her breath was rough and Temperance could feel her tears dropping to her fingers as she worked at the gown.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a doctor?\u201d Temperance finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Silence whispered.</p><p>That was so obviously not the case that Temperance felt fresh tears start again. She swiped at them fiercely with her wrist. Now was not the time to succumb to her own horror and regret. She had to be strong for Silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u201d\u2014she had to stop and inhale\u2014\u201cwhat did he do to you, dearest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d Silence said tonelessly. \u201cHe never even touched me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance started to protest but then reined herself in. Quite obviously Charming Mickey had done something to Silence, and just as obviously she couldn\u2019t talk about it right now. For the next several minutes, Temperance concentrated on finger-combing her sister\u2019s long russet hair. She parted and braided it and, using a few of her own hairpins, wrapped it in a crown about her head.</p><p>Silence lay against Temperance\u2019s breast while Temperance stroked her forehead as if she were a little child.</p><p>She broke the quiet after a bit. \u201cDearest, whyever did you go to that man?\u201d</p><p>Silence sighed, the sound lost and lonely. \u201cI had to save William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you come to me first? We could have discussed it, perhaps found another way to help William.\u201d Temperance tried to keep her voice even, but she knew some of her despair leaked through.</p><p>\u201cYou were so busy,\u201d Silence said quietly. \u201cWith the home, with the children, with Lord Caire and your hunt for a new patron.\u201d</p><p>Her words were like a knife to Temperance\u2019s breast. How could she have become so involved with other things that her own sister had not thought to come to her for help?</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway,\u201d Silence whispered, closing her eyes. \u201cI had to go to Charming Mickey alone. I had to make the bargain I did with him alone. And it worked, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worked, dearest?\u201d Temperance murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy going to Charming Mickey. My bargain with him. He says he\u2019ll return the Finch\u2019s stolen cargo.\u201d</p><p>Temperance closed her eyes as well. She hoped that the pirate king would keep his word, but even if a miracle happened and he did, that would not change things for Silence.</p><p>Her baby sister was ruined\u2014now and forever.</p><p>LAZARUS HAD RISEN only moments before when the argument started outside his bedroom door that afternoon. He looked up from his desk, where he\u2019d been sitting in his banyan and breeches, and watched his bedroom door burst open.</p><p>Temperance marched in the room. Behind her hovered Small.</p><p>Lazarus took one look at the evidence of tears on Temperance\u2019s face and snapped to his valet. \u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>Small bowed and drew the bedroom doors shut.</p><p>Lazarus stood slowly. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, tragedy in her gold-flecked eyes. \u201cSilence... Oh, God, Lazarus, Silence.\u201d</p><p>He noted absently that she\u2019d never addressed him by his given name before. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, as if to steady herself for the recitation. \u201cShe decided to try and get back William, her husband\u2019s, cargo herself. She went to the dockyard gang lord, a man named Mickey O\u2019Connor....\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard vague rumors of a flamboyant dockyard thief in his wanderings in St. Giles. The man was dangerous. Caire frowned. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>A silver tear slipped from beneath her eyelid and dropped, sparkling, in the afternoon light, to the floor. \u201cHe agreed to return the ship\u2019s cargo... but at a price.\u201d</p><p>A lifetime of cynicism made him know what the price was, but he asked anyway. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, shining gilded brown. \u201cHe made her spend the night with him.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus exhaled at the confirmation. He\u2019d never met this Silence, knew nothing of her, and even if he had, he would probably care not a whit for her. Except that she was Temperance\u2019s sister.</p><p>And that made all the difference in the world.</p><p>It was a strange thing, this feeling of empathy. He\u2019d never experienced it before. He realized that what hurt this woman hurt him as well, that what made her bleed caused a hemorrhage of pain within his soul.</p><p>He held out his arms to her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She dived for his arms and he caught her against his chest, shards of exquisite pain prickling his bare skin where the banyan parted and exposed him. She smelled so sweet, of dawn and woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he crooned, the words foreign on his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed once. \u201cWhen I came home this morning, William said Silence had never returned the night before. He suspected she\u2019d gone to O\u2019Connor, but it was too dangerous to venture into the gang lord\u2019s territory at night.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus thought silently that if it had been Temperance, if he\u2019d had knowledge that she were in a den of thieves, her person and soul imperiled, he would\u2019ve retrieved her no matter what the cost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe waited until light and then rented a hack,\u201d she whispered into his shoulder. Her breath sent shivers of unease across his skin. \u201cWe\u2019d just come within sight of O\u2019Connor\u2019s house when Silence emerged from it.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. She still wore the yellow topaz pins he\u2019d bought for her, though she\u2019d changed her gown.</p><p>She shuddered as if remembering. \u201cHer hair was down, Caire, and her bodice undone. He made her walk that way up the street, as if to brand her a whore. When she saw me, she started to cry.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, absorbing her pain, and repeated the only thing he knew to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said nothing happened, that O\u2019Connor made her stay the night in his bedroom but didn\u2019t touch her. Oh, Caire, her protests were so pathetic that I didn\u2019t dare press her for the truth. All I could do was hold her.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms about her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, looking into his eyes. \u201cBut the worst part was when we returned to the foundling home. William was waiting for us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t accompany you in the hack?\u201d Lazarus frowned.</p><p>Temperance shook her head. \u201cHe said if he was seen near O\u2019Connor\u2019s house, it would give credence to the claim that he was in league with the river pirate.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus ran his hand soothingly over her back without comment. Hollingbrook sounded like a fool.</p><p>\u201cAnd when we arrived, he took one look at Silence and then turned his face away. Oh, Caire\u201d\u2014her eyes closed wearily\u2014\u201cit near broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head then because he couldn\u2019t not do so. His lips brushed hers gently. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her head sank wearily against his shoulder as she accepted his kisses. Her lips were soft and tasted of tears. He brushed his mouth over her cheeks, tasting the tears there as well, licking up her grief.</p><p>\u201cCaire,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d she said, almost like a little girl. He guessed she\u2019d not slept since he\u2019d brought her back to her home the night before.</p><p>\u201cThen lie with me a while,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He picked her up like a child and brought her to his still-unmade bed, laying her gently there before climbing in beside her. He pulled her close until her head was snuggled against his banyan-covered chest, pricking him with almost-pain.</p><p>She sighed again. \u201c\u2019S funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d he murmured, threading his fingers through her hair. He took the yellow topaz jewels out of her coiffure and laid them on the table by his bed.</p><p>\u201cWilliam sent word. After he went home with Silence. After my brothers argued and Asa stormed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d He plucked bent little pins from her hair, one by one, releasing her tresses from their confinement, combing them gently with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe ship\u2019s cargo,\u201d she said. \u201cMickey O\u2019Connor kept his word. It was all there on the ship this morning. As if it had never disappeared in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Lazarus stared at the canopy over his bed and thought about a thief\u2019s perfidy and his honor and the price a woman might pay for the man she loved. When he looked down again, he saw that Temperance breathed slowly and evenly against him, her lush mouth slightly parted. Her mahogany hair was spread like a blanket of silk upon his shoulder and bed, and the sight gave him satisfaction deep in his soul.</p><p>He lifted one lock and watched as the strands curled adoringly around his fingers. He smiled slightly. How a man might deceive himself with such a sight.</p><p>Then he let his arm drop. He pulled her a little closer against his chest and closed his own eyes.</p><p>And slept.</p><p>SHE AWOKE IN a darkened room with the realization that something awful waited for her just as soon as she opened her eyelids.</p><p>So she didn\u2019t.</p><p>She drifted, not thinking, not waking, trying to hold on to the peace of sleep. There was another body next to hers, large and warm and comforting, and she concentrated on that. He breathed deeply as if still asleep, and she liked the sound of his soft exhalations. It meant that she wasn\u2019t alone. She wished she could stay here forever, in the gray warmth of half-sleep. But inevitably, wakefulness and knowledge intruded and she opened her eyes on a pained gasp.</p><p>Caire\u2019s arm tightened about her.</p><p>She turned her face into his side, inhaling his musk, ashamed that tears still threatened. Silence was the youngest, the most innocent of their family, and her downfall seemed too terrible to bear, as if all light had been extinguished in the world.</p><p>He sighed heavily, one hand trailing down her back to her bottom and squeezing. \u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>He was hot. She slid her arm over his back, vaguely surprised to realize that only a thin layer of silk separated her fingers from his bare skin. \u201cCaire.\u201d</p><p>His mouth found hers, lazy with sleepiness. He kissed her and she was comforted, here in the darkness. She wasn\u2019t Temperance at this moment; he wasn\u2019t an aristocratic lord far above her. Here in the limbo between night and day, they were simply a man and a woman.</p><p>And as a woman, she opened her mouth to his.</p><p>He made a satisfied sound, deep in his chest, and thrust his tongue into her mouth, asserting his authority. She let him, drawing him deep. Right now she didn\u2019t want to face the world outside those bedroom doors. She only wanted to feel.</p><p>To let herself feel as she hadn\u2019t in years.</p><p>Desire hit her, hard and fast. She\u2019d always been particularly vulnerable to physical lust, had to guard against it every day of her life to make sure others didn\u2019t know how it controlled her. Now she let it run free.</p><p>She opened her hands over his back, feeling the slick silk slide beneath her palms. He was muscled, his shoulders wide, the indent of his spine very defined.</p><p>He broke the kiss on a gasp, plucking at her bodice. \u201cTake this off.\u201d</p><p>It was awkward, here in the dark, but she skimmed and wriggled, and in the end, when her stays twisted about her middle, he simply inserted his fingers under the laces and tore them from the holes. Each lace made a popping sound as it was released from its prison, and she felt her breasts jiggle in freedom. He ripped the ruined stays from her body and then pushed her chemise over her head.</p><p>And then she was naked.</p><p>\u201cRemove this,\u201d she whispered, pulling at his banyan.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, and she remembered his sensitivity.</p><p>She met his eyes. They stared regretfully down at her. \u201cIt will hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hurt.\u201d He brushed his lips against the corner of her mouth. \u201cNo longer hurt with you. Just... discomfort. And only if you touch my bare skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you touch my bare skin?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cThat, I assure you, will cause me no pain at all.\u201d</p><p>This frustrated her, but then she moved against him, rubbing her breasts against his chest, feeling the silk against her nipples.</p><p>He growled, reaching for her, and she broke free of her reins. She threw a leg over him and ran her bare calf up and down his leg. He wore breeches, and she felt the rough material against her skin before she came to his bare lower legs. He stiffened. She knew she was causing him discomfort, but she couldn\u2019t stop. She delighted in the contrast between her softness and his hard strength.</p><p>He moved suddenly, rolling her beneath him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t do the expected. Instead he captured her hands, pressing them above her head, shoving his weight down on her until she could hardly move.</p><p>\u201cPlease, now,\u201d she panted. She didn\u2019t want to leave this drugged state, to return to normal life and guilt and sorrow.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d he murmured against her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied angrily, \u201cyes, there is.\u201d</p><p>But he only laughed, his breath tickling her skin as he trailed his mouth over her collarbone. What was he about? Didn\u2019t he have the same urges as other men? That part of him\u2014the part that made him a man\u2014was most definitely interested. It pressed against her belly, hard and hot through his breeches, sliding to her hip as he moved down her body.</p><p>She was distracted, dazed and confused, her attention split between his wandering mouth and the cock that pressed now at the top of her mound. She tried to raise her hips, to push against him, but he chuckled and shifted one thigh, ensuring her immobility.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she cried in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mrs. Dews,\u201d he drawled, \u201cI thought you\u2019d been married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was married,\u201d she said waspishly. The last thing she wanted to think about now was her dead husband.</p><p>\u201cThen I would think you\u2019d be somewhat familiar with this process,\u201d he whispered just before he took her nipple into his hot mouth.</p><p>Her mind went blank, and then a rolling wave of sensation made her literally shake. Dear God, it\u2019d been so long since a man had touched her there. Since she\u2019d felt that strong suckle. The eroticism was almost overwhelming.</p><p>He lifted his head to lazily lick at the breast, each languid swipe of his wet tongue harrowing in its own way.</p><p>\u201cI must admit I\u2019m a novice at this myself,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked into the darkness. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking love,\u201d he said, quite matter-of-factly, and bit gently on her other nipple.</p><p>She sobbed, feeling that pleasure-pain, feeling the growing ache in her center. He would not move to relieve her.</p><p>Instead he babbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s an extraordinary experience,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cbut you must forgive me if I seem unsure. I\u2019ve bedded many women, but the act of making love is one I\u2019ve never ventured. In this, I think, you must be the master.\u201d</p><p>His voice had a slight question, but even if she\u2019d been in her right senses, she wouldn\u2019t have commented. Why was he playing this game when all she wanted was his flesh between her thighs?</p><p>\u201cGently,\u201d he crooned in a hushed voice, chiding her for a groan of frustration. He shoved apart her thighs and settled himself into the space he\u2019d made. \u201cThere. Is that better?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was unquestionably better. The length of his hardness lay against her wet folds, the material of his breeches a wonderful abrasion. She closed her eyes in bliss at his heat, at the slight, but not quite hard enough, pressure.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he repeated soothingly. \u201cNow, what if I add this?\u201d</p><p>And he drew her nipple into his mouth again, his teeth scraping just barely as he suckled.</p><p>She wanted to touch him as well, to run her fingers through the hair on his chest, to grip his shoulders and reach beneath his breeches to knead his buttocks. But his hands still chained hers and she was forced to simply wait.</p><p>To submit.</p><p>\u201cWiden your legs,\u201d he whispered, his voice deep and clear in the still dark.</p><p>She complied.</p><p>\u201cLift them a little.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed. He grunted in what sounded like pleasure. Her movement had caused him to settle closer to her, his cock now lodged between the folds of her sex.</p><p>She swallowed, waiting for his next move.</p><p>\u201cI think... yes, this.\u201d He shifted, his hand between them, opening his falls, letting himself out. When he again let his weight settle against her, his naked penis rubbed quite explicitly on her clitoris, and while she was distracted by that, he brought his mouth down on hers.</p><p>He kissed her openmouthed, and it was almost too intimate, here in the dark. He lay on her\u2014his chest pressed into her vulnerable, naked breasts, his hot cock burrowed against her softness\u2014and thoroughly, leisurely, kissed her.</p><p>He caught her bottom lip between his teeth, nibbling delicately, then whispered against her lips, \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>She accepted the sweep of his tongue into her mouth, sucking for long moments helplessly. So erotic was the kiss that she almost didn\u2019t notice when he began to move against her. But she did. She stilled, her entire concentration on that part of his body becoming intimate with that part of her body. Until he nipped the corner of her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPay attention.\u201d His voice was ragged now.</p><p>Something wild and feminine thrilled at the roughness of his voice, at the knowledge that she was affecting him, despite his sophistication. She opened her mouth beneath his, biting back at him, and he inhaled sharply. Then his mouth was crushing hers, roughly, almost out of control, a male creature dominating a female. His female.</p><p>He shifted again, his penis drawing back, finding her entrance and notching into her. He raised his head only far enough to whisper, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He shoved powerfully.</p> <p>His hardness breached her soft depths, parting and burrowing, invading where she\u2019d been empty for years. She gasped at the movement, at the sensation both physical and mental, but his mouth was on hers again, and he inhaled her breath. He shoved and shoved again until he was seated fully, her thighs stretched wide, his hips hard against hers.</p><p>She had a moment of panic. Who was this man? Why was she under him, letting the worst part of herself dictate her actions? Then he began to move and all thought fled her mind. He moved like a wave pounding against a beach, like the wind flying across the cobblestones, like a man on a woman. It was the oldest, most common movement in history, and at the same time it was new and pure. Because it was him and her and they\u2019d never done this together before.</p><p>She arched under him, feeling his flesh part and merge with hers as he continued to kiss her deeply.</p><p>He ran his mouth over her cheek, never breaking his smooth, slow rhythm, and whispered in her ear, \u201cWrap your legs around my hips.\u201d</p><p>She did and then they were locked tightly together. He hitched himself up a little on her and she gasped. On each downward thrust, on every slow, dragging withdrawal, he rubbed his flesh against the apex of her sex. She turned her head, suddenly too exposed, too vulnerable, even in the dark, but he followed her, pressing his mouth softly at the corners of her lips. It was unbearable, this slow, controlled, repeated invasion, this sure attack on her senses. She wanted to scream, to make him stop. To urge him to go faster. And as if he understood her anxiety, he increased his pace, thudding into her core with a strong tempo.</p> <p>Driving her insane.</p><p>She tore her mouth away from his, panting, her wrists twisting under his hold. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, an unseen ghost. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d He levered himself up a little more and began a slow twist of his hips as he drove into her, and somehow, the pressure, the pleasure, the heat, and the expectation all released at once.</p><p>She flew apart, sobbing, gloriously free, no mind, no soul, only a single throbbing point of shining beauty. Dimly she heard his breath catch, felt his rhythm falter and jerk, and then suddenly lose control. He thrust into her body savagely as she floated, and the movement sent her even higher.</p> <p>He exhaled roughly.</p><p>His body made one or two more thrusts, and then he stopped, his head dropping as he kissed her tenderly. She had a wild urge to say something entirely inappropriate. To tell him what this had meant to her.</p><p>He released her wrists, but she was too worn out to lower her arms.</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary indeed,\u201d he murmured, his voice calm and deep, only slightly out of breath.</p><p>She knew she should analyze that, should make some reply.</p><p>But she drifted to sleep instead.</p><p>HE\u2019D NEVER WOKEN beside a woman before.</p><p>It was Lazarus\u2019s first thought the next morning. His usual lovers were, by definition, more in the way of business partners. They sold a commodity; he bought it. Simple, clean, and impersonal. So impersonal he\u2019d sometimes not known their true names, even the ones like Marie, who he\u2019d kept for years. Marie in whose name he searched for a killer in St. Giles.</p> <p>Yet he\u2019d never lain next to Marie. He\u2019d never felt her sweet warmth beside him, never listened to the soft exhale of her breath as she slept.</p><p>He opened his eyes and turned his head to watch Temperance. She lay with her arms still thrown over her head. Her lips were a deep red, her cheeks flushed, and the dawning sun gave her skin a golden glaze. She was almost too beautiful, lying next to him, to be real. Only the tangle of her dark hair saved her from perfection. Thank God. He\u2019d bought and used perfection before, and it no longer interested him. His blood stirred now for a real woman.</p><p>One untidy lock of hair trailed across a cheek, down her neck, sticking a bit sweatily, and curled at the top of one exposed breast. Round and full, the nipple a soft rose. He touched that nipple, wondering at the velvet texture of her skin, the instant tightening at the tip.</p><p>She gasped and his gaze flew toward hers. She looked at him wonderingly as if surprised to find herself here in his bed.</p><p>Well, perhaps she was.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he began. Banal, perhaps, but what the deuce else was he to say?</p><p>But she threw back the covers and bounded out of the bed like a startled fawn. \u201cWhere is my chemise?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms behind his head. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She turned a glare at him\u2014entirely charming since she was nude. \u201cYou took it off me. You must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had, er, other matters on my mind.\u201d Pity. He had no need to look at his lap to know that his cock would\u2019ve been more than happy to repeat their activities of last night.</p><p>He glanced at her. She was on her knees, her bottom in the air as she searched under a chair, presumably for the missing chemise. The view was astounding, but he had the feeling she wasn\u2019t in the mood.</p><p>And, indeed, when she suddenly straightened and caught his stare, she glared. \u201cI need to go home. I told Winter I was coming to see you, but I never expected to spend the night! He\u2019ll be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he said in what he hoped was a soothing voice. \u201cBut it\u2019s just dawn. Surely you can stay long enough to break your fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to get home,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t have my brothers thinking we\u2019re lovers.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, but some sense of survival kept him from pointing out that they were lovers.</p><p>Instead he said patiently, \u201cI\u2019ll ring for a maid to help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d She held up the remains of her stays.</p><p>He winced. \u201cAh. Allow me to send one of my maids to purchase you a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will take hours!\u201d She was back to glaring at him again.</p><p>He sighed. He\u2019d never particularly enjoyed rising early, but it was quite evident he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to lie abed this morning.</p><p>Lazarus threw back the covers and rose, permitting himself only a moment\u2019s satisfaction when she took one look at the tent in his breeches and blushed violently. He crossed to the cord and rang for Small. After a sotto voce conference at the door to his room\u2014Temperance had retired to his bed\u2014the valet acquired a set of stays from a maid, and in half an hour, Mrs. Dews was properly attired again.</p><p>Lazarus lounged in a chair, watching as she tied her cloak quite firmly under her chin. Every hair was in place, a white cap sat primly on her head, and she looked every inch the respectable matron of a foundling home.</p><p>He hated the look.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said as she put her hand on the doorknob.</p><p>She turned impatiently but looked wary as she saw him prowling near.</p><p>\u201cI need to make some investigations tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI had word of a man I should question when I returned home last night.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen be ready at eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her hard, his mouth forcing hers open, thrusting in his tongue as she gave way.</p><p>When he raised his head, she was looking at him in alarm. He smiled. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>And he watched as she turned and left his bedroom. Her spine was straight, and she never looked back. Perhaps she\u2019d already decided to put their night together behind her.</p><p>If so, he pitied her. For he had every intention of bedding her again.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Meg spent the rest of the day quite happily combing out the tangles from her long flaxen hair. Early the next morning, she braided her hair and wound it about her head in a golden crown. She\u2019d hardly put the last pin in when the guards came to bring her before the king. This time the throne room was filled with a bevy of lovely ladies. Each was more graceful than the last, their faces painted delicately to highlight their dazzling beauty.</p><p>In the midst of this feminine bounty, the king lounged, large and masculine and isolated. His gaze immediately went to Meg.</p><p>Without preamble, he asked, \u201cDo you love me, my concubines?\u201d</p><p>As one, the ladies turned and, with various simpering expressions, said, \u201cYes!\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>Temperance stared blindly out of Caire\u2019s carriage as it rolled through the bright London sunshine. She\u2019d succumbed to the temptations of the flesh, had lain with a man not her husband\u2014for the second time in her life. She should feel guilt and sorrow and perhaps panic, and she did feel all those things. But at the same time, there was a spark of joy deep within her breast that stubbornly refused to be quenched by all her doubts.</p><p>She\u2019d lain with Caire and she was happier for it.</p><p>Still, she was bracing herself to meet Winter\u2019s disapproval when the carriage stopped near the home. And, indeed, when she descended, she saw that Winter stood outside the home\u2019s front door. Oh, dear.</p><p>He watched her approach, his dark brown eyes intent, but when she drew near, he merely said, \u201cCome inside, sister.\u201d</p><p>Temperance followed him, subdued. She half expected him to quiz her on her absence the previous night, but he simply led her into the kitchen instead. There, Nell was supervising the cooking of the morning meal, Mary Whitsun in attendance. Nell rolled her eyes at Temperance\u2019s entrance, obviously agog with questions she couldn\u2019t ask at the moment.</p><p>Winter turned as if to go, but Temperance laid her hand on his arm. \u201cSilence?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, turning his face from hers. \u201cNeither she nor William have communicated since he sent word that the cargo was returned.\u201d</p><p>Temperance released a breath. \u201cAnd Asa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He and Concord aren\u2019t speaking. I fear he\u2019s disappeared again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded dismally. Their family had splintered apart in only a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cI must go to the school,\u201d Winter said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, dropping her hand.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cAre you truly well, sister? I worry for your welfare.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her eyes on her shoes. What must he think of her?</p><p>She felt the brush of his hand on her hair, light and comforting, and then he was gone from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you last night, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mary Whitsun said softly. She was busy stirring the porridge over the fire and would not meet Temperance\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Temperance sighed and considered avoiding the issue. But that wasn\u2019t fair to either Mary Whitsun or herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I neglected you and the other children. I should never have left you so abruptly last night.\u201d</p><p>Mary gave her an inscrutable look, much too old for a twelve-year-old child. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Temperance winced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d Mary had slowed her stirring until the big wooden spoon was nearly motionless in the pot. \u201cMr. Makepeace said that a lady was making inquiries about girl apprentices yesterday evening. He said it might be a good position for me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance\u2019s heart squeezed. She wasn\u2019t ready yet to let go of Mary Whitsun, but she must face the reality of her position.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She found she had to clear her throat. She smiled brightly to cover the pause. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll discuss this with Mr. Makepeace and make sure the position is a good one for you, Mary.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mary ducked her head, her little shoulders slumping. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>And Temperance had to turn away to hide the shine of tears in her eyes.</p><p>The rest of the day was spent in the usual labors of the home\u2014cooking, cleaning, ordering the children and gently chiding. By evening, Temperance was at once exhausted and on edge, anticipating seeing Caire again. Yet, when his knock came at the kitchen door, she was still not prepared to see him.</p><p>Temperance opened the door and looked at him, standing there in the waning dusk. His silver hair was pulled back into a sleek tail, but her fingers remembered the silkiness of the locks. His sapphire eyes watched her from beneath the brim of his tricorne, and he wore his usual black cloak, but now she knew what it felt like to have him lie between her thighs. Knew how the lines about his mouth deepened when he was at his point. Knew how his penis jumped and jerked within her as his semen washed into her.</p> <p>She inhaled, fighting to keep the polite, everyday expression on her face.</p><p>A corner of his sensuous lips curved just slightly as if he had an idea of the battle she fought within. \u201cMrs. Dews. How are you this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite fine, my lord,\u201d she replied, perhaps a touch too sharply. She had an overwhelming urge to touch him, and yet she could not.</p><p>His mouth hid a definite smile now, and the sight made her want to both slam the door in his face and grab him and kiss him all at once.</p><p>It was a rather frustrating sensation.</p> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWould you care to come in for tea before we depart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, no,\u201d he replied, as formally as she. \u201cThe business I have tonight cannot wait.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Her cloak was ready and she swung it around herself before nodding to Nell, who was pretending not to be eavesdropping at the kitchen table, and left. Caire immediately set off. She hurried to catch up, but they hadn\u2019t gone half a dozen steps before he pulled her suddenly into a darkened doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth cut off her startled exclamation. He kissed her thoroughly and possessively before raising his head slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded very satisfied with himself.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>He set off again, more moderately this time. Unlike their other evenings in St. Giles, she did not know where they were headed. Caire was the one leading now. They followed the back alley out to the crossroads, and Temperance saw his carriage waiting.</p><p>She glanced at him, surprised. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo visit the man we saw at Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s house,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>She halted. \u201cOh, but surely you don\u2019t need me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea the ways that I need you,\u201d he murmured, and helped her into the carriage.</p><p>Well, she really had no choice. At least that was what Temperance told herself as she sat on the carriage cushions. Perhaps the truth was that she liked being with him no matter the pretext.</p> <p>He sat opposite her, and she tamped down a twinge of regret.</p><p>The carriage lurched forward, and she looked down at her hands in her lap, aware of his gaze upon her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked softly after a moment.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cI meant after our coupling last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She felt heat creep up her neck. He would talk bluntly about the matter! \u201cI\u2019m well. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your sister?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, the tears too close to the surface. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>She peeked through her lashes, trying to read his expression in the dim light. He sounded as if he might be worried for her. Did he intend to repeat the events of the night before? Or was it a one-time thing best forgotten? But surely if he was not interested in her, he would not have dragged her along on this ride. Temperance felt heat pool low in her belly at the thought of his hands caressing her breasts again. Of his lips against her neck.</p><p>The carriage shuddered to a halt and she looked up quickly. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to finish the question, because the carriage door opened at that moment and a tall man in a gray wig and half-moon spectacles entered.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dews, perhaps you remember my friend Mr. St. John?\u201d Caire asked smoothly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, trying to hide her confusion.</p><p>Mr. St. John inclined his head. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. John has kindly consented to join us in our investigations this evening,\u201d Caire said.</p><p>St. John snorted softly, making Temperance wonder how his kind consent had been obtained. She stared curiously between the two men. Caire and St. John didn\u2019t seem likely friends. Caire was so carefree\u2014but with an air of danger\u2014while St. John looked grave and scholarly.</p><p>\u201cMay I inquire as to how you two became friends?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was Caire who replied. \u201cSt. John and I met at Oxford, where I was spending my time drinking bad wine, and he was attempting to translate obscure Grecian philosophers and arguing politics with other boring fellows.\u201d</p><p>St. John interjected another snort here, but Caire continued, oblivious to the interruption. \u201cOne night I came across him in the midst of six vulgar toughs who were in the process of pounding him into a sort of puree. I\u2019m afraid I took offense at their chosen pursuit.\u201d</p><p>Temperance waited, but both men merely looked at her as if their story was done.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cSo you met in a tavern brawl?\u201d</p><p>Caire looked at the ceiling consideringly. \u201cMore a street fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr melee.\u201d St. John shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd you became friends,\u201d she finished for them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caire said while St. John shrugged again, as if the outcome was self-evident.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Temperance muttered under her breath.</p><p>Caire must\u2019ve had acute hearing. \u201cI think it was the blow St. John received to the crown of his head,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cBlood all over the place. It has a kind of bonding effect.\u201d</p><p>She blinked again. \u201cAnd you were untouched?\u201d</p><p>That presumption was too much for St. John. \u201cHe had his nose broken and both eyes blacked,\u201d he said with what sounded very much like satisfaction. \u201cAnd his lip swelled so much he talked with a lisp for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sennight,\u201d Caire interjected.</p><p>\u201cSix weeks at the very least,\u201d St. John shot back without heat. \u201cYou were still lisping on May Day when we, ah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowed down the Isis dead drunk at dawn,\u201d Caire said. \u201cWith the don\u2019s stolen pug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d St. John murmured.</p><p>Temperance\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Caire\u2019s mouth cocked up. \u201cSo you see why I brought him when I thought we might need another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Temperance said weakly.</p><p>\u201cI spent the next two years at Oxford trying to get him to drink more wine and study less,\u201d Caire.</p><p>\u201cAnd I spent those two years attempting to keep you from succumbing to your worst urges,\u201d St. John said far less lightly. He glanced at Caire. \u201cAt one point, I was certain you had a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did, \u201d Caire whispered. \u201cMaybe I did.\u201d</p><p>The carriage jolted and stopped.</p><p>Caire glanced out the window, immediately sobering. \u201cAnd here we are.\u201d</p><p>AFTER THAT LAST attack in St. Giles, Lazarus had vowed never again to put Mrs. Dews at risk. Yet, at the same time, he needed an excuse that required her continued presence in his life. His inquiries, while dangerous, were perfect.</p><p>Hence St. John\u2019s appearance tonight.</p><p>Lazarus admitted to himself wryly that a male duenna\u2014whom he\u2019d provided himself\u2014made his pursuit of Temperance somewhat comical. But he\u2019d not compromise either her safety or his... courtship of her.</p><p>The word gave him pause. Was that what this was? A courtship? Perhaps. It was the first time that he\u2019d pursued a female without the lure of money. It was a strangely humbling thought: She\u2019d come to him with no regard for what he could give her. He had to use his charm alone.</p><p>And that was often in short supply.</p><p>\u201cWho is the man we see tonight?\u201d St. John asked as they descended the carriage. He might be a scholar, but Lazarus knew from those days at Oxford that the man could fight if need be.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Eppingham, Lord Faulk,\u201d Lazarus said, looking at the crumbling town house in front of them. They were in Westminster. The area had once been fashionable, but now most of the wealthy former citizens had fled west. \u201cHe\u2019s fond of blindfolds.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus felt St. John\u2019s quick glance, but he ignored it as he rapped on the door. There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find this man?\u201d St. John asked stiffly.</p><p>Lazarus smiled humorlessly. \u201cA brothel madam recommended him to me.\u201d</p><p>He caught St. John studying Temperance, but before he could voice a possible concern, the door to the house was opened.</p><p>A slatternly maid stood gaping at them.</p><p>\u201cMay we see your master?\u201d Lazarus asked.</p><p>She gulped, scratched at one arm, and turned without replying. The maid led them into a house that obviously had once been better maintained. The worn wooden floor was dull. Dust had settled into the dark corners. A room was off the hall, and she opened the door without preamble. Faulk was seated inside at a desk, attired in a frayed brown banyan and soft cap to keep his shaved head warm. He wore fingerless gloves on his hands to write, and Lazarus noticed that his fire was meager. In fact, the whole house was chill.</p><p>\u201cWho was it, Sally?\u201d Faulk asked before belatedly looking up. He stared at them for a moment, and Lazarus thought his eyes iced over. \u201cI have no monies to give you.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus arched an eyebrow. \u201cWe\u2019re not bill collectors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Faulk showed no sign of embarrassment. \u201cThen what is your business, if I may ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wished to ask you about a mutual friend.\u201d</p><p>Faulk arched a single eyebrow. He was younger than Lazarus had first taken him for\u2014perhaps no more than forty. He was handsome, but want or hard living had etched lines in his face, and his jawline sagged. In another year or so, his good looks would be gone.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Marie Hume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Faulk replied promptly. His gaze never wavered, but his hand fisted on top of the desk.</p><p>\u201cA fair woman with a round, red birthmark by the corner of her right eye?\u201d Lazarus asked gently. \u201cShe was found dead in St. Giles almost two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany whores die in St. Giles,\u201d Faulk said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lazarus said, \u201cbut I never said she was a whore.\u201d</p><p>Faulk\u2019s expression blanked.</p><p>In the silence, Lazarus took Temperance\u2019s arm and pulled her to sit next to him on a listing settee. St. John remained standing by the door.</p><p>Faulk flicked his eyes to Temperance and St. John and then seemed to disregard them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this about?\u201d he asked Lazarus.</p><p>\u201cMarie was a friend of mine,\u201d Lazarus replied. \u201cI\u2019m interested in finding the man who murdered her.\u201d</p><p>Faulk\u2019s sallow skin turned waxen. \u201cShe was murdered?\u201d</p><p>Could a man pretend a change in skin color? Lazarus thought not. \u201cShe was found bound to a bed, her belly cut open.\u201d</p><p>Faulk stared at him and then abruptly shifted his weight in his chair, slumping back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her?\u201d Lazarus asked.</p><p>Faulk nodded. \u201cA half dozen times or more. But I wasn\u2019t the only man she entertained.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus waited, not saying anything.</p><p>Faulk\u2019s color\u2014what there was of it\u2014was returning to his face. \u201cShe had several callers. She was willing to do, ah, unusual things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked knowingly at Lazarus, as if they shared a dirty secret. Except Lazarus had held his \u201csecret\u201d so many years he\u2019d lost any shame he\u2019d once had in it.</p><p>He stared back stonily at the man. \u201cDo you know the names of any of her other callers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus studied the man a moment, and then said without looking at St. John, \u201cTake Mrs. Dews to the carriage, please.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance tensed beside him, but she went without protest as St. John led her from the room. He shut the door behind them.</p><p>Lazarus hadn\u2019t taken his eyes from Faulk the entire time. \u201cNow. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHOULD WE LEAVE him alone with that man?\u201d Temperance whispered anxiously to Mr. St. John.</p><p>He didn\u2019t break stride as he descended the town house steps. \u201cCaire knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Lord Faulk should call more servants? What if he overwhelms Lord Caire?\u201d</p> <p>Mr. St. John handed her into the carriage and then sat across from her. \u201cI expect Caire can handle himself. Besides, it didn\u2019t look like Faulk had any more servants than that half-witted girl.\u201d</p><p>Temperance gazed nervously out the window, not exactly convinced by this vague reassurance.</p><p>\u201cYou worry about him,\u201d St. John said softly.</p><p>She looked at him in surprise. \u201cWell, of course I worry about him.\u201d</p><p>She saw suddenly by the satisfaction on his face that worry had a far more significant meaning for him.</p><p>She looked down at her hands and repeated more softly, \u201cOf course I worry for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one has worried about him for a very long time, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He frowned a little, and she noticed for the first time that his thoughtful gray eyes were rather lovely in a remote sort of way. \u201cI worry about him, but it isn\u2019t the same, is it? I have my own family.\u201d He blinked suddenly and his head jerked as if he\u2019d remembered something. \u201cOr I had one, at least.\u201d</p><p>There was an awkward silence then, for he was obviously suffering from some kind of grief and just as obviously didn\u2019t want to discuss it.</p><p>After a bit she inhaled. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t come out.\u201d</p><p>St. John crossed his arms. \u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know her?\u201d she asked suddenly. \u201cMarie?\u201d</p><p>Mr. St. John\u2019s cheekbones were high and sharp, and she saw them pinken slightly now with flags of color. \u201cNo, I never met her.\u201d The color deepened. \u201cHe kept\u2014keeps\u2014that part of his life well hidden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s never married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He frowned, thinking. \u201cAs far as I know, he\u2019s never even been interested in a respectable woman.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cAt least not until now.\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to examine her hands while her cheeks heated.</p><p>She felt more than saw St. John sit a little forward. \u201cLook here. He may seem hard and cynical and, well, brutal sometimes. But remember, there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s vulnerable. Don\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked up, appalled at the very thought. \u201cI would never hurt him.\u201d</p><p>But he was already shaking his head. \u201cYou say that now, it\u2019s natural, but keep it close to your heart. He can bleed. Don\u2019t make him.\u201d</p><p>The carriage rocked as Lord Caire threw open the door and entered.</p><p>St. John shot her a warning look, then sat back against the squabs. \u201cDid you get what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Caire thumped against the roof and settled himself beside St. John. \u201cFaulk knows of at least three other men.\u201d</p><p>St. John raised his eyebrows doubtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s not much to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more than I had before,\u201d Caire replied.</p><p>St. John scoffed. \u201cAnd how do you propose going about finding these fellows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll inquire,\u201d Caire said loftily.</p><p>\u201cDear God, inquire.\u201d</p><p>They were bickering, but Temperance had the idea that both men enjoyed it, thought they\u2019d die a thousand deaths before admitting it. She looked out the window and half drifted as she thought about what St. John had said earlier. Surely he must be mistaken? How could a man like Caire have any vulnerabilities at all? She glanced at him from under lowered lids. His attention was on some point he was making to St. John, but he caught her look nevertheless. His eyelids drooped and a corner of his mouth curled sensually even as he argued with his friend.</p><p>Temperance caught her breath and hastily looked away. Dear God. If he could affect her with a mere look, surely it was she who should be warned?</p><p>They pulled up at St. John\u2019s house shortly thereafter.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Caire, Mrs. Dews.\u201d St. John nodded.</p><p>Temperance inclined her head.</p><p>\u201cGood night and thank you,\u201d Caire said.</p><p>St. John shrugged. \u201cAny time.\u201d</p><p>The door closed behind him and then the carriage jerked into motion again. Temperance half expected Caire to cross and sit beside her, but he seemed content to watch her from across the carriage. She fidgeted a moment under his eyes, and then a question that had been hovering at the back of her mind for days now tumbled out.</p><p>\u201cDid you know she saw other men?\u201d</p><p>The question was abrupt, she knew, but he had no trouble following her train of thought. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she frowned down at the folds of her cloak, rubbing at a spot on the edge\u2014\u201cshe was your mistress. Surely you expected fidelity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Her voice verged on the strident, but she didn\u2019t moderate it. How could he not care?</p><p>\u201cShe was my paid mistress,\u201d he said coldly, \u201cnothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how often did you see her?\u201d</p><p>He stirred impatiently. \u201cIt was my habit to visit her twice a week.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, a rising tide of some emotion swelling in her breast, threatening to break the barrier of her silence. \u201cYou saw Marie for twice a week for two years. You made love to her hundreds of times\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we did was not making love,\u201d he cut in sharply.</p><p>She waved away the interruption. \u201cYou once said you didn\u2019t love her, but you must have felt something for her.\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone to great trouble and risked your life on more than one occasion to find her killer.\u201d She smacked her open palm against her seat. \u201cShe must\u2019ve meant more to you than a mere mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe I must have loved her?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She leaned forward, enraged for no discernible reason. \u201cI believe that you wanted to love Marie\u2014that you\u2019re enamored by the idea of love\u2014but that you have no concept what love is. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re searching for in St. Giles\u2014some source of emotion, some inkling of what human feeling really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terribly perceptive of you, Mrs. Dews,\u201d he drawled horribly. \u201cYou\u2019ve known me less than a month and you\u2019ve already plumbed the depths of my soul.\u201d</p><p>All her anger left her instantly. \u201cLazarus...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A muscle twitched on his jaw. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cSomething. Anything. Tell me she was the love of your life. Explain to me how it is she was your mistress, but you had no idea she had other lovers or even a brother. Tell me something, Caire. Feel something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d he murmured, apparently unmoved. \u201cPerhaps my actions are on a whim only. Perhaps I\u2019ve never loved another human being in my life. Perhaps I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, feeling wounded, feeling weary. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. All people can love.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed, not at all nicely. \u201cAll? What a very childish thing to say. Do whores love? Do murderers? Tell me, does the man who raped your sister feel love?\u201d</p><p>She was across the carriage before she thought about it, flailing at his neck, shoulder, and face, anywhere she could reach. \u201cStop it! Stop it! Stop it!\u201d</p><p>He caught her flying wrists deftly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know what you want me to say, but I can\u2019t give you that. I can only give you this.\u201d</p><p>And he wrapped his black cape about her like the wings of a bird and kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>King Lockedheart turned to Meg, his eyebrow cocked in challenge.</p><p>But Meg merely said, \u201cThis is not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it, then, fair Meg?\u201d</p><p>Meg\u2019s lips twitched as she hid a smile. \u201cLust, Your Majesty. Your concubines lust after you.\u201d</p><p>The king swore loudly, making the blue bird flutter on her perch. \u201cAway with you again, Meg. And be sure to wear a gown more befitting a throne room when next I call for you.\u201d</p><p>Meg curtsied. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty, but I only have the clothes upon my back and no others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to it that she is properly attired,\u201d King Lockedheart commanded, and once again Meg was led back to the dungeons....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance struggled against Lazarus even as he shoved his tongue into her mouth. Her rage was desperate, baffling, and she wanted to scream and weep at the same time. Why couldn\u2019t he feel? Why couldn\u2019t he love? Why couldn\u2019t he give her what she needed?</p><p>But his mouth was heavy on hers, his lips drugging. She found herself grasping at him instead of trying to free herself. If he would not let her go, then she\u2019d take from him as he took from her.</p><p>She knocked his hat to the floor of the carriage, speared her fingers through the silver threads of his hair, dislodging his ribbon. She loved his hair, gloried in the shining silken strands. She fisted her hands in his hair and tugged, pulling his head back. He groaned as their kiss was broken, then groaned again as she slid her open mouth down his throat. She didn\u2019t care if she was causing him pain. His skin was cool from the night air, salty and sweet. She licked him, tasting, wanting to bite. Wanting to devour this man she could neither let go nor fully possess.</p><p>She opened her mouth over the tendon at the side of his neck and bit down hard.</p><p>He cursed, the sound loud in the carriage. He took her head between his palms as if to forcibly dislodge her, but then abandoned the attack. Instead his hands were suddenly at her skirts, pushing, shoving them upward as he continued to curse steadily.</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders to keep her balance as he jostled her, bringing her legs to either side of his hips. She could feel her skirts up around her waist, but she had her eyes closed, savoring the taste of his flesh in her mouth. He fumbled between their bodies, his hands knocking against her bare inner thighs, and one corner of her mind wondered if he really thought he could accomplish anything in this close space.</p><p>And then she felt his naked erection probing.</p><p>She opened her eyes and reared back, staring at him in shock.</p><p>He watched her, his eyes silently locked with hers as he guided himself between their bodies. She felt as he rubbed her lips, felt as he found her entrance, felt as he lodged his head there.</p><p>Felt as he paused.</p><p>She looked at him, balanced atop his cock, only the barest tip inside her. She was empty and waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou do it,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She blinked, as if coming out of a daze, glancing about them. They were in a moving carriage, for goodness\u2019 sake.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laid one palm against her cheek, turning her face to look at him again. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late for doubts. Stay with me. Put me in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand up until his fingers were right against her feminine flesh.</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>He held her gaze as he deliberately circled the part of herself that was holding him, then moved up and pinched her clitoris between thumb and forefinger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he whispered, a dark, sexual devil. \u201cTemperance, make love to me.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, feeling his cock, large and insistent, those fingers, assured and relentless. This was wrong, so wrong, and it felt so very, very good.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he whispered, sliding his left thumb across her mouth as he rubbed his right against her clitoris.</p> <p>She opened her mouth, licking his thumb.</p><p>\u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>Her hips bucked, once, twice. Her head fell back even as she drenched his penis in her orgasm. She opened her eyes as she came, watching him beneath lowered lids. His face was drawn, his mouth a tight, tortured line.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense,\u201d he said.</p><p>But she was wild now, a being without thought other than to fulfill her body\u2019s desires. She watched him, half smiling, as she swiveled her hips, teasing him and herself.</p> <p>He moaned. \u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>The carriage jolted over a rut in the road, and she let the movement bear her down on him, let him enter her an inch or two.</p><p>But then she immediately lifted so that only his head teased her folds.</p><p>He swore, his upper lip beaded with sweat.</p><p>And she laughed low, the sound like no other she\u2019d ever made in her life. She was possessed, here in this dim carriage, traveling between worlds, on a journey without a clear destination. She arched, bringing him inside again, just a little, and then let him slide entirely from her body.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Temperance.\u201d His voice, normally cool and dispassionate, was ragged.</p> <p>She smiled and leaned forward, rubbing herself against him, using his hard, hot flesh to arouse herself. She bent, tilting her hips, and took his bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>He might\u2019ve sworn then\u2014the words were unintelligible\u2014but his purpose was certainly clear. He grabbed her hips in a firm hand and brought her up, shoving his cock in place with the other hand and bringing her down hard.</p><p>Oh, ecstasy! He filled her, stretching her wide in this position. The feeling was exquisite. She arched, clutching at his shoulders, grinding herself against him, but he wanted something different.</p><p>He slapped her bottom through her skirts. \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>She pouted. \u201cNo.\u201d She liked this, this subtle grinding, this wonderful rubbing.</p><p>\u201cRide me, damn it.\u201d He pressed his thumb against her, and for a moment she saw stars.</p><p>Then he took it away again.</p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d she moaned.</p> <p>\u201cThen ride me. Please.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, this aristocrat, this lord, begging her to bring him pleasure, and decided she would take pity. She rose up on her knees, his length sliding from her, and then brought herself down again.</p><p>He watched her, thumbing her secretly under her skirts as she rode him, jolting hard into him, swiveling, panting, riding him as the carriage bumped through the darkened streets. Each rough jolt, each swaying swerve added to her pace until she was moving on him fast, openmouthed and gasping for air. Galloping toward a finish.</p><p>His face was sheened by sweat, his mouth drawn and strained. The muscles of his neck stood out in ropes of tension, and she saw him swallow as he pressed against her.</p><p>She wanted to tell him\u2014to cry aloud to him\u2014how very much he meant to her. But then she lost her pace, faltered, and fell against him, her body convulsing uncontrollably. Dimly she was aware that he clutched her hips with both hands now, that he was bucking beneath her, driving his length again and again into her open flesh. She sobbed into his shoulder, waiting, her muscles turned to liquid, her center a furnace. He pumped into her without mercy, and she turned her head to watch him, saw when he tilted his face to the ceiling, his mouth open, his teeth bared in a silent bellow.</p><p>His semen flooded her.</p><p>He was arched, his hips tilted up, her knees nearly off the seat as he held himself in her, pumping out his essence.</p><p>And then he suddenly relaxed.</p><p>Her knees bumped down onto the squabs again. His arms came up slowly, as if he were worn out, and crossed behind her back, holding her close. They were still locked together, his softening flesh in her as she laid her head against his shoulder and listened to the sounds of the London night passing by outside.</p><p>SHE WAS A warm weight on his lap, holding his cock still within her soft, slick body.</p><p>Lazarus closed his eyes, inhaling the perfume of their mating. It was an earthy scent, a humble scent, one he would forever associate with her. He ran his palm down her back, feeling the rough wool of the cloak she still wore. They\u2019d made love in a carriage. A corner of his mouth twitched up at the absurdity. He wasn\u2019t a young lordling given to flights of wagered daring, but she seemed to arouse him no matter what the venue.</p><p>She lifted her head and tried to push away from him, but he held her a moment longer. \u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive home soon,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She was right, but he was reluctant to let go. To separate from her. But his flesh was weak. She moved again and he felt himself slide from her depths. He sighed and opened his arms.</p><p>She scrambled from his lap, almost falling as the carriage tilted around a corner.</p><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d He steadied her with a hand, but she soon moved across the carriage and sat on the opposite seat.</p><p>She looked away from him.</p><p>Ah. Mrs. Dews, that reserved matron, was back. He laid his head wearily on the seat.</p><p>\u201cYou need to set yourself to rights,\u201d she said, gesturing at his lap without looking. As if the sight offended her.</p><p>He glanced down. Well, he certainly wasn\u2019t at his proudest, lying limp and damp against the outside of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHave you a kerchief?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>She fished in her sleeve and produced one, holding it out.</p><p>He took it, slowly wrapped the bit of linen around his member, and wiped himself off. He handed the handkerchief back. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, as horrified as if he\u2019d taken a piss in Westminster.</p><p>He would\u2019ve laughed, save that the situation was more tragic than amusing. Why must she be so provincial in her attitude toward lovemaking? He narrowed his eyes. Perhaps her husband had been a prude or otherwise inadequate. It came to him that she\u2019d hardly mentioned the man at all, though she professed to have loved him. He opened his mouth to ask her about the dead man, but the carriage shuddered to a halt. He glanced out the window and saw that they\u2019d drawn up at the end of Maiden Lane.</p><p>She was already scrambling to leave him.</p><p>He rose.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cI can get out by myself.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his lips into a thin smile. \u201cI have no doubt that you can, but I intend to walk you to your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but...\u201d Her protest died when she saw his face. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>After that she descended quietly.</p><p>He took her arm as soon as he made the street, not confident that she wouldn\u2019t simply flee ahead. They walked to her door silently, and by the time they made it, he was in a rage, though he couldn\u2019t pinpoint why. She turned as soon as they were abreast of the home, intending, it seemed, to enter without even bidding him good night.</p><p>Something snapped. He muttered a curse before hauling her around and slamming his mouth down on hers. This was what he wanted; this was what tamed the beast within him: her soft lips, the quiet sound of her moan as he licked across them. There was a desperate, animal need within him, one he couldn\u2019t fully identify. One he couldn\u2019t understand rationally. It was tearing him apart from within, this need. It wanted her\u2014something from her\u2014though he didn\u2019t know quite what. He only knew that if this terrible need was not assuaged, he very much feared he might lose something within himself. It was a confusing thought, and as he raised his head, he saw that her face revealed her confusion as well. Perhaps she, too, was in the grip of something terrible that she could not define. She opened her mouth as if wanting to say something.</p><p>But in the end, she turned away without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he pleaded, for what he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She stopped, her back to him. \u201cI... I can\u2019t. Good night.\u201d</p><p>And she rapped on the door to her home.</p><p>Christ\u2019s bloody body! He turned away, kicking at the uneven paving stones. They couldn\u2019t go on like this. One of them would break, and he wasn\u2019t sure which would be worse: him or her.</p><p>The return carriage ride was long and wearisome. By the time he made his own town house, the clocks had already chimed the midnight hour. He gave his hat, cloak, and stick to the butler and was already walking toward the stairs when the man cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, you have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus turned and stared at his butler.</p><p>The butler bowed. \u201cLady Caire is in the library.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus strode to the library, some nameless trepidation making his heart beat quickly. He opened the door and saw her at once. She lounged on a settee, her shimmering lake-blue skirts spread about her, her head slumped onto her shoulder. She\u2019d fallen asleep waiting for him.</p><p>He approached the settee on the balls of his feet, oddly hesitant to wake her. When was the last time he\u2019d examined her unobserved? Years, perhaps, or more likely decades. She was beautiful; she always had been and she always would be. The bones of her face were fine and aristocratic, but he noticed now a slight softening of her jawline, a tiny drooping of her upper eyelids. He bent closer to look for other changes and inhaled the scent of oranges. Her scent. She\u2019d always worn it, and it brought back memories of the nursery. Of her coming to visit when he ate his tea when he was seven or eight. Of her kissing his cheek before she left.</p><p>She stirred and he hurriedly stepped back.</p><p>\u201cLazarus.\u201d She opened those sharp blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019d ask you where you\u2019ve been if I did not fear to hear the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d He propped a shoulder on the mantel. \u201cTo what do I owe this visit?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, arch and flirtatious, but he thought he saw her lips tremble. \u201cCan\u2019t a mother drop in on her son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. If you\u2019ve only come to play, you\u2019ll excuse me if I seek my bed instead.\u201d He turned toward the door, but her voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cLazarus. Please.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. The smile was gone now, and her lips did definitely tremble.</p><p>She inhaled as if bracing herself. \u201cHave you any wine?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her another moment and then sighed. Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour or his own weariness, but he could use a drink as well, though not of wine. He crossed to the decanter and poured them each a glass of brandy.</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember you preferring this instead.\u201d He handed her a glass.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d She took the glass with both hands, looking startled. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, taking a seat across from her. \u201cI think I saw you one night in Father\u2019s study.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows but did not comment. For a moment, they both sipped their brandy in silence.</p><p>Finally she cleared her throat. \u201cYou took that woman to Lady Stanwicke\u2019s ball.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her over his glass. Her tone had been very neutral. \u201cHer name is Temperance Dews. She runs a foundling home in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA foundling home?\u201d She glanced up quickly. \u201cFor children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She was gazing at her glass now with pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you come for, Mother?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>He expected her usual dramatic outrage. Perhaps some cutting sarcasm. Instead she was silent for a time.</p><p>Then she said, \u201cI loved her, you know.\u201d</p><p>And he knew that she was talking about Annelise, dead a quarter of a century.</p><p>\u201cI miscarried three times,\u201d his mother said low. \u201cOnce before you were born and twice before Annelise was born.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He eyed her sharply. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course not. You were a child, and we were not a particularly close family.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother replying to that.</p><p>She continued. \u201cSo when Annelise was born, she was very dear to my heart. Your father, of course, had no need of a girl child, but that was just as well.\u201d She glanced up quickly at him and then down again at her glass. \u201cHe\u2019d taken you away from me when you were but a baby, made you his own, as it were. His heir. So I made Annelise my own. Her wet nurse lived in the house, and I visited her every day. Several times a day if I could.\u201d</p> <p>She took a long sip of brandy, closing her eyes.</p><p>Lazarus didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t remember this, but then he\u2019d been a child and only interested in matters that impacted his own small world.</p><p>\u201cWhen she became ill...\u201d She stopped and cleared her throat. \u201cWhen Annelise became ill that last time, I begged your father to send for a doctor. When he refused, I should\u2019ve sent for one myself. I know that. But he was adamant... and he was your father. You remember how he was.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, he remembered well how Father was. Hard. Mean. Completely assured of both his own invincibility and his own correctness. And cold, so very cold.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI thought you should know.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him as if waiting for something, and he stared back, mute, because he wasn\u2019t sure if he was ready\u2014if he\u2019d ever be ready\u2014to give it to her.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d His mother drained her glass and set it on a table before rising. She smiled brilliantly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s very late and I must be getting home. Tomorrow I have a fitting for a new gown and then an afternoon tea to attend, and I must get some sleep if I\u2019m to look my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Lazarus.\u201d She turned to the door, but then hesitated before looking at him over her shoulder. \u201cPlease remember that just because love isn\u2019t expressed doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t felt.\u201d</p><p>She swept from the room before he could reply.</p><p>Lazarus reseated himself and watched as he swirled the last of the brandy in his glass, remembering a little girl\u2019s brown eyes and the scent of oranges.</p> <p>SHE COULDN\u2019T GO on like this.</p><p>Silence pretended sleep as she watched her husband rise. They\u2019d slept in the same bed last night, but it might as well have been separate houses. William had lain as still as a corpse on the far side of the bed, so near the edge she\u2019d thought he might fall off in the night. When she\u2019d carefully inched over to lie against him in the dark, his entire body had stiffened, and fearing he really would fall, she\u2019d rolled back to her own side, hurt.</p><p>But it had taken her many hours to finally sleep.</p><p>Now she watched as he shaved and dressed without ever looking her way. Something shriveled and died inside her. His ship\u2019s cargo had reappeared just as suddenly as it had disappeared. The ship\u2019s owner was overjoyed, William was no longer in peril of being sent to prison for theft, and he\u2019d finally received his pay.</p><p>They should have been happy.</p><p>Instead, despair hovered over their little home like an insidious mist.</p><p>William buckled his shoes and left the bedroom, closing the door softly behind him. Silence waited a moment and then rose herself, hurriedly tiptoeing about the room to dress. Yesterday he\u2019d left without saying good-bye. And, indeed, when she came out of the bedroom, he already had his hat on.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019d hoped to make you breakfast,\u201d she said in a rush.</p><p>He shook his head without looking at her. \u201cNo need. I have business this morning anyway.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been at sea for over six months. Probably he did indeed have business, but at seven of the clock?</p><p>\u201cHe never touched me,\u201d she said low. \u201cI vow on my mother\u2019s grave, he never touched me. I swear... I swear on...\u201d</p><p>She looked wildly around the room and ran to pick up the Bible her father had given her as a little girl. \u201cI swear, William, on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d In two strides he was beside her, finally. He gently took the Bible from her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him helplessly. She\u2019d told him again and again, but each time he merely looked away from her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cHe took me to his bedroom and told me that if I spent the night in his bed, then in the morning he would return the cargo. He promised he would not touch me, and he did not. He did not, William! He slept on a chair by the fire the entire night.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, mutely urging him to acknowledge her, to turn and kiss her and pat her on the cheek and say what a silly misunderstanding this all was. To be her William again.</p><p>Instead he turned his face away from her.</p><p>\u201cOh, why can\u2019t you believe me?\u201d she cried.</p><p>He shook his head, his weariness more chilling than anger would\u2019ve been. \u201cMickey O\u2019Connor is a notorious scoundrel without a scrap of decency or pity, Silence. I don\u2019t blame you. I just wish you had let me handle this.\u201d He looked at her finally, and to her horror, she saw that his eyes swam with tears. \u201cI wish to God you\u2019d never gone there.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the door and jerked it open.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me if you loved me,\u201d she cried.</p><p>He halted, still and silent.</p><p>\u201cI told him you did,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He walked out without answering and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Silence stared at her hands and then around the small, old room. She\u2019d thought it homey once. Now it merely seemed dreary. She sat abruptly on a straight-backed chair. When she\u2019d told Charming Mickey that her husband did indeed love her, he\u2019d simply smiled and replied, If he loves you, he will believe you.</p><p>What a fool she was.</p><p>What a fool.</p><p>HE\u2019D NEVER REALLY allowed himself to examine why he sought Marie\u2019s killer, Lazarus reflected as he paced through the darkening streets the next night. St. John had told him he was obsessed, and Temperance had accused him of believing he was in love with Marie when he had no idea what love was, but was either right? Perhaps he simply was on a quixotic quest for no discernible reason. Perhaps his life was so barren that the violent death of a mistress was a welcome excitement.</p><p>Depressing thought.</p><p>She\u2019d been seeing other men while living at his expense. The knowledge should\u2019ve shocked him, made him angry, but his only emotion was curiosity: Had she needed more money than his generous allowance? Or had she needed the sexual coupling?</p><p>He stepped around a near-skeletal man, passed out or perhaps dead in the street. He was nearing St. Giles. The street was becoming narrower, more filthy and wretched. The channel in the middle of the street was clogged with noxious debris, the stench a miasma that seemed to cling to the skin.</p><p>He\u2019d already found one of the men Faulk had named, a thin weaselly fellow who\u2019d never once met his eyes as they\u2019d talked. He couldn\u2019t help but think the man needed to tie up his women in order to get the courage to become aroused. The thought was repugnant. Was that what he was? A coward unable to look a woman in the eye as he bedded her?</p><p>Except he could look Temperance in the eyes. He didn\u2019t need the ropes and hood with her. She was a kind of freedom for him. A pleasant sort of normalcy.</p><p>Perhaps that was why his feet guided him to her even now.</p><p>Night had fallen fully, black and ominous, by the time he entered St. Giles proper. Lazarus grasped his stick more firmly, aware that he\u2019d been attacked three times now in this area. He\u2019d been intent on the hunt, on following the trail of blood, but perhaps he should look more closely at where and when he\u2019d been attacked.</p><p>On why he\u2019d been attacked.</p><p>Up ahead, a gang of men emerged around the corner. Lazarus faded back into a side alley and watched their approach warily. They were arguing over a gold watch and a curled wig\u2014they\u2019d obviously already preyed on at least one unlucky gentleman tonight.</p><p>Lazarus waited a moment after their voices had died into the night and then continued.</p><p>Ten minutes more and he stood outside Temperance\u2019s kitchen door. The hour was late. He hesitated a moment, straining to listen for any sounds from within. When he could make out none, he twisted apart his stick, drawing out his short sword. He inserted the blade in the crack between the door and the frame. A moment of careful maneuvering and he\u2019d lifted the bar.</p><p>Easing the door open, he glided inside and rebarred it. The kitchen fire was banked for the night. Perhaps she\u2019d already gone to bed. He could sneak up the stairs, but he had no idea which room was hers. The risk of alarming the house was too big. Besides, a teapot sat on the table, a small, pitiful tin of tea beside it. Perhaps she meant to return for her midnight cup of tea.</p><p>He entered her little sitting room as he had on that first night he\u2019d met her. The grate was cold, and he knelt to lay a fire, returning briefly to the kitchen for a spill. Then he sat and waited like a lovelorn swain. Lazarus laughed lightly under his breath. Wasn\u2019t that what he was? A suitor waiting in bitter hope that his lady would grace him with her presence? It wasn\u2019t even about the sex. He simply wanted to be with her. To watch the expressions flit across those extraordinary golden eyes. To listen to her voice.</p><p>Oh, he was pitiful.</p><p>He heard rustlings from the kitchen and he tilted his head, closing his eyes to listen. Was it her out there? He imagined so, seeing in his mind\u2019s eye her pulling the kettle from the hearth and pouring the water over the tea leaves. He sat inert and called to her silently, his whole body longing for her.</p><p>The door creaked and he opened his eyes to see her staring at him. He smiled like a fool; he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, quite obviously nonplussed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling on you,\u201d he replied. \u201cI fear I need to go into St. Giles tonight, and I need you with me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment and then turned back into the kitchen. He followed to find her already putting on a cloak. \u201cWhy do you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I plan to go back to Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned at him over the ties to her cloak. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there twice; surely we\u2019ve learned all we can there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d He ran a finger along the worn wooden kitchen table. \u201cExcept that I went to see one of Marie\u2019s lovers. He says he met Marie at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s gin house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stared at him. \u201cBut Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease acted as if she\u2019d never met Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps she hadn\u2019t.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cStill, I find it very odd that Marie would have patronized her gin shop. Marie catered to gentlemen. Had you asked me before she died, I would\u2019ve said she wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a place like Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very odd.\u201d She walked to the bottom of the stairs and called softly, \u201cMary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>A thump and then the patter of feet came from above.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Martha Swan,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked a question at him.</p><p>He smiled whimsically. \u201cI know it sounds daft, but think: Why were we attacked at Martha Swan\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cTo keep us from talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was already dead.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit together, but Mary Whitsun appeared at that moment in her night rail. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d The girl looked uncertainly between him and Temperance.</p><p>\u201cBar the door behind me, please,\u201d Temperance said. \u201cAnd then go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded and in another moment they were in the alley.</p><p>The wind caught the edge of Temperance\u2019s cloak and sent it billowing about her. \u201cIf not to keep us from talking to Martha Swan, then why the attack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He set a quick pace, making sure to keep her close to his side. \u201cPerhaps someone at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s saw us there. Someone who didn\u2019t want us to investigate. Perhaps Marie met whoever this person is at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a doubtful look. \u201cOr perhaps this is all just coincidence.\u201d</p><p>They walked the rest of the way in silence. Lazarus was damnably aware of Temperance\u2019s heat next to him, of her vulnerability. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have brought her along, but the more he thought about it, the more sure he was: The answer somehow lay at Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s gin shop. And Temperance was his key to getting people to talk there.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they entered the dingy room, and at first the shop seemed the same as the first two times they\u2019d been there. The gin shop was crowded and hot, the fire wasn\u2019t drawing well, and smoke hung about the blackened rafters. Lazarus began pushing his way to the back, toward Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s rooms.</p> <p>Temperance caught his arm, halting him. He bent down so she could murmur close, \u201cSomething\u2019s not right. The room is too quiet.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head to see that she was right. There was no drunken singing from the table of sailors in the corner, no arguments or loud discussions from the rest of the company. In fact, the customers huddled together. No one met his eyes.</p><p>Lazarus looked at Temperance. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her beautiful golden-flecked eyes puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The one-eyed serving girl emerged from the curtained back hall. Before the curtain fell, Lazarus counted three men in the hall. What had made Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease triple her guard? The girl\u2019s head was down, her face tear-streaked. She caught sight of them and ducked her head, sidling to the side.</p> <p>Temperance hurried to her without any urging from Lazarus. He watched as she seemed to plead with the girl, following as she shook her head and turned away. Temperance laid a hand on the barmaid and the girl shook it off, saying something sharply. Temperance straightened abruptly, her eyes wide.</p><p>Lazarus was at her side in a second. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>Temperance led him back outside the gin shop, looking fearfully around. He drew her close, under his cloak, wrapping his arms about her. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her face a pale oval in the night. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t even discuss Marie. There\u2019s been another murder\u2014a prostitute. She was found bound to her bed and her belly...\u201d She gasped, unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His heart was beating fast, his senses alert to every tiny movement, every small sound in their vicinity. \u201cI have to get you back to the home.\u201d</p> <p>She clutched at him. \u201cThey\u2019re saying it was the Ghost of St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome think him a phantom, some think him a real man, but in either case they believe he\u2019s the murderer.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and began walking. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know. There\u2019s speculation that he\u2019s seeking revenge of some sort, that he\u2019s been sent to punish the sinful or that he simply enjoys killing.\u201d She shivered again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, does it? If he was the murderer, if he wanted us dead, he wouldn\u2019t have joined you in defeating those attackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>It was another ten minutes before they were at her door again, and Lazarus was never so happy to see the home. When she unlocked the door, he followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>He watched as she filled her little kettle and hung it over the hearth before stirring up the banked fire. \u201cWhat evidence is there that the Ghost is the murderer? Did the barmaid say?\u201d</p> <p>She shot him a perplexed look as she set out her tea things. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem to know. She was just repeating what everyone else said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the kitchen table. \u201cI wonder, then, if someone is spreading this rumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIn any case, I can no longer take you into St. Giles. Not while this murderer is at large.\u201d</p><p>She nodded silently, her brows knit at his pronouncement. Was she that docile to his command, or would she disobey him later? The thought made him restless\u2014that he had no real power over this woman. She could do as she pleased no matter what he thought or how he worried.</p><p>The kettle came to a boil after a bit and she filled her teapot. He followed her into her little sitting room, squatting to make up the fire there as she sat on her stool. Then he lounged in the chair and watched, ridiculously content, as she poured herself a cup of tea and added sugar. It occurred to him that he wouldn\u2019t mind spending every evening for the rest of his life thus, watching her take her first sip of hot tea, considering the way she half closed her eyes in relaxation.</p><p>\u201cHow is your sister?\u201d he asked after a bit.</p><p>She looked up quickly, perhaps surprised, and that irritated him.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cSilence, I think? Has she recovered from her confrontation with O\u2019Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from her at all. Winter won\u2019t talk to me; he simply goes about his work without discussing anything. Concord is quite angry\u2014or perhaps disapproving is a better word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the children?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow fare they?\u201d</p><p>She cradled her cup between her hands. \u201cMostly they seem the same as usual. Mary Whitsun follows me about the house like a shadow, though, as if she fears I\u2019ll disappear if she loses sight of me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, unsure of what to say to all this. His experience with families\u2014indeed, with feelings\u2014was woefully inadequate.</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cAnd you? How is your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as good as new.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for several seconds, and then she asked quietly, \u201cWhy do you think Marie never told you about her brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because I never asked her about her family.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that we hardly talked at all. There wasn\u2019t a need to in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when you saw her, you\u2019d simply...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Yes.\u201d He watched her, waiting for her revulsion. \u201cI didn\u2019t want or need anything else from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He inhaled. \u201cFrom you I want much, much more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Now Meg sat all alone in her tiny dungeon cell that day, for no one came to visit her. She busied herself tidying the cell and then washed herself in the bucket of water and combed out her long golden hair. She\u2019d almost resigned herself to going to bed when there was a tap at the door to her cell. In came three lady\u2019s maids and one very elegant hairdresser, and before she knew it, Meg was arrayed in a sparkling blue gown, her hair dressed with pearls, and fine heeled slippers on her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what is the meaning of this?\u201d she cried in astonishment.</p><p>The hairdresser bowed and replied, \u201cTonight you are to dine with the king himself.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Temperance watched him, this exotic creature, this man from a foreign world, saying that he wanted more from her. How much more? She wanted to ask but feared the answer.</p><p>So instead she set down her teacup. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, staring into the flames of the fire. He seemed content with their pact, whatever it was, but she felt heat unfurling in her belly. She wanted more as well.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me about your family.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head irritably. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve told you about my sister, about my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not about your father,\u201d she said in a low voice. She didn\u2019t know where it came from, this sudden need to know all his secrets. Perhaps it was the knowledge that a murderer stalked the streets of St. Giles; perhaps it was the subtle brush with death. All she knew was that she wanted to know him, this man she\u2019d taken into her body.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cMy father was an aristocrat. There\u2019s nothing more to tell of him.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, watching him. His eyes were back on the fire, and there was quite obviously much more to tell.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, startled. \u201cHe was... a big man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaller than you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He frowned. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. I was taller by the time I returned from Oxford. He just seemed... large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cBut you want more from me,\u201d she said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I, in turn, want more from you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled crookedly. \u201cYou drive a hard bargain, Mrs. Dews. What do you want to know of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to know everything,\u201d she said boldly.</p><p>\u201cAh, can anyone ever know everything about another person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said, rising.</p><p>He stilled, watching as she took two steps to stand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cProbably we remain separate, lonely individuals for all of our lives,\u201d she murmured, perching on his spread knee. She touched the folds of his neckcloth and then began unwrapping it. \u201cWe can never know another truly. Isn\u2019t that what you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have,\u201d she mocked gently. \u201cYou\u2019re a gentleman of intellect, a very cynical one. I think you spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about the world and how very alone you are in it.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, his Adam\u2019s apple moving beneath her fingers. \u201cAren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She flicked a look at him, then concentrated on slipping off his neckcloth. \u201cIs that why you tie them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk. I never thought you a coward, Lazarus.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and closed his eyes. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She began on the buttons of his waistcoat. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why you tie them, or you don\u2019t want to admit it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very stern you are, madam.\u201d His voice held a hint of warning.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded, her eyes on her work. \u201cBut I think I would never get any answer from you otherwise. Does their nearness give you pain? Does the thought of how apart you are from them\u2014from everyone\u2014cause you the anguish you feel when others touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour perception terrifies me.\u201d He helped her remove his waistcoat. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I feel pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the pain physical or mental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she began to unbutton his shirt. She could feel the heat of his skin, and his dark chest hair was shadowy beneath the fine linen. She felt her insides clench. \u201cThen perhaps you tie them so they will not cause you pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\u201d\u2014she lifted her eyes to meet his\u2014\u201cperhaps you tie them so that you have no need to acknowledge their humanity.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that make me the devil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>His eyes slid away from hers.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of their gaze? Is that what the blindfold is for? So you can\u2019t see their eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t wish them to see my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t want them to see the black at the center of my soul.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his amazing blue eyes a moment, and he let her as if he was telling her something silently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tie me.\u201d She felt her pulse speed. She wanted to take off his shirt, but then again, she had no wish to cause him pain. She smoothed her hands over the linen, feeling his warm muscles beneath. He had a lovely chest, broad and fine, the mounds of his shoulders flowing smoothly into the bunched muscles of his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because I\u2019m more important than those others or less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Most definitely.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, watching her hands on him. The thought that she was important to him made tears prick in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAm I more important to you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Of course he was. But she brushed aside the question. She was interested in his vulnerabilities, not her own. \u201cDoes this pain you? If I touch you through the cloth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and softly kissed his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI answer your questions, but you don\u2019t answer mine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not yet. Don\u2019t push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d His question was cut off as she leaned forward and delicately licked one nipple through his shirt.</p><p>He inhaled. \u201cI\u2019ll need to know someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d She traced around his nipple with her tongue. The wet fabric was nearly transparent, and she could see the brown nipple beneath his shirt.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push.\u201d She held the shirt flat against his chest to more clearly see him. His puckered nipple made a tiny peak.</p><p>\u201cAs you push me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I pushing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost assuredly.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on a strand of his hair in reprimand.</p> <p>He grunted. \u201cDo you ask yourself why you have a need to push me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She traced downward to lay her hands flat against his belly. It felt firm and hot.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She was distracted for a moment by the waistband of his breeches and the fall beneath.</p><p>\u201cTemperance...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She slid off his lap and to her knees between his legs. She flicked open the buttons of his breeches. \u201cDo you feel pain now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he murmured. He seemed enthralled by the sight of her fingers working at the opening to his breeches. Beneath, his erection strained at the cloth. Her mouth was dry, anticipating the sight.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to let him go that easily. \u201cLazarus? Am I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are, it is exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said as she laid his breeches open. His cock was tenting the front of his smallclothes. \u201cLazarus...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he answered. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her hands about his penis inside his smallclothes. She glanced up at him under her eyelashes. \u201cWould you like to tie me sometime?\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if awakening from a daze, his eyes growing wary. \u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who lies?\u201d she murmured as she gently squeezed, testing his hardness. \u201cWould it hurt you if I took this out and touched it?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled. \u201cI think I could bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His husky plea decided her. Carefully, delicately, she unbuttoned his smallclothes and pulled back the flaps. And then she simply looked.</p><p>He was truly magnificent, sitting in her worn armchair, his legs spread, his penis enormously erect. The fact that he still wore his shirt and breeches, hose and shoes, made the sight of his black pubic hair and ruddy cock all the more arousing. The sight was shockingly intimate. He looked like a king, arrogant and sure of his power.</p><p>\u201cI love to look at you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d he whispered, his voice a deep male purr.</p><p>She glanced up at him and at the same time wrapped her hand about his cock. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you wouldn\u2019t want me spread upon your bed? Powerless, helpless to your desire?\u201d</p><p>His eyes had half closed, his cheeks flushed with sexual hunger. \u201cI... I... perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d she murmured, her attention drawn back to the prize in her hands. Truth be told, her interest in the game had waned. \u201cI\u2019ve never known you to be uncertain as to your wants. Your desires.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed very carefully, feeling the softness of his skin, the iron hardness underneath.</p><p>He gasped, arching his hips so that his cock thrust into her hands. \u201cDamn it. Put it in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, a little shocked. She\u2019d never done such a thing before. She stroked her finger over the tip of his penis, where a tiny slit leaked liquid. What would that liquid taste like in her mouth?</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he said, his voice very deep and very clear in the quiet room. \u201cSuck me.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head and stuck out her tongue hesitantly. And licked. She wrinkled her nose. It was salt and musk, not unpleasant, but not what she\u2019d expected either.</p><p>Above her, he moaned. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Oh, to hear him beg. There was something in her, something wicked and base that lapped up that plea in his voice. She opened her mouth and placed the head of his cock inside.</p><p>Sucked.</p><p>His hips jerked, jamming his cock farther into her mouth. She almost backed off, but then she held him more firmly and flattened her tongue against him, sucking gently. His hands came up, stroking her head. She felt him take the pins from her hair, wrapping his hands in the locks, pulling gently. She wasn\u2019t sure he even knew what he did. She leaned back a little, letting him slide from her mouth so she could look up at him.</p><p>He was watching her.</p><p>The knowledge made her wet. She laid her tongue against him and, locking her eyes with his, licked all the way around the head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d His jaw gritted, flexing in the firelight.</p><p>She stroked down on his penis and opened her lips about him, sucking gently on the very tip.</p><p>His face was strained, the muscles standing out on his arms. \u201cTake it deeper.\u201d</p><p>And she did, swallowing as much of him as she could, her eyes still on his even as his hips moved under her. He covered her hand with his own to help her stroke faster.</p><p>He was gasping now, his cheeks furrowed, his face flushed. \u201cDo you want it?\u201d he whispered. \u201cStop now if you can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t talk\u2014her mouth was full of his cock\u2014but she wanted to see this. Wanted to bring him to the inevitable end. She watched him as she felt his cock swell in her mouth. Watched him as his hand jerked powerfully on his length. Watched him as he bared his teeth.</p><p>\u201cAh, God!\u201d</p><p>She tasted salt and warmth. Felt tears fill her eyes as he spasmed helplessly. He was big and strong, but she\u2019d brought him to this point.</p><p>She licked him as he softened, feeling tender, feeling somehow lost.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he ordered, and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He tucked her head under his chin, and they lay there for long moments as he stroked her hair. Then he began to pull her skirts up. Wordlessly, relentlessly, he uncovered her limbs until she lay sprawled on him, the fabric of her skirts around her waist.</p><p>He looked down and she followed his gaze. Her dark curls were a shocking contrast to the whiteness of her skin. She wasn\u2019t used to this, to a man examining her in the firelight, and she started to pull down her skirts to cover her nudity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He stayed her hand, his eyes meeting hers in command. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but the movement was weak.</p><p>He moved his hand to the juncture of her thighs, and she turned her head, hiding her face in his shoulder. She felt him pet her, stroking through her curls.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She complied, swallowing shallowly, waiting for his touch.</p><p>It was so delicate when it came that she almost missed it. He skimmed her inner thighs, up close to where her center waited for him. But then he skirted up, around her mound, touching only the edges of her hair.</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and raised her head.</p><p>His big hand lay over her mound, his fingers spread possessively.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look away or I\u2019ll stop,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She swallowed, watching as his fingers slowly slipped down to her far lips. He widened them, spreading her lips, revealing the deep rose within and her own embarrassing moisture.</p><p>\u201cSo soft,\u201d he said, and ran his forefinger through her folds.</p><p>She was panting now, watching as his finger reached her apex and circled around her nub. Gently, he tapped her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She wanted to shake her head, to look away, but if she did, he would stop and the mere thought was enough to make her think she\u2019d die.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he whispered, deep and intimate, \u201ctell me if you like this.\u201d He pressed gently, not quite hard enough. \u201cTemperance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cHarder. Touch me harder.\u201d</p><p>He pressed again. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Oh, glorious bliss! Her hips rose of their own accord. She nodded jerkily.</p><p>He circled against her, using that exact amount of pressure. \u201cNow watch. Keep your eyes open and on my hand or I\u2019ll stop. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, mesmerized by that finger, growing steadily slicker with her own moisture. He ministered to her in the quiet of her sitting room, the only sounds her ragged breathing and the small liquid noises his hand made against her flesh. He rubbed faster and faster until her eyelids were heavy, until it was a herculean struggle to keep them open. She was afire, warmth and sweet pleasure radiating from her center.</p><p>And suddenly his hand twisted.</p><p>Her eyes opened wide as she watched him insert two fingers deep into her, and she gasped at the feeling and the sight. He brought his thumb down on her at the same time and she broke apart. The fire spreading through her limbs, her head thrown back, her vision blurring even as she still watched him work her flesh. Dear Lord, she\u2019d never felt so wanton. She was trembling in his arms, her legs flexing, and still he shoved his fingers into her, spreading them apart, twisting them inside of her.</p><p>His other hand turned her head, and he was kissing her suddenly. His mouth open and wet as those clever fingers of his slowed.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he gasped against her. \u201cI need you. I need you now.\u201d</p><p>He was lifting her, bringing her legs around, positioning her like a rag doll for his own pleasure, because she certainly could no longer move.</p><p>He rose, holding her, and reversed their positions, laying her back in the big armchair, her bottom on the very edge of the seat, her feet on the floor. He crouched before her, and she saw that his erection was enormous. She watched as he took it in one hand and brought it between her legs. He pushed his shoulders underneath her spread legs and straightened, bringing them up so that she was helplessly draped across him.</p><p>He positioned his cock at her entrance, his mouth open and panting, and she watched him as he shoved himself inside her. His head was arched back as if he suffered some unbearable pain. As if he were about to expire.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he panted. \u201cI can\u2019t... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>And he began pounding into her, shoving her back into the chair, clutching her legs against his chest so that she had no purchase, no way of defending herself against his assault.</p><p>Not that she wanted to.</p><p>The feel of him filling her repeatedly, just after her exquisite release at his hand, brought the warmth rushing back immediately. She crashed, wave after wave of pleasure beating against her, overwhelming her senses. She was only dimly aware of him straightening on his knees, still locked to her, bringing her bottom entirely off the chair as he slammed himself into her fully. He held her there as he spilled himself into her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His big hands were on her bottom, spread and holding her. He ground himself into her as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of her, as if he wanted to stay locked with her forever. But he was only a man after all. He slumped forward, somehow managing to bring her down gently. He disentangled her legs from his shoulders and then laid his head next to hers in the chair seat.</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d he murmured, big and heavy and satiated on her. \u201cTemperance.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the ceiling of her little sitting room and knew she had to find the words to tell him what he meant to her. Knew she would lose him if she couldn\u2019t let the words leave her lips, however painful and hard it was for her. She stood at a crossroads, and to make no decision was to lose everything instead. Tomorrow. Tomorrow she would find the way.</p><p>Tonight she simply closed her eyes.</p> <p>TEMPERANCE WOKE EARLY the next morning and lay staring at the ceiling in her tiny lonely bedroom. She didn\u2019t want to rise. Her bedroom was up under the eaves. This high in the home, there were only three rooms\u2014hers, Winter\u2019s, and the one Nell slept in when she wasn\u2019t watching over the nursery at night. The rooms were cramped with low, sloping roofs. When it rained, a corner of her room leaked. In winter she was cold, and in summer it was abominably hot.</p><p>Dear God, sometimes she wished she could simply fly away. Perhaps that was why she\u2019d indulged in those dangerous interludes with Caire, risking not only pregnancy and a bastard child, but also her very soul. He was a temptation she seemed to have no defense against. Perhaps after all these years of fighting her very nature, it had finally become a moot point. Perhaps the fight itself was never really winnable. Perhaps\u2014</p><p>A thump came from the room next to hers\u2014Winter\u2019s room. Temperance frowned and started to rise.</p><p>Something crashed next door.</p><p>She ran from her room. Winter\u2019s door was shut, of course, so she rapped on it. \u201cBrother?\u201d</p> <p>No answer.</p><p>She rapped harder and when there was still no sound from within, she balled her hand into a fist and pounded. \u201cWinter! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She tried the door handle, but it was locked. His bedroom was the only room in the house where Winter might find a measure of privacy. She was just beginning to wonder how she might break the door down when it swung suddenly inward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Winter stood in the doorway, but despite his soothing words, all was manifestly not right. Blood streaked his pasty face, running from a gash on his forehead, and he swayed where he stood.</p><p>Temperance wrapped her arms about her brother\u2019s waist to keep him from falling. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand to his face and then seemed startled when he saw the blood on his fingers. \u201cI... I believe I fell.\u201d</p> <p>His hesitant tone alarmed her more. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem...\u201d He trailed off and looked about his tiny, cell-like room. \u201cPerhaps I should sit down.\u201d</p><p>She helped him to sit on his bed\u2014there was no room for even a chair\u2014then stood over him anxiously. \u201cAre you ill? When did you last eat?\u201d</p><p>She tried to lay the back of her hand on his forehead, but with uncharacteristic irritation, he brushed her away. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine; I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell down and can\u2019t remember why?\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cWhat did you eat for dinner last night?\u201d</p><p>His forehead creased. \u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Winter! Did you eat anything at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps some broth,\u201d he said, not meeting her eyes.</p> <p>Temperance sighed. Winter had never learned how to lie effectively. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll fetch some breakfast and bandages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the school,\u201d he said fretfully. \u201cI must open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pushed him back onto his bed, for he\u2019d tried to rise again. \u201cThe school can close for one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll lose the tuition,\u201d he said.</p><p>Temperance stared at him. It was true; if the school was not opened, then the students did not pay tuition for that day. \u201cSurely we can afford one day closed?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his complexion almost as white as his pillow. \u201cWe\u2019ve used nearly all the money Lord Caire gave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe owed the butcher and baker,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand we hadn\u2019t paid the cobbler for the boys\u2019 shoes this last November.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked about the small room, but there was no one else to make the decision for her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Just don\u2019t try to get up. Promise me, Winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded, and, indeed, his eyes were already closed when she left the room.</p><p>Dear God, she\u2019d known they were in desperate straits, but she\u2019d had no idea the depths to which they\u2019d fallen. Temperance hurried down the stairs, trying to order her priorities, but she kept coming back to the fact that Winter was ill, and she just couldn\u2019t run the home without him.</p><p>She walked into the big old kitchen, her mind in turmoil, but stopped when she saw who was within.</p><p>Polly stood next to Nell, and both women\u2019s faces were fearful. Mary Whitsun huddled in a corner, her little face white. Polly held a still bundle in her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Temperance whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Polly said. \u201cShe was suckling fine and then last night...\u201d She pulled back a corner of the blanket. Mary Hope was within, her tiny face red and shining with moisture.</p><p>Polly looked up, her face white. \u201cShe has the fever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>That night, Meg was led into a magnificent dining room. A feast was laid there, but the only one who sat at the table was the king with his little blue bird in its golden cage at his elbow.</p><p>The king dismissed the guards and indicated a chair at his right hand. \u201cCome sit by me, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Meg sat very carefully so as not to harm her lovely dress.</p><p>\u201cNow, Meg,\u201d King Lockedheart said as he took a gold plate and set meat and sugared fruit upon it.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><p>The king set the plate he had filled with his own hands before her. \u201cI wish to know what love is.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>\u201cThe lighter wood, I think,\u201d Lazarus said consideringly early that afternoon. \u201cWith the ivory inlay.\u201d</p><p>He and Mr. Kirk, the piano maker, were in his study. Mr. Kirk had brought half a dozen different wooden boards, each intricately decorated. Lazarus ran his hand over the sample he\u2019d chosen. It was feminine without being overornamented.</p><p>Like Temperance.</p><p>\u201cA very nice choice, my lord.\u201d Mr. Kirk gathered his samples into an especially made case. \u201cI believe we have something nearly finished. Shall I deliver it to you in a fortnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s to be a present. I shall give you the address to deliver it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, my lord.\u201d Kirk bowed, backing from the room obsequiously.</p><p>Lazarus leaned back in his chair feeling oddly light, almost carefree. He\u2019d given presents to other women\u2014payments for services rendered\u2014but he\u2019d never taken the trouble to pick out the gift himself. Frankly it hadn\u2019t mattered, either to him or the woman. She would regard the trinkets and jewels he bestowed as insurance against the inevitable time when they would part, something easily converted to money. He hoped that Temperance would regard his gift in a more permanent light, that perhaps their relationship itself might one day become\u2014</p><p>His dreamy thoughts were interrupted by the door to his study opening again. Lazarus looked up and for a moment wondered if his thoughts of Temperance had conjured her out of thin air.</p><p>He stood. \u201cTemperance. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She glanced about his study as if dazed. \u201cI... I thought to visit you.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perfectly.\u201d But her bottom lip trembled.</p><p>Why was she lying to him? \u201cWould you like to sit? I\u2019ll ring for some wine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She started for him. \u201cNo, please don\u2019t call anyone. I simply wanted to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Her face was pale. The wide-brimmed hat she held in one hand fell to the floor as she came toward him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI walked,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cFrom St. Giles?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTemperance, you must tell me what the matter is. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took his face between his palms. \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to think about that for a while. I don\u2019t want to think about anything.\u201d</p><p>And she pulled his head down and kissed him. Her mouth was desperate on his, not soft and luring, but hot and hungry. His body reacted as if trained to service her and her alone. He found himself with his arms about her, his tongue already in her mouth. She made a sound of satisfaction beneath his lips as he crowded her against the desk. His hands were on her skirts, gathering them even as his mind reminded him that there was no lock on his study door.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d He tore his mouth from hers, sweeping her into his arms.</p><p>Swiftly he bore her out of the study, past his startled butler and up the stairs to his bedroom. Small was inside when he kicked the door open.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Lazarus said in a voice he no longer recognized as his own.</p><p>The valet disappeared silently.</p><p>Lazarus laid Temperance on his bed, then began to climb in beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>He froze, watching her.</p><p>\u201cI want...\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cI want to do this your way.\u201d</p><p>Despite her veiled words, he knew immediately what she meant. Animal desire slammed through him, hardening his cock to the point of pain, drawing his balls tight. Dear God, yes. In a second, he was half mad with the mere thought. He could take her in the way he liked best; she\u2019d asked. But a small part of him withdrew, shaking its head in disapproval. Temperance was different. He couldn\u2019t use her like this.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, a hawk guarding prey before the strike. \u201cBe sure. Once a certain point is crossed, I won\u2019t be able to back away. And you won\u2019t be able to make me.\u201d</p><p>Her throat worked as she swallowed. \u201cPlease. I want to know what you do. I want to feel it.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment longer, trying to read her mind, before shoving off the bed again. His hands were trembling.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He took a step back, afraid to touch her. Afraid to lose control. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath, her cheeks pinkening, but her hands moved to the laces of her bodice readily enough. He watched, his fingers flexing by his sides, as she stripped off bodice and stays, her skirt and shoes. When she extended a slim foot forward and slowly unrolled her stockings, he began to think she was teasing him. When she pulled the chemise gracefully over her head and threw it to the floor, he knew. She reached up and took the pins from her hair, fluffing it and combing her fingers through the locks. She sat on his bed, entirely nude, her breasts high and proud, one calf under the other leg, and she simply looked at him, waiting for his next command.</p><p>He swallowed. God. Could he do this? But she\u2019d wanted it. She\u2019d asked for it.</p><p>He turned before he could change his mind and quickly crossed to his chest of drawers. Inside the top drawer was a pile of neckcloths, neatly folded. He grabbed a handful and returned to the bed.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>She complied, placing her wrists over her head without prompting, near the spools of his headboard. He tied them there, trying to keep his eyes away from her breasts, drawn high by her lifted arms, away from her parted mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>She parted her thighs, spreading her legs wide, for his bed was not narrow, and he fastened each ankle to the posts at the end. He straightened, looking at her as he held the last neckcloth. She was like some feast for a god. Her body pink and white against the green and brown of his coverlet, her hair long and silky, spread upon his pillow.</p><p>Her eyes were not afraid, but they were wide.</p><p>He walked to the head of the bed, drawing the neckcloth through his fingers. \u201cAnd now I blindfold you.\u201d</p> <p>TEMPERANCE WATCHED AS Caire bent over her with the neckcloth. His face was grave, his sensuous lips drawn tight with strain, and his sapphire eyes had darkened to near black. She knew she should feel fear, but all she felt was anticipation.</p><p>Exquisite anticipation.</p><p>He placed the soft folds of linen over her eyes, and all was black. She listened to the sound of her own breathing, louder somehow, as she felt him tie the neckcloth firmly. His hands left her and she cocked her head, listening for his movement. He had paced around the bed, she thought, near the foot, but he stopped. She nervously fingered the carving at the head of the bed. What was he doing? What did he wait for? Her thighs were parted widely, air cooling her most intimate flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou are so lovely.\u201d His deep voice was near her left side and she started.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he murmured, and she felt something\u2014a fingertip?\u2014on her left shoulder. The touch was so light she wasn\u2019t even sure it was there.</p> <p>\u201cYour skin is like silken velvet,\u201d he said, close to her ear. His fingertip skimmed down to her breast, slowly circling. \u201cA pearly pink, so fine, so sweet.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew his fingertip from her skin, and for a moment she was untouched.</p><p>Something wet touched her nipple.</p><p>She inhaled at the suddenness. It was his tongue, it must be, but it was the only part of him that touched her. He circled her nipple and then closed his mouth about it, suckling. Shivers of sparkling sensation ran from her nipple straight to her center. She squirmed without conscious thought, but the binds at her wrists and ankles kept her from moving much. She must simply wait and submit to his attentions. Submit to what he wished to do next.</p><p>Was this the allure, then? This helpless wanting, this anxious anticipation?</p><p>He let go of her nipple suddenly, and she felt cool air blow against her damp skin. She shivered, both nipples now at a peak.</p> <p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d he whispered, and she felt his breath against her belly.</p><p>The bed depressed between her spread feet, and she realized he must be down there, sitting or lying, so close to where she was embarrassingly wet. There was a moment of silence, and she imagined him simply looking at her, exposed and waiting.</p><p>She grew wetter.</p><p>\u201cI wonder\u201d\u2014his fingertip landed lightly just behind her right knee\u2014\u201care you sweet everywhere?\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath as his touch wandered up her thigh, delicately, seemingly in no hurry.</p><p>\u201cShall I taste?\u201d he asked idly.</p><p>She bit her lip, trying to catch her breath, though she made no exertion.</p><p>\u201cTemperance?\u201d he asked, his voice deep. \u201cShall I?\u201d</p> <p>Dear Lord, if the cloth wasn\u2019t over her eyes already, she would\u2019ve hidden her face. He wanted her to ask for it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps here,\u201d he whispered as he grazed her inner lips with one finger. \u201cOr maybe here?\u201d He circled her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she choked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d he asked politely, his finger still lightly\u2014too lightly\u2014touching. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease taste me,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>And she felt his tongue, wet and sure and, thank God, so firm. He licked her in strong strokes. He missed no part of her, thoroughly laving her quivering, sensitive flesh. When he at last got to her clitoris and bore down on it with the flat of his tongue, she went a little mad. She twisted in her bonds, panting and muttering who knew what, feeling the warmth building inside of her until it turned liquid and ran all through her veins. She arched, pressing her pelvis into his face shamelessly, seeking more, and he gave it, thrusting two fingers into her as his tongue rapidly flicked over her peak.</p><p>She\u2019d had enough\u2014she was done\u2014but he would not retire. He brought that tiny bit of flesh into his mouth and sucked and sucked until she wailed her surrender, her body concussing with the explosions of her pleasure.</p><p>She was weak and warm and still tied open for his desire.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said, his voice husky and low as it blew across her wetness, \u201cI think you may be ready for me now.\u201d</p><p>He lifted from her and then she felt the brush of his breeches on her inner thighs, the weight of his body, and the probe of his penis. It was smooth and hard at her entrance. He swirled it against her moisture and then with one quick thrust seated himself within her. She felt the depression of the mattress on either side of her shoulders, as if he held his upper body up off her with his arms. Then his mouth was against her left nipple as he set a leisurely pace. He thrust and withdrew firmly, but without any haste, as if he had all the time in the world. As if she were his private plaything that he might amuse himself with for as long as he wished.</p><p>He tongued her nipple, then moved to the other, his penis moving in and out of her without pause. It was maddening. She tried to thrust up, but the bonds prevented her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispered like some devil in her ear.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He kissed her ear.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>There was a split second\u2019s pause and then a low, muttered curse. He hitched himself up her and slammed himself into her as if he\u2019d lost all control. Fast and hard, as she\u2019d asked, and it was pure bliss. White light burst behind her eyelids, hot and blinding, and she would have cried out had he not covered her mouth with his. He kissed her deeply as he continued to pound into her, taking his pleasure on her helpless body.</p><p>And when he jerked and broke their kiss, rubbing his face into her neck, she knew he\u2019d found his bliss as well. He thrust once more, and again, and then his entire weight slumped against her.</p><p>For a moment they lay like that, and then the neckcloth was removed from her face. She blinked up into his sapphire eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow will you tell me what the matter is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>MAKING LOVE TO Temperance like this had been like a dream come true. But there had been something missing. Something small, nagging at the back of his brain, and the moment Lazarus took the neckcloth off her face, he knew what it was: Temperance\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d wanted to see the golden stars in her eyes as they made love. And he\u2019d wanted for her to see his eyes.</p><p>To see him.</p><p>Those extraordinary gilded eyes shifted away from his gaze now. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve felt anger at her obvious prevarication, but instead tenderness flooded him. He pushed the hair back from her face. \u201cCut line, Temperance. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled at the bonds on her wrists. \u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her cheek. \u201cNot until you tell me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and whispered, \u201cMary Hope, the baby I brought home that first night we met, is dying.\u201d</p><p>Relief was a liquid lightness in his chest. She\u2019d told him; she\u2019d let him in a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so small, so weak. I should\u2019ve known she would not make it. But then she rallied for a bit and I hoped...\u201d</p><p>He was silent, absorbing her pain.</p><p>She sobbed and shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s dying there at the home. I couldn\u2019t bear to watch her struggle to breathe, so I left Nell to nurse her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d He lifted his head to look at her. \u201cYou bear so much already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grimaced, as if in physical pain. \u201cI don\u2019t bear enough. Winter collapsed this morning. The home is killing him, I fear. I should never have left there today. I should never have come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you probably shouldn\u2019t have left, but everyone needs a rest sometime. Don\u2019t worry yourself so.\u201d</p><p>She merely shook her head.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, thinking. An uneasy emotion he couldn\u2019t quite identify was growing in his chest. \u201cThat home is like a prison for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He reached to work at the ties at her wrists. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered for some time why you insist on working there. Do you like it? Do you enjoy the work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe work is no doubt very admirable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply and he looked down at her. She was staring at him wide-eyed. He\u2019d succeeded in shocking her into silence, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked again gently.</p><p>\u201cLiking has nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not. The home is a charity. One doesn\u2019t have to enjoy charity.\u201d</p><p>He half smiled. \u201cThen there is no shame in admitting you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it one way or the other. I like the children, naturally, and I do sometimes feel satisfied when we place one in a good position. I must enjoy it, mustn\u2019t I? I\u2019d be a monster if I didn\u2019t.\u201d She appealed to him, as if she couldn\u2019t answer the question herself.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s neither good nor bad\u2014how you feel about the home and working there\u2014it just is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, of course I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cTell me without lies or evasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her affectionately. \u201cOh, my little martyr, you lie every day, to yourself, I fear, most of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He gave up on the bindings for the moment; she seemed comfortable enough anyway. \u201cYou refuse to admit love for Mary Whitsun or even tiny Mary Hope\u2014I\u2019ve seen you refuse to touch the baby. You hold yourself back, deny yourself pleasure\u2014unless pressed. You make yourself work at a hopeless job that is killing you, and all for some ridiculous sense of unworthiness. You are the most saintly woman I know, and yet you think yourself a sinner.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, white lines appeared around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you...\u201d She gasped for breath. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me I\u2019m saintly. That I don\u2019t know what sin is.\u201d</p><p>She was truly angry; he could see that. She yanked wildly at her bonds.</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d she screamed. Her mouth was wide, and tears had started at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not good; I\u2019m not a saint. I need to work at the home.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his nose to hers. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a good and true thing to do. It doesn\u2019t matter a whit how I feel about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing penance, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She shook her head, red-faced, the tears running into her tangled hair. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned close, capturing her face between his palms. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, closing her eyes. \u201cWhen my husband died... when Benjamin died...\u201d</p><p>He waited patiently as she sobbed. He\u2019d known that something was here. Had she not loved her husband? Perhaps even wished him dead? He was prepared for such mundane confessions, but not the one that came from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was with another man.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, so startled that he let her go. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily. \u201cHe was... Well, it doesn\u2019t matter who he was, but I let myself be seduced by him. I was at his rooms, with him carnally, at the exact moment Benjamin was run down by a brewer\u2019s cart. I came home, trying to decide how I would keep my sin from him, and he was dead.\u201d Her eyes suddenly flew open. \u201cHe was dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at her a moment, as a horrible realization began to form at the back of his mind. Abruptly he stood and went to his desk to find a penknife.</p><p>\u201cHow long had you known your lover?\u201d he asked as he cut through the binds at her ankles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She knit her brow in confusion. \u201cNot long. It was the first time I\u2019d been with him. What does it matter?\u201d</p><p>He laughed shortly, but the sound was not amused. \u201cIt matters only in the irony, I suppose. The first time you sinned, you were punished overhard, I think.\u201d</p> <p>He cut her wrists free.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? This isn\u2019t a simple wrong. It isn\u2019t eating too many sweets or desiring another woman\u2019s bonnet. I slept with a man not my husband. I committed adultery.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, suddenly weary. \u201cAnd you expect vilification from me for such a human failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a failing.\u201d She sat up and wrapped herself in his coverlet. She was beautiful\u2014he could see that in a dispassionate way\u2014the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever known. \u201cI betrayed my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yourself,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>She blinked. \u201cYes, and myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual congress was your downfall,\u201d he said. \u201cSexual congress with a man not your husband was the worst thing you\u2019d ever done in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, wishing irrationally that he hadn\u2019t pressed her. \u201cYou\u2019ll never forgive yourself, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She seemed taken aback by his unemotional articulation of her dilemma.</p><p>\u201cSexual congress is the most unpardonable sin to you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you decided you needed to punish yourself, you used your worst sin.\u201d</p> <p>He opened his eyes and looked at her, so beautiful, so strong. Everything, he suddenly realized, that he would wish for in a woman, had he ever thought to wish, and he finally identified the emotion in his heart. Hurt. She\u2019d hurt him as thoroughly as if she\u2019d shoved an arrow through his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve used me to punish yourself, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He watched dawning realization spread over her face, a confirmation more positive than anything she could ever say, and that arrow twisted deep in his chest. Yet still he had to ask the last question.</p><p>\u201cAm I anything to you but a punishment?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Meg looked at the most powerful man in the kingdom. \u201cYour Majesty, may I ask why you wish to know what love is?\u201d</p><p>The king frowned. \u201cI know what it is to face death in battle. I know about ruling a vast kingdom, about meting out justice and showing mercy, but despite all this, I do not know what love is. Can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Meg thought about his question as she ate. How was she to explain love to a king? At last she looked up and saw the king feeding a date to the little blue bird.</p> <p>\u201cOpen the cage door,\u201d she said....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>\u201cPunishment?\u201d Temperance stared at Caire.</p><p>He was dressed while she was entirely nude. He\u2019d not even removed his coat to make love to her. She felt at a terrible disadvantage. She\u2019d just told him of her greatest shame\u2014a thing she\u2019d told no other person, not even Silence\u2014and he\u2019d accused her of... what?</p><p>She shook her head, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t think of you as punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He was quieter than she\u2019d ever seen him, withdrawn from her somehow. \u201cThen explain your sudden request for me to bind you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the coverlet up to shield her bare shoulders from his gaze. \u201cI... I simply thought it was something you liked. Something I was curious about. I don\u2019t know why I asked tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He\u2019d turned his back to her, his hands clasped behind him. \u201cIt was degrading for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she exclaimed without even having to think.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted\u2014needed\u2014sex, but it\u2019s a sin for you, isn\u2019t it? The very worst of sins. The only way you could approach the act was by making it something foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She struggled from the covers, unmindful now of her nudity. How could he possibly imagine\u2014</p><p>\u201cSomething degrading.\u201d He turned and looked at her, and she froze, half-risen from the covers. \u201cBecause otherwise, well, it would be nothing but pleasure, wouldn\u2019t it? And that you couldn\u2019t allow yourself.\u201d</p><p>She sat back slowly, not even defending herself anymore. Was this true? Had she really used him in such a despicable way?</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d he said dispassionately. \u201cWhat you feel. After all, I never considered the emotions of my partners before. Quite frankly, their feelings were of no account to me in our transactions. But oddly, what you feel does somehow matter to me.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking down at his hands for a moment and then back up at her, his face exposed now, sad and hurt and resigned.</p><p>The sight made something twist in her chest\u2014made her want to say something\u2014but still she could not bring herself to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although I am a disgusting creature in many ways, although I have needs not of the ordinary, perhaps even evil needs, I believe that I do not deserve to be used in this way. I may be a man without conscience, but you, my dear martyr, are better than this act.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room, closing the door quietly behind him.</p><p>For a moment, Temperance simply stared at the door. She wanted to run after him, to apologize, to explain somehow, to say the words she couldn\u2019t before, but she was nude. She looked down at the coverlet fallen to her lap.</p><p>Hurriedly she rose and began dressing, but her chemise tangled over her head and she couldn\u2019t find her second stocking. By the time she\u2019d poked enough pins into her hair to hold it off her neck, it was half an hour later and he\u2019d still not returned.</p><p>Temperance opened the door and crept into the corridor. The house was eerily quiet, and she realized she had no idea where he might have gone. Perhaps his study? Did he have a private sitting room or library? She began walking down the hall, peering into rooms. Eventually she realized that a library would surely be on another floor, and she wandered down the stairs.</p><p>There was light in the main hallway, and as she entered, she saw that Small was standing by the butler.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Lord Caire?\u201d she asked, knowing her face was reddening. What must the servants think of her\u2014a lone woman, her hair falling from its pins, in an unmarried gentleman\u2019s house?</p><p>But her embarrassment fled at Small\u2019s reply. \u201cMy lord has gone out, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Temperance stared blankly. Had he loathed her company so much that he\u2019d vacated his own house?</p><p>\u201cLord Caire left instructions that the carriage be brought around for your use, ma\u2019am.\u201d Small\u2019s face was the expressionless mask of the good servant, but his eyes were sympathetic.</p><p>Temperance had a sudden urge to weep. Was that it, then? Was all that had been between her and Caire over now?</p><p>She bit her inner cheek. She would not break down\u2014not now, at least. \u201cThank you. That was most... kind of Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>Small bowed as if she were a true lady instead of the daughter of a brewer, recently discarded by an aristocratic lover. She swept out into the late afternoon daylight and down Caire\u2019s front steps with as much dignity as she could muster. Inside the big carriage, though, after the door had been slammed shut and she was all alone with no curious eyes to stare, her spine collapsed. She huddled in a corner of the seat, rocking against the soft leather as the carriage drove through the London streets.</p><p>All her life she\u2019d thought of herself as an essentially good person. Her downfall with the man who\u2019d seduced her had been shocking. She\u2019d known that she\u2019d been led astray because of a flaw within herself, and she\u2019d thought that flaw had been her overwhelming sexual urges. But what if that had merely been a symptom of a far greater sin?</p><p>What if her true flaw was pride?</p><p>She watched with sightless eyes as London rumbled by and thought about her marriage, so long ago now. Benjamin had been Father\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a quiet man, grave beyond his years. He\u2019d studied at one time for the church, but when he\u2019d met Father, Benjamin had been an impoverished schoolmaster. Father had offered him work at the home and a room in their house. Temperance had been sixteen then\u2014so very young! Benjamin had been mature and pleasant of face, and Father had approved of him. It had seemed the natural thing to do to marry him.</p><p>She\u2019d been happy enough in her marriage, hadn\u2019t she? Surely she had because Benjamin was a good man, a likable man. And he\u2019d been gentle in their marriage bed\u2014the few times he\u2019d been passionate. Benjamin believed that physical love was a holy act between a man and wife. Something to be done thoughtfully and not too often. In fact, the only time he\u2019d come close to sounding vexed with her was when she\u2019d suggested that perhaps they might practice their physical bond more often. He\u2019d made it quite plain that a woman who sought out sex was to be pitied.</p><p>She\u2019d known, even then, that something was wrong about her makeup. That she had urges that needed to be watched. And yet when temptation had presented itself, she\u2019d fallen with hardly a struggle. John had been a young lawyer renting a room next to their house. Temperance frowned. Now when she tried to recall what he\u2019d looked like, all she could remember was how hairy the backs of his hands had been. At the time, to her younger self, that had seemed like an exciting sign of male virility. She\u2019d thought herself passionately in love, with a tragic fatefulness that had been all-consuming at the time and now was only dimly remembered. The afternoon she\u2019d fallen, Temperance remembered thinking that she would die\u2014physically fall ill and die\u2014if she did not lay with John.</p><p>So she had and her life had crumbled apart.</p><p>She\u2019d returned from the dingy room John had rented to find Benjamin\u2014grave, handsome Benjamin\u2014breathing his last. His chest had been crushed by the wheels of a huge brewer\u2019s cart. He hadn\u2019t even regained consciousness before dying. Temperance didn\u2019t remember much after that. Her family had taken care of Benjamin\u2019s funeral, had cared for and comforted her. Weeks later, she found out that John had left his rented rooms without ever saying good-bye to her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>Ever since, she\u2019d worked to hide her sin\u2014and the temptation of lust. Had she in the process become a hypocrite? She\u2019d wanted the comfort of Caire\u2019s arms, but she was so wrapped up in her own demons that she hadn\u2019t even thought about his feelings.</p><p>Caire was right. She\u2019d used him. The thought made her squirm, made her want to lash out\u2014blame Winter for his collapse, blame John for seducing her so long ago, blame Silence for her foolish bravery, blame Caire for his advances\u2014blame, in fact, anyone but herself. She hated the knowledge that she was so base. He was right. She\u2019d used him for sexual pleasure and hadn\u2019t even the courage to acknowledge the fact to herself.</p><p>And somehow in the process of using him, she\u2019d so hurt him that he believed she thought sex with him was degrading.</p><p>It was a temptation to make excuses for herself. But she fought down all her prevarication, her lies and evasions. She swore to herself two things: one, that she would save the home. And two, she would find a way somehow to heal the hurt she\u2019d caused Lazarus. She\u2019d find a way to open herself to him, even at the risk of hurting herself, because she owed him that. Because if she didn\u2019t, she would never be able to get him back. Could she admit how she felt to him? She was no longer sure. The mere thought of expressing aloud her feelings made sweat start at the small of her back.</p><p>But there was something she knew she could do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing, Temperance knocked hard against the carriage roof. \u201cStop! Stop, please! I wish to go to a different address. I wish to visit Mr. St. John.\u201d</p><p>LAZARUS HAD NEVER thought of himself as lovable. Therefore it should come as no shock at all that Temperance did not, in fact, love him. No, not a shock... but it would have been nice had she had some small feeling for him.</p><p>Lazarus pondered his own sickening craving as he guided his black gelding through the London morning throng the day after he\u2019d walked out on Temperance. It appeared that his own nascent emotions had provoked a new desire as well: the urge to be loved. How banal. And yet, banal or not, he could not change the way his heart felt.</p><p>A corner of his mouth quirked up humorlessly. It seemed he must be like other men after all.</p> <p>The black shied and Lazarus looked up. The address he sought this morning was not so very far from his own town house. The square he now guided the horse into was new, the houses genteel and so elegant they must\u2019ve cost a fortune to rent. Lazarus swung down from the gelding and gave the reins to a waiting boy, along with a shilling for his troubles. He mounted the pristine white steps and knocked.</p><p>Five minutes later, Lazarus was shown into a study both luxurious and comfortable. The chairs were wide enough for a man\u2019s girth and covered in a deep red leather. The books were in enough disarray to suggest actual use, and the massive desk, taking up an entire corner of the room, shone with polish.</p><p>Lazarus strolled the room while he waited for his host. When the door at last opened, he had a copy of Cicero\u2019s speeches in his hands.</p><p>The man who entered wore a full-bottomed white wig. The outer corners of his eyes, his lips, and his jowls all sagged downward as if pulled by an invisible string, giving his countenance the agreeable look of a hunting dog.</p><p>He glanced at Lazarus, raised a bushy gray eyebrow at the book in his hands, and said, \u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Lazarus closed and set aside the book. \u201cAm I addressing Lord Hadley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are indeed, sir.\u201d Hadley gave an abbreviated bow and, sweeping aside the skirts of his coat, sat heavily in one of the leather chairs.</p><p>Lazarus inclined his head before sitting across from his host. \u201cI am Lazarus Huntington, Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>Hadley arched an eyebrow, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could help me,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cWe have\u2014or rather had\u2014a mutual acquaintance: Marie Hume.\u201d</p><p>Hadley\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.</p> <p>Lazarus cocked his head. \u201cA blond lady specializing in certain forms of entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat forms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rope and hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Hadley didn\u2019t seem at all embarrassed by the outr\u00e9 turn of conversation. \u201cI know the gel. Called herself Marie Pett when she was with me. I was under the impression she had died.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus nodded. \u201cShe was murdered in a house in St. Giles almost three months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d Hadley said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see how it matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus inclined his head. \u201cI wish to find the murderer.\u201d</p><p>Hadley showed the first sign of emotion since Caire had arrived: curiosity. He took a small enameled box from a pocket, tapped out a pinch of snuff, inhaled, and sneezed. He blew his nose and shook his head as he put away his handkerchief. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>Lazarus raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy d\u2019you want to find this gel\u2019s murderer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Hadley fingered the snuffbox still in his hand. \u201cYou know about her specialty, so I assume you used her for the same purpose as I. A pity, as I said, that she\u2019s dead, but there are other women to fulfill our particular needs. Why bother seeking her killer?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus blinked. No one had ever asked him the question phrased in such a way. \u201cI... spent time with her. With Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I never loved Marie. But she was a person. If I do not find her killer, seek retribution for her death, then no one held her in regard. Then...\u201d</p><p>Then what?</p><p>But Hadley finished his sentence for him. \u201cAnd if no one holds Marie in regard, then perhaps no one holds you in regard? No one holds us in regard. We are merely solitary creatures enacting our bizarre form of human contact without anyone caring about us at all.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus stared at the other man, a bit stunned.</p><p>Hadley\u2019s mouth curved, creating a whole array of sagging wrinkles in his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bit more time to think it out than you.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus nodded. \u201cDo you know any other who visited her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that worm she called a brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Tommy.\u201d Hadley pursed his lips, not an attractive expression for him. \u201cTommy was there, lurking about, nearly every time I visited fair Marie. Once he came with an older woman. She wore a soldier\u2019s red coat. Seemed a bad sort, but as I said, I didn\u2019t bother much with Marie\u2019s personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Lazarus frowned. The brother had said he only visited his sister rarely. Apparently he lied. And how was Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease involved with this? She and her shop seemed to pop up at every turn.</p><p>\u201cDoes that help?\u201d Hadley inquired courteously. \u201cI never met any of her other clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does help.\u201d Lazarus stood. \u201cI thank you, my lord, for your time and your frankness.\u201d</p><p>Hadley shrugged. \u201cIt was no trouble. Would you like to stay for a glass of wine, sir?\u201d</p><p>Lazarus bowed. \u201cThank you, but I have another appointment this morning. Perhaps some other time?\u201d</p><p>It was merely a polite gesture and both men knew it. A fleeting emotion crossed Hadley\u2019s face, but it was gone before Lazarus could decipher it.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Hadley stood. \u201cGood day, sir.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus bowed again, crossing to the study door. But a thought gave him pause there. He turned to look at the older man. \u201cMight I ask one more question, sir?\u201d</p><p>Hadley waved a hand, indicating assent.</p><p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>That same expression trod across Hadley\u2019s face, deepening each wrinkle and sag. \u201cNo, sir. I have never married.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus bowed yet again, conscious that he\u2019d crossed the bounds of civility. He let himself out of the elegant, expensive town house. But as he emerged into the morning sun, he wondered: Had loneliness left its stamp upon his features as well?</p><p>SILENCE STOOD IN front of the foundling home the next morning and smiled. No, that wasn\u2019t quite right. She looked at her feet and tried again, feeling the muscles move in her cheeks. How odd. Something that had been as natural as, well, smiling just days ago was now so foreign that she wasn\u2019t sure she was doing it properly.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a toothache, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Silence looked up into the rather grubby face of one of the orphans. Joseph Smith? Or perhaps Joseph Jones? Goodness! Why had her brother and sister chosen to name all the boys Joseph Something and all the girls Mary Whatever? Had they been quite mad?</p><p>But the boy was still staring at her, one dirty finger stuck in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she said sharply, startling them both. She\u2019d never reprimanded one of the children, sharply or otherwise.</p><p>The child immediately removed his finger, watching her rather warily now.</p><p>Silence sighed. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph Tinbox.\u201d</p><p>Silence wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhyever were you named that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d the boy said, \u201cwhen I comed here, I had a tin box tied to my wrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Silence muttered, giving up on the smile altogether. \u201cWell, Joseph Tinbox, I\u2019m here to see Mrs. Dews. Do you happen to know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d Joseph replied.</p><p>He turned and opened the door to the home\u2014apparently unlocked this afternoon\u2014and led her into the house. There was a great commotion coming from the kitchen, and when Silence stepped in, she saw Temperance, her hair coming down about her ears, managing sheer chaos. A group of boys stood in the corner, alternately singing in high, angelic voices and poking each other when Temperance or Nell turned their back. Nell was supervising the weekly wash, while three small girls tended a large pot of something steaming on the hearth.</p><p>Temperance turned just as Silence entered and shoved back a lock of curling hair. \u201cSilence! Oh, thank goodness. I could use your help today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Silence stared about the kitchen rather dazedly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d Temperance said firmly. \u201cWinter is still ill. Could you take this tray up to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter is ill?\u201d Silence picked up the tray automatically.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Temperance frowned at the singing boys. \u201cFrom the beginning again, please. And Joseph Smith, do stop shoving Joseph Little. Yes,\u201d she said again, turning back to Silence. \u201cI forgot to tell you, didn\u2019t I? Oh, so much has happened in the last day. Just take him his food, and under no circumstances should you let him rise from his bed.\u201d</p><p>Temperance\u2019s look was quite stern, and Silence was tempted to salute, though she wisely refrained from the gesture. She hurried from the kitchen instead and made her way to Winter\u2019s room up under the eaves. Perhaps Temperance had had some sort of foresight, for as Silence pushed open the door, she caught Winter putting on his breeches.</p><p>Or trying to in any case.</p><p>Her youngest brother was pale and sweating and fell against the bed as she shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a man have some privacy?\u201d Winter said in uncharacteristic ill humor.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re attempting to escape.\u201d Silence set the tray on a small table by the bed, balanced precariously atop a pile of books. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Winter asked darkly.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re ill? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Silence wrinkled her nose in sympathy. Temperance could be rather bossy sometimes, although in this case Silence was in full agreement with her sister. Winter looked quite terrible. He\u2019d taken off his nightshirt to get dressed, and she could count the ribs on his bare torso. He bent to retrieve his nightshirt from the floor, and she sucked in her breath.</p><p>He straightened hastily, but she\u2019d already seen the long cut on his back. \u201cDear God! Where did you get that?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his nightshirt on over his head. When he reappeared, he grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Please don\u2019t tell Temperance; she\u2019ll only worry more.\u201d</p><p>Silence frowned. \u201cBut where did you get it? It looks like a knife cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort. I fell.\u201d He looked sheepish. \u201cIn the street the other day. I\u2019m afraid I came down on a wagon wheel and the iron cut right through my coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow strange. It looks exactly as if someone had cut you with a knife\u2014or a sword, I suppose.\u201d Silence tried to look over his shoulder, but he sat back against the pillow with a slight wince. \u201cHave you cleaned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Truly.\u201d He smiled, crooked and endearing. \u201cI admit that I may\u2019ve let the wound go when I first got it and that may have led to my fainting spell, but it\u2019s healing properly now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Silence,\u201d he said. \u201cNow. Tell me how things are with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She carefully transferred the tray to his lap, making sure it was settled enough that it wouldn\u2019t spill. \u201cWell, William has sailed again.\u201d</p><p>Winter glanced up from a spoonful of soup. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, busying herself with straightening the bed linens. \u201cThere was a ship whose captain fell suddenly ill. William assured me that he would be paid well for going back to sea early.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d Winter said noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cAnd I went to Concord\u2019s house for dinner the other night, and he was quite cold. Asa was supposed to be there as well, but he didn\u2019t come. Didn\u2019t even send his regrets.\u201d Silence picked up a pillow to plump. \u201cYou won\u2019t credit it, I\u2019m sure, but Concord implied that I\u2019d been seduced by Mr. O\u2019Connor, even after I told him that that simply wasn\u2019t the case. I don\u2019t think he believes me, Winter. I don\u2019t think Temperance believes me either.\u201d</p><p>She must\u2019ve hit the pillow overhard because a small cloud of feathers puffed from a corner.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Winter said slowly, eyeing his damaged pillow.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Silence placed the pillow back on the bed and gave it a gentle pat. \u201cBut you believe me, don\u2019t you? You know that Mr. O\u2019Connor never touched me, that he only asked me to spend the night. And I did. I did spend the night in his room, but nothing\u2014nothing at all!\u2014happened. Do you believe me, Winter?\u201d</p><p>She stood, arms crossed protectively over her breasts, and stared at him anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d Winter said slowly, \u201cthat you are my sister and that no matter what happened, I will continue to love you and stand by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered, and stupid tears started in her eyes. For it was the sweetest thing Winter could possibly say\u2014and also the most horrible. He obviously didn\u2019t believe her either.</p><p>\u201cSilence...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she said without looking at him; she couldn\u2019t or she just might either burst into tears or hit him, neither of which would be very good. \u201cI\u2019ll just go down and see if Temperance needs my help in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d he called as she made the door.</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn, staring down at her hand on the knob as she said gruffly, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about helping us here on a more permanent basis?\u201d</p><p>The question was so startling that Silence turned to look at Winter.</p><p>He was regarding her gravely. \u201cWe could use your help, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He blinked and looked down at his plate of soup. \u201cI think it might be of benefit both to you and to us.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was ruined. The realization was sudden and so entirely unwelcome that Silence was struck dumb.</p><p>Winter raised his eyes to hers, and they were filled with regret and sorrow. \u201cPlease at least think about it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily and left quickly without replying. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>No one believed she\u2019d walked out of Mickey O\u2019Connor\u2019s bedroom untouched. Not her neighbors, who whispered as she walked by. Not the shopkeepers, who turned their backs and pretended to be busy when she came into their stores. Not William, who had been mute as she\u2019d watched him pack and leave. Not Asa or Concord or Verity or even Temperance or Winter. Even her own family thought she lied to cover some horrible sin.</p><p>No one believed her in all the world.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>King Lockedheart looked bemused. \u201cBut if I open the cage door, the bird shall fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to learn what love is, you must open the door,\u201d Meg said.</p><p>So the king opened the little blue bird\u2019s cage door. Immediately the bird took flight and darted out an open window of the room.</p><p>The king looked at Meg with his eyebrow cocked. \u201cI think that all I have learned is how to lose a bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d</p><p>The king frowned. \u201cLoss. Emptiness.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>\u201cThen you think we can do it?\u201d Mrs. Dews leaned forward, her face bright, her extraordinary brown eyes eager.</p><p>St. John nodded, amazed by her vitality. How could he not be? She was in such extreme contrast to Clara\u2019s still form upstairs.</p><p>He shoved the awful thought aside and focused on answering her instead. \u201cYes. Yes, of course. I\u2019ve already had my secretary send out the invitations to view the foundling home.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dews bit her lip. \u201cHow many did you invite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over a hundred people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She sat very still, her eyes wide, but her hand crept out to seize the wrist of her maidservant, a woman named Nell.</p><p>St. John had been taken aback by the presence of the maid on this, Mrs. Dews\u2019s second visit to his house. On the first, she\u2019d arrived alone and nearly vibrating with the excitement of her idea: to open the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children for viewing in the hopes of catching the interest of a prospective patron for the home. It was a daring scheme, but one that was shrewd as well. Viewing the unfortunate, whether at prisons, hospitals, or houses for the hopelessly mad, was fashionable in London at the moment. Most came merely to stare and titter at the antics of those poor souls, but many would also pledge monies to the charities they viewed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot of people,\u201d Mrs. Dews said, letting go of her maid.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they are all of the best families\u2014ones to whom charity is now in fashion.\u201d St. John arched a significant eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cQuite. Yes, of course.\u201d Mrs. Dews smoothed her black skirts with one hand. It trembled slightly, and St. John had a wild urge to cross the room and comfort her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be ready in time?\u201d he inquired, clasping his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cI believe so,\u201d she said, looking a bit relieved at the change of subject. \u201cWe\u2019ve already scrubbed the walls and floors, Winter has been listening to the children recite various poems by heart, and Nell has been busy mending the children\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good. I\u2019ll have my cook make a quantity of punch and some gingerbread the day before to be delivered quite early on the set morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you\u2019ve done so much already,\u201d Mrs. Dews exclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t wish you to go to the expense on my account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the children,\u201d St. John reminded her gently. \u201cI\u2019d feel quite the lackwit if I didn\u2019t contribute to our little plan. Please, don\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case...\u201d She smiled shyly at him, her eyes so alive.</p><p>How Caire could\u2019ve let this woman slip through his hands was beyond him. He turned quickly, pretending to study the china clock on his mantelpiece. \u201cIf that is all today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, of course,\u201d she said from behind him, sounding a little hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to take up your time, Mr. St. John. You have been of such great help to me and our home.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw to prevent himself from stuttering apologies. Instead he bowed a bit stiffly. \u201cGood day, Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>She left then, after a graceful curtsy, and only the maid shot him a curious look over her shoulder. He waited until the door to his library shut before walking to the window that overlooked the street below. He watched as she crossed the street, her stride light and graceful, one hand on her bonnet, for it was a windy day. The maid walked by her side instead of behind, and they seemed to be conversing. Her black-clad figure grew small, and in another moment she\u2019d disappeared into the London crowd.</p><p>St. John let the curtain fall from his fingers.</p><p>He looked about his library, but despite the books and news sheets and clutter, it seemed barren and lonely after her visit. He left the room and mounted the stairs, climbing two floors up. He didn\u2019t visit Clara often at this hour; she usually slept in after what was invariably a restless night. But today he found himself unable to keep away. In the back of his mind, he knew that there would come a day\u2014perhaps soon\u2014when he would no longer be able to climb the stairs and see her.</p><p>St. John tapped at her door and then cracked it open. The old maid who was Clara\u2019s constant companion looked up from her chair by the bed, then rose and crossed to tend the fire.</p><p>He approached the bed and looked down. Clara must\u2019ve just had her hair washed, for it was spread, a bright banner, over her white pillow. The locks were a deep brown with bits of red in them, now streaked with strands of gray. He found himself stroking her hair. She\u2019d once told him it was her best feature, and he\u2019d been amazed that ladies categorized their person thusly. Amazed and fondly amused.</p><p>\u201cGodric,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked down and saw her brown eyes watching him. Once they had been as beautiful as Mrs. Dews\u2019s. Now they were always pain-filled.</p><p>He bent and brushed a careful kiss across her wide forehead. \u201cClara.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her pale lips curving just slightly. \u201cTo what do I owe this visit?\u201d</p><p>He whispered in her ear, \u201cA deep and abiding longing to see the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, as he\u2019d intended, but then the gentle sound turned to a hacking cough that shook her frame. The nurse hurried over.</p><p>St. John stepped back, watching with painful patience as Clara\u2019s spasm gradually subsided. When it was over, sweat had dampened her hair and her face was more pale than her pillow, but she looked at him and smiled.</p><p>He swallowed past the constriction in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you. I merely wanted you to know that I love you.\u201d</p><p>She held a shaking hand out to him.</p><p>He took it and watched as she mouthed, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>St. John made himself smile before turning and leaving his wife\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>IT WAS LATE afternoon nearly a week later when Temperance knocked on Polly\u2019s door. Now that Winter was recovered, she and Mary Whitsun had been running errands in preparation for the home\u2019s viewing, but it was important that she stop by Polly\u2019s rooms today.</p><p>Polly answered the door with a sleeping Mary Hope in her arms and a shawl thrown over her shoulder. \u201cCome in, Mrs. Dews, Mary Whitsun. It\u2019s that glad I am to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mary Hope any better?\u201d Temperance whispered the question as she stepped into the crowded little room. A glance showed her Polly\u2019s own babies sleeping together on the bed. Mary Whitsun tiptoed over to replace the blanket one of the children had kicked off.</p><p>\u201cAye, she is.\u201d The wet nurse beamed as she looked down at the baby. \u201cThe fever\u2019s left and she\u2019s sucking strong. I think she might just live, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God.\u201d Temperance closed her eyes in relief. The babies died so often. It was a welcome surprise to find one who struggled through fever so young.</p><p>Not that Mary Hope was entirely out of the woods yet. \u201cAnd your own babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never got the fever, thank the Lord,\u201d Polly replied. \u201cHealthy as young puppies, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Polly.\u201d Temperance made a mental note to reward the wet nurse.</p><p>\u201cWill you hold her?\u201d Polly asked. \u201cShe\u2019s just now fallen to sleep, and I haven\u2019t had a moment to put myself to rights.\u201d</p><p>She held out the babe, and Temperance remembered Lazarus\u2019s words\u2014that he\u2019d seen her refuse to touch the baby. She hesitated only a second before taking the warm little bundle into her arms. Mary Whitsun peered over her arm, and they both looked down with wonder at the tiny delicate fingers that splayed against one pink cheek. Temperance\u2019s eyes stung with tears.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d Polly asked with concern as she tucked her shawl into her bodice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Temperance murmured as she wiped her cheek against her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it was so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it was,\u201d the wet nurse said comfortably, taking back the baby.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use not loving them, is there?\u201d Temperance whispered. She glanced at Mary Whitsun, who was still enthralled by the baby\u2019s tiny face.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m afraid \u2019tis silly to even bother,\u201d Polly replied. \u201cOne look in their wee faces and we\u2019re all lost, aren\u2019t we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d</p><p>Temperance bid Polly good night and closed the door to her room gently behind her. When she looked up, she saw Mary Whitsun watching her.</p><p>\u201cWill the baby live, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled. \u201cI think so, Mary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad,\u201d Mary said somberly.</p><p>They clattered down the rickety stairs and out the front door of Polly\u2019s rooming house. Temperance glanced uneasily at the sky. The sun was beginning to set. \u201cWe need to hurry home before dark.\u201d</p><p>Mary hurried beside her. \u201cIs it true that the Ghost of St. Giles comes out after dark and hunts girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Mary ducked her head. \u201cThe butcher\u2019s boy. Is it true?\u201d</p> <p>Temperance frowned. \u201cSome girls have been hurt, yes. But you needn\u2019t worry so long as you stay at the school, especially at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stay home?\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced at Mary. The girl had her eyes fixed on the ground as they walked. \u201cI need to do errands, naturally\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if another baby needs help at night?\u201d Mary was biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cMy job is to help orphaned babies in St. Giles,\u201d Temperance said gently. \u201cWhere would Mary Hope be if I hadn\u2019t gone after her?\u201d</p><p>Mary said nothing.</p> <p>\u201cBut I hardly ever have to make trips after dark,\u201d Temperance said briskly. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded, but she still looked troubled.</p><p>Temperance sighed, wishing she could set Mary\u2019s mind at ease, but as long as the murderer was loose, that would be hard to do.</p><p>When they reached the home, yet more work waited and Temperance sent Mary Whitsun to supervise the littler girls in washing the hall walls.</p><p>By the time Temperance climbed the stairs to her room that night, it was quite late. The preparations for opening the home for viewing were exhausting. Every time she thought they were nearly done, another job would rear its head and she\u2019d have to somehow see to it.</p><p>She turned the corner on the rickety stairs, examining the banister. It was in need of a polish, but would making it look better merely persuade any potential patron that the home wasn\u2019t really in need of funds? This was the dilemma with all the decisions she made to neaten and clean the home. Every decision she second-guessed, even when Winter told her in his quiet voice that she was doing a fine job and not to worry so much. And beneath all her worries was a nagging sadness. Put simply, she missed Caire. She found herself wondering what he\u2019d think of her decisions, wanting to discuss her problems and small joys with him. She wanted to be with him.</p><p>But she\u2019d pretty well fouled those waters, hadn\u2019t she? Her shoulders slumped at the thought as she rounded the final twist in the old staircase, coming at last to the uppermost floor of the home. He thought she\u2019d wanted him only for a crass sexual relationship, and while she certainly longed to embrace him again, there was so much more to her emotions.</p><p>She halted, there at the top of the stairs, a single candle wavering in her hand to give her light, as she finally acknowledged what she\u2019d known all along. She felt much more for Caire than lust.</p> <p>A sob caught in her throat before she could stifle it. She\u2019d been so lonely before he\u2019d come into her life. His absence now only highlighted just how alone she was. Oh, she had her brothers and sisters, the children and Nell, but even with her own family, she was apart. Only with Caire was she herself, flaws and all. He saw her sexual need, her sometimes un-Christian urges and emotions and, wonder of wonders, liked her just the same. Wanted her just the same. It was so freeing, simply being with him! Knowing that she could be herself\u2014all of herself\u2014and he would not turn away.</p><p>She looked about the dim, squalid hallway. Alone. She was so alone.</p><p>IT WASN\u2019T UNTIL half an hour into the viewing that Temperance decided that the event was going quite well, all things considered.</p><p>They\u2019d had a rather rocky start when their first visitors\u2014a lady with an enormous plume in her hair accompanied by a stout gentleman in a full-bottomed wig, improbably dyed an inky black above his elderly face\u2014arrived a bit early at just before five of the clock. Joseph Tinbox had been the only one to hear the knock at the door, and when he\u2019d answered it, had at first refused them entry on the grounds that they were \u201ctoo early and ought to go away and come back at the proper time.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, Nell had gone looking for Joseph Tinbox at that moment and found him about to shoo their visitors away. Profuse apologies, and the application of two cups of Mr. St. John\u2019s punch, had done much to soothe the couple\u2019s indignation. After that, a steady stream of gentlepersons had arrived. So many, in fact, that at one point their grand carriages had clogged the end of Maiden Lane, much to the interest of the usual inhabitants. Some had, in fact, taken out chairs and sat along the street to watch the parade of nobility go by.</p><p>Yes, all was going quite well, and if the punch held out and she could keep Winter from engaging in a political discussion with a rather loud young gentleman in an atrocious yellow coat who insisted on saying the most idiotic things, they might actually live through this day.</p><p>Temperance smiled and shook the hand of a vivacious lady in a plum-colored dress as the lady exclaimed about the \u201cpoor little wretches.\u201d She was leaving and, despite her rather unfortunate choice of words, seemed genuinely moved by the orphanage.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Nell muttered behind Temperance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but she\u2019s quite enthusiastic,\u201d Temperance whispered back.</p><p>\u201cNo, not her. Her.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked over their guest\u2019s head to see Lady Caire picking her way across the cobblestones, her mouth twisted in distaste. She wore an entirely inappropriate gold and blue brocade dress and held the hand of a gentleman in a ginger wig and lavender coat. The Maiden Lane spectators were quite taken with her, many elbowing their neighbor as she passed. Fortunately, Mr. St. John had seen her approaching and intercepted her, apparently pointing out the home\u2019s rather sad architecture. He couldn\u2019t hold her off forever, though.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Temperance groaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d Nell hissed, all agog.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lady Caire,\u201d Temperance murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s quite horrible.\u201d</p><p>A muffled giggle came from behind them.</p><p>Temperance turned and to her horror saw that they weren\u2019t alone. Lady Hero, in a striking silvery-blue dress, had somehow entered the little hallway and, what was worse, had obviously heard her.</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Temperance muttered, beginning a curtsy and then changing her mind halfway down and popping back up too fast. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean... that is... uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is rather horrible,\u201d Lady Hero said, smiling faintly. \u201cBut if you will credit it I\u2019ve heard her discuss the plight of poor children before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Temperance asked faintly. She darted another look at the street. Lady Caire had stopped to argue about something with her escort. She turned back to Lady Hero. \u201cSo she might actually be interested in our home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes. As am I,\u201d Lady Hero said almost diffidently. \u201cI was orphaned at the age of eight, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero waved aside her apology. \u201cIt was a long time ago now. But there are any number of ladies who are interested to one degree or another with the welfare of poor infants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was Temperance\u2019s not very eloquent reply. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her to seek a patroness. Somehow she had been thinking all along about a patron who would be like Sir Stanley Gilpin\u2014older, wealthy, and male\u2014when perhaps she should\u2019ve been focusing merely on the wealthy bit. She smiled at Lady Hero. \u201cHow wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero smiled. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll be so kind as to show me about your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Temperance said, but Winter descended the stairs at that moment.</p><p>\u201cSister, have you seen Mary Whitsun?\u201d Winter had a line between his brows.</p><p>\u201cNot since this morning.\u201d She turned to look at Nell.</p><p>The maidservant shrugged. \u201cShall I look for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Nell,\u201d Winter said.</p><p>Nell hurried up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Mr. Makepeace,\u201d Lady Hero said.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lady Hero Batten, Winter,\u201d Temperance said.</p><p>\u201cAn honor to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Winter bowed.</p><p>\u201cI was just telling Mrs. Dews\u2014\u201d the lady began, but Nell came rushing back in the room again. She held Joseph Tinbox by one arm.</p><p>\u201cTell her what you\u2019ve told me,\u201d Nell demanded of Joseph. \u201cTell her where Mary Whitsun went!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left,\u201d Joseph said succinctly. His brown eyes were wide, his face so pale the freckles stood out. \u201cShe said it was all right. She said everyone was too busy.\u201d</p><p>Temperance felt ice form in her breast. \u201cToo busy for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman came and said there was a babe what needed fetching,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cMary went with her.\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced out the door. The sky had already begun to darken, night slinking into St. Giles like an alley cat.</p><p>Dear God. Mary Whitsun was out in St. Giles at night with a mad killer on the loose.</p><p>LAZARUS DRIFTED THROUGH the late afternoon streets of St. Giles. The sun was beginning to set, the feeble rays withdrawing swiftly from tall buildings, overhanging eaves, and a myriad of swinging signs. Lazarus leapt over the corpse of a cat in the gutter and continued on his way.</p><p>He was close, very close, to finding Marie\u2019s murderer. Again and again he\u2019d come back to St. Giles, and this trip he felt might very well be the last one\u2014for better or worse. Danger was lurking here, sharpening its claws, waiting for him to make a false move.</p><p>Danger or not, something deep inside him felt it only right to balance the scales. He needed to see that Marie\u2019s murderer was punished before he could move on with Temperance. And he needed to see Temperance again. Badly. He had no doubt that the breath would stop in his chest if he could no longer touch her, speak to her, and watch those amazing golden-flecked eyes reflect her true emotions.</p><p>But first he had to find Marie\u2019s murderer.</p><p>To that end, he\u2019d tried speaking to Tommy Pett thrice in the last week\u2014the boy must know something about the connection between Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease and his sister. But each time Lazarus had called at Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s establishment, Tommy had been unaccountably absent. Perhaps a late daytime call would find him in.</p><p>In another fifteen minutes, he turned into Running Man Lane, following its twists and turns until it spilled into the courtyard where Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s whorehouse was. But as he neared, he could hear bawling and raised voices. His last few steps were made at a run.</p><p>The sight that greeted him in the courtyard was an odd one: the ladies\u2014and boys\u2014of the night all seemed to be standing in the courtyard, many holding candles or lanterns. Some argued, some wept, and some simply stood stunned. At that moment, Pansy walked out of the whorehouse with her hulking guard, Jacky, behind her. Lazarus began pushing through the crowd, even as Jacky raised his massive hands above his head and clapped them together, effectively silencing the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cThe house has been searched. No one lurks within. The danger is gone,\u201d Pansy said in her deep voice. \u201cNow I want all of you to go back inside.\u201d</p><p>Jacky clapped his hands together again, and one by one, the whores moved reluctantly inside.</p><p>A big woman in purple silk braced her hands on her hips. \u201cAn\u2019 \u2019ow are we to know it\u2019s safe in there?\u201d</p><p>Pansy shot her a stern look. \u201cBecause I say \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>The woman turned red-faced and shuffled inside.</p><p>Lazarus stepped forward and Pansy caught sight of him. She jerked her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re not wanted here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was undeterred. Wanted or not, he had the feeling that what was inside the whorehouse was of importance to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing you need worry about,\u201d she muttered, and turned aside as if to leave him there.</p><p>Without thinking, he caught at her shoulder before she could disappear inside the house, then felt more than saw Jacky swing at him. The guard was a big man, but he had a big man\u2019s slowness. Lazarus easily ducked inside the blow and punched him hard in the gut. Jacky fell heavily to his knees.</p> <p>Pansy made a distressed sound and wrapped her tiny arms about the big man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>Lazarus stepped back but kept his hands fisted. It wouldn\u2019t do to underestimate Jacky.</p><p>Pansy sighed, her misshapen face looking a little gray. \u201cI\u2019m as good as dead anyway. Come inside.\u201d</p><p>Jacky lumbered to his feet, shooting a nasty look at Lazarus, but he stood aside to let him in.</p><p>Lazarus entered the house with the hairs on the back of his neck on end. The guard wouldn\u2019t mind killing him. Only Pansy\u2019s will kept him from attacking.</p> <p>She made no other comment but led the way up the stairs. A few whores still lingered in the hallways, gossiping, but at the sight of the madam, they vanished into their rooms. Pansy stopped at a door midway down the upper hallway and cast an inscrutable glance at Lazarus before she pushed it open.</p><p>The smell hit him first, the stench of bowels and blood. The body on the bed had been gutted\u2014just like Marie. He stepped closer, mindful of the dark smears on the floor, and gazed into the waxen face. It was Tommy, the boy\u2019s countenance oddly serene above the violence of his body.</p><p>Lazarus looked back at Pansy. She was staring fixedly at the horror on the bed, but at his look, she jerked her chin at him. \u201cCome downstairs. I need a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door behind them, and they all tramped down the stairs silently and into her little sitting room. Pansy sat in her special chair, gesturing for Lazarus to sit opposite her.</p><p>\u201cTea, Jacky.\u201d When the big man didn\u2019t move, she nodded wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Lord Caire won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The guard grunted and left the room.</p> <p>\u201cHe was killed the same way as Marie and the other prostitutes,\u201d Lazarus said softly. \u201cHe must have known the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Pansy seemed to be in a meditative mood, her chin propped on a fist.</p><p>\u201cMistress Pansy.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily, looking up. \u201cYes. Yes, of course he knew the murderer.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus narrowed his eyes. \u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze squarely. \u201cAs do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it, Pansy?\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand as the door opened. Jacky entered, carrying a delicate tea tray in his huge hands.</p> <p>She smiled at him as he set the tray down. \u201cThank you, Jacky. Could you please guard the door for me?\u201d</p><p>The big man shot a suspicious glance at Lazarus and trundled out.</p><p>Pansy waited until the door was closed. Then she looked at Lazarus. \u201cIt\u2019s the owner of this house. She controls all the prostitutes in her little corner of St. Giles. They each must pay a portion of their earnings to her, even if it\u2019s only a few pennies. Marie refused. And Tommy, that fool...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in disgust and poured herself a cup of tea.</p><p>Lazarus made himself sit patiently.</p><p>She took the full teacup, but then merely stared into the tea. \u201cI think he tried to blackmail her. I think that\u2019s what set her off. She was here tonight visiting Tommy, and she left in a hurry. Tommy must\u2019ve known all along who\u2019d killed his sister, and once you started asking questions, he figured she would pay him to keep her secret. He was pretty, but not very smart.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus closed his eyes. He was so close. \u201cWho, Pansy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Heart\u2019s-Ease.\u201d</p><p>His felt his pulse begin to race. Finally. \u201cThe bawd who runs the gin shop?\u201d</p><p>Pansy\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cShe\u2019s much more than that. She\u2019s the most powerful woman in this part of St. Giles. And the most dangerous. You saw Tommy. She did that in a houseful of people. She\u2019s in a berserker rage. She\u2019s burning her bridges behind her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why kill Marie and the other prostitutes so dramatically?\u201d</p><p>Pansy shrugged. \u201cTo scare away her competitors, her allies, her whores\u2014anyone and everyone, in fact.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll kill me afore the sennight\u2019s out, I think,\u201d Pansy said dispassionately, and finally took a sip of her tea. \u201cMe and whoever else she thinks has betrayed her or stands in her way. You\u2019d better watch your step as well. She\u2019s already killed Tommy to keep him from talking to you\u2014and to Mrs. Dews.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus raised his eyebrows, his alarm growing. \u201cMrs. Dews?\u201d</p><p>Pansy set her teacup carefully on the tray. \u201cI think Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease sees Mrs. Dews as a sort of rival for control of St. Giles. She doesn\u2019t like that Mrs. Dews rescues the children Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease would rather sell\u2014or whore out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll go after Temperance Dews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lazarus felt his muscles tighten in alarm.</p><p>Pansy looked at him with a terrible fatalistic tragedy in her eyes. \u201cOne of the girls here brought in a lass tonight\u2014the one Mrs. Dews dotes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease took the girl with her when she left.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus sprang to his feet, dashing to the door as Pansy\u2019s last words floated after him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease means to strike at Mrs. Dews through the girl.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cWhat you feel is the sorrow of loss,\u201d Meg said. \u201cWhat you feel is love. And,\u201d she continued as the little blue bird flew back in the room and lit on the king\u2019s hand, \u201cthat is love also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not understand,\u201d the king said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel now?\u201d Meg asked.</p><p>King Lockedheart frowned as he gently stroked the little bird\u2019s head. \u201cJoy. Happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the joy of love.\u201d Meg smiled. \u201cTo experience your love for the bird, you must be willing to let her go. And in exchange, the bird displays her love for you by returning.\u201d...</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>Dear God.</p><p>Temperance felt her knees give way in horror. Not Mary Whitsun. Not her darling Mary Whitsun.</p><p>She felt Nell wrap an arm around her to brace her. Lady Hero was looking concerned. Mr. St. John ushered Lady Caire and her escort in and after a brief word with Winter, shot Temperance a grave look before showing the lady up the stairs. Winter took the rest of them into the kitchen. Temperance sank into a chair. She needed to rescue Mary, but how could she when they didn\u2019t even know where Mary had gone?</p><p>\u201cWe need to search for her,\u201d Winter was saying. \u201cWhere was the baby Mary was fetching?\u201d</p><p>Someone started pounding on the kitchen door. \u201cTemperance!\u201d</p><p>It was Caire\u2019s voice. Temperance jumped up and flew to the door, fumbling with the bar, her hands trembling.</p><p>She threw open the door and fell into Lazarus\u2019s arms, and for a moment she simply stood there, shaking against him. He was so large, so warm, and he was here when she most needed him.</p><p>He clutched her to his chest. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head against him. \u201cMary Whitsun is missing.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up. \u201cI know. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease has her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just come from Mrs. Whiteside\u2019s house. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease is Mrs. Whiteside. She seems to have lured Mary Whitsun there with the help of one of the prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must go at once.\u201d Temperance grabbed her cloak, hanging on a peg by the door.</p><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019s something else.\u201d Caire caught her arm, but it was Winter he addressed. \u201cMother Heart\u2019s-Ease is the murderer.\u201d</p><p>Temperance stared at him. \u201cMarie\u2019s murderer? The one who has been...?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She sobbed once before pulling herself together. \u201cThen the matter is even more urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said gently, \u201cbut there\u2019s also a possibility of a trap. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease has a particular dislike of you, it seems.\u201d</p><p>Winter stirred. \u201cThen she should not go.\u201d</p><p>Temperance rounded on him in a fury. \u201cNot go? It\u2019s Mary Whitsun! I can\u2019t leave her with that woman, trap or no.\u201d</p><p>Winter began to protest, but Caire looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany her and keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take my footmen as well.\u201d</p><p>They all turned at the voice. Lady Caire had entered the small kitchen with her beau. Two burly footmen stood behind her. She met Lazarus\u2019s eyes for a minute.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Caire took Temperance\u2019s hand and then they were out the door and into the night with the footmen following.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she want with Mary Whitsun?\u201d Temperance panted as they hurried.</p><p>Caire shook his head. \u201cShe may be merely a lure. In which case she\u2019s probably in no danger.\u201d</p><p>Temperance shivered. \u201cBut Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease hates me, you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Pansy.\u201d He hesitated, glancing about them as they rounded a corner. \u201cShe\u2019s already killed Tommy Pett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Temperance tried to control her rising panic. Why had she never told Mary how much she loved her? Why had she kept her at arm\u2019s length? \u201cThen she may kill her simply to spite me.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus didn\u2019t answer, merely squeezing her hand.</p><p>The journey seemed to take hours, but it was only minutes later when they and the two footmen made Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s gin shop.</p><p>Lazarus eyed the door and broke apart his stick.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d he said to Temperance. \u201cYou two\u201d\u2014he jerked his chin at the footmen\u2014\u201cto either side of me.\u201d</p><p>Temperance nodded, watching as he pushed the door open with his foot.</p><p>The sight within was a strange one. The gin shop was nearly empty, but the overturned tables and broken chairs told of a struggle. Two bodies lay upon the floor\u2014Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s guards. The one-eyed barmaid cowered under the remains of a table. In the center of the room stood the Ghost of St. Giles, his sword tip at the throat of the last guard. At their entrance, the Ghost glanced at them from behind his black mask but made no other move or sound.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is!\u201d the guard blubbered. \u201cMother Heart\u2019s-Ease \u2019eard you were comin\u2019 and ran out the back door. She could be anywheres now.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost merely pressed his sword to the man\u2019s throat. The guard yipped and a trickle of blood ran down his neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d called the barmaid. \u201cOh, don\u2019t hurt Davy!\u201d</p><p>The footmen looked uneasily at Caire.</p><p>\u201cTell him where Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease is, then,\u201d Lazarus said in a calm voice.</p><p>Temperance saw the Ghost\u2019s mouth twitch up at the corner as if in sardonic approval.</p><p>\u201cShe was going after you.\u201d The girl pointed at Temperance.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Temperance asked.</p><p>\u201cTo yer home,\u201d the girl said. \u201cSaid she\u2019d make sure you\u2019d leave St. Giles once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Temperance frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Lazarus. \u201cWas she alone? Did she have a girl with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe \u2019ad one of yer lasses,\u201d the barmaid said. \u201cNow leave my Davy alone. She\u2019s not \u2019ere, I tell you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d best get back to the home,\u201d Lazarus said grimly.</p><p>\u201cBut what is she about?\u201d Temperance cried. The fact that Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease had taken Mary with her when she fled sent chills down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lazarus looked at the Ghost. \u201cAre you with us?\u201d</p><p>The harlequin nodded and with a graceful spin was out the door and running lightly down the street.</p> <p>\u201cHurry!\u201d Caire called to the footmen. He took her hand again and they retraced their steps.</p><p>Night had fallen fully. Signs swung overhead, creaking eerily in the wind. Now and again, they could see the moon, floating bloated and weak behind drifting clouds. The Ghost of St. Giles ran ahead, his footfalls nearly silent. As they neared the home, Temperance could see an odd orangey-red light flickering over the rooftops, teasing and coy, but becoming bolder as they ran.</p><p>And then she smelled the smoke.</p><p>\u201cDear God!\u201d She couldn\u2019t even put into words her fear.</p><p>They rounded the corner and saw. The home was on fire. For a dreadful moment, the sound seemed to stop in Temperance\u2019s ears and all she heard was a kind of rushing noise. Oddly she focused on Lady Caire, standing by herself in the middle of Maiden Lane. Lazarus\u2019s mother had one hand to her mouth, and she was gazing up\u2014at the top of the foundling home. That sight was what brought Temperance back suddenly and all at once. People were shouting. Nell was there, shaking her arm, and she could smell the smoke now, a dreadful hint of the chaos within.</p> <p>\u201cAre they out?\u201d she shouted at Nell. There were children milling about her. \u201cAre all the children out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Nell replied.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take count!\u201d Temperance shouted.</p><p>Maiden Lane was in chaos. People screamed and ran back and forth, the aristocrats who had come to view the home mingled with the everyday folk of St. Giles. A bucket line had formed. The ragged cobbler who lived in the cellar next door handed a bucket of water to a footman in full livery who handed it to the fishmonger\u2019s wife who handed it to a lord in a snowy white wig and so on. It was a bizarre sight. Temperance turned and looked behind her at the home.</p><p>And caught her breath.</p><p>Flames were shooting out the upper windows, smoke billowing in a gray-black cloud. At that moment, Winter and St. John staggered from the house.</p> <p>\u201cWinter!\u201d Temperance called.</p><p>He carried a small boy in his arms. \u201cNo one else is in the nurseries. I think we got them all. Did you count the children?\u201d</p><p>Temperance turned to Nell.</p><p>\u201cSix and twenty\u2014all but Mary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>Temperance clutched at Lazarus\u2019s arm. \u201cWhere is she? Where could Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease have taken her?\u201d</p><p>But when she looked at him, he was staring up at the building. \u201cChrist\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>She followed his gaze. Atop the roof, a tall, gaunt woman in a tattered man\u2019s scarlet military coat was picking her way across the shingles.</p><p>The harlequin flashed by them silently and disappeared into the house next to the foundling home.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is Mary Whitsun?\u201d Temperance fisted one hand at her breast. No, it couldn\u2019t be. No one would be so terrible as to leave a child in that inferno.</p><p>But Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease was clearly alone.</p><p>Temperance burst into tears. Dear God, Mary Whitsun was in a burning building, dying.</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s bloody stones,\u201d Caire muttered, and before she could speak, he was gone.</p><p>Gone inside the burning home.</p><p>THE LOWER FLOORS were relatively clear, but as Lazarus ran up the wooden stairs, the smoke rapidly built. He threw his cloak over his head, holding part of it against his mouth, but it provided little barrier against the smoke. He choked, fighting his body\u2019s urge to return to clean air. Dear God, he could hardly see, let alone breathe. Everything was gray with smoke. He looked about the floor where the children slept.</p><p>\u201cMary!\u201d</p><p>His bellow turned to a hacking cough and was lost in the roar of the fire. She might not even be here. He might be on a fatal fool\u2019s mission. But the sight of Temperance\u2019s despair had been too much for him to bear. If the child was here, he would find her.</p><p>The inferno moaned like a live thing, lurking in the floor above\u2014the floor where Temperance and her brother had rooms. He narrowed his stinging eyes against the smoke as he climbed the rickety staircase. If he survived this hell, he\u2019d be damned sure the home was better built next time. Tears streaked his face but evaporated almost at once in the heat.</p><p>The upper hall boiled with smoke.</p><p>Where would a madwoman hide a child? Lazarus fell to his knees, crawling, the tears blurring his eyes. If the girl was at the far end of the hall, she was gone now, but Temperance\u2019s room was not yet engulfed. He had to at least check.</p><p>He reached up to turn the doorknob, shoving the door open with his shoulder. \u201cMary!\u201d</p><p>An answering cry.</p><p>He was blind now, so he felt with his hand, finding and clutching at a small foot. She was bound, lying on the floor next to the bed. She crowded against him as if she might burrow her small body into his, and he felt the wiggling fur of the cat she held. He broke apart his stick and used the sword to cut the rope about her legs and hands. Then he tucked her under one arm and dragged her toward the stairs. The flames were blasting in his face, licking down his throat, trying to set him afire from within. His lungs ached. There was a terrible roaring in his ears, and he realized, suddenly and fatefully, that the house was giving way. The cat leapt from the girl\u2019s arms.</p><p>Temperance loved this child, even if she\u2019d never admitted it.</p><p>He shoved Mary\u2019s little body ahead of him. Dear God, let her at least live. \u201cRun! Run now!\u201d</p><p>He might\u2019ve said more, but at that moment, hell opened up and swallowed him whole.</p><p>THE HOME WAS dying, and Caire and Mary Whitsun were still inside.</p><p>Temperance watched as a section of the roof suddenly slid and came tumbling down to the cobblestones. For a moment, two figures were silhouetted against the flames: Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s cadaverous form and the quick shadow of the Ghost of St. Giles. Then they were both gone. Temperance couldn\u2019t muster the energy to wonder what had happened to them. All her will, all her hopes and prayers, were centered on Lazarus and Mary.</p><p>Fire licked up from a broken window, the room beyond entirely golden with flame. The crowd had quieted, as if in awe, as the roar of the fire had grown louder. The bucket line was still struggling heroically, but their efforts had no visible effect on the flames.</p><p>There was a sudden shriek, and Temperance watched, detached, as the Ghost of St. Giles dragged Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease from inside the neighboring house. It was a bizarre sight. Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease fought like a maddened wolf, but the Ghost had his hand locked about her upper arm and easily contained her. He shoved her at Mr. St. John, pointing with a gloved finger first at the burning home and then at the screaming woman, as if any of them needed an explanation. St. John\u2019s face hardened, and he called over two loitering footmen to help him hold the murderess.</p><p>Then the Ghost of St. Giles simply walked away into the crowd. No one gainsaid him.</p><p>Temperance didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI must go in,\u201d she said to no one in particular, and started forward, only to find her arm in Winter\u2019s firm grip.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She turned her face to his, pleading.</p><p>She could see tears in his eyes. \u201cNo, sister. You must remain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll burn,\u201d she whispered, turning back to the fire. \u201cHe\u2019ll burn and I don\u2019t know if I can bear it.\u201d</p><p>Winter said no more, even when she collapsed to her knees. She was bereft, here on the muddy cobblestones, watching her love die. He was her love, she knew it now that it was far too late to tell him. Caire was both stronger and more vulnerable than any man she\u2019d ever known before. He saw her flaws, saw her anger and sexual need, and her pretense of being someone better than she really was, and he didn\u2019t care. It was odd; she\u2019d always thought she\u2019d love someone who saw only the best in her when all along it was the man who saw everything\u2014the good and the bad\u2014who she loved.</p><p>And now it was too late.</p><p>Her throat was raw, and Temperance realized she was screaming, trying to crawl forward, Winter\u2019s hold on her arm preventing her.</p><p>And then a small form appeared, walking from the smoke and flames. Mary Whitsun emerged from the burning home like a miracle. She saw Temperance and ran to her. Temperance hugged her close, crying and kissing her face, squeezing her much too tight in her sorrow and joy.</p><p>Until Mary Whitsun raised her tear-streaked face. \u201cHe\u2019s still inside, Lord Caire. He came for me, but he shoved me down the stairs. He\u2019s still inside.\u201d</p><p>Something crunched and then gave way, and the entire front half of the house collapsed in on itself.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>King Lockedheart was very pleased with this demonstration. To reward Meg, he offered to give her anything she asked for\u2014anything at all.</p><p>Meg smiled. \u201cI thank you, Your Majesty, but all I wish for is a little pony and a pack of provisions, for I long to see what the wide world is like.\u201d</p><p>The king frowned at this, for he\u2019d become rather fond of Meg. But no matter how he argued, Meg was quite firm: She would leave on the morrow to go exploring. This put the king into a foul mood, and he was terribly curt with her for the rest of the wonderful meal. Meg for her part was cheerful, ignoring the king\u2019s more sarcastic comments.</p><p>And at the end of the evening, she left the king sitting all alone in his dining room....</p><p>\u2014from King Lockedheart</p><p>The rain was gentle at first. It drifted down, as soft as a mother\u2019s kiss on a sleeping child. Temperance didn\u2019t notice the drops falling from above until the fire began to hiss. And then, all at once, the clouds above opened up, pouring rain down like a waterfall, the drops so hard that they ricocheted off the cobblestones, splashing back up as they hit. The fire fought back, hissing and spitting its defiance, great waves of steam rising up. But the rain was stronger, more relentless, and the flames began to fall back.</p><p>And in the midst of all this, a figure in a black, swirling cloak emerged from the clouds of steam, limping but walking steadily.</p><p>Temperance rose to her feet, a cry strangled in her throat. His silver hair was tarnished by the smoke, but it was him. It was Caire. She pulled away from Winter and ran, slipping on the wet cobblestones, blinded by the rain and her own tears, rushing toward her heart. As she neared, a black singed cat struggled from under his cloak and streaked straight to Mary Whitsun.</p><p>Caire coughed. \u201cI loathe cats.\u201d</p><p>Temperance sobbed once.</p><p>He caught her hard, pulling her under his cloak, kissing her with a smoke-filled mouth, there in the rain in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she sobbed, rubbing her hands over his face, his hair, his chest, making sure he was solid and real. \u201cI love you, and I thought you were dead. I couldn\u2019t bear it. I thought I would die too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d walk through fire for you,\u201d he rasped, his voice hoarse and broken. \u201cI have walked through fire for you.\u201d</p><p>She choked on a laugh, and he kissed her again, his mouth hard, tasting of smoke and fire, and she\u2019d never tasted anything so wonderful before, because he was alive.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>He broke their kiss, resting his forehead against hers. \u201cI love you, Temperance Dews, more than life itself.\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve said more, but she kissed him again, softly this time, trying to convey everything she felt with just her lips.</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Someone cleared their throat nearby.</p><p>Lazarus pulled back from the kiss enough to mutter, \u201cYes, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Temperance blinked and turned her head. Lady Caire stood beside them, her elegant white coiffure ineffectively shielded by a coat held over her head by her shivering companion. She looked wet and cold and hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCaire,\u201d Temperance whispered.</p><p>He lifted his head to glance at his mother. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done making a public display of yourself,\u201d Lady Caire said, \u201cthe children need to be seen to, and there\u2019s an insane woman Godric St. John says started the fire and murdered three women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern is touching as always,\u201d Caire began, but then Temperance pinched his earlobe. \u201cOuch.\u201d He looked down at her.</p> <p>Goodness, aristocrats were idiots at times! \u201cYour mother was very worried for you.\u201d</p><p>Caire lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lazarus.\u201d Lady Caire\u2019s voice was clear and certain. But then her lower lip trembled. \u201cYou\u2019re my son. I may not express my love effectively, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and stared at her in wonder. And he probably would\u2019ve continued to stare, dumbstruck, if Temperance hadn\u2019t pinched him again.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d He shot a glare at her.</p> <p>She arched a brow at him pointedly.</p><p>\u201cMother, mine.\u201d Caire leaned down gingerly and kissed his mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cA wise woman once told me that just because love isn\u2019t expressed doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t felt.\u201d</p><p>Lady Caire\u2019s eyes welled with tears. \u201cDoes that mean you love me as well?\u201d</p><p>A corner of Lazarus\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u201cI think it must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you listened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word you have ever uttered,\u201d Caire whispered, \u201cis engraved upon my heart.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Caire closed her eyes as if she\u2019d received a benediction.</p><p>Then her eyes snapped open. \u201cYes, well. What shall we do with all these children?\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced at the home. The fire looked nearly out, but there was not much left beyond smoldering ruins. Dear God. It only now occurred to her that they had nowhere to take seven and twenty children, and although she\u2019d set out this morning to find a patron for the home, now she no longer even had a home.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they can come to my town house,\u201d Caire started doubtfully.</p><p>His mother snorted. \u201cThe home of a bachelor gentleman? I think not. The majority will come to my town house for the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can find places for some as well.\u201d Lady Hero had approached quietly. \u201cMy brother has a house standing nearly empty. He\u2019s in the country for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Temperance hardly knew what to say to such generosity.</p><p>\u201cI can help with the little ones,\u201d Mary Whitsun said. Her lower lip trembled. \u201cUntil I find an apprenticeship, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Temperance laid her hand gently on Mary\u2019s sooty hair. \u201cHow would you like to remain at the home\u2014wherever the home might be\u2014and help as long as you\u2019d like?\u201d</p><p>Mary Whitsun\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cI\u2019d like that, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Temperance blinked back yet more tears.</p><p>Lady Hero smiled at the two of them. Her titian hair was wet and straggling about her shoulders, and yet she still seemed dignified and every inch the sister of a duke. \u201cWhen you are settled, I would like to discuss building a new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs would I,\u201d Lady Caire said. For a moment, both ladies eyed each other.</p><p>\u201cLarger, do you think?\u201d Lady Hero murmured.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with room for the children to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite,\u201d Lady Caire replied decisively, and smiled at the younger woman.</p><p>They seemed to have come to some sort of unspoken pact.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Temperance said, dazed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in for it now,\u201d Caire murmured irreverently in her ear. \u201cWith my mother and the sister of a duke attending to your affairs.\u201d</p><p>But she ignored his teasing, hugging him in her glee. The home had not one but two patronesses!</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to contribute something to the home as well.\u201d His tone was oddly diffident.</p><p>She looked up at him and said, \u201cThank you. We\u2019d be most honored to have you as a patron as well.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her quickly and then Caire sighed. \u201cI need to attend to that.\u201d He nodded his head to where St. John held Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease with the two footmen. \u201cWill you stay here?\u201d</p><p>Temperance smiled up at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, Mother, my lady.\u201d He made an abbreviated bow to both ladies.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cI think we need to organize these children.\u201d She raised her eyebrows at Lady Caire.</p><p>That lady nodded and as one, the women wheeled to descend on Nell and the group of children.</p><p>Caire shivered with mock apprehension. \u201cThose two are going to be formidable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what we need,\u201d Temperance said with satisfaction.</p><p>He hugged her to his side as they approached St. John and the struggling Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease.</p><p>St. John looked at Caire. \u201cWhat is this about? Why would this women set fire to the home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed Marie,\u201d Caire said grimly. \u201cAnd Marie\u2019s brother, too, when he tried to blackmail her. She realized that we were getting close to discovering her, and she came here to kill Mrs. Dews, I think.\u201d</p><p>Temperance looked at the gaunt woman with loathing. \u201cAll the children were inside the home as well. She would\u2019ve killed many more than just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She didn\u2019t care.\u201d Caire nodded at St. John. \u201cIf we search her gin shop, we might find evidence of the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d St. John replied. He flipped back the ragged red man\u2019s coat that Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease wore. Beneath, rusty stains splashed across the bosom of her dress and down the front.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Temperance whispered, covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>It was apparently too much for Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease. She lunged, shrieking obscenities like a madwoman, which, it was quite apparent, she was. Both footmen were hauled forward at the strength of her attack. Caire swung Temperance behind him and backed several steps, putting them both well out of Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her to gaol in my carriage,\u201d St. John shouted above the woman\u2019s ravings.</p><p>Caire nodded. \u201cBind her well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d St. John replied. \u201cI\u2019m taking no chance of her escaping.\u201d</p><p>The men set about their grim task.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Caire whispered in Temperance\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019re wet and cold and so am I. Let\u2019s find a carriage to take us home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Winter...\u201d Temperance glanced about and spotted her brother helping to herd the children.</p><p>Winter caught her look and raised his hand, jogging over. \u201cI\u2019m to help Lady Caire and Lady Hero to settle the children, especially the boys. They\u2019ll be staying at the Duke of Wakefield\u2019s house, and they\u2019ll need supervision there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must help,\u201d Temperance began.</p><p>Winter laid his hand on her shoulder. \u201cNo need. There\u2019s enough people between the servants and Nell and me.\u201d</p><p>Caire nodded above her. \u201cI\u2019m taking her home and giving her a warm bath.\u201d</p><p>Winter eyed Caire without speaking. And then he stuck out his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Caire took his hand, shaking it firmly. \u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d</p><p>Winter looked between Caire and Temperance, his brow arched, but he merely said, \u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>Caire nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Winter bussed Temperance on the cheek and ran back to the children.</p><p>\u201cNow to find a carriage,\u201d Caire muttered, then grimaced. \u201cDamn it, I forgot to thank St. John for capturing Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t,\u201d Temperance exclaimed.</p><p>He turned to look at her.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t help but laugh; it was such a silly thing after all that had happened. \u201cThe Ghost of St. Giles appeared with her while you were inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, in front of everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He marched right up to St. John and gave Mother Heart\u2019s-Ease to him. I think we were all too stunned to detain him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd St. John was there at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked at him curiously.</p><p>Caire shook his head. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been there. I\u2019d enjoy very much finding out who it is that hides behind that mask.\u201d</p><p>Temperance wrapped her arm about his side as they started for the carriages. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mystery that we\u2019ll have to save for another day.\u201d</p><p>TEMPERANCE WOULD HAVE fallen asleep on the carriage ride to Caire\u2019s house if she weren\u2019t so nervous with anticipation. She had told Lazarus that she loved him, but there was still something yet\u2014she needed to show him.</p><p>So when the carriage stopped outside his town house, she took his hand and led him silently inside.</p><p>\u201cI smell of smoke,\u201d he protested as they climbed the grand staircase together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she replied. \u201cI nearly lost you today.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was leaping in her chest so violently that she thought she might well faint. She had a second chance. Dear God, Caire was giving her a second chance. Whatever she did, she mustn\u2019t mess it up. She carefully closed his bedroom door behind them and then stood before him.</p><p>\u201cI want to... no, I need to show you how much I love you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for the last week. How you thought I felt I was degrading myself by making love to you.\u201d</p><p>He started to speak, but she placed her forefinger across his lips.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d She inhaled to fortify her courage and deliberately trailed her finger across his lips, over his jaw, and down his neck. \u201cPlease let me.\u201d</p><p>He held very still, barely breathing. She knew this caused him pain, but she did it anyway. She needed to teach him that touch\u2014especially her touch\u2014need not bring him pain, that it could be pleasurable as well, and the only way she knew to demonstrate the lesson was to show him.</p><p>\u201cI want to see if I can find a way\u201d\u2014she held his gaze as she untied his cloak\u2014\u201cto do this without it hurting you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me.\u201d</p><p>The cord rasped softly as it slid apart. She took the cloak from his shoulders, carefully placing it along with his hat next to the candle atop the chair. When she turned back to him, he was still standing, watching her curiously. He\u2019d made no move to take off any more of his clothing.</p><p>\u201cYou healed me.\u201d She swallowed and placed her hands on his shoulders. His jerk this time was softer, as if he either strove to contain the pain or it had receded a bit. She hoped it was the latter. \u201cYou made me whole again after years of suffering. I\u2019d like to do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, gently, she took off his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth. When she began unbuttoning his shirt, she could feel him shivering under her fingertips. For a moment, her courage failed her. What if forcing her touch on him merely made him more sensitive to it? Gave him more pain?</p><p>Then she looked into his face.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t be disappointed if this doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll still love you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>She felt tears prick her eyes at his calm acceptance of her and what she wanted to do. Whatever happened, they were in this together and that at least made her feel better.</p><p>Bit by bit, one article of clothing at a time, she undressed him in near-complete silence. By the time they got down to his smallclothes, she was out of breath and he was already erect under the cloth. Her hands shook as she divested him of his last article of clothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stood back and looked at him.</p><p>He was magnificent nude. His silver hair spread over his shoulders, long enough to brush his dark nipples. In contrast, the hair on his body was nearly black. Dark curls swirled between his nipples in a diamond-shaped pattern on his chest. His hard belly was bare, but just below his navel, the dark hair began again, in a thin line that trailed to the curls around his manhood. His legs were long and strong, his shoulders broad and muscled. And his eyes\u2014dear God, his eyes!\u2014watching her silently, sparkling sapphire blue, as he waited for her next move.</p><p>\u201cTell me if I go too far,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf it hurts too much, if you want to stop.\u201d</p><p>His deep sapphire eyes were trusting. \u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>She placed her palms flat against his bare chest, firmly, and gently pushed him to sit on the bed. She was expecting his flinch by this point, but she didn\u2019t give in to it, keeping her hands against his warm skin as he inhaled deeply. When he had settled, she slid her palms slowly down his torso, feeling the smoothness of his skin, the tickling abrasion of his body hair. She watched his eyes as they darkened to midnight blue; she paused and then slid her hands back up his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to simply look at your bare body for so long.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted, but he didn\u2019t comment. He inhaled, his chest swelling and deflating beneath her palms. He was so alive, so vital, and for the moment he was all hers.</p><p>She gave a gentle shove, making him lie back on the bed.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he lay obediently.</p> <p>She went to his chest of drawers and searched until she found his neatly folded neckcloths. She drew five out and turned back to his great bed. \u201cWhen you tied me, I was forced to accept your lovemaking without giving in return. I\u2019d like to do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, but he nodded once, firmly.</p><p>She began tying his right ankle to the post at the bottom of the bed. She finished that foot and looked at him. He was breathing faster, but his eyes were calm. She tied his other foot and both his wrists. The knots were loose, and in any case, she was fairly certain he could tear himself free from the bonds if he truly wished. But that didn\u2019t matter. The point was merely to give him the feeling of helplessness.</p><p>And to that end, she approached the bed with the last neckcloth between her fingers.</p><p>His sapphire eyes glittered as she laid the neckcloth across them and tied it firmly to the back of his head. She brushed her fingers over his cheek. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p> <p>His voice sounded sensuous. Anticipatory.</p><p>She stood back and looked at her handiwork. He filled the huge bed. She\u2019d tied his wrists to one post. His fisted hands were stretched over his head, the muscles bulging in his upper arms. The neckcloth covered his face from his brow to the middle of his nose. His lips were parted as he waited for her next move, his face turned to her as if he tracked her movements by sound. She shivered, remembering how it had felt when he blindfolded her\u2014her senses primed by the dark. His broad chest heaved. His penis lay thick and ruddy against the paler skin of his flat belly.</p><p>Dear God, she was growing wet merely looking at him. For the first time in her life, she welcomed her own arousal. She half closed her eyes, glorying in the sensation of her heavy breasts, of her thighs rubbing together. This was who she was, whether she liked it or not, a woman who wanted and needed sex. Who loved sex. And tonight she would use that part of herself\u2014the part she\u2019d always despised\u2014to heal this man she loved.</p><p>Quietly, she removed her clothing, bodice, stays, dress, underskirts, stockings, and shoes. When she took off her chemise, his nostrils flared. Could he scent her arousal? She could smell it herself, faint and tangy. She would usually be wildly embarrassed at her own body\u2019s scent and moisture, but she willed the embarrassment away.</p><p>She needed to be bold and without fear to do this.</p><p>For a moment, she stood by the bed, not touching him, not moving, merely breathing in and out, feeling her own body, watching his. Then she touched one finger to his nipple\u2014as he had once done to her. His chest heaved at the touch, but he made no sound.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She circled his nipple, small and dark against his pale skin. It pebbled as she touched him. She inhaled as well, her chest suddenly tight. He was at her mercy, this powerful, lonely man, both physically and emotionally. If she made the wrong move, she might hurt him terribly, for she knew now that she could hurt him, and the realization was wondrous and strange.</p><p>Somehow, by some miracle, she mattered to him.</p> <p>\u201cAll of you.\u201d She leaned forward and placed her mouth against his chest, kissing him, stroking him with her lips, trying to convey all she felt. She licked his nipple, circled it with her tongue, tasting man, tasting Caire. She took that small bit of flesh between her lips and bit gently, carefully, listening as his breath quickened.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you since that first night when you surprised me in my sitting room.\u201d</p><p>Her breath quickened as well, but it wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t nearly enough. She climbed on the bed and straddled his hips, but when he pressed up, she ignored him, sliding lower, her legs on either side of his thighs.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps it was when you talked to me so shamefully in your carriage that first time.\u201d She lay flat on him, her breasts crushed just above his hot penis, her forearms along his sides, touching him with as much of her body as she could. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>She felt his body shudder, knew she was hurting him with just her gentle touch, but she pressed on. She licked down his chest, feeling the tears start in her eyes as his heartbeat thudded under her lips. She was causing him pain and she hated it, but at the same time, she hurt him with all the love in the world.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you talked about? How you described me kneeling before you?\u201d</p><p>He shuddered.</p><p>She took down her hair, letting it spread over his chest as she kissed around his navel. A soft sound left his lips, perhaps a moan, but she didn\u2019t stop. She tongued her way to that special spot by his groin where his thigh met his hip, licking like a cat. She wriggled farther down him, stretching her legs full length along his, her feet hanging off the end of the bed, her breasts resting now atop his hard thighs.</p><p>\u201cAnd what I would do when I knelt before you?\u201d</p><p>His whole body stilled. Carefully, thoroughly, she licked over his hard cock, feeling it leap beneath her tongue. She bathed him with her tongue but didn\u2019t take his penis into her mouth. His breathing was rough now, and she didn\u2019t know whether it was from arousal or pain.</p><p>Perhaps it didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>\u201cI was so aroused by your words,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo shamed and at the same time so excited. You were opening up a new world for me. A world in which I could be free. I want you to be free too.\u201d</p><p>She placed her head between his thighs and kissed his sac, gently, tenderly, inhaling his male musk. Then she turned her head and ran her mouth down first one thigh, then the other, leaving no spot untouched, leaving no bit of flesh unloved. By the time she reached his feet\u2014big, but with surprisingly elegant arches\u2014she was drenched with her own need. He no longer trembled, but when she looked toward the head of the bed, she saw his fists clenching the spindles of the headboard so tightly she feared he might break them.</p><p>Now.</p><p>She flowed up him, bracing one hand on his shoulder, using the other to guide him into her. They both gasped at the penetration.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Her tears overflowed as she took him deep within her. She raised her bottom, letting him slide out once, twisting herself back down on him. Then she laid herself on him like a blanket, covering as much of his flesh with hers as she could. She found that she had to curl her legs next to his hips to keep him lodged within her depths, but she could spread herself over nearly all of his torso. Then she lay still, her head on his chest, his hot cock within her, listening to his leaping heartbeat under her ear.</p><p>He was gasping beneath her.</p><p>She raised her head a little and brushed her lips over his exposed jaw, trying to comfort him. \u201cIs it all right?\u201d</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t answer. His hands were still fisted, the muscles in his upper arms bulging with his restrained strength. She watched his hands flex around the neckcloths, waiting to see if he\u2019d tear himself free, feeling his hard length within her, pulsing with life.</p><p>When after a while he still let her lay on him, she moved. A gentle circling of her hips, a mere rising and falling, like waves upon a great rock.</p><p>She licked his throat, humming under her breath, comforting as she made love to him. He hardly moved within her. She wanted\u2014needed\u2014this to last. At the same time, her desire was rising. She ground herself against him, using his body to pleasure herself, even as she tried to convey all he meant to her.</p><p>He made a sound, perhaps a sob, and she closed her eyes, rubbing her wet face against his jaw.</p><p>\u201cTemperance.\u201d He moved his face then, catching her lips. \u201cDear God, Temperance!\u201d</p><p>She kissed him gladly, letting him thrust his tongue into her mouth, letting him take control in this small way.</p><p>Her movements slowed until she was merely pulsing against him, concentrating on his cock filling her completely, on his hips against the inside of her thighs, on his tongue within her mouth. It began gradually, naturally, like the dawning of the sun, a warmth starting at her center and spreading throughout her body. She hardly noticed until she was clenching inside, sobbing noiselessly against his mouth. She felt him jerk inside her, felt all of his muscles tense beneath hers. She knew he was reaching his peak as well and continued to kiss him. Gently. Softly. Telling him all she felt with just her body.</p><p>He relaxed, his spasm spent, while she still lay on him, her flesh wet with both their fluids, delicately sensitized. She had enough presence of mind to reach up and untie his hands.</p><p>Then she tucked her head under his chin and lay quiet, his cock still lodged within her, and whispered, \u201cI love you, Lazarus Huntington. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDOES IT STILL hurt when I touch you?\u201d Temperance asked sometime later.</p><p>She and Caire had bathed and supped and made love again, and now they sprawled nude upon his bed. She lay on her side, her legs tangled with his, rubbing her palm over his chest. She couldn\u2019t seem to touch him enough.</p><p>Caire turned his head, his sapphire eyes meeting her own. \u201cNo, your touch no longer pains me. I think you have indeed cured me. It tingles a bit, but the sensation is not painful.\u201d He caught her hand, rubbing her fingers over his nipple. \u201cQuite the opposite, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Happiness streaked like a golden light through her, but she kept her face grave. \u201cAre you sure? Perhaps we should test your endurance further.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved rather wickedly, and he brought her fingers to his mouth, kissing each one slowly and carefully until Temperance nearly squirmed. \u201cIs that a challenge, madam?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyelashes demurely, her heart pounding at their flirtation. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall endeavor not to disappoint.\u201d His voice had turned serious, and when she looked up again, his face had lost its former teasing look. \u201cI never want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if pained. \u201cI am not the man you would\u2019ve chosen on your own, I think.\u201d</p><p>She laid a palm on his cheek. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped open, and he suddenly rolled to bring her beneath him. \u201cBecause I am selfish and vain and venal\u2014nothing, in fact, like you or the men in your family. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware of that fact. I don\u2019t deserve you, Temperance, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You have told me you love me, and I\u2019ll not let you change your mind, now or ever.\u201d</p><p>He lay on her heavily, his legs between her spread thighs, and she was aware that he was erect and ready again. It was a position of dominance, one meant to enforce his will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she looked up at him and smiled gently. \u201cWhat makes you think I didn\u2019t choose you?\u201d</p><p>His dark brows snapped together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his glorious silver hair. \u201cYou are exactly what I want, exactly what I need. You are honest and strong and fearless, and you make me fearless too. You don\u2019t let me hide behind excuses and prevarication; you make me face myself and you as well. I love you, Lazarus. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen marry me,\u201d he said fiercely.</p> <p>She gasped, the prospect of happiness shimmering so close she could almost reach out and touch it. \u201cBut... what about your mother?\u201d</p><p>He arched an arrogant eyebrow. \u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d</p><p>Temperance bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m not an aristocrat\u2014I\u2019m not even close. Father was a beer brewer. Surely your mother and the rest of society will disapprove of marriage to me? After the fire, I don\u2019t even have anything to my name but the clothes I wore today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not entirely true,\u201d he drawled, and his sapphire eyes seemed to glow in the shadows of the curtained bed. \u201cYou have a very fine piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do,\u201d he said, and kissed her nose. \u201cI ordered it only a couple of weeks ago as a surprise present, and as it wasn\u2019t delivered before the fire\u2014it wasn\u2019t, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said loftily. \u201cYou have a piano and a full set of clothes, and that\u2019s plenty dowry to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you provided the piano!\u201d Temperance couldn\u2019t stop the smile that was spreading over her face. A piano? Lazarus might call himself selfish, but it was the sweetest gift she\u2019d ever received.</p><p>\u201cWhere the piano came from is of no matter, Mrs. Dews,\u201d Lazarus replied. \u201cThe fact is you own it. As for society, it can go hang. I\u2019ll wager the thing the gossip mongers will be most scandalized by is that I found a lady to consent to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd my mother will no doubt be extremely happy that I\u2019ve married at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He nudged himself against her damp folds, and she lost whatever objection she was about to make.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw he was so very close, his silver hair falling like a curtain to either side of her face.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Mrs. Dews,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand save me from a life of loneliness and uncaring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you\u2019ll save me from a joyless life filled with only work and duty.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes flamed, and then he was kissing her passionately. He pulled back only long enough to say, \u201cThen you\u2019ll marry me, my sweet Mrs. Dews?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you and love you until the end of both our days, my Lord Caire.\u201d</p><p>And she would\u2019ve said more, but he was kissing her again and it didn\u2019t matter anyway. All that mattered was that he loved her and she loved him.</p><p>And that they\u2019d found each other.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Now, a year passed and during that time, King Lockedheart grew more and more morose. One by one, he dismissed his courtiers until only a very few wise men remained. He grew weary of his beautiful concubines and he sent them, weeping, away. He sat alone in his great golden throne room on his velvet throne and wondered why he felt this way. All that was left to keep him company was his little blue bird, but a bird cannot talk or laugh or smile.</p><p>One day, a quiet knock came at the throne room doors, and when the king called for entry, who should come in but Meg the maid?</p><p>Well, the king sat up straight, but soon his broad shoulders slumped again and he looked a bit sulky. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hither and yon and over all the wide world,\u201d Meg said cheerfully. \u201cI had a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019ll be going again?\u201d the king asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Perhaps not,\u201d Meg said as she sat at his feet. \u201cHow did you feel when I was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost. Empty,\u201d the king said.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve returned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy. Joyful,\u201d King Lockedheart growled as he scooped Meg into his lap and kissed her soundly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Meg asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d the king replied. \u201cThis is love, true and eternal, my sweet Meg. Will you be my queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Meg said. \u201cFor I\u2019ve adored you since first you had me dragged before you. We will be married and we\u2019ll live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>And so they did!</p><p>THREE WEEKS LATER...</p><p>The mornings were the hardest, Silence found. There just never seemed to be any reason to get up. She lay in bed and stared at the ceiling. William was gone, of course, four weeks now at sea and still no letter. That wasn\u2019t so unusual, but the nagging feeling that he wouldn\u2019t write at all this voyage was. Concord wasn\u2019t speaking to her, except for one short lecturing letter that she\u2019d burned because it might destroy any sisterly feeling she had for him should she read the whole thing. No one had heard from Asa.</p><p>Silence sighed and rolled to her side, idly watching a fly buzz against the bedroom window. Temperance would be happy to have her come and help plan the wedding. But the sad thing was that Temperance\u2019s happiness with Lord Caire contrasted depressingly with Silence\u2019s estrangement from William. And jealousy of her own sister made Silence feel small, ugly, and bitter.</p><p>Winter had come around twice asking in his easy, patient way for her help with the foundling children, but\u2014</p><p>There was a thump at her door.</p><p>Silence turned in the direction of the outer room. It had been quite a loud thump for her to have heard it in the bedroom. Who could it be? She owed no tradespeople and wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. It might be Winter come to cajole her again. She scrunched down in the covers. If it was Winter, she didn\u2019t want to see him. She had just decided to pretend to not be at home when she heard it: a faint mewling.</p><p>Well, that was odd. Was there a cat at her door?</p><p>She got up and padded to the door, cracking it only slightly because she was still in her chemise. No one was there\u2014or so she thought until she heard the sound again and looked down. A baby lay at her feet in a basket, like Moses, only without the rushes. She frowned at him and he frowned back, stuffing a fat fist into his mouth and growing rather red in the face. She didn\u2019t know much about babies, but she did know when one was about to bawl.</p><p>Hastily she bent, scooped up the basket, and closed the door behind her. She set the basket on the table and lifted out the baby, inspecting him\u2014or rather her, as it turned out. The baby was dressed in a gown and stays and was quite pretty, with dark eyes and a wispy curl of dark hair peeking from her cap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t receive visitors before two of the afternoon,\u201d Silence muttered to the little girl, but the baby simply waved a fist, nearly catching her in the nose.</p><p>Silence looked in the basket and found a worn silver locket in the shape of a heart.</p><p>\u201cIs this yours?\u201d she asked the babe as she opened it awkwardly with one hand. Inside was a slip of paper with the word darling written on it. That was all. She searched the basket, even taking out and shaking the blanket the baby had lain on, but there were no more clues to the baby\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone leave a baby on my doorstep?\u201d she wondered aloud as the baby gummed her fist. The child seemed happy enough now that Silence was holding her. Perhaps the unfortunate mother knew of her connection to the foundling home?</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019d best take you to Winter,\u201d Silence said with decision. Suddenly she had a reason to get up this morning. She felt almost excited. \u201cAnd since I found you, it seems only right that I be the one to name you.\u201d</p><p>The baby raised her eyebrows as if in query.</p><p>Silence smiled at her. \u201cMary Darling.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
