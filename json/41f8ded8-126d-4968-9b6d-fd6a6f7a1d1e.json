My new business card reads Delilah Street, Paranormal Investigator, but my old personal card could have read Delilah Street, Unadoptable Orphan.</p><p>I was supposedly named after the street where I was found abandoned as an infant in Wichita, Kansas. (I guess I should just thank God and DC Comics it wasn\u2019t Lois Lane.) I\u2019ve googled and groggled (the drinking person\u2019s search engine) the World Wide Web for Delilah Streets and not a single bloody one of them shows up in Kansas.</p><p>Whoever my forebears were, they gave me the Black Irish, Snow White coloring that is catnip to vampires: corpse-pale skin and dead-of-night-black hair. By age twelve I was fighting off aspiring juvie rapists with retractable fangs and body odor that mixed blood, sweat, and semen. Really made me enjoy being a girl.</p><p>My growing-up years of group homes in Wichita are history now that I\u2019m twenty-four and on my own. I had a good job reporting the paranormal beat for WTCH-TV in Kansas\u2014until the station\u2019s jealous weather witch forecaster forced me out.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m a freelance investigator in wicked, mysterious post\u2013Millennium Revelation Las Vegas. Vegas was wicked, of course, long before the turn of the twenty-first century brought all the bogeymen and women of myth and legends out of the closet and into human lives and society. Now, in 2013, Vegas is crawling with vamps and half-weres and all-werewolf mobs and celebrity zombies and who-knows-what-else.</p><p>My ambitions are simple.</p><p>One, staying alive. (Being turned into an immortal vampire doesn\u2019t count.)</p><p>Two, being able to make love on my back without having panic attacks. (Whoever thought someone would aim for the missionary position?) Position hadn\u2019t been an issue until recently and neither had sex, until I finally found a man I want to make love with, ex-FBI guy Ricardo Montoya\u2014aka the Cadaver Kid. He\u2019s tall, dark, handsome, Hispanic, and my brand-new horizontal ambition. He has my back\u2014and my front\u2014at every opportunity.</p><p>And, three, tracking down Lilith Quince\u2014my spitting image\u2014to find out if she is a twin, double, clone, or simulacrum. Or if she is even still alive. It\u2019s rumored some CSI V bodies are real ... corpses. Seeing her/me being autopsied on Crime Scene Instincts V: Las Vegas one rerun-TV night in Wichita brought me to Sin City in the first place.</p> <p>Lucky me, Lilith became the most desirable corpse ever featured on the internationally franchised show. Millennium Revelation pop culture and taste tend toward the dark\u2014now I know how dark. When Hector\u2019s CSI show made Lilith Quince into a macabre worldwide sex symbol, he inadvertently made me, Delilah Street, a wanted woman. Not for myself alone, mind you, but for the naked and dead image of another woman.</p><p>The CSI cameras showed a discreet maggot camping out in a nostril that held a tiny blue topaz stud like my very own, so Lilith in filmed corpse form was dubbed Maggie and became the It Girl of 2013: Maggie dolls and merchandise are hot and so are bootleg Maggie films, outtakes, and my hide, if anyone could snag it\u2014dead or alive. One werewolf mobster almost did already.</p><p>At least ambition number four is now a done deal: Identifying the embracing skeletons Ric and I discovered in Vegas\u2019s Sunset Park just after I hit town and just before the town hit me back, hard.</p><p>I discovered more than Ric and corpses in Sunset Park. I found an ally who has heavenly blue eyes and is seriously gray and hairy. That\u2019s my dog, Quicksilver. He\u2019s a wolfhound-wolf cross I saved from death at the pound. He returns the favor with fang, claw, and warm, paranormally talented tongue.</p><p>(I have a soft spot for dogs\u2014especially since Achilles, my valiant little Lhasa apso in Wichita, died from blood poisoning after biting a vampire who was trying to bite me. Achilles\u2019 ashes rest in a dragon-decorated jar on my mantel, but I haven\u2019t given up the ghost on him.)</p><p>Oh, the location of that mantel might be of interest. It\u2019s in the Enchanted Cottage on the Hector Nightwine estate. Hector rents the place to me cheap because, as the CSI franchise producer, he\u2019s presumably guilty of offing my possible twin on national TV. Hector doesn\u2019t really have a conscience, just a profit motive. He\u2019s banking on my finding Lilith or becoming her for his enduring financial benefit.</p> <p>The only thing Hector and I share is a love of old black-and-white films. The Enchanted Cottage duplicates a setting from a 1945 movie. A shy-to-the-point-of-invisible staff of who-knows-what supernaturals run the place, and I suspect it\u2019s supplied with the wicked stepmother\u2019s mirror from Snow White. Although it\u2019s been mum with me so far, I do see dead people in it.</p><p>The most complicated beings in my brave new world are the CinSims. Cinema Simulacrums are created by blending fresh zombie bodies illegally imported from Mexico with classic black-and-white film characters. The resulting \u201clive\u201d personas are wholly owned entertainment entities leased to various Vegas enterprises.</p><p>Hector and Ric blame the Immortality Mob for the brisk business in zombie CinSims, but can\u2019t prove it. Hector wants to wrest the CinSims from the mob\u2019s control into his. Ric aches to stop the traffic in illegally imported zombies. It\u2019s personal\u2014he was forced to work in the trade as a child.</p><p>I\u2019d like to help them both out, and not just because I\u2019m a former investigative reporter crusading against human and unhuman exploitation. My own freedom is threatened by various merciless and sometimes downright repellent factions bent on making life after the Millennium Revelation literal Hell.</p><p>Luckily, I have some new, off-the-chart abilities simmering myself, most involving silver\u2014from the silver nitrate in black-and-white films to sterling silver to mirrors and reflective surfaces in general.</p><p>Which reminds me of one more sorta sidekick: a freaky shape-changing lock of hair from the albino rock star who owns the Inferno Hotel. The guy goes by three names: Christophe for business; Cocaine, when fronting his Seven Deadly Sins rock band, and Snow to his intimates. He seems to consider me one of them, but no way do I want to be.</p><p>While thinking of my lost Achilles, I made the mistake of touching one long white lock of Snow\u2019s hair he\u2019d sent me as a mocking gift. The damn thing became a sterling silver familiar no jeweler\u2019s saw or torch can remove from my body. Since it transforms into different pieces of often-protective jewelry, it\u2019s handy at times. I consider it a variety of talisman-cum-leech.</p><p>That attitude sums up my issues with the rock star\u2013 hotelier, who enslaves groupies with a onetime mosh-pit \u201cBrimstone Kiss.\u201d</p> <p>Then I discovered why those post-concert kisses are so bloody irresistible ... and Snow forced me to submit to his soul-stealing smooch in exchange for his help in saving Ric from being vamped to death. This kiss-off standoff between us is not over.</p><p>I\u2019ve been called a \u201csilver medium,\u201d but I don\u2019t aim to be medium at anything. I won\u2019t do things halfway. I intend to expose every dirty supernatural secret in Las Vegas, if necessary, to find out who I really am, and who\u2019s being bad and who\u2019s being good in my new Millennium Revelation neighborhood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ACOYOTE YIPPED in the desert night surrounding Las Vegas.</p><p>Its sharp introductory barks escalated into a full, soulful howl at the moon.</p><p>I straightened from my feral crouch to listen.</p><p>Then I smiled.</p> <p>That lonesome coyote might be the only natural critter within hearing tonight.</p><p>Even the glowing yellow moon, half full, looked pretty unnatural. Its blade-straight inner edge reminded me of a giant casino chip split down the middle.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t used to working under moonglow. Usually Sin City\u2019s gigantic bouquet of neon lights backlit my night-crawling expeditions.</p><p>Tonight, though, my beat was a raw desert landscape of distant mountains that made the flat valley floor into a huge, empty, open maw surrounded by massive saw teeth. I stood at its center, the moonlight reflecting from the steel studs embedding the arms, legs, and torso of my form-adapting black catsuit.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d I whispered at the jaundiced half-werewolf moon, \u201cand you\u2019ll get a jawful of broken fangs.\u201d</p> <p>Something came barreling out of the darkness right for me, as if answering my invitation. Fast and furred, the yellow-beige flowing blur grew ears, hackles, and hulking shoulders as it neared\u2014like a panting locomotive with a boar\u2019s-head cowcatcher.</p><p>I turned sideways as it charged by, kicking up sand chest-high. Then it wheeled and leaped for my throat.</p><p>\u201cQuick,\u201d I shouted, using the word as a name, not a command. A huge pink tongue swiped my jaw and slimed my costly, FBI-approved night vision goggles. Only borrowed, alas.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wipe the wet lenses clean on my steel-studded outfit. Scuff City. So I swept off the goggles and shook my head at the grinning wolfish face now at standing height. My waist.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver, you\u2019re supposed to find prey, not me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>I fished in the secondhand cop utility belt swagging my hips for a microfiber cloth, then glanced around. All around. The new bone-reading night vision lenses had tinted everything a Beatles-submarine yellow. I pushed them, cleaned, atop my head like sunglasses.</p> <p>It was pleasant to see the true moonshine-silvered landscape, cool and serene. Silver is my talisman, including this silver-gray dog who\u2019s half wolfhound, half wolf, and all partner. Quicksilver is more lupine than K-9, and just what a girl needs for a bodyguard and buddy after the Millennium Revelation.</p><p>Hmm. A hummock of Joshua tree\u2013tall cactus was edging into sharper focus. I snapped the lens strap back around my head and the lenses down over my eyes. Several hummocks of cacti were shuffling toward me. Quicksilver had accomplished his Australian sheep dog act, after all.</p><p>I drew the police baton at my hip. The idea was to serve and protect, not to hurt.</p><p>And not to be hurt.</p><p>The closer they came, the bigger they got. Human figures, three of them. These were professionally big guys, the kind who walk with beefed-up arms out from their sides at acute angles, with thigh-heavy legs pushing their feet apart so they make a waddle into a threat.</p><p>Muscle, in the classic PI term.</p><p>And you just a slip of a girl, Irma commented sardonically.</p><p>Shut up, I told my inboard invisible friend since orphanage days. I\u2019m on the tall and solid side. Quick and I can handle these Three Stooges.</p> <p>Sadly, that\u2019s about all they were. As much as twentieth-century zombie movies celebrated a dogged will to ambulate, the New Millennium\u2019s feral zombies share the same lack of social graces, not to mention coordination.</p><p>Quicksilver immediately trotted to circle behind them and nip at their shambling heels or backsides if necessary.</p><p>The three were still shod and wore \u201crent\u201ded suits ... not the hired kind, but the tattered variety rent apart by werewolf fangs and claws. Their dim memories of being torn to death by Cesar Cicereau\u2019s werewolf mob didn\u2019t make them want to gnaw brains yet, but somewhere deep down they must still be plenty pissed.</p><p>Nor were they visibly rotting on the hoof. In fact, their pre-chewed condition put them in more danger from predators than the other way around. Those mortal wounds had never healed, but remained blood-crusted scars of their last stand some twenty to seventy years ago. Werewolf chieftain Cicereau had been offing competition since Vegas began in the 1940s. The Millennium Revelation had unfolded a lot of mysteries along with all the variations of supernatural underworld creatures it had coughed up.</p><p>Still, three guys heading for a lone woman was never a safe situation, even if she had a hundred-and-fifty-pound dog in attendance.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fellas,\u201d I told them, brandishing my club, \u201cwelcome to Rancho Second Chance-o.\u201d</p><p>That stopped them dead in their tracks.</p><p>Or perhaps what had stopped them was sighting the low bunkhouse and corral behind me, where a horse lifted its head to nicker. Home, sweet, home on the range. Don\u2019t ask me why, but horses have a soothing effect on feral zombies.</p><p>I stepped aside to let the trio stumble into the ranch\u2019s safety zone surrounded by silver barbed wire fencing. That\u2019s when a pack of shadows rushed me from the surrounding sagebrush, from every last bush.</p><p>A coyote pack!</p><p>No time to play zombie tourists.</p><p>My night stick prodded all three Zobo butts hard to keep them moving, and I raised my right arm just as the lead coyote leaped for my throat. With my leather-gloved palms at both ends, I managed to wedge the police baton between its fangs, then twist my upper body. That threw the alpha male off to the side in time for me to knee the next coyote in the leaping chest, so it fell back.</p><p>Quicksilver, snarling and snapping up a storm, was harrying ears and tails and flanks to drive back the middle of the pack of five. Coyotes don\u2019t weigh much, maybe thirty pounds, and neither Quick nor I wanted to kill them. These were just desert dogs, doing what comes naturally. It\u2019s actually harder to fight off opponents you only want to discourage.</p><p>From the grunting sounds behind me, the zombies had roused to kick away coyotes trying to slip through the barbed wire isolating the corral, protecting the nervous horses that had bunched and whinnied.</p><p>Quick raced over to add the discouragement of his big bad wolf teeth, while I shouted and flailed with my baton, trying not to break any animal\u2019s delicate leg.</p><p>Between the kick-dancing zombies, Quicksilver\u2019s slashing speed and teeth, and my shouts and hard knocks, the coyote pack was retreating, snarling, with ears down.</p><p>The oncoming dirt-bike roar of a Ranger RZR utility vehicle spitting up twin funnels of sand and snapped-off brush finished the job. The coyotes vanished into the moonlight-dappled sand as if made of it.</p><p>The ATV ground its noisy way to the enclave\u2019s open gate. I followed, dusting off my supple yet rhino-hide-tough Inferno Hotel catsuit. The driver doffed his helmet and goggles. My Vegas-based, designer suit\u2013wearing ex-FBI guy was looking provocatively off-Road and Track.</p><p>Oooh, chica, Irma purred in my mind. Our Ricardo is flaunting his muy macho mode. My motor is revving.</p><p>Yup, my uninvited alter ego is the Queen of Shallow.</p><p>\u201cCoyotes?\u201d Ric greeted me. \u201cAre they okay?\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver circled the Ranger to sniff its huge tire footprint, hackles raised.</p><p>\u201cA bit bruised and cut,\u201d I said. \u201cWe pick a time were-wolves aren\u2019t out and then run into their innocent little brothers on a tear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must be hungry to pack in fives,\u201d he said. \u201cCoyotes generally stick to mated sets or run in threes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike zombies?\u201d I asked, nodding at the stolid waiting trio.</p><p>\u201cJust more stragglers from that lot I resurrected at Cicereau\u2019s Starlight Lodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep them out of the zombie trade, at least. You bring something back from the dead, in whatever state, you\u2019re kinda responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>His words left me speechless. My tough FBI guy didn\u2019t know it, but I may have done exactly that with him.</p><p>\u201cI really understand,\u201d I said in a serious tone that slipped past him. His mind was still on the wandering zombies.</p><p>\u201cThe rest have scattered pretty far,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I won\u2019t need you and Quicksilver for roundups after this. Didn\u2019t know if Cayuse here\u201d\u2014he slapped the Ranger\u2019s sand-blasted engine cover\u2014\u201cwould work to round up stray Zobos. It sure does. They shy like horses at unnatural sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Ric. A man and his wheels. You\u2019ve named that mobile mechanical monster of overbearing tires and sheer ruckus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got Dolly.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the barely visible black bulk of my \u201956 Caddy convertible. Her full name was Dolly Parton, and she had the awesome chrome \u201cbumper bullets\u201d to prove it. She was parked on the dirt road that was way too far from the highway asphalt for my taste and her black-satin finish.</p><p>\u201cCome inside.\u201d Ric dismounted easily in his spandex race driver jumpsuit. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the setup. We need to get these Zobos tucked away for the night and the next few weeks. Now that they\u2019ve got horses to tend and guard\u2014 and are safe behind silver wire\u2014they\u2019re ready for rehab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehabilitation for what? Basket weaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I just can\u2019t leave any known dead wandering around to be meat for the Immortality Mob.\u201d</p><p>I followed him inside the rambling barbed wire, shaking my head and muttering \u201cCayuse?\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver couldn\u2019t trot away from the parked Ranger fast enough. We were two of a kind, urban creatures, especially when that citified outpost was Las Vegas, the capital city of all things spectacular and supernatural in 2013.</p><p>Inside the fence I saw the usual barn, horse corral, and bunkhouse.</p><p>The three rag-suited Zobos were being tended by four of their ilk, this set wearing Lee jeans, work boots, and plaid cotton shirts with pearlized buttons.</p><p>Quicksilver whined behind me, whether from confusion or outraged fashion sense, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>The brown leathery look of the Zobos\u2019 visible skin evoked human cowhands who worked outdoors in the desert. Ric could even open a dude ranch with these guys. The Lazy Z.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks like the Louisiana Hayride TV show set,\u201d I commented. \u201cWhat do feral zombies eat? I suppose these guys haven\u2019t worked their way up to brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad rap. They eat nothing ... yet. Right now they just feed and water the horses. These are the sleepwalking dead. Since drops of my blood animated them, they have to obey me. I don\u2019t know if the Immortality Mob exists, but I do know somebody\u2019s learned to exploit zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a word out of earshot, Montoya,\u201d I told him. How sharp were Zobo senses, or brains, anyway?</p><p>We moved to lean against the crossbars of the corral fence, watching the half-moon reflected in the darks of large equine eyes. As a coyote howled in the distance, the horses did an uneasy soft-shoe over the desert floor.</p><p>\u201cOther than your obsession to leave no zombie wandering unclaimed,\u201d I told Ric, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of collecting the ones you raised at the werewolf mob\u2019s Starlight Lodge? They were all likely other gangsters who got in Cesar Cicereau\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find dead bodies, I simply have to dowse for them with a forked piece of wood or wire, like dowsers do for water. To raise them, drops of my blood have to \u2018baptize\u2019 the dowsing rod. In a sense, those zombies are my blood brothers now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite being hoodlums and criminals in life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe werewolf mob also ran down and killed a lot of unlucky innocent bystanders over the decades. Even you were on their menu just a couple months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I guess whoever the Zobos were, they\u2019re blank slates now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAnd anybody can round them up ... to use and abuse them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially the mysterious Immortality Mob you and Hector Nightwine obsess over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople talk about the Immortality Mob, but nobody knows what or who they really are. That\u2019s worth an obsessive interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody has to handle leasing the CinSims to the Vegas attractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman lawyers,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAnd technicians go public to service the CinSims\u2019 location chips if any wander off their prescribed territory, but they\u2019re mere hirees. Whoever masterminded the process of overlaying the Hollywood personas on zombie bodies remains a mystery. No one knows if it\u2019s weird science, or magic, or the intervention of some as-yet-unknown paranormal entity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrrr,\u201d I said, as the night wind riffled the horses\u2019 manes and chilled my spine. \u201cI doubt Vegas or me can stand any more \u2018unknown paranormal entities.\u2019 The Karnak Hotel\u2019s ancient vampire empire is evil enough under the ground. Don\u2019t you have a way to de-raise these Zobos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work like that, Delilah.\u201d Ric watched a palomino colt side-dance toward us. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to kill a zombie. The reanimated dead can\u2019t die again. That\u2019s what is so evil about raising them in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you born with that gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a curse? Every paranormal \u2018gift\u2019 is a power waiting to be corrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mirror-walking too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what it\u2019s brought you. You\u2019re afraid to use mirrors now that you\u2019ve imprisoned Cicereau\u2019s ghostly daughter in that mirror-world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>Mirror-world seemed to work like a fey origami box. It could stretch in all directions or take a quirky left turn and have you suddenly facing your worst enemy. I wasn\u2019t going there again\u2014unless forced\u2014until I figured out its rules and regulations.</p><p>\u201cWhere did the bodies you raised years ago end up,\u201d I asked Ric, \u201cwith the Immortality Mob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one yet. They went where the live illegal aliens went. They were smuggled across the border as cheap labor on ranches and in factories. CinSims came later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy raise only Mexicans for CinSims?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because border crossings are myriad, and expected. My native country is full of people yearning for a better life in the U.S.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLos desperados y los desaparecidos,\u201d I said in his native Spanish. \u201cThe outlaws and the disappeared.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been studying my English-Spanish dictionary since meeting Ric, particularly the slanguage edition for any naughty words he might use in the heat of lovemaking. Of course, Spanish is a Romance language. Its musical lilt to an Anglo ear can make even a whispered obscenity sound sweet, not that I\u2019d caught Ric using anything but impassioned prose on the flattering level of, oh, the Song of Solomon, say.</p><p>His Latin blood made him muy expressive. A night with him was a better self-esteem enhancer for a girl than winning the Miss Universe contest.</p><p>Um-mm, Irma seconded me. Although I\u2019d always locked her down during the main event, she still had a front-row seat for the warm-up rounds, like now.</p><p>\u201cExcellent pronunciation, paloma.\u201d Ric nuzzled my cheek as the palomino whinnied approval. His lips whispered against mine between a string of soft kisses interspersed with nips. \u201cYou know your mouth drives me loco when it speaks my native tongue.\u201d</p><p>That one sentence had taken a full minute to articulate between the lip-lock action, and it drove any sense of night chill from my bones. Ric\u2019s mouth pulled back to let me speak against the caressing pad of his thumb, which only prolonged the dizzy desire.</p><p>I was melted Velveeta cheese in deep need of a ... breadstick. Men love to prove they can drive every thought out of even the most coolheaded woman. They had a point.</p><p>Get a room, Irma moaned in my vacant mind. Please!</p><p>\u201cAmor,\u201d I whispered to Ric over her mental whimpering, \u201ca Zobo roundup isn\u2019t my idea of a rendezvous. Have mercy and tell me more about the current social and political situation in your native land.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, easing off the romantic pressure to answer my grad school question. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to shake off an inquiry. I hesitate because I don\u2019t enjoy acknowledging the brutal state of lawlessness in the land that birthed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care, even though you were enslaved there as a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially because of that. Think. Mexican soil near the U.S. border is a no-man\u2019s-land thick with unclaimed corpses. Thousands perished trying to cross the border and were left in shallow graves. Others were undiscovered victims of the drug cartel wars or, like the hundreds of murdered women in Juarez, the white slave trade. The dry desert landscape preserves corpses. Look at the Egyptian mummies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more mummies for quite a while, please,\u201d I said with a shudder. The dry desert landscape also cooled off plenty at night.</p><p>Ric absently put an arm around my shoulders to warm me. \u201cThe desirable CinSim zombies only come from the Mojave and Sonora deserts that reach into California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, not the Chihuahuan that straddles the Tex-Mex border. Something in the Mojave and Sonora sand is a prime natural preservative. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Egyptian vampires immigrated here via their underground River Nile centuries ago. You got a good look at these latest guys from Cicereau\u2019s Murder Inc. lodge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they appear pretty whole for having been werewolf pack bait. With some plastic surgery on their death wounds, they could pass as live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think the Immortality Mob, whoever they are, get such clean canvases for their Cinema Simulacrums? You can\u2019t show a fine film on a scratched movie screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to think of my CinSim friends in Vegas as hitchhiking on gussied-up corpses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? They probably had cosmetic procedures when alive and acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your Zobos can be rehabbed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea. If they can be used by the baddies, why can\u2019t they be employed for their own good, at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you own this ... arid land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own a thousand acres of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the FBI paid that well or that you were with them that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsulting pays a lot better. These acres are too far from everything, even Area 51, to cost much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me of \u2018alien\u2019 issues,\u201d I complained as a joke.</p><p>Ric grinned. \u201cCalifornia isn\u2019t the freakiest state in the nation anymore, Nevada is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Kansas yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will soon,\u201d he said, brushing a kiss across my temple. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start our road trip back to where you grew up. It\u2019ll be a change of scene and a chance to put your ghosts to rest.\u201d</p><p>I agreed. Ric needed a change of scene after what Vegas had dished out to us recently. I wasn\u2019t sure my past was any place to find R &amp; R, but I kept quiet.</p><p>He reached over to pat a white-blazed horse forehead farewell. \u201cSeven Zobos corralled tonight is a good start,\u201d Ric said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably attract their former in-ground buddies. We need to get back to civilization, get a shower, some sleep.\u201d</p><p>A horse whinnied agreement. We must reek if the livestock wanted us washed.</p><p>\u201cMost girls are horse-crazy at some stage.\u201d Ric nodded at the restless half-dozen mustangs and purebreds, bracing a motorcycle boot heel on the lower crossbar. Somehow that didn\u2019t do the trick of turning him into Clint Eastwood.</p><p>\u201cNot me. I was fighting off vamp boys at that age.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou make me wish I was a vamp boy. You look tasty in the moonlight\u2014mother-of-pearl skin, sapphire eyes, ebony hair.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I was about to blush. What girl believes she\u2019s good enough looking, deep down? And I\u2019d had a head start at self-loathing nobody around me had bothered to head off or even see, except Ric.</p><p>But I was a piker.</p><p>Ric had been through hell and back, maybe even the literal one, since childhood, and recently he\u2019d been vamp-drained of almost every last drop of blood. My Snow-assisted kiss of life had restored his heartbeat, and the docs had declared him fine, but I\u2019d regarded making love as therapy ever since. I was tiring of playing therapist and ready to pronounce him normal again, relax, lose my protective instincts, and enjoy the ride.</p><p>So if me in the moonlight brought it on, I was willing to stand there gooey-eyed and sop it up. Looking at Ricardo Montoya had never been a chore for me, either. Girls aren\u2019t supposed to wax verbally enthusiastic about how guys look\u2014unless they\u2019re Dan Brown\u2019s wife describing the dimple in Robert Langdon\u2019s chin\u2014but Ric was the disgustingly tall, dark, and handsome Hispanic edition, only he now had one silver iris to add an exotic air. An eye patch would look dashing too.</p><p>I stared into that silver eye, unguarded by a brown contact lens for this night-work, and saw my face reflected, tiny and shiny, exactly as he\u2019d described it. His left iris was a reflective silvery surface, a miniature mirror, but I doubted I could dive into and through it with anything but my mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cYou never got this mushy before your eye turned,\u201d I said more throatily than I\u2019d expected. \u201cMaybe I just look better through it now.\u201d</p><p>There you go, Irma objected. Putting us down again.</p><p>Ric mock-growled back and kissed me like yesterday, today, and tomorrow rolled into one mega-moment. His lips slipped along my cheek and under my ear, nibbling.</p><p>\u201cBack to my place, then, for all that jazz.\u201d</p><p>By then Quicksilver had finished checking out the perimeter and even he was growling. His tolerance for sloppy sentiments was lower than mine.</p><p>\u201cWe do leave the motorized critter behind?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Ric glanced over his shoulder at the ATV. \u201c\u2019Fraid so. You\u2019re gonna be my only ride tonight.\u201d</p><p>Um, frisky. Irma approved. Quit worrying, girlfriend. The man had a blood count of zero for a couple days there. Even vampires need a fresh feed to get it up.</p><p>I do so not want to think about that, I told her. You are getting a time-out, girlfriend, starting now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWHY THE SMIRK?\u201d Ric asked, swinging an arm over my shoulder. Navigating the shifting sands made us swagger toward the road, bumping hips and weapons systems.</p><p>I was not about to convey Irma\u2019s saucy thoughts to my guy.</p><p>\u201cLook at Quicksilver,\u201d I told him instead.</p><p>As usual, Dolly had her top down, and Quick had raced ahead to jump into her backseat. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to roll.\u201d</p> <p>The wolf-spitz family dominated the wolfhound in Quicksilver\u2019s looks, so he was a \u201csmiley\u201d dog, with the perked ears and grinning face that looked ever so friendly. It was hard to tell when he was just happy to see you, or ready to attack. His paler beige face showed a gray lupine widow\u2019s peak, but his eyes were a lovely \u201cspacious skies\u201d shade of blue, a trait that came from a rare wolfhound gene.</p><p>\u201cDo zombies make him nervous?\u201d Ric asked. \u201cAny ordinary dog wouldn\u2019t know whether to attack or bury \u2019em like a bone. These Zobos rambling out here like Xanax addicts must really confuse the issue.\u201d</p><p>I patted Quick between the ears before working the car keys out of my duty belt and going around to Dolly\u2019s driver\u2019s seat while Ric stowed my night vision goggles in the trunk.</p><p>Ric imitated Quick and bounded over the convertible\u2019s closed front door into the passenger seat, just to prove he was fully recovered from the Karnak Hotel mob vampire attack.</p><p>I was hoping he was out to prove something else tonight.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we go to Wichita, we share the driving,\u201d Ric said, glancing at the luminous dial of his seriously multi-function watch. As a former FBI agent, he knew where to get all the latest paramilitary gizmos.</p><p>I\u2019d never let anyone else drive Dolly before. Well, except for the Inferno and Karnak Hotel demon parking valets, and those occasions had been emergencies. Dolly had been my BFF since I bought her at a Kansas farm sale five years ago, when I\u2019d been nineteen. Her looks were electric. Licorice-black body paint, channel-stitched red leather interior, and white convertible top. I didn\u2019t lightly let other hands curl around her extra-large pizza-size steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I told Ric, meaning our road trip. \u201cWe go halves all the way to yellow-brick-road country. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so keen to leave Vegas for the boonies right away.\u201d</p><p>By then I had Dolly\u2019s three hundred and sixty-five vintage horses kicked in and we\u2014slowly\u2014moved through the abrasive sand-drifted road toward the highway.</p><p>\u201cYou do let her stretch out all her horses on the freeway, right?\u201d Ric asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t like state highway patrol stops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. You just gotta know where they typically lie in wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing you figure out in the FBI. We didn\u2019t like local cop stops, either.\u201d</p><p>I heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cI\u2019m installing a fuzz buster before we go anywhere, speed demon.\u201d</p><p>Ric\u2019s grin in the moonlight was as white as Quicksilver\u2019s. \u201cWhat a waste of money when you\u2019ve got an inboard one riding shotgun.\u201d</p><p>His hand stroked my nearest inner thigh. \u201cAny Navy Seal would salivate to have this Inferno Hotel battle suit. As impenetrable as Teflon, you say, yet the surface feels as smooth as velveteen.\u201d His strokes became longer and Dolly swerved a bit. \u201cNo steel studs here, chica? You\u2019d think Snow of all ... people would know how much vamps like femoral arteries and would have ordered the fang-repellent studding everywhere.\u201d</p><p>By now I was mucho glad the suit was also waterproof. Did I even remember the na\u00efve virgin who\u2019d thought she was getting her period the first time she\u2019d met Mr. ex-FBI smoothie in Vegas\u2019s Sunset Park a mere couple of months ago? I kept my eyes on the rough road and parted my totally armored thighs a teasing bit more. Sex in a high-tech wet suit was suddenly looking really hot.</p><p>Too bad Ric didn\u2019t realize this was just necessary physical therapy.</p> <p>Yowsa! Irma managed to get in as she broke out of solitary for a weak moment\u2014mine.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be quite a road trip, Montoya,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Behind us, Quicksilver stopped the heavy doggy panting and gave a sharp yip, like a basso coyote alert. Was he jealous of me getting all the petting or ...</p><p>\u201cHoly smoke!\u201d I yelled, choking my grip on the steering wheel.</p><p>As we neared the lonesome gray of the interstate, a black hedge of fog had materialized from the concrete pavement, rolling toward Dolly\u2019s chrome front bumper like a solid wave of storm cloud.</p><p>\u201cFlash flood?\u201d I murmured uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no flash flood,\u201d Ric shouted, grabbing the fifteen-shot automatic from the very visible shoulder holster over his racing suit.</p><p>I looked hard. Yes, the wave was more solid than water ... and sported moonlit fangs.</p><p>I accelerated. Dolly\u2019s bumper bullets plowed through a fender-high onslaught of furred shoulders and snarling, snapping maws.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver, no!\u201d I shouted as the gray tide flowed around Dolly\u2019s red taillights into the desert beyond.</p><p>The dog was already over the rear door and on the desert floor, giving chase.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver, no!\u201d I shouted again. I\u2019d recognized the pack\u2019s breed, and mere werewolves would have been an improvement.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver, come back.\u201d Yeah, like a locomotive would spin on a dime and jump its tracks.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver, leave kitty!\u201d I screamed at the top of my lungs in as deep and commanding a voice as my female vocal cords could manage.</p><p>I squealed Dolly into a too-rapid right onto the empty highway to look for results.</p><p>Ric regarded me as if I was insane.</p><p>By then I\u2019d roughed up Dolly\u2019s brake shoes, but had avoided a fishtail as the car stopped. To my surprise, I saw Quicksilver\u2019s form lofting into a long leap over the trunk and into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cGood dog, good boy,\u201d I said in that exaggerated praising tone deluded dog \u201cowners\u201d use.</p><p>Ric was still watching me as if I was nuts. \u201c\u2018Leave kitty\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one command he\u2019ll obey for our walks in Sunset Park.\u201d I shrugged apology. \u201cIf it\u2019s late and deserted I let him off leash. Of course that\u2019s when the cats come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the only way you can call back Killer Dog is to scream \u2018Leave kitty\u2019 for all the world to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did work. And it\u2019s not easy to turn a hundred-and-fifty-pound half-wolfhound from prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor a hundred-and-eighty-pound man,\u201d Ric added with a mock ogle. \u201cDid you have to call out the hounds on me? Where\u2019d they all go?\u201d</p><p>I turned with Ric to eye Quicksilver\u2019s \u201caren\u2019t-I-really-good-to-listen-to-you?\u201d smiling mug and the desert beyond.</p><p>A bright flash of gold was moving across the valley floor, the darker mountains looming behind it.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d I asked. \u201cSome moonlight phenomenon, like the purported green flash at sunset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat under the earth,\u201d Ric said, stretching out of his seat to see. \u201cHoly smoke is right. Picture a tomb painting writ large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God. It\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I looked again.</p><p>Now I saw the smoky flowing cloud that had rushed us was racing to meet the flash of moving moonlit gold that led an army of shadows over the sere ground. A solid-gold royal chariot. Behind that spectacular artifact came the Karnak Hotel\u2019s hidden horde of ancient Egyptian vampires taking a run behind their desert steeds, with hyenas serving as their pack of hounds.</p><p>\u201cI never noticed these mountains looked like pyramids, from a distance,\u201d I breathed. \u201cThe royal hyenas just flowed right through us.\u201d</p><p>Ric nodded as we watched the distant spectacle.</p><p>\u201cI never saw the critters personally, but from your description and what we\u2019ve just seen, the hyenas may have a spirit or ghostly existence as well as a way-too-physical one. They\u2019ll sic the Karnak royal vampire chariot corps on us now that we\u2019ve had a close encounter. Better floor it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Quicksilver just chased them! That dog would tackle Godzilla.\u201d</p><p>Not to mention a six-hundred-pound white tiger. No way was I telling Ric that Quick had faced off Snow\u2019s security shape-shifter, Grizelle, while I was busy erasing Ric\u2019s childhood whip scars in the Inferno bridal suite.</p><p>Long story, for both of us. Ric hadn\u2019t totally recalled his ordeal as mass vampire bait and I was still acting as his lover-cum\u2013private nurse, protecting him as he thought he protected me. Maybe that was love, or maybe it was fooling yourself.</p><p>Whatever, I\u2019d discovered even natural hyenas are really ugly customers, more weirdly related to felines than canines, with jaws that can snap and grind bones like the cannibal giant lurking up Jack\u2019s fairy-tale beanstalk. The thought of even their spectral forms cozying up to Dolly\u2019s paint job ... ick. Hyena ectoplasm must resemble the wet cheesecloth fake mediums spit up in s\u00e9ances.</p><p>I was still shaking my head as I revved Dolly down the blessed ribbon of smooth concrete that would take us away from this prickly desert of cacti and khaki-colored carnivores, live and undead.</p><p>Ric frowned at my speedometer until I pushed the needle up to ninety. Then he tuned the radio full up on a Spanish-language station, so that trumpets and five-string guitars hailed our return to civilization.</p><p>Ric caught me eyeing his profile. \u201cNo traffic cops lying in wait until we approach Salt Cedar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ex-FBI guy likes to take lawless midnight spins out into the desert dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve learned way too much about my deepest darkest secrets since I was unconscious in Christophe\u2019s bridal suite mainlining other people\u2019s blood.\u201d He smiled his promised revenge. \u201cI\u2019ll have to show you some new tricks, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading straight to your home ground.\u201d</p><p>I checked the rearview mirror, pleased to see only the distant headlights of a semi. \u201cWhy were the Karnak vampire armies out for a run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur scouting expedition to their secret underworld did destroy the centuries-kept herd of human cattle they bred to feed on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly after we released those poor souls to their long-delayed Afterlife,\u201d I said. \u201cHoward Hughes is hoping his work with the wine-god we freed will get them all on brewed blood substitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoward Hughes was a demented genius of a human being and now he\u2019s a vampire, Del, not your Big Daddy. You can\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>For a wild moment, I speculated that maybe he could be ... my daddy, that is. Anybody could be, from Hector Nightwine to coroner Grisly Bahr to, hey ... Donald Trump. That\u2019s the catch when you\u2019re an abandoned baby. You could be anybody. Or anything.</p><p>Ric was still in warning mode.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t let the big, loin-clothed lug you freed from two thousand years of pillar duty under the Karnak lull your defensive instincts. That wine-loving Shezmou dude had a double role in ancient Egyptian mythology. His other specialty was Lord of the Slaughter. So, before everybody in the Vegas vampire empire can get nicely-nicely civilized via some Hughes invention, they still have to seek prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s out here to prey on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsolated ranches. I imagine the worker vamps can subsist on herd animals without killing them, if they have to, and the twin Pharaohs would get first dibs on any human herders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Zobos and your horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silver barbed wire will repel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires? I thought it was werewolves that silver bullets can hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver is one of the oldest vampire repellents. It fell out of favor in the days of the cross and holy water, but ancient Egyptians wouldn\u2019t be subject to Christian symbols. Silver recovered much of its mojo after the Millennium Revelation.\u201d</p><p>I touched my hip. My own silver familiar often went undercover as a slim chain.</p><p>\u201cYour newly silver eye?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYet to be seen,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver barbed wire. Where\u2019d you get that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCustom-made. I have contacts in the Mexican jewelry trade on both sides of the border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSterling silver? Isn\u2019t that metal too soft to make effective barbed wire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it the evil eye after it was nailed down around the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve ... used ... your silver iris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you got it, use it. My concentrated stare produced a cool blue aura around the wire. Then it hardened like your silver familiar did when you touched Cocaine\u2019s albino lovelock and it morphed into a solid form. My amped-up wire proved diamond jeweler\u2019s saw-and torch-resistant, just like Snow\u2019s pretty-pretty white hair. I\u2019m betting this wire now has some supernatural power that makes predators of the paranormal sort back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know this wire is impenetrable?\u201d</p><p>Ric grinned as widely as Quicksilver. \u201cFirst, my Taxco amigos tested it with saw and torch. Second, I have a feeling silver is our lucky charm. Even your super-dog has those changeable silver circles on his collar. Time I shared the bounty, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate to be called that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re hogging the driving and you can\u2019t do anything about it now. Or this.\u201d</p><p>His hand returned to my inner thigh and didn\u2019t look to be leaving until we hit Vegas. Gotta say the bouncy road feel wasn\u2019t hurting anything, either. Dolly\u2019s vintage shocks were set to velvet vibrate. That Ric. From comatose to cocky after just two dangerous missions. Delilah the secret sex therapist was very happy.</p><p>\u201cWhere does your silver body jewelry thingy go, anyway?\u201d Rick asked, \u201cwhen you wear that skintight super-suit?\u201d</p><p>This was the man who so memorably removed my new werewolf salsa club duds and twenty-four-year-old virginity in front of his bathroom mirror (before I started seeing dead people in looking glasses) asking. I blushed anyway, but only the half-man in the moon could see that with us zipping down the deserted straight-pin road at almost a hundred miles an hour.</p><p>\u201cWhen you got cozy with what would be my bikini wax job\u2014if I had one\u2014eight miles back,\u201d I admitted, \u201cthe silver familiar, ah, migrated to a less active erotic zone. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t like crowds.\u201d</p><p>Ric\u2019s rhythmic caresses stopped. \u201cLiving up to its name, I see. But I don\u2019t see. Where?\u201d</p><p>While he examined me for a clue, I watched the speedometer. It took a mile, less than a minute, for him to get it.</p><p>Ric sounded smug. \u201cElementary, my dear Watson. I detect two new symmetrically placed oversize silver studs on the chest of your catsuit. Hmm, spiked studs. Muy provocative. Your familiar isn\u2019t being shy, Del, it\u2019s upping the erotic ante. However or wherever that outfit opens and shuts, I\u2019m going to take my time finding out.\u201d</p><p>Behind us a huge sigh and agitation on the leather upholstery indicated that Quicksilver was settling down on the backseat for a resigned doggy snooze before he spent the night on outside patrol. He\u2019d always been an ultrasmart and sensitive dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ONCE THE GOLDEN glow of the Las Vegas Strip was unfolding like a fan on the horizon, I checked in with my landlord on my hands-free cell phone.</p><p>Actually, I checked in with his butler. He was the one who\u2019d fret about my whereabouts.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even need to worry about waking him up, because he was one of the celebrity zombies known as a CinSims. You really can\u2019t wake up William Powell from The Thin Man and My Man Godfrey films, among other classics, since the actor has been dead for decades and his various acting personas have been grafted onto contemporary zombie bodies at select Las Vegas entertainment locations.</p><p>What does it say when the only person who worries about your well-being like a father you can always count on isn\u2019t actually a real person?</p> <p>Quicksilver and Ric listened hard to my end of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cGodfrey? Yes, we\u2019ve stayed out really late, but we\u2019re safe and sound.\u201d ...</p><p>\u201cMaster Quicksilver will be fine. Ric has a smart house but Quick is smarter, so we can always use the extra security.\u201d ...</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re heading to Ric\u2019s place. Master Quicksilver and I are doing an overnight. Tell your boss I\u2019ll check in with him in the morning.\u201d ...</p><p>\u201cAfter breakfast, Godfrey, yes.\u201d ...</p> <p>\u201cIndeed. We are being \u2018deliciously scandalous\u2019 and will \u2018enjoy ourselves.\u2019 Yes, maybe even champagne, but certainly Brimstone Kisses.\u201d</p><p>I winked at Ric as the phone\u2019s ultraviolet glow faded with my conversation.</p><p>\u201cBrimstone Kiss.\u201d Ric mused. \u201cThat\u2019s the Inferno Bar cocktail you whipped up for the Humphrey Bogart Casablanca CinSim when you were trying to ply him with booze to save my hide. Is my liquor cabinet likely to stock the right ingredients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have OJ in the fridge and orange brandy on hand, I can mix up a Brimstone Kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy? Nope. You\u2019ll just have to rely on my homemade brews and kisses.\u201d</p><p>By then we\u2019d arrived and Ric\u2019s garage door was opening at Dolly\u2019s approach as its interior light went on. Luckily, Ric\u2019s Vette was a space saver. Dolly could glide her three thousand-plus pounds right in. She\u2019s a big girl and proud of it.</p> <p>Ric and I were entering the connecting courtyard before the system could close the garage door after us, so Quicksilver lingered behind to ensure nothing even as low and slender as a rattlesnake had slipped in unnoticed.</p><p>I loved the moonlit courtyard and the soothing splash of its copper fountain recycling water to the lush foliage. It felt so Old Mexico. Ric loved the stucco wall niches between climbing vines dripping blossoms and rich scent, where he could back me into the dark for butterfly and brimstone kisses.</p><p>Quicksilver whined impatiently and then lapped noisily at the fountain pool. He was big enough to sound like a herd of thirty water buffalo.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s jealous,\u201d Ric said, turning to stare at the wolfish lapper.</p><p>Quick stared back and stopped drinking, wearing his innocent-dog look.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we leave him on guard duty out here?\u201d Ric suggested.</p><p>I walked over to Quick, who promptly sat and gazed at me with his limpid baby blues. My hand brushed his head and neck, fingering the silver medallions on his collar, now all sliced in half, like the moon.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Could a dog roll his eyes? Mine did. I took that as a yes.</p><p>Ric and I walked through the heavy hacienda-style wooden front door as it opened for us. Ric\u2019s house might not contain the Enchanted Cottage\u2019s invisible helpers, but he had high tech.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any ritzy liquor cabinets,\u201d I mentioned as Ric took my hand and hustled me through the dim living room.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need liquor. We\u2019re running on liquid silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually like sharing a bit of my silver magic. Concealing your one silver iris most of the time isn\u2019t a drag?\u201d</p><p>In the dark living room Ric stopped to grasp my upper arms, even then his palms unable to stop caressing my velvety, metal-studded suit.</p><p>\u201cI like us sharing everything. What\u2019s not to like about you saving my life if the only side effect is a cool silver eye I can cover with a contact lens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your eye doesn\u2019t reflect an aspect of my silver talents. Maybe the color was leached from your eye, rather than added. I didn\u2019t even know I had any silver mojo until I came to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, querida. I really don\u2019t care about the why and wherefore of my quirky eye right now. What I don\u2019t know is how Christophe\u2019s rescue party kept their hands off you in this thing. Mmm, that warm velvety black stretchy stuff embedded with all those silver metal mega-goose bumps except here. ... What\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re holding back.\u201d</p><p>I felt like such a fraud for not telling Ric I might have brought him back from the dead with the leftovers of Snow\u2019s Brimstone Kiss, not my own determined CPR.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... not used to such blatant booty calls.\u201d</p><p>Ric laughed, a rich and wonderful sound I thought I\u2019d never hear again only a few days ago. \u201cShy Delilah,\u201d he crooned. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s even more seductive? Yeah, this is a booty call. We\u2019re going into the lighted bathroom and you\u2019re going to strip me naked, shy girl, but then we\u2019ll go into the dark bedroom and I\u2019m going to make love to you in that suit like you\u2019ve never had it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ric, I\u2019ve only ever ... had ... you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not like this. We\u2019ve both got the silver mojo now, and I\u2019ve figured out how to use it some. There\u2019s no telling what we can do together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what the silver eye will do for, or against, you. I don\u2019t think sex is going to prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Del, sex proves everything. Our connection was white-hot from the first, with our finding those not-so-dead embracing skeletons in Sunset Park. ... What should I call that co-ed dowsing moment? A sensual shudder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely put,\u201d I admitted. He was right. We\u2019d had it all from the first. Sex and death and dark delight.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cThis could be dangerous. My silver talents, your quicksilver eye. We could ... spontaneously combust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing the mood with that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Se\u00f1orita Paloma.\u201d His kisses avoided my mouth, tracing my temple and cheekbone, along my jawline down to the side of my neck to the drumming pulse there.</p><p>The sweet spot for teenage boys and vampires.</p><p>I twisted my shoulder away from his lover\u2019s grip. I didn\u2019t want to play vampire games. It wasn\u2019t safe sex.</p><p>Allowing myself to tease the site of the vampire bat bite that had introduced Ric to puberty in the Mexican desert had made it an instant highway for the real Millennium Revelation vampires to nearly suck him dry and kill him. I wanted no more neck-nibbling, even if it had been a basic foreplay move since cave days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back now, Delilah,\u201d Ric reminded me. \u201cBetter than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ego never went missing, for sure,\u201d I teased. \u201cYou really want me to strip you?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d never been there before, but I\u2019d never been the doer, mostly the do-ee. Convent school and a squeamish fetish for avoiding vampire hickeys will do that to a girl.</p><p>I knew once we hit the bathroom spotlights I was going to blush. Pale skin is made for baring every hang-up, but this was what I\u2019d wanted so desperately, Ric alive and vital again. Why did I always find it easier to make war than love? Why was Ric hell-bent on taking me over every hurdle in my once-sheltered life? Why did sex have to be so revealing?</p><p>No wonder Quicksilver had wanted to get lost, fast. For the first time, I wondered about his doggy sex life, maybe the reason for all those solo midnight runs of his. TMS. Too much speculation.</p><p>Actually, undressing Ric was a good ice-breaker. The racing-style suit Velcroed open at the extremities and then down from the mandarin-collared neck to the, um, crotch. He stood there like Vitruvian Man with his legs braced and arms out while I went to work high, low, and center. Men can be so out there.</p><p>I smiled as he turned his muscular, desert-dusky back to me, the bright lights revealing no trace of the ugly whip welts my tear-salted kisses had smoothed into faint silver scars. My forefinger traced the Catherine\u2019s wheel of strokes thinner than barbed wire, each touch evoking his audible purrs of pleasure.</p><p>I\u2019d done this.</p><p>My silver talents and whatever remnant of Snow\u2019s Brimstone Kiss that had lingered on my lips had made the site of untold old pain into a new erotic zone.</p><p>Even as my fingers explored the wonder of what my lips had wrought, I winced.</p><p>How could I anticipate that Snow would absorb every slash the child Ric had borne as fresh wounds while I healed the old sites? What weird connection had been going on?</p><p>Ric was right again. In a paranormal world, every gift seems mated with a curse.</p><p>Now, as I played Ric\u2019s faded scars like a harpist, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of Snow. Could my pleasure-giving here slowly undo the damage done days and miles away at the Inferno Hotel? How much, over how many times? Or would the exchange of damage last forever?</p><p>I recalled Snow, fatalistic and as supernaturally cool as ever when we\u2019d last met ... the first time after Grizelle had told me what I\u2019d done. My knees had been knocking, but the impervious rock-star persona Snow flaunted for the world had shown no signs of craving vengeance.</p><p>Why would he? He now had a greater power over me than any werewolf mob boss or undead Karnak pharaoh or vampire Howard Hughes ... or even Ric.</p><p>My guilt. I\u2019d deliberately chosen to undo the last seven lashes of Ric\u2019s pain even after I knew each healing touch was scourging Snow. My punishment, so far, was cringing at the memory of Snow every time I made love with Ric. I suspected there was far worse to come.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop,\u201d Ric told me.</p><p>Startled, I assumed he\u2019d eavesdropped on my distracted thoughts. But ... no.</p><p>\u201cYour sensual back massage is making me too happy. I trust we have something joint in mind,\u201d he went on.</p><p>I stepped back, dropping my hands. Still the amateur, I scolded myself, either avoiding or pushing too far too fast. I didn\u2019t know my own powers on any front ... physical, emotional, or paranormal.</p><p>Ric picked me up in a bride-over-the-threshold carry and brought me into the dim bedroom. He settled me on the bed to a rhythm of kisses and caresses that made making love with one person in a wet suit seem perfectly logical, and my suit\u2019s silver studs flashed tiny lightning strikes from all the room\u2019s mirrored or metal surfaces.</p><p>\u201cElectric,\u201d Ric murmured, as he rolled onto his back beside me. Of course, I had to remain on my side. My phobia against lying on my back kept me with my head braced on my crooked arm, gazing down into his beloved face. Ric turned his head away from me, so I couldn\u2019t see the silver iris. \u201cDelilah, I need your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand down his muscled, slightly furry thigh. \u201cNo problemo, amor.\u201d</p><p>His hand on my wrist stopped me.</p><p>\u201cNo. Here.\u201d He turned his head farther, his brunet profile etched against the blue satin pillowcase the color of my eyes. I consumed the sight of his dark, thick hair, slanting forehead, slightly aquiline nose, deeply arched lips ... the image as breathtaking as one of Michelangelo\u2019s ultramasculine sculpted angels.</p><p>His motion had brought my focus to the strong, exposed column of his neck with the new knot of scar tissue resembling a miniature star gone nova.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t miss how shallow, excited breaths lifted his bare chest up and down even as he kept his face and throat immobile for my view. The provocative contrast was playing crazy with my libido.</p><p>\u201cNo, amor,\u201d I coaxed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game anymore. That Sonoran desert bat bite left two tiny marks on your neck. I could play ferocious vampiress and leave you unchanged before. Now, real vampires have used that same spot as a spigot. They sucked your blood out. I can\u2019t \u2018pretend\u2019 to do that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a vampire bat bite, Delilah, on the neck, a natural site for the tiny beast. I can\u2019t help that undead beasts favor the spot too, or what I feel. Your mouth has made the welts on my back into a road map of pleasure points. Think what your lips could do for the new scar here.\u201d</p><p>Help me, Irma! I couldn\u2019t plead that I didn\u2019t do oral sex. I couldn\u2019t deny that we all had idiosyncratic turn-ons and turn-offs. I\u2019d overcome my distaste of early attacks from predatory half-vamps to feed Ric\u2019s harmless thirst for a bat bite rerun. He\u2019d led me to overcome a lot of my hang-ups. How could I deny his one little long-standing kink?</p><p>\u201cPor favor,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can beg ...\u201d</p><p>I studied his beautiful, beloved features. Like I shouldn\u2019t be begging him to let me touch him, love him.</p><p>I launched the most passionate kiss of my being at the damned vampire scar, pouring love and tears on the wound, as I had before when I had healed, sensing the pleasure shivering through his entire body and mind and soul, breathless at the power I had to shake him ... and at his power to make me abandon myself and my fears.</p><p>IT WAS ONE of those paralyzing nightmares, where you know you need to move, change the scene, wake up ... and you can\u2019t.</p><p>Yes, I was reliving my old alien abduction scenario. Me pinned on my back to an examining table, or an autopsy table, like Lilith. Me in the glare of a sinister overhead light hovering like a pale manta ray. A trio of vampire nurses fencing me in along each side of the table.</p><p>Vampire nurses? Howard Hughes\u2019s various Vegas venues had finally crept into my old Wichita nightmares.</p><p>An alien figure still stood at the foot of the table, ready to inject me with ... some giant needle device. Yes, the alien was the black-and-white CinSim of Dr. Frankenstein, who wore far too much gel on his thick black hair.</p><p>And then he became the gold-glimmering black figure of Anubis, the Egyptian god of the underworld ...</p><p>Really, I had too many alien entities to worry about to stay frozen in this dream ... and so I awoke. I couldn\u2019t move for several seconds, my heart beating as if the captive-on-my-back abduction experience had been real.</p><p>And then I remembered that ... it had been. I\u2019d actually lived through scenarios like this since hitting Vegas. I\u2019d already experienced this in real life, surreal as Vegas was.</p><p>Was I finally outgrowing my childhood phobias by living through them?</p><p>Beside me, I noticed Ric thrashing on his black satin sheets. I softly stroked his upper arm. Where I feared to lie on my back, he\u2019d made a habit of doing it to hide the whip scars of his childhood. Now he lay on his stomach, his exposed back and hips twitching with the phantom lashes of his deepest memories and nightmares.</p><p>\u201cRic,\u201d I whispered into his ear whenever his head thrashed my way. I ran my fingertips over the pale scars, each stroke quieting his shudders.</p><p>He awoke groggy and purring at last.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave a man alone, Delilah,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMagic Fingers. Put in a quarter.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, recognizing a reference to massage beds in cheap motels.</p><p>\u201cAre we really going to stay in motels on our road trip?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He turned over onto his side. Revealing his back had been a big achievement. Someday we\u2019d make love in the missionary position, my own phobias no more too. Who\u2019d believe a modern woman would want to be on the bottom. Oh, yes.</p><p>\u201cGod, I had a horrible nightmare, Del,\u201d he said, blinking as the memories flooded back.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, I haven\u2019t dreamed like this in years. Mama Burnside pretty much reprogrammed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d had someone like her in the group homes of Wichita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get back there and look them all up, paloma. And give \u2019em heck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you dream?\u201d</p><p>He laid his head on my shoulder. \u201cI saw El Demonio, the chief slave-labor smuggler south of the border. He was using his bullwhip on me again\u2014\u201d</p><p>I clutched his head to my breast.</p><p>\u201cDel, you\u2019re gonna hook me on bad dreams.\u201d</p><p>I unclutched.</p><p>\u201cBut, Del ... in the dream, he turned into ... you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and your crazy silver familiar had taken the form of twin silver whips and then became tendrils of your silky dark hair and they were slashing like black-satin ribbons all over my body and I was really into it ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. You just want a pity fuck.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cAny time. No, honestly and truly. I dreamed that old dark dream and then you appeared and drove it back down into the deepest corner of Nightmareland. The day you dream your alien abduction scenario and I\u2019m the one menacing you with the phallic implement from the foot of the table, we\u2019ll know we\u2019ve got both our kiddie nightmares deep-sixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that this trip back to Wichita will do that for me? Turn the bogeyman at the alien abduction table into Prince Charming with a hard-on?\u201d</p><p>He turned sober.</p><p>\u201cI believe that digging to the bottom of our nightmares always pulls up the truth, Delilah. And the truth will set you free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reporter\u2019s credo, but not an original thought, Ric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so true, mi amor,\u201d he said, pulling my face down to his in a deep, soothing goodnight kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFAR BE IT from me,\u201d said my landlord, Hector Nightwine, the next morning while I squirmed on the carved wooden chair opposite his office desk, \u201cto insert myself into the course of true love, but you and the Cadaver Kid have been absent from the Strip for too long.\u201d</p><p>He sat in an even more massive chair that cupped him like King Kong\u2019s palm would surround a giant prune Danish. For once, I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>The mental picture of Hector Nightwine inserting himself between Ric and me was physically impossible and emotionally repulsive.</p><p>Hector was a mini-me of Star Wars\u2019 Jabba the Hutt in an Orson Welles smoking jacket. If he knew I had a metal bikini top from the first film of Cleopatra in my cottage quarters on his Sunset Road estate, I\u2019d be kept in chains on the set of his CSI V TV series forever.</p> <p>The \u201cCadaver Kid\u201d nickname was from Ric\u2019s few years in the FBI, where his \u201cgift\u201d for finding buried dead bodies was considered gee-whiz great profiling, not an inborn paranormal ability.</p><p>As for true love, I doubted Nightwine would ever know it unless it came wearing a bottom line, and I was even more superstitious now about calling what Ric and I had anything that resembled a clich\u00e9d happy ending.</p><p>So I addressed the only possible part of his comment I could.</p><p>\u201cThe Strip, Hector? Some new mega-billion behemoth going up there? Where on dry Nevada earth is there room?\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s chubby, hairy hand stroked the black beard that concealed his multiple chin collection.</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is a modest ... shop, I\u2019d call it. It\u2019s sprung up on one of the odd bits of untaken Strip land housing one-story enterprises.\u201d</p><p>I made a face and crossed my legs to distract his attention to my Betty Grable pin-up shoes: forties platform-sole spikes in VE-Day red. Better to have him leering at my ankles than my bustline. At least I thought so.</p><p>\u201cYou mean,\u201d I asked, just to be clear, \u201camong the cheapie tourist shops, scalped show-ticket booths, palm readers, and naughty lingerie hucksters?\u201d</p><p>Something had to occupy and pay rent on the odd Las Vegas Strip corners not commandeered by hotel-casino frontage. What I couldn\u2019t figure out was why international media mogul Hector Nightwine cared about a dinky new shop.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to tell me.</p><p>\u201cSome of your old friends,\u201d he said, waggling his coarse eyebrows, \u201care busy vying for this spanking new enterprise. I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to visit, since a new friend of yours is the merchant in question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMerchant? I don\u2019t know any \u2018merchants\u2019 except for a certain ghoulish TV mayhem huckster in my twenty-twenty sights at this moment.\u201d</p><p>Nightwine\u2019s plump hand dipped into a wooden salad bowl filled with crunchy little nothings from the lower orders of planet life. Dead now, I hoped.</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere, dear Delilah. I confess. You are such a modest little thing.\u201d He wagged a forefinger that dangled something black and slimy and boneless. \u201cDoes Mr. Montoya know you\u2019ve set up a bare-chested hunk in a commercial hot spot?\u201d</p><p>I straightened my spine, imagining myself standing at my immodest full five-eight, though seated, and glowered to encourage him to go on. Which he did.</p><p>\u201cTwo major Strip forces you know, Delilah, are fighting wolf-fang and tiger-claw to acquire the business for their hotels, and no doubt franchise it.\u201d</p><p>Now I got it. \u201cCesar Cicereau\u2019s Gehenna Hotel werewolf mob versus Christophe\u2019s rock-star Inferno Hotel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMais oui, ma petite. I\u2019m considering entering the fray. The concept is genius, my dear Delilah. You did sign Mr. Shezmou to a personal contract, did you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d I was so shocked I descended into mob-speak. \u201cHe owes me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery wise. Well, trot yourself and your canine companion over there and prepare to protect your interests. And not only from bigwigs. The showgirls and tourist ladies are lining up for blocks in the hot sun in designer heels you would kill for.\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cI don\u2019t have to, Hector. I have my own collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the Enchanted Cottage\u2019s new Bottomless Closet. How did you manage to convert the old-fashioned and invisible brownie and pixie helpers that came with the place into a host of personal Red Carpet stylists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour estate spy cameras are worthy of Excess Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am always the auteur, my dear, the director who writes his own scripts. But, sometimes, I admit, you write yourself into the most delightful corners, far beyond my humble powers to manipulate. Beware, Delilah. Powers less benign than I have also realized your potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I turned on my heel, or Betty\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that I protect my interests, to the hilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to the last man. Yes, I know.\u201d</p><p>NIGHTWINE\u2019S MAN GODFREY was waiting outside the door, as usual.</p><p>His pencil-thin mustache surmounted a slightly receding chin and he had a slightly receding dark hairline. Still, his white tie and tails were always a swooningly crisp black and white. If you\u2019d ever wanted to glide across the dance floor with a larger, wryer Fred Astaire, Godfrey was your man.</p><p>\u201cThe master is right,\u201d Godfrey told me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been undertaking dangerous duty in the dark lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGodfrey, you eavesdrop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReligiously.\u201d</p><p>I followed him and his button-down black tails down the Sunset Road mansion\u2019s back stairs to the kitchen, our steps clattering on the uncarpeted wood.</p><p>In a moment the click of nails joined our percussive procession. The back stairs were narrow and turned like a ballerina on a music box. At the bottom, Quicksilver had come to heel at my side, not that I ever commanded him to do anything.</p><p>We faced Godfrey.</p><p>\u201cQuick was with me on those missions,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd Ric knows what he\u2019s doing out there on the desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cMy ... cousin at the Inferno Bar, Nick Charles, well knows the combined power of man, woman, and dog. Who am I, a humble butler-in-disguise, to argue with that magic? But we CinSims are all merely motion picture phantasms in a way, Miss Delilah and Master Quicksilver. We are dancing with the dead, the resurrected bodies that serve as our sturdy immortal canvas, ever so much more resilient than film. We are not as fragile as living flesh, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are as dear,\u201d I said, brushing my hand against his black sleeve. CinSims were solid, but I hesitated to touch a phantasm.</p><p>Since almost losing Ric to the Karnak vampires, I\u2019d become a real softie.</p><p>\u201cPart of the service,\u201d Godfrey said, a pre-Technicolor twinkle in his gray eyes. \u201cI was not a matinee idol for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Well, William Powell had been a starring character actor, really, but I\u2019d always had a weakness for character over flash.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, Godfrey,\u201d I told him, \u201cyou make me feel like Dorothy on a road trip with one of her trio of cool dudes.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged modestly. \u201cYou\u2019d better follow the yellow brick road to the Strip, Miss Delilah, as the Wizard of Sunset Road suggested. Mr. Nightwine has an infallible eye for the main chance. And take your big dog too.\u201d</p><p>I curtsied and almost skipped my way out the back door and down the flagstone path to the Enchanted Cottage, so very glad I wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019M NOT FAMOUS for following instructions.

Sunglasses were my constant accessory too, partly to hide the fabled baby-blues I share with my elusive double, Lilith Quince, but I put Lilith out of my mind before she drove me out of it instead.</p><p>Hector\u2019s description of sleazy businesses took my Strip walk toward downtown and the last surviving, nonimploded hotel-casinos of the town\u2019s fifties and sixties heyday, when the Rat Pack of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr., ran wild in Vegas instead of werewolf mobsters.</p><p>After weaving almost to the streetlamps to miss a steamy tourist array of sun-baked Goth and punk leather, I spotted a stunning gold-and-ebony sign above a shop frontage.</p><p>CHEZ SHEZ, the gilt letters read, just as I\u2019d recommended.</p> <p>\u201cChez\u201d\u2014pronounced as in \u201cthe wonderful one-horse shay\u201d\u2014was French for \u201chouse of.\u201d \u201cShez\u201d was short for \u201cShezmou,\u201d the ancient Egyptian name for \u201cvengeful, beheading demon under-god who\u2019s got great hands for neck-twisting as well as wine-pouring and massage.\u201d</p><p>The line of women wasn\u2019t blocks long, but they did almost kick me to the curb, literally. I\u2019d been dodging ill-intentioned Jimmy Choos since Sheena, the weather witch at WTCH-TV in Kansas, so I simply hopped and skipped around them to the front door, which was manned by ... a woman.</p><p>Of my acquaintance.</p><p>She was also one don\u2019t-cross tiger of a female, Grizelle, Snow\u2019s shape-shifting security chief at the Inferno Hotel.</p><p>Right now she was all woman, six-foot-three of ridiculously high-priced and small-sized designer suit and stiletto heels on a velvet-black frame. Her skin was moir\u00e9 black taffeta, subtly marked with the shadow of tiger stripes. Little-known fact: all spotted and striped cats have skin to match. Grizelle in human form was almost as formidable as her six-hundred-pound white-tiger self. Her eyes were jungle green and her manicure was vampire red.</p><p>I\u2019d worn my air-sole sneakers for my Strip stroll\u2014the silver familiar was so ashamed of my unfashionable look it was hiding out as a toe-ring\u2014so I was more pipsqueak than usual measuring up to her. But height is attitude, not altitude.</p> <p>So I showed some.</p><p>\u201cNew job as a shop doorman, Grizelle? Was Snow so miffed by your last foiled attempt to stop my Inferno comings and goings that he fired you?\u201d I taunted. \u201cNaughty, naughty kitty. Maybe I can put in a good word for you with Nightwine Productions, Inc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do door duty anywhere,\u201d she answered. \u201cI was just leaving after I saw the low-rent party hanging around inside. Seeing as you\u2019re entering, I\u2019ll stick around awhile longer.\u201d She fanned the taloned fingers of her right hand.</p><p>\u201cDelilah,\u201d said a deep male voice from within.</p><p>I promptly did a do-si-do around Grizelle\u2019s statuesque presence and doffed my sunglasses. I still had to blink for several seconds to see in the comparatively dim interior.</p><p>What I saw was tall, dark-haired, and not unhandsome, but unfortunately, it was not my indebted demigod, Shezmou.</p><p>\u201cSansouci,\u201d I said with surprise. \u201cFancy finding you here. Needing a manicure? Or just a good chiropractic neck adjustment?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m no squirt, but most men of my acquaintance flirt with six-foot-something. Now\u2014between the head muscle for both the werewolf mob and Snow\u2019s hellish Inferno operation\u2014I was feeling distinctly outgunned.</p> <p>Yet intrigued.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two knew each other,\u201d I commented, switching my gaze from Sansouci to Grizelle like a nervous, well, gazelle. She scared me a lot more than he did, perhaps because I\u2019d done her boss wrong in a very big way.</p><p>The pause became what you could call pregnant.</p><p>Grizelle tossed her mane of spangled dreadlocks that much resembled an Egyptian wig. I wondered if Shezmou had seen her yet. They\u2019d make an awesome power couple.</p><p>\u201cThe doors are barred for now,\u201d Grizelle told me. \u201cYou can gawk a bit and then you should leave. I\u2019m here for a private business conference with the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Sansouci\u2019s wolfish grin looked really rakish on a closeted vampire, trust me. \u201cI represent the Gehenna werewolves,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I have time to show you and the little lady around.\u201d</p><p>He had a gift for irritating in stereo.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to include me. I can show you around. Shez and I are business partners. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShez is male?\u201d Grizelle sounded both surprised and condescending.</p><p>She eyed the polished chrome, copper, and gold metallic walls and shelves of semiprecious stone jars. A similar display of gilded wine bottles topped an ebony-and-turquoise bar on another wall.</p><p>\u201cI should have guessed,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call Shez a \u2018girly man\u2019 to his face,\u201d I warned her.</p><p>Looking around without engaging my reflections too much, I saw a surprisingly modest space, part bar and part boutique, just as I\u2019d envisioned, but unattended. I smelled the pine, sesame, and almond oils used in Shezmou\u2019s potions, though not the castor oil, thank goodness. Methought Chez Shez needed a more fashion-forward signature scent. Time for that later.</p><p>Then a glass-beaded curtain behind the counter shimmied and remained swaying like a belly dancer\u2019s skirt at the entrance of a slight young woman wearing nothing more than a mahogany spray tan, a tissue-thin strapless white-linen sheath, and an Urban Decay \u201csmoky eye\u201d to die for.</p><p>The curtains\u2019 colored beads echoed the red, blue, and green glass on wide ancient Egyptian collars. Their gentle clicking reminded me of the waist-circling, oversize rosaries the older nuns at Our Lady of the Lake convent school had worn ... and the sound of the millions of flesh-eating beetles occupying the Karnak underworld.</p><p>\u201cAre you Mr. Mou\u2019s one p.m. appointments?\u201d the girl asked. Her eye-whites dazzled as her focus darted between all three of us.</p><p>Mr. Mou? Irma interjected. The quick start-up forced our foreign friend Shezmou to employ one of the dimmer bulbs on the marquee.</p><p>I was inclined to cut the young woman slack. She was barely twenty, not a ripe old lady of twenty-four like me.</p><p>\u201cMr. Souci?\u201d she inquired hopefully, nailing the only man in the room.</p><p>\u201cAt your service,\u201d he said smoothly. He knew no other way to deliver a line to a female. \u201cYou can call me \u2018San.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Oh, please! Irma was hopping annoyed, and so was I. The girl was going into standing swoon mode at one glimpse of Sansouci\u2019s deep-set green eyes and one sentence from his even deeper hypnotic voice. Vampire, dearie, and the kind that feeds on women.</p><p>\u201cMs. ... Gray Zelle?\u201d She next fastened a hopeful hazel eye on me, since I looked a lot less dangerous than Grizelle.</p><p>I stepped politely aside.</p><p>The young woman took one look at Grizelle\u2019s haughty carnivore expression and fastened her gaze on me again for dear life. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Street, but you can call me Delilah. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFawn Schwartz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Fawn, I am Mr. Mou\u2019s silent partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, uh, talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Silent partner\u2019 is a business expression. Shez wants to see me first. Alone. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci raised an eyebrow. Grizelle lifted a sneering upper lip to showcase her carnivore canines. I was glad to ditch the pair when Fawn parted the clicking curtains and I ducked through. Irma and I.</p><p>The shop front looks promising but could use some hipper upgrades, she told me.</p><p>At this point, merchandising was hardly my main concern. If Christophe, aka Snow, and Cicereau were battling for an interest in Chez Shez, I wanted to make sure they had to deal with me, which both would loathe. I had a feeling the real silent partner in this setup would like that just fine.</p><p>The fluorescent-lit manufacturing area was much bigger than the storefront. Shezmou was working his grape press, the sinewy arm and back muscles of his cinnamon-hued torso gleaming with enough sweat to put him in a well-oiled Mr. Universe contest. Given the new female option of women ogling men these twenty-first-century days, as a product front man he was a Name Brand born.</p><p>At the click of the bead curtains his bewigged head turned. He gave the huge cheesecloth wad of grapes one last wring and wiped his reddened hands on a piece of white linen. One would be reminded of an ancient housewife, if one wished to commit suicide and say so.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome,\u201d he addressed me, \u201cO Deliverer of Shezmou, to my house of fine wines and oils. Thus Delilah has wrought, and I, Shezmou, deliver, reversing our roles as my own nature must also move from wine to balm, and eternal death to eternal life.\u201d</p><p>Gods require lots of wordy preamble, so I just smiled and nodded.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t noticed that Shezmou\u2019s twenty-foot incised image on a Karnak Hotel subterranean pillar included actual wrist and ankle chains to keep him inanimate, Shez wouldn\u2019t have been freed from millennia of bondage. His captivity had ensured that the Egyptian vampires could rampage without facing any Afterlife music.</p><p>Egyptian vampires?</p><p>Yup, they were the only ancient culture to have no bloodsucker mythology. Yet, sometime between 5000 and 3000 B.C., the problem had become severe enough that even the royal line was tainted. Many high-ranking mummy heads, including King Tut\u2019s, had been severed before wrapping to ensure no awkward resurrections here on earth.</p><p>Almost all world religions offer a \u201cseparate and save\u201d option for the Afterlife. Not the Egyptians under secret vampire rule. Once infested with vampires, Egyptian culture froze in time, feasting on their own in perpetuity and occasionally sampling stray latter-day humans.</p><p>Shezmou had been the demigod, or demon, who twisted off the heads of the damned and cast them into Egyptian Hell. With him in chains, vampires had centuries to create and re-create their own thirsty breed unchallenged.</p><p>All those deathless big bad vampires were still ruling the Underworld beneath the Karnak Hotel and Casino. I knew something they didn\u2019t, not even their twin brother-sister pharaohs. A big bad modern vampire secretly owned the Karnak and pulled Vegas strings from atop the Strip hotel, and he had twenty-first-century ambitions. Luckily, he and I had an uneasy but mutual understanding. So I had an unseen ally here.</p><p>\u201cI was not expecting to receive the mighty Delilah,\u201d Shezmou said.</p><p>Ric had adroitly impressed the ancient godling with my namesake\u2019s Biblical exploit of cutting off Samson\u2019s hair to sap his strength. I\u2019m sure Shez didn\u2019t want me snipping off any of his wig strands.</p><p>\u201cI thought two others of the Upperworld also sought audience?\u201d Shezmou asked me.</p><p>\u201cThey await without, mighty Shezmou.\u201d Okay. Being suddenly thrown into an ancient surviving culture, vampire or not, brought out my high-school Shakespeare play dialogue.</p><p>Shez grinned at me. \u201cI owe my liberator a great debt. It is good that you are wise enough to pour sweet oil on my godhead.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my lord! Irma said. Did that sound tacky. And hot.</p><p>\u201cNow I practice a modern profession,\u201d Shezmou\u2019s Darth Vader baritone continued. \u201cI must seem ... ordinary to conduct commerce. So speak as if I were your ... equal. Just between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Shez.\u201d</p><p>His grinned widened. \u201cYou enjoy that, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do, Shez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI observe that small women enjoy ordering large men around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour human avatar is only six-feet-five, Shez. And I am tall for my gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may suggest, to get along in the Upperworld, cultivate contractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a woman in childbirth,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cDealing with such matters is my little brother Bez\u2019s profession.\u201d</p><p>Bes, rechristened \u201cBez\u201d by Ric and me just because it went better with Shez, was the dwarfish god of randy sex and ... subsequent childbirth. Logical, these Vulcans and Egyptians.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it,\u201d I repeated Shez\u2019s earlier phrase in a more casual way. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a woman in childbirth, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are ... ah, you\u2019re slim and limber, although high for your sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shortly going to meet a female almost as tall as you, Shez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Before that, I want to make sure you\u2019re properly represented. I assume your boss ... er, overlord, has a link to the storefront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A link, as in a chain, only this chain is embedded in a fine glass box lid. See.\u201d</p><p>Shez gestured to a twenty-five-inch flat-screen monitor on an ivory-inlaid table of exquisite Egyptian workmanship.</p><p>I sat on the zebra skin X-bench (sorry about that, ancient zebra) and awakened the computer link with a touch.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you looking Stripside sloppy today, my dear Delilah?\u201d Howard Hughes\u2019s shrunken face mouthed into a fish-eye webcam lens. \u201cWhat do you think of my new shop concept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Hughes shrugged. He\u2019d had himself made into a vampire at almost his last breath to retain his financial kingdom. With his long beard and hair and gaunt look of pained disappointment, he alarmingly resembled a plastic Jesus figure.</p><p>\u201cShe who thinks is clever,\u201d Hughes chanted. \u201cHe who does owns the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Howard. You know this concept\u2014and Shez\u2019s enthusiasm for it\u2014is my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a contract in writing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to provide one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty percent for Hughes Tools and Tchotchkes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo like you to overreach, Mr. Hughes. Ten percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five to me. Oh, twenty-four. Your age, nicely symbolic,\u201d he cackled. \u201cAnd only fair. I am an old, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ever were and always will be.\u201d</p><p>Hughes\u2019s blasted face wrinkled with a rather charming smile. \u201cGive me credit, and I will give you the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll.\u2019 We\u2019re teaching Shez speech with contractions today. Better for the future talk shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways on top of things, Delilah. Speaking of which, you walked off with my priceless film artifact, the first cinematic Cleopatra\u2019s coiled brass serpent bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours and welcome to it back. I\u2019d rather wear the push-up bra you invented for Jane Russell. All that heavy metal is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your cold heart, perhaps? Oh, all right. Twenty percent to me and my mammary artifact back.\u201d</p><p>Hughes\u2019s webcam revealed a buxom vampire nurse behind him rattling his IV pole to hang a fresh bag of sterilized blood before the image faded.</p><p>\u201cHe is a strange creature,\u201d Shez noted, \u201cand by rights I should have twisted his fanged head from his stringy neck, but he is not of my people and has been most accommodating to me and my arts of the wine and oil press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a god in hiding from your should-be worshippers. And it\u2019s he\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had to recite hieroglyphics aloud, you\u2019d sound most artificial also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, partner. Speaking of \u2018greed,\u2019 it\u2019s time to meet the high-end Strip mouthpieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese \u2018mouthpieces\u2019 are a variety of musician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so. The music of coins.\u201d</p><p>I preceded Shez through the Glass Curtain, but I fear that Grizelle and Sansouci stood to attention only when the Lord of the Slaughter stepped into the showroom.</p><p>Grizelle growled, and for a shocked microsecond shifted into her white-tiger form.</p><p>\u201cMeet my business partner, Shezmou,\u201d I said while she corrected her impulse. \u201cHe\u2019s the genius behind the vintage wines, scents, and oils this establishment offers the Las Vegas attraction world.\u201d</p><p>Shez shook his bewigged, glass-bead-swagged, and braided mane, and growled godlike approval.</p><p>Sanscouci muttered, \u201cHoly Seared Shitakes. This is a Clash of the Titans.\u201d</p><p>He edged my way, arms folded on his chest, while the two larger-than-life types eyed each other like enemies and lovers. \u201cStarting your own harem with Bijou Boy there, Street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous, Mr. Souci?\u201d</p><p>Sansouci winced. \u201cWhat I do for my boss. What\u2019s with the guy\u2019s albino kilt? And I don\u2019t get this boozy beauty parlor concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t sampled his wines yet.\u201d</p><p>Shez\u2019s divine super-sharp hearing whipped his impressive head our way. \u201cMr. Souci may sample any bottle he pleases, but he should not drink the massage oils.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci\u2019s almost-emerald eyes rolled like Quicksilver\u2019s when he heard me try a ridiculous command, like \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not sell beer,\u201d Shez went on, \u201calthough I could brew it. The two gold taps at the end of the bar are a special house brew, ideal for\u201d\u2014Shez frowned, striving to be modern and hip\u2014\u201cthe nightclub set.\u201d He regarded me quizzically. I supposed that he\u2019d been watching TV in his spare time at the roomy laboratory Hughes had provided atop the Karnak Hotel. \u201cNight ... stick. Does that not mean, ah, the police?\u201d</p><p>I realized then that Shez had first met me wearing my used cop duty belt with the attached billy club. I\u2019d left all that fighting gear home. Perhaps a mistake, I thought, as I eyed the three deadly paranormals in the room with little mortal unarmed me and poor Fawn Schwartz.</p><p>\u201cThe Police is a music icon,\u201d Grizelle purred to Shezmou. \u201cYou seem new to our entertainment-centered world. I could introduce you to the Seven Deadly Sins rock band at the Inferno Hotel tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRocks I know from my native soil and sins are my specialty,\u201d Shez answered, being far more provocative than he knew.</p><p>Beside me, Sansouci growled in his turn. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to get his attention away from that sleek Inferno cat-woman? Cicereau had no idea he had any competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a partner in this operation,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou can make points with me.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t meant to flirt, just to make Sansouci feel better. That was an Our Lady of the Lake convent school girl-graduate problem. We always wanted to make everyone feel better ... in an abstract, selfless, spiritual way. Not a good ploy with vampires.</p><p>Sansouci was about as spiritual as a machete.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk \u2018points\u2019 with me, Delilah, without being ready to deliver.\u201d He flashed a grin broad enough to showcase the strong white canine teeth he usually kept under lip and key. \u201cThat why Shez calls you Deliverer?\u201d</p><p>Mistake. Another one.</p><p>Trying to distract Sansouci to give Shez and Grizelle some one-on-one time, I\u2019d upped the sexual and homicidal tension in the shop so you could cut it with a diamond saw. I guess Shez hadn\u2019t been off a pillar for a millennium too many.</p><p>I was just a mortal wearing loose tee and shorts, the tourist uniform.</p><p>By comparison, Grizelle was prime Las Vegas Strip showgirl with a Siegfried and Roy pedigree. She was the modern equivalent of a Vegas goddess, much as I hated to admit it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s off between you and Grizelle?\u201d Sansouci whispered, standing way closer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cWe tangled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d He leered at her, not me. \u201cGirl-to-girl. I\u2019d have liked to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRein it in, Romeo. It was tiger-to-girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the girl and walked away without bone-deep tracks in your face?\u201d He stepped back to eye me as if I\u2019d grown a unicorn horn. \u201cHey, Delilah. I know you have the nerve act sharp with Christophe and Cicereau, but Grizelle? Tell me another fey tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my more desperate moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two hellcats were fighting over the Cadaver Kid, I bet.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded. Sansouci didn\u2019t need to know Ric had still been comatose at the time.</p><p>\u201cGrizelle must go for the Latin lover type,\u201d he said, frowning at Shez. When I just stared, disbelieving, he added. \u201cWhat? This Shez guy is Mediterranean, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust barely.\u201d Egypt did border the southern seashore, but the ancient population came from the cradle of Africa, not Asia or Europe.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s with the major eyeliner?\u201d Sansouci asked. \u201cHe looks like the Rudolph Valentino CinSim at the Karnak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked for Johnny Depp. Re-creating his ancient beauty potions is like a religion with Shez. He isn\u2019t shy about marketing his products.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get mixed up with him? What kind of super is he?\u201d Sansouci asked.</p><p>\u201cAh ... his job for his big boss was about the same as what you and Grizelle do for yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s paranormal muscle of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his hobby is making wine and ... perfumes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his physical therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPTS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPost-traumatic stress? This guy doesn\u2019t look like an army vet. You\u2019re losing me, Delilah, not that I wouldn\u2019t like to find you in a dark, deserted cul-de-sac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have enough women in your blood-bank harem already, Sansouci?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can always use a fresh item on the menu.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci was a modern, civilized vamp. He sipped a little from enough adoring ladyloves to live without killing, at least just for blood.</p><p>\u201cSee those cobra-headed gold taps Shez was mentioning?\u201d I said, eager to distract him from his favorite target, me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Not beer on tap, I hope,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be smart, given the high prices on the beauty potions. Just the bottles are worth a bundle. Malachite, lapis lazuli, tiger\u2019s-eye.\u201d His gaze had drifted to Grizelle, who was interrogating Shez without him even knowing it.</p><p>\u201cSterile artificial blood,\u201d I whispered in Sansouci\u2019s ear this time. \u201cTotally legal and dependent on no living creature\u2019s circulatory system. Interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Would I drink near beer on a bet? Blood on tap? You\u2019ve obviously never had vampire sex. Where\u2019s the seduction? Where\u2019s the danger? Where\u2019s the warmth, the beating heart, the heat? Where\u2019s the fun, Street? Huh? You like it hard, don\u2019t you? You don\u2019t like life, or death, too easy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were on the hair covering my neck. His eyelids had almost closed as one outer upper lip lifted over his teeth in a classic Elvis-sneer, but his voice went so low and deep I felt the vibration in my veins. I also felt myself swaying toward him like a cobra to a snake charmer.</p><p>I jerked away. \u201cWhere\u2019s the profit, you should be asking.\u201d</p><p>He hissed out a sigh of frustration, and then finally gave the gilded faucets a serious survey.</p><p>\u201cThose look like real gold,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I give Metrosexual Boy that. Blood would look deliciously tasty flowing from those eighteen-karat snake fangs. It would appeal to the kind of upwardly mobile vamp who sniffs cocaine.\u201d His eyes narrowed to malachite-hard slits. \u201cYour sponsor at the Inferno could market the hell out of a product like that. That might nudge your amateur cocktails off his featured drink board.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Christophe, aka Cocaine of the Seven Deadly Sins rock band, aka Snow, knew how to market danger and death. And he\u2019d stolen my Albino Vampire and Brimstone Kiss cocktails recipes for his bar after I\u2019d invented them there on the spot.</p><p>But there were other rich entrepreneur hoteliers in town, and only one of them was undead for sure. And only I knew who he was for sure. Did I want to share with Sansouci?</p><p>He claimed to feel the \u201cwarmth,\u201d something Howard Hughes would never have been capable of, man or vampire. We both were at odds with his boss, Cesar Cicereau. I could use an ally on the dark side.</p><p>Cozying up to Sansouci might make Ric uneasy. Still, Sansouci, representing Cicereau, had been a major player in Ric\u2019s rescue party. So had Snow. Which one did I prefer to confide in? Sansouci was wrong about me. The answer I liked was easy. Him.</p><p>\u201cTry the tap,\u201d I advised Sansouci. \u201cYou\u2019re a new breed of vamp. This is a fresh type of blood from an inventive new source. What can it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He eyed my mouth while I spoke as if he wanted to eat it.</p><p>Holy Hathor! Shez\u2019s seductive ancient scents sure brought out new hormone levels in the old town.</p><p>\u201cIf I lived on brewed blood out of a golden spigot,\u201d Sansouci said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need to sup on a nightly harem. I could concentrate on one lady. Would you like that, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the monogamous sort,\u201d he mused. \u201cI might like your type for a change of pace. I confess I find fidelity really hot, but it\u2019s not available.\u201d</p><p>Fidelity? From a vampire with a harem? I suppose the novelty would last ... for a while. We were back to talking sex and blood, again, and a deep nagging doubt tugged at my composure.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cTry the new brew. Some vamp has to be the first. Why not you?\u201d</p><p>His grin was lethal. \u201cYeah. Some vamp has to be the first. Why not with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted.\u201d Sansouci eyed the cobra-headed spigot. \u201cI\u2019m taken too, indentured by Cicereau\u2019s Blood Price. I don\u2019t expect that condition to last forever. Come on and watch. I\u2019ll toast you with the first ... what? Mug? Glass. What\u2019s this Shezmou going to serve his make-believe blood in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d I turned to our host. \u201cShez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your command, Deliverer.\u201d His impressive presence dwarfed even Sansouci and me. I glimpsed Grizelle scowling over his bare red-bronzed shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe have a first customer for the house vintage,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you pour a ... draft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Shez swept a gold-band-wristed arm over Sansouci\u2019s broad shoulders and muscled him to the bar. He plucked a jeweled gold cup from the shelves and filled it at the tap, jerking the cobra neck to a broken right angle with relish.</p><p>A thin ruby stream pissed into the cup.</p><p>\u201cNothing from here goes to the police lab, right?\u201d Sansouci asked.</p><p>Grizelle snorted.</p><p>Sansouci took the cup from Shezmou\u2019s dark hands into his own pale ones. For the first time, I recognized Sansouci as Black Irish, like me. Just how old was he? In pre-vampire years?</p><p>He lifted the rim to his lips, threw back his head with the abandon of a howling wolf, and downed the liquid in one gulp like a shot of booze.</p><p>Three previously held breaths suddenly whooshed through the small showroom.</p><p>Sansouci lifted his cup Viking-style. \u201cBrewer. Another round. Most satisfying,\u201d he declared, eyeing me, \u201cbut not quite up to what one finds at the Inferno Bar.\u201d</p><p>This was a reference to me, not Grizelle, who nevertheless growled softly as she edged closer to tower over me.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d she told me in a hissing feline whisper, \u201cyou betray my master, Christophe. Now you hoodwink Cicereau\u2019s security chief, who is apparently a blood addict. When will you abandon your beloved Ric? You fought me for his redemption. I predict that one day soon you will fight for his death.\u201d</p><p>When it came to Mean Girls, Grizelle was top of the heap, claws down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just annoyed at not being the center of attention,\u201d I answered. \u201cShez is now the prize impressive supernatural on display on the Strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does he join the Chippendales show at the Rio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Trading on his macho appeal is beneath Shez\u2019s dignity. He\u2019s an artist of the old school, a wizard with herbs and spices and wine grapes and sometimes ... souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoiled souls, like yours?\u201d Grizelle asked, her contralto voice sinking to an even more sinister whispered hiss.</p><p>\u201cI know what you owe my master for stealing his Brimstone Kiss and sacrificing his very skin for your lover\u2019s pleasure,\u201d she told me in a low, furious growl. \u201cMontoya\u2019s scars were old and no longer pained him physically. My master suffered the fresh and brutal physical burden of years\u2019 worth of whipping in one session. I only realized you had to be the source when it was far too late. Christophe is more than Cocaine or Snow. He\u2019ll call in your debt one day, believe it. I can\u2019t wait to help that happen.\u201d</p><p>Lordy! I\u2019d been besieged by two sets of seething green eyes that wanted more than I was willing to give them this morning. Way too much excitement for a Kansas girl.</p><p>Someone loomed behind me. \u201cIf you talk of souls,\u201d Shez told Grizelle, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to hear it. This is only my ... day job.\u201d</p><p>I nodded encouragingly. Shez was getting the lingo fast.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wish to see me at my night job,\u201d he told both his corporate suitors. \u201cIt is too rough for the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci\u2019s dark eyebrows peaked like Mephistopheles\u2019 with curiosity, while Grizelle merely looked haughty.</p><p>\u201cThe mighty Delilah,\u201d Shez went on, to my glee, \u201cis my ... mouthpiece. You must negotiate with her. I weary of deciding too much. I prefer formulating my preparations or taking swift action. This talk of business and percentages and of \u2018cloning the shops\u2019 is annoying. My workplace is not ... isn\u2019t the place for discussing such boring things. You must deal with the mighty Delilah if you wish to bargain, or my serving girl, Fawnschwartz, if you wish to purchase.\u201d</p><p>Shez withdrew through the tinkling glass bead curtains.</p><p>\u201cHow rude,\u201d Grizelle growled.</p><p>I smiled and shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s the creative genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Mighty Delilah,\u2019\u201d Grizelle spat.</p><p>\u201cYou had to have been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Sansouci asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Now. I\u2019m going to be unavailable for a week or so. I suggest you two meet with your principals and each draw up a business plan I can review on my return.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise slipping back to deal directly with Shez. He looks like a big, easygoing lug, and does indeed have a softer side, but he has quite a demonic temper and I can\u2019t be responsible for your safety unless I\u2019m present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... responsible for our safety?\u201d Shadows of Grizelle\u2019s white whiskers were coming and going on her dusky face as her human upper lip curled with fury, the urge to shift barely under her control. Her long red fingernails fanned in and out. \u201cI could eat you alive, and almost did once.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci just smiled, on firm ground again, and donned his deep black sunglasses. \u201cLooks like the mighty Delilah could use an escort to see her safely out.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my arm out of Sansouci\u2019s firm custody. No way did I want it to look like I needed male intervention in front of Grizelle.</p><p>She remained, pacing the shop, studying its wares, and terrifying the young clerk with a thoughtful, hungry look.</p><p>Sansouci led me down the street to the awning over a deserted doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to frost Grizelle\u2019s whiskers?\u201d he asked, admiringly. \u201cI knew you were capable of rushing into the lion\u2019s den, but she is no cat to mess with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a discussion. It ended in a draw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell you. And you gave yourself away to Grizelle as a vampire, not the presumed werewolf everyone takes you for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind giving myself away to her, were she a client of mine, in her human form. She\u2019s not one to gossip, Delilah. Besides, she respects vamps more than wolf boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need her respect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help negotiations when you return, remember? Come on, Delilah. I\u2019m your pal. I was in Montoya\u2019s rescue party. I went into that damn fey maze under the Gehenna with you. You will award me the franchise, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe word is \u2018negotiations.\u2019 It\u2019s not prearranged, even for frenemies like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been promoted to a frenemy? That sounds promising. Love-hate relationships can be damn stimulating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it. I don\u2019t want phone-line chat. I only came outside with you because I want to ask you something about Ric\u2019s time with the Karnak vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the stones of a statue, I\u2019ll say that, to resist giving them the information they wanted despite the leeches and the vampire tsetse flies and the lords of the blood-dance siccing every vamp in the place on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I don\u2019t need a play-by-play. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if they did get what they wanted. They\u2019ve been quiet since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontoya did not give them a word, I\u2019d never believe that,\u201d Sansouci said.</p><p>\u201cYour faith is touching,\u201d I said, my grin going crooked even as I produced it. I took a deep breath. \u201cWhat if they weren\u2019t just torturing him by draining every last drop of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they did that. He was dead, Delilah, until you put those ruby-glossed lips of yours on his. Your CPR chest-thumps didn\u2019t revive him. Your kiss did.\u201d Sansouci\u2019s expression grew grave. \u201cNow that I think about it, a kiss than can revive a corpse might off a vampire. Maybe you and I don\u2019t have a future, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we don\u2019t! What I\u2019m wondering, all of a sudden, is if the damn twin pharaohs got exactly what they wanted.\u201d</p><p>His forehead wrinkled under the rakish forelock of silver-streaked black hair, but his eyes remained an unread mystery behind the shades.</p><p>Then he nodded ever so slightly and slowly.</p><p>\u201cRic dowses for the dead. He can raise them. The dowsing and finding I get. Ordinary people can do that for water, or even gemstones and precious metals. I know that from my ... long and inglorious past. Finding is one thing, but raising the dead as zombies? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dowsing rod and Ric\u2019s special talent do the finding. It takes a few drops of his blood on the dowsing rod to actually raise the bodies.\u201d</p><p>Sansouci did what I wanted from him. He speculated like a predator. \u201cAnd if one had pints and pints of that dead-raising blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! The twin pharaohs\u2019 vamp troops weren\u2019t consuming Ric\u2019s blood. They had their own inbred stock for that then. They were taking it. For use later to raise any dead they wanted resurrected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just feeling me out to confirm your own suspicions, Delilah. Flattering, but useless. I have no idea why they\u2019d want that power, but their having it can\u2019t be good for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways Ric with you.\u201d He swept off the sunglasses in the shade, those emerald-hard eyes looking for something in me I had no desire to ever show him. \u201cCall me green with envy,\u201d he said wryly, \u201cbut I can\u2019t deny he\u2019s a good man in a bad world. If he\u2019s still \u2018just\u2019 a man.\u201d</p><p>The words chilled me more than his gemstone gaze.</p><p>Sansouci, any vampire, was something of a soul-shifter as well. Once he\u2019d been mortal and human, and he remembered that time. Now he was immortal and unhuman. He knew way more about merciless adaptation and accommodation than a fierce shape-shifter like Grizelle had ever had to learn.</p><p>That\u2019s why he scared me even more, in his fashion.</p><p>I was glad to be getting out of town this afternoon, even if it meant looking my past bogeymen in the face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PACKING FOR KANSAS had forced me to dig out one of my conservative TV reporter suits. The Enchanted Cottage\u2019s invisible \u201cpersonal shopper\u201d apparently wouldn\u2019t touch anything so contemporary and commonplace. My chrome multihanger bought from a closing dress shop remained bare.</p><p>What a wardrobe witch! She\u2014or he\u2014had never bothered with my growing collection of casual jeans and tops since arriving in Las Vegas, either. That made me realize my new locale had dropped the whole, mid-tier \u201cworking woman\u201d wardrobe out of my life. But that was Vegas. You either tromped the hot streets in flip-flops, surfing shorts, and fanny packs, or you hit the hot spots in glitz and glamour.</p><p>I checked my email on the office/den computer one last time ... in fact, it was noonish, so Ric was outside tooting Dolly\u2019s horn and Quicksilver was adding the exclamation of a sharp bark to each toot. Guys just don\u2019t want to let a girl have fun.</p><p>Only ... I glimpsed several occasional but familiar email addys, fresh since the wee hours of this morning. Several bore the .sup extension for the hot new \u201csupernatural\u201d domain. I was hearing from infernobait, stone-donsnow, snowgasm224, cocainiac, snowkissedslut, all at the web address, kissedoffsnow.sup, and brimfulbabe and others from the original leading Snow fan site, snowkissedsluts.sup.</p> <p>The subject lines were ominous. \u201cIt\u2019s OVER!\u201d \u201cWho wants JUST a FREAKING scarf except an Undead Elvis freak???\u201d \u201cGlad I kicked the KISS.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the impatient outside clamor, I opened some of the messages, heart pounding.</p><p>My God, I was right. Snow was no longer closing his shows by lassoing his mosh-pit fans with a silk scarf and making them swoon from the multi-orgasms of the Brimstone Kiss.</p><p>How long had this been not going on?</p><p>That\u2019s what these women had been feverishly texting each other about. The emails were meant to update the older blog members. I saw my name mentioned, usually with gratitude that I\u2019d convinced them to go \u201ccold Kiss\u201d and forget about hoping for a second round of bliss. It sounded like they\u2019d all \u201cgone electric,\u201d anyway.</p> <p>I was shocked. Could I have been the last Brimstone Kissee? This was no time to do the math. I grabbed my duffel bag and hustled out to install it in Dolly\u2019s huge trunk.</p><p>Ric sat behind the convertible\u2019s big red-and-chrome steering wheel, clapping sarcastically. Quicksilver sat in the backseat, his big red tongue lolling out like he was getting heatstroke from waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, jumping into the passenger seat. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>My sigh on takeoff blew off any more thought of Snow and all his works for now.</p><p>At first, I\u2019d been surprised by how much I resisted leaving Vegas on its own for a week. Now that I\u2019d put various bigwigs of my acquaintance into suspended animation, I felt much better about abandoning the city to its overlords for a while.</p><p>Somehow I\u2019d become a freelance gadfly-combination-warrior maid-of-all-work for werewolf mobster Cesar Cicereau, undercover vampire entrepreneur Howard Hughes, and rock star\u2013supernatural question mark Christophe/Cocaine/Snow. Not to mention my landlord, media boss Hector Nightwine.</p> <p>Pursuing hot new attractions like Shez and his offbeat enterprise was the Vegas mogul\u2019s favorite competitive sport. They\u2019d all be a lot less likely to get up to anything really despicable as long as negotiations over Chez Shez remained in limbo. Much as I wasn\u2019t crazy about seeing Wichita again, I was pleased at the prospect of not having to face evil on a cosmic scale for a whole week.</p><p>Quicksilver always loved to ride in Dolly, and seemed even happier than I was to be leaving the Vegas Strip behind as Ric drove us out of town.</p><p>No more hoarding Dolly\u2019s big vintage steering wheel for me. I was glad to have Ric alive and well and putting me in the passenger seat. I\u2019d done a hell of a lot for him lately, and he needed to feel he could return the favor.</p><p>Quick dashed from one side to the other of the Caddy\u2019s wide backseat, his long tongue flopping ludicrously from side to side in his mouth. The sunglasses that protected his unusual wolfhound-blue eyes from the wind gave him a guy-movie, stunt-dog look, silly but happy-go-lucky.</p><p>As we drove up Highway 93, slowed by heavy Vegas traffic, I kept glancing in my side mirror, watching the huge profiles of the Karnak, MGM-Grand, Bellagio, Gehenna, and the Inferno hotel-casinos shrink into the distance.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said when my eye caught a blur of black motorcycles on the freeway access road. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the Lunatics half-were gang?\u201d</p><p>While Ric was giving them a glance, Quicksilver was already pawing the sunglasses off his wolfish nose. He leaped out of Dolly onto the bed of a pickup truck loaded with feed sacks in the next lane and then disappeared as he leaped down to the roadway.</p><p>\u201cMadre de Dios,\u201d Ric swore, fighting to maneuver Dolly\u2019s nineteen feet between the pickup and a roaring semi into the far right lane. \u201cMy Vette this is not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDolly may not be nimble, but she has the horses and the heart,\u201d I told him. \u201cJust keep flooring it.\u201d</p><p>Ric roared the car onto the next exit ramp, reporting on the rearview mirror action while I twisted my head to watch it.</p><p>\u201cThose crazy bikers must be doing seventy on the access road,\u201d he shouted into considerable wind noise. \u201cThey\u2019re a public menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see Quick?\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019d be a block or more back by now at this speed,\u201d Ric yelled.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d I said, as I watched the last motorcycle in the long line spin out sideways in a cloud of dust. The desert seeped everywhere. \u201cDon\u2019t slow Dolly down to more than forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe speed limit is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget any law-abiding FBI guy stuff,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m watching. We\u2019ll need to accelerate fast to get back on the freeway on the next entrance ramp. Time it so you make the crossroad light on green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to race the biker gang to the crossroad? Are you crazier than those half-werewolf Lunatics? Your dog on foot has fallen half a mile behind us by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo. That\u2019s why we have to time getting to the intersection just right. Quicksilver really doesn\u2019t like the Lunatics. They attacked me on practically my first day in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember like Quicksilver remembers ... ooh, see that? Ouch.\u201d</p><p>Ric, who\u2019d responsibly kept his eye on the road and the speed limit, stole a sideways glance at the oncoming knot of formidable motorcycles. The salivating, fanged, hairy half-werewolf riders added a new dimension to the Hell\u2019s Angels\u2019 long-terrifying image. Another Harley spun sideways, taking out two ... no, three bikes beside it like huge shiny black bowling pins.</p><p>\u201cI can cross lanes and stop that gang, Del, if you think they ran down Quicksilver, but I don\u2019t want to crease Dolly on my watch. You\u2019d be more likely to kill me than those bozos. Hijo de puta!\u201d</p><p>Ric jerked Dolly\u2019s big wheel to keep her untouched as neighboring vehicles fled the oncoming action, heading into our lane while dodging the were-bunch on the rolling thunder overtaking us all.</p><p>In my side mirror, the lead biker\u2019s snarling face was growing bigger and uglier, his overreaching front wheel closing in on Dolly\u2019s pointed chrome taillight. We were verging directly into the gang\u2019s path.</p><p>The bikers maintained their bowling-alley vee formation, not about to back down from colliding with a despised \u201cboat\u201d like a vintage Caddy giving them a challenge.</p><p>Then a cloud of gray that reminded me of a mini-version of the creepy spectral hyena desert \u201cfog\u201d surmounted the leader of the pack\u2019s leather-jacketed back.</p><p>The rider\u2019s clawed, fingerless gloved hands shot up off his handlebars. His fur-eared head twisted hard to the left as he fell from the saddle. His Harley went down, striking sparks from the pavement as it drove ahead in a sideways stop and his gang plowed into it and each other in one howling, screeching, shattering, squealing cloud of metal and leather and blood and fur.</p><p>And chrome.</p><p>Dolly.</p><p>\u201cHang on, Del, and don\u2019t look back,\u201d Ric shouted. \u201cI\u2019m making that green crossroad light like you said, and I don\u2019t want to do an accident report on this one. We\u2019ll circle around and find Quicksilver on foot. Damn, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what to say. Don\u2019t do anything insane.\u201d</p><p>Something thumped into the backseat in a cloud of dust as police sirens converged on the intersection dwindling behind us, where small engine fires were sending up smoke signals into the settling dust.</p><p>\u201cGo up the on ramp and back onto the freeway,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>Ric sent me a disbelieving look as Quicksilver nudged my shoulder with his dust-powdered nose. He smelled of gasoline, leather, cheap hair gel, and flea powder. Ugh.</p><p>\u201cI knew the dog could fight, but you never mentioned he was a racehorse too.\u201d Ric nervously eyed the rearview mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t think any civilians got caught in that mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. The gang had bullied all the accompanying traffic off the road, so Quicksilver had a clear alley all the way to take them out before the next intersection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me he planned that mayhem to the last second?\u201d</p><p>A cold wet nose brushed my cheek.</p><p>I twisted around to pat the backseat for his sunglasses until I, oof, found them and perched them on his nose again.</p><p>\u201cDelilah?\u201d Ric insisted.</p><p>\u201cYup. He\u2019s a yuppie puppy. A can-do puppy. Quicksilver can pace most any vehicle for a short distance, and at street speed, indefinitely, I know from experience. He knew he could get those dangerous Lunatics off the asphalt without involving any innocent victims, or he wouldn\u2019t have gone after them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me a dog, any dog, would take that into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just his breed instincts coming out. He\u2019s half wolfhound under that lupine package. Werewolves are the only lupines left in the Continental U.S., and these half-weres are the worst of the breed. So Quick\u2019s their law-enforcement nightmare.\u201d</p><p>I eyed Quicksilver stretched out on the long backseat, licking his toes free of dust, gasoline, and probably asphalt burns. Not to worry. Dog saliva will soothe wounds, but Quicksilver\u2019s saliva has proven to have instant healing properties for him, and, on two occasions, Ric. That\u2019s how my two mucho macho males had bonded despite initial territorial disputes over custody of me. They knew I didn\u2019t want to see either one of them hurt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the motel bathtub for you tonight, buddy,\u201d I told Quick, \u201cfor a good soak and cleaning. No arguments.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me and lapped away like a cat.</p><p>\u201cOkay. This time we\u2019re really on the road,\u201d Ric said, letting Dolly out to high speed and settling his frame into her cushy, red-leather comfort.</p><p>\u201cYour Vette is a railroad flatcar compared to Dolly, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like road feel. Dolly drives like an overweight rolling marshmallow to me.\u201d</p><p>I peered into the side mirror. \u201cShe didn\u2019t lose any tail-light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw.\u201d Ric grinned and pushed the speedometer up past the speed limit. Vegas had diminished to a piece of sparkling glass winking from Dolly\u2019s mirrors. \u201cThat broken chrome you spotted was from the tinsel on all those hopped-up Harleys.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you want to put me into the motel bathtub tonight for a good, long soak,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m all for it. Hell, I earned it for my performance as a dog chauffeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-plus driving, partner. With a gold star.\u201d</p><p>UTAH\u2019S SUNSET-COLORED MESAS and cliffs resembled the spectacular Valley of Fire attraction near Las Vegas, only it went on for hundreds of eye-candy miles.</p><p>To reach our first night\u2019s stop near Green River we crossed a plateau of almost eight thousand feet and came back down to earth through Spotted Wolf Canyon, where Quicksilver ran along the winding interstate. Quick resumed his rumble seat through the sheer canyons of the San Raphael Swell.</p><p>Ric was driving, so I enjoyed striking views of Devils Canyon as we ascended Ghost Rock Summit and noticed a side jaunt to Goblin Valley State Park. By twilight, we found a motel with separate cabins and a big claw-footed tub. Quicksilver dried himself by spending the chilly night outside, howling for a full moon, no doubt. Ric dried himself on the cool, scratchy motel sheets with me.</p><p>Fed and fueled, we got on the road early, all of us smelling of pine soap as we headed into Colorado and its mountain air. Even Dolly looked freshly washed and shined. Maybe the ghosts and goblins had given her a moonbeam rubdown after her rocky start out of Vegas.</p><p>My silver familiar had morphed into a New Age necklace studded with turquoise for the morning drive. Instead of curling shyly around my big toe nights, as had been its habit, now the familiar was twining itself over Ric\u2019s and my interlocked fingers and limbs, slipping like a mobile cold shiver over our overheated skin.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mention the new silent partner in our sex life. Ric had the single Silver Eye now, whatever that meant. He popped a brown contact lens over the pale reflective iris every morning, like taking a pill, to normalize his looks.</p><p>Remembering the nightmare visions from being the main course at a vampire feast under the Karnak only made him more gung-ho to get to Kansas and unearth the cause of my trauma. Part of that was his ex-lawman, good-deed mentality. I think another reason was that concentrating on my issues pushed his own back from the front line.</p><p>So ... this was a contradiction: I was actually happy that my youthful unhappiness made such a good diversion for Ric.</p><p>Here we were, both pretending the other needed our help most.</p><p>I started out driving while Quicksilver made up doggy dreamtime in the backseat and Ric turned Dolly\u2019s radio dial left and right up and down the FM and AM ranges. All we got was static wail.</p><p>Dolly\u2019s big wheels were no joy to navigate around hairpin mountainside turns. I recalled reading a beauty tip that driving a big old wheel without power steering was great exercise for the bust support muscles. Dolly had power-everything, but, even so, my entire body was putting English into those continuous hairpin turns. I was sure to be sore tomorrow.</p><p>Still, the sun poured down sparkle on the speedy roadside creeks following the twisting mountain roads. Towns and even glimpses of habitation were rare in the mountains. Ric used his cell phone to map the highway for likely stops. I\u2019d never adulterate Dolly\u2019s vintage integrity by adding any slick, modern gadgets, not even the threatened fuzz buster.</p><p>Light faded fast amid these impressive peaks. I yawned in the deepening shadows and checked the gas gauge. Dolly wasn\u2019t stingy with gasoline, but her tank was built for travel. The road went ever down and down until we finally hit the deserted flats again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive now,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAll those major curves must be exhausting to hold on to. I speak from experience.\u201d</p><p>I smiled faintly at his double entendre. I was pretty tired from the constant tension in my shoulders, and it was twilight in the shadow of the Rockies. He sped Dolly along the empty road, knowing my arm and back muscles craved a hot shower.</p><p>\u201cA good kind of exhausting,\u201d I added. \u201cThat\u2019s real driving, not just steering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAnd I was sitting, helpless, on the outside, gazing two miles down into ravines and hoping Detroit\u2019s Largest didn\u2019t plan to take us on a Thelma and Louise dive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys just so hate being not in control.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver, who\u2019d slept through the mountain pass, sat up and growled protest from the backseat. He was a guy too.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Ric pointed to a highway sign that was all words and no pictures.</p><p>The type was huge, but impossible to read while we were whizzing by at ninety miles an hour.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that,\u201d he shouted into the wind whipping past Dolly\u2019s big-screen fifties windshield.</p><p>I had no idea what kind of off-road hokey attraction he was talking about. They were usually ill-kept reptile farms or fireworks shacks out here.</p><p>\u201cThe sun is setting,\u201d I pointed out, jerking my head over my shoulder to look past Quicksilver\u2019s sunglasses-free mug, all black nose and white teeth.</p><p>A spectacular, pollution-abetted sunset was setting the western mountain peaks afire, turning the dimming sky into a psychedelic painted desert of purple, orange, green, and gold.</p><p>\u201cWe should be finding a motel for the night,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis is better.\u201d Ric surprised me. I was sure he was eager for a replay of last night. His ordeal had done nothing to weaken his libido. The contrary, even.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing out here but mileposts, Ric. I know this is the Big Nowhere, but I need a hot shower, some food, and a comfy bed right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right back there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a unique way.\u201d He swung Dolly into a U-ey on the deserted two-lane that her Queen Mary turning circumference shouldn\u2019t have been able to make without hitting the shoulder gravel.</p><p>I winced for her vintage everything, but most guys have some freaky car mojo going. Dolly spun the one-eighty in a disciplined, ladylike fashion, no squealing brakes or unseemly spray of road grit ruining the polish on her black-satin chassis.</p><p>I felt my right wrist getting heavy under the weight of a single handcuff dangling a broken chain. No, not this time. I was wearing a charm bracelet again, loaded with tooth-sharp, tiny icons I couldn\u2019t see in the dark. Even the silver familiar was going along for the ride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to love this babe of a boat,\u201d Ric said, turning her up an asphalt-paved two-lane road I\u2019d missed spotting in the rapidly descending twilight.</p><p>I still was in the dark about the meaning of the sign, especially as Dolly\u2019s headlights scanned no sign of human habitation except barbed wire fencing along the small but oddly smooth road.</p><p>\u201cIt gets really dark out here without any lights for miles,\u201d I pointed out. Again.</p><p>\u201cSo what? We\u2019re not afraid of vampires, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut in the heartland, vamps are not major tourist attractions, or hidden empires, or mere mob muscle, like in Vegas,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re plain and simple bloodsuckers, and always hard at it.\u201d</p><p>Ric just laughed.</p><p>Frankly, his laughter was worth as much to me as my non-vamp-perforated skin these days.</p><p>Staring into the dark for a sign of civilization, I spotted a large silvery pale expanse with faint lines forming interior squares, like a concrete wall. And we were heading right for it.</p><p>Quicksilver whined and braced his long-nailed front paws on my leather seat back. He knew that was a no-no. At least he knew enough to plant them and stop, with no overexcited canine churning that would damage the leather, but he wanted a good view of our eerie destination as much as I did.</p><p>And then I spotted ...</p><p>\u201cCars. That\u2019s a parking lot in the middle of nowhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Ric sounded smug.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any motel cabins or buildings. Or showers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking for rain while driving a convertible with the top down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that blocky little building in the middle of the parked cars there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like an animal shelter in a very small town. Ish. Sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed leather not turn you on?\u201d</p><p>Ric eased Dolly into a vacant area up against what looked like a parking meter. Then he buzzed up the driver\u2019s window a few inches and clamped the parking meter head onto the glass.</p><p>\u201cRic. Why is that thing abusing my vintage window? Those fifty-six Biarritz Caddy windows are hell to replace. I know, because Quicksilver smashed through one to defend me against the Lunatics the day that I adopted him in Sunset Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Ric said as the hovering white alien ship dead ahead produced a vaguely colored glow and tinny music blared into the Cadillac.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to be abducted, or what?\u201d I shouted, hands over ears and body braced for instant levitation. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough \u2018missing time\u2019 in my personal history already.\u201d</p><p>Ric remained calm. \u201cGuess you never had a chance to patronize a restored twentieth-century drive-in movie theater. Me neither.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his arm over my seat back.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from the food shack, Date?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WE HAD OUR first \u201cdiscussion\u201d while the giant screen showed inane cartoon characters and animated boxes of candy and popcorn. If I never saw another Dancing Milk Dud, it would be too soon. And the music was the sappiest I\u2019d ever heard in my life.</p><p>\u201cRic, I\u2019m not sure this whole trip is a good idea. Happiness was Wichita, Kansas, in Dolly\u2019s wide-screen rearview mirror. And this side trip is creepy. I know I wasn\u2019t really abducted by aliens as a kid, but that scenario is way too close for comfort to what might have actually happened. The closer we get to Wichita, the jumpier I get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Delilah.\u201d He pulled me across the bench seat to lay my head on his shoulder. \u201cNot many restored drive-in movie screens survive in the country. I thought you were a vintage film buff. Anyway, the girl is supposed to get a little scared and snuggle up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive-ins were dead before I was alive. Why are we here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou love vintage, right? I just thought we could do something fun for a while, be together like a normal couple at a movie instead of chasing down IDs on buried bones and digging up ancient vampires along with lots of early Vegas history and getting exotic supernatural killers on our tails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of tails ...\u201d I glanced around for Quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cHe hopped out as soon as we were hooked up to the speaker to find a better viewing spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow Quick\u2019s gone and we\u2019re sitting in this parking lot of strangers in the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold Creek,\u201d Ric said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I thought the phrase meant something like \u201ctough shit,\u201d at first.</p><p>\u201cCold Creek, Colorado,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s the town just fifteen miles away. We\u2019re not in the wilderness, and Quicksilver is just off doing doggy guard duty, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hot shower and fast food just fifteen minutes away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we\u2019ll go there after the show. Meanwhile we can do what Dolly was meant to do, take a couple of hot kids to the drive-in with her top down and the guy hoping to get the girl\u2019s top down. We can neck through a few reels, and I do mean reels, because they show old black-and-white movies here. Just neck like the normal teenagers we never were. Smear your lips with that hot new color lip gloss you\u2019re using and I\u2019ll get to work wearing it off.\u201d</p><p>I did adore the kissing part. I dug in my hobo bag on the floorboard. \u201cYou like this stuff, huh? It is flavored.\u201d I screwed up a bullet-shaped tube of deep raspberry color with flecks of silver glitter.</p><p>His \u201cyeah\u201d was one of those gruff, turned-on under-statements he made during sex.</p> <p>\u201cLet me put it on you,\u201d he said, suddenly. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight Cherry Shimmer,\u201d I said before he tilted up my chin and ran the smooth oily stick over my bottom lip so slowly it was like he used his tongue.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cherry,\u2019\u201d Ric repeated. \u201cPerfect for the tender teen mood I want you in tonight.\u201d</p><p>He slicked the gloss over my top lip as I felt a deep quiver inside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re way past that stage, Ric,\u201d I said anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm in going back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing back? You never were at a drive-in movie. You\u2019re way too young too. Didn\u2019t you get enough thrills sneaking around dating those rich and spoiled baby socialites in Washington, D.C.? You were the exotic wild child turned bureaucrat\u2019s foster kid and high school heartthrob. Don\u2019t kid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant going back to a more innocent time. The minute I laid eyes on Dolly I was wishing I could take you and her out on a date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe kinda got to the endgame of a date right there in Sunset Park over an overexcited dowsing rod before you ever laid eyes on Dolly at the curb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t regret that moment for the world, Del. Look, that teenage tear of mine wasn\u2019t real, any more than those Barbie girls were. Sure, I made it with them ... in the beach house, in the boat house, in the upstairs maid\u2019s quarters, in the gazebo in the garden, in their graduation Beamers and Porsches with bucket seats and central consoles, and upright shifts making it an instant three-way. I never made love with them.\u201d</p><p>I had nothing to say to that.</p><p>\u201cDel, you must know that I know all the things you\u2019ve been doing to spare me any aftershocks from being eaten by vampires.\u201d</p><p>I could only mutter the next sentence. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to laugh at that phrase, but they tortured and almost killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve got most of those memories back. I know how you bent your whole heart and soul to making sure when I came out of my coma it wasn\u2019t like waking up fresh from a nightmare, like you do so often. And it wasn\u2019t, was it?\u201d</p><p>Now he was nibbling on my earlobe, my neck.</p><p>Necking. Just the word made me nervous now that vampires were surfing U.S.A. across the whole world. Back in Dolly\u2019s day, the term had meant lots of smooching and maybe even tongue if the guy was a J.D., a juvenile-delinquent-in-training, and lots of above-the-waist groping. I\u2019d seen American Graffiti too. It was a forty-year-old antique, even though it was in color.</p><p>\u201cI love being behind this steering wheel,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cRic, we\u2019re not even moving now. We\u2019re parked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I\u2019m in the driver\u2019s seat and you\u2019ve got both hands free. And girls just want to suck face forever.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me against him. I looked around nervously, but the tall gateway and road lights were shining in the now totally dark distance. Our car was open, but we were pretty hidden.</p><p>Ric\u2019s face bent to find mine for a passionate kiss that took my breath away, breaking it only to murmur sexy Spanish words against my lips, moving from short, soft nibbles to soul kisses that were so much searching tongue I was thinking who needed anything more and how could we keep finding new angles and different rhythms that would keep us on the brink of this insane delirium?</p><p>We never stopped lip-syncing. The vast night air and our hot-breathed body moves in a confined space and confined clothes were beyond erotic. It was sexting in the dark. Ric\u2019s mouth was everywhere, burning up my skin and moving on so fast I seemed bathed in pre-orgasmic sensation. Despite my lips\u2019 many near-collisions with his neck, I managed to avoid his bite scar, remembering that in the first heat of our relationship I\u2019d accidentally bitten him a little and scared myself silly. I\u2019d kill myself if I found out I had any vamp tendencies, although that would be tough. Suicidal vampires don\u2019t exist.</p><p>Ric finally broke off to let me breathe, leaving me dizzy, my fingers curled into his thigh to keep myself upright. My head lolled onto the seat back while I stared up at bright swaths of stars sowed like seeds on the wind in the black sky. Ric lowered his head to my heaving chest as if dowsing for my heartbeat, his mouth kissing a line up to my collarbone and chin.</p><p>I certainly was getting why drive-ins had been called \u201cpassion pits.\u201d Warm, wet lips suckled my earlobe; teeth pinched it. A hot, probing tongue plunged into my ear. The sudden nip and plunge sensation pushed a sexual rush from my brain down to my toes and back up again.</p><p>On that wave, sucking me beneath the waterline of sensation into utter surrender, Ric\u2019s face nuzzled behind my ear, pushing under my hair. A fiery burning sensation on my neck paralyzed me. Then I realized ... I started to mouth the word, \u201cNo,\u201d but his fingers fanned against my lips as if to sign shhhhh. I reined in my galloping breath.</p><p>The sudden ceasing of our motion except for Ric\u2019s mouth burning, burning, burning the skin on my neck made time freeze. I heard crickets screaming all around us for the first time, but mostly I felt a hot, surging pulse coursing through my body, sensed its echo in his. I didn\u2019t want to stop him. I didn\u2019t want to move. I wanted to let him take me, take me, take me until he could take no more.</p><p>My lips parted to draw his caressing fingers inside, but otherwise nothing in me could move but the pounding, pounding of blood and desire, until his face drew back and his fingertips caressed the stinging sweet-spot on my neck.</p><p>\u201cTe amo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t use that word you hate, but every teenager in the world has done this in a place like this. You see now? How the kiss that seeks the hot blood that drives our love excites? Let me give this as well as take it from you. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I ... bruise?\u201d</p><p>He stroked me there again. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, amor. It\u2019s the badge of our passion. That\u2019s why I put it far back on your neck, under your hair. Only you and I will know it\u2019s there. Only I can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems ... possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassion is possession. I love that you thought about stopping me. It\u2019s so hot that you didn\u2019t. I know,\u201d he said, stroking me again, bolts of desire surging through me now on every caress, \u201cyou always feared an attack here from vampires. That you overcame that to let me make my love visible; there\u2019s nothing better.\u201d</p><p>Our mutual fever still raged, so I understood what he meant, I guess, but icy tendrils of doubt still stirred my soul.</p><p>\u201cChica,\u201d Ric whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t you want to explore the deepest levels of our love? Don\u2019t you want sex that shakes your soul? Don\u2019t you feel safe with me no matter what?\u201d he asked, coaxed.</p><p>Now he had me. The last thing I wanted to mess with right now was his machismo.</p><p>Only one answer, Irma butted in. Don\u2019t blow it.</p><p>\u201cYes. I trust you. Of course, I do. S\u00ed. Te amo, hombre.\u201d</p><p>I guess I\u2019d just have to look up \u201csuck me\u201d in my Dirty Spanish dictionary for future use. I didn\u2019t have the nerve for the even dirtier version. Yet.</p><p>BUT I SURE didn\u2019t feel safe in the drive-in\u2019s great outdoors.</p><p>It\u2019s not like Ric did a suck and run. He held me close, kept kissing my mouth, my face, the small damp spot near my carotid artery that throbbed and pulsed with the still-ragged beating of my heart. My head on his chest felt the echo of his own slowing rhythms. We pulled apart to let the urge to merge subside until later.</p><p>I heard a thump from the backseat and knew Quicksilver had returned as soon as the mushy stuff was safely over. Having Quick in the backseat meant we could prepare for the actual supposed point of the outing, the movie. Ric, of course, had wanted to initiate me in the proper setting all along.</p><p>Reality took over. The liquid heat at the crux of my body was major. I pulled myself together and made my first trip to the cinder-block women\u2019s \u201crestroom.\u201d Hip boots and tongs required.</p><p>While Ric went to relieve (men have it easy) and retrieve (the menu gave fast food a bad name), I established myself back in Dolly\u2019s passenger seat. Just letting Ric drive my baby had been a good move. The whole point of this trip, I realized, was to let Ric take charge on the professional investigative turf that was his, and take care of me for a change. And did he ever.</p><p>Deep sigh. I\u2019d grown up wary, edgy, ready to be pounced on by some vamp boy or mean girl every moment. This trip \u201chome\u201d was going to be a hard assignment, except for the extracurricular activities. Maybe I was being a worrywart about Ric\u2019s minor physical ... alterations and his randy schoolboy fixation on \u201cbranding\u201d his girl. \u201cWon\u2019t you wear my ring around your neck?\u201d I saw that iconic fifties\u2019 song could refer to a more intimate claim. Same symbolic point. I doubted a class ring on a chain could have me nearly stroking out the way Ric\u2019s fifteen minutes of semipublic necking had.</p><p>Looking at the charm bracelet on my wrist, I realized the silver familiar hadn\u2019t given even one defensive twitch during the entire episode. It certainly was getting with the nineteen-fifties program.</p><p>I could only hope the familiar wasn\u2019t also a one-way spy-line for Snow. Now that I was getting a lot more clued into sexual subtexts, I remembered Snow\u2019s remark when we first met near his Inferno Hotel bar that our conjoined black and white long hair would look sexy in the mirror above his bed.</p><p>I\u2019d taken it for a not-too-subtle message that he wasn\u2019t a mirror-phobic vampire\u2014since he was phobic about being taken for an albino vampire\u2014but I hadn\u2019t discovered my own mirror-based freaky powers then and had only just met Ric and my own libido.</p><p>Maybe the remark had been a pure come-on I was still too na\u00efve to recognize.</p><p>Maybe I can sub for you under that mirror, Irma suggested.</p><p>Maybe Lilith already had.</p><p>Good. I wanted to leave Snow as far behind as I\u2019d recently wanted to lose Wichita. Forever.</p><p>WHILE WE WAITED for Ric\u2019s return, I shared my smaller misgivings with Quicksilver in the backseat. His ears perked and fanned forward while his eyes, glued on my every word, expressed bottomless sympathy.</p><p>\u201cRomantic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I began. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a cricked neck from watching a horrible, scratched film way above us. I won\u2019t hear the rotten sound over Ric\u2019s munching, and he\u2019ll probably throw you more popcorn than is good for you. We\u2019ll hear a chorus of growling tummies from ersatz snack food. And endure cramped legs from awkward petting positions. I mean ours, not yours. Oh, well. Ric\u2019s been a sick man. We have to humor him.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver growled, leaped out of the car, and lifted a leg against the metal sound unit pillar before he vanished again for his usual nightly run.</p><p>\u201cRight on, brother,\u201d I called after him. \u201cI\u2019d do that, and then make my escape if I could. You should see the women\u2019s restroom here.\u201d</p><p>Shhh, Irma warned. Ric\u2019s coming back.</p><p>Ric had returned bearing a tray holding four red-and-white-striped boxes of popcorn, enough to make up a dapper barbershop quartet, and huge paper cups of soda pop. I scooted far across the bench seat and leaned even farther over to open the heavy door for him.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of cup holders here,\u201d he muttered when we were back in our respective seats. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to drink fast.\u201d</p><p>Me, I was doing nothing that would require a second visit to what passed for a women\u2019s restroom here. \u201cStall\u201d was indeed the correct expression.</p><p>Dolly was pre\u2013center console, pre\u2013cup holders. I opened the huge glove compartment and lined up the drink cups on the horizontal lid.</p><p>The sound unit spouted alive, producing chuckling music and a laugh track as film trailers and commercials for long-gone car models and local businesses unreeled on the screen. I could hear rustlings and heavy breathing from the cars all around. One great heaving beast of lust had materialized in the parking lot.</p><p>Meanwhile, giant numbers were counting back from ten on the screen. From the surrounding parked cars\u2014 some convertibles, all with rolled-down windows\u2014came an echoing shout. \u201cFour\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one!\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, the film started flickering on the giant graph-paper-lined screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sound system surged into Phantom of the Opera shrieking organ mode. Heavy block letters as distorted as the sound covered the screen.</p><p>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary newsreel,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classic,\u201d Ric said. \u201cYou must have seen this on the TV in your group home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned off anything made after the nineteen-forties, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, this was released years before we were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo were the film zombies! I turned off the gory stuff. Peter Lorre and Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price were scary, but elegant. And a bit too hokey to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d Ric coaxed. \u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ve offed vampire mummies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were real. This is just freaky-scary.\u201d</p><p>Ric stroked my hair as I peeked through its strands to the screen. His arm was around my waist. My hand on his chest could feel the calm, steady thrum of his heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d he whispered into my forehead.</p><p>Yes, he was. Guess I could sit through one gory guy movie after having risked my soul to bring him back from the dead.</p><p>And the chance to see a black-and-white film blown up to Times Square billboard size was awesome.</p><p>TOO BAD THE black-and-white people on-screen weren\u2019t my favorite CinSims, but no-name actors from the sixties. I amused myself for a while by eyeing the heroine\u2019s ultra-short skirt and long blond hair in a shoulder-brushing flip.</p><p>Ric picked up the popcorn and pop and munched and sipped, even when lumbering, glassy-eyed zombies crammed a liver into their mouths or gnawed on an obviously human bone.</p><p>Yawn. The humans took refuge in a deserted farmhouse. They broke furniture to nail breakaway boards over the doors and windows, to no avail. They cowered and screamed, the zombies walked. Very, very slowly. And walked. Relentless.</p><p>Around us the audience gasped and shrieked a little.</p><p>Me, I fell asleep, waiting for a witty line of dialogue, on Dolly\u2019s body-warmed red leather, in the embrace of my zombie movie-loving significant other. My silver familiar had become a calming, actually ticking, old-fashioned locket-watch on a neck chain, resting right where my heart slowed and disappeared into a dream.</p><p>THE SHRIEK THAT awoke me echoed on and on, nothing new in this movie.</p><p>Another voice had joined the panicked chorus and I knew it.</p><p>I sat upright.</p><p>\u201cSome date, sleepyhead,\u201d Ric said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver\u2019s howling at the half-moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you hear him with all this zombie growling and gnarfing and victim shrieking? This is classic. Nightwine should lease some of these zombie CinSims to guard his grounds and yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, Ric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a line from the movie, Del. Aren\u2019t you glad I\u2019m into classic films, like you are?\u201d</p><p>Grrr. Arghh! The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, I thought.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver?\u201d I got on my knees in the front seat to look into the back one.</p><p>My dog lofted over the car\u2019s side, his hackles fluffed enough to masquerade as a bad dame\u2019s good fur coat in a thirties movie. Real classics.</p><p>\u201cRic!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>He had set the nostalgia food and drink on the open glove compartment lid and was staring at the pandemonium on the giant screen.</p><p>\u201cThese zombies are marvelous,\u201d he said. \u201cRomero, the director, got away with murder. Nude rear shots, cannibalism close up and personal, helpless humans, the living dead on a rampage. This is the forerunner of spatterpunk.\u201d</p><p>Oh, joy.</p><p>Quicksilver was panting and salivating as he stared at the screen. I followed his intent canine gaze.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>The zombies were walking, all right.</p><p>Right off the screen.</p><p>And they all looked eight feet tall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTHERE\u2019RE PUTTING VINTAGE movies in three-D?\u201d I exploded. \u201cThat craze has gotten out of hand. Some of us find what Romero did in 1968 plenty scary, not to mention icky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no film purist like you or Hector Nightwine,\u201d Ric agreed, \u201cbut adding three-D is odd for restored drive-in-movie fare. It\u2019s very realistic, though.\u201d</p><p>I noticed some smaller figures actually running between the cars parked closest to the screen. Some were scrambling over car hoods and tops and trunks, heading our way.</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t the walking dead people,\u201d I yelled. \u201cThey\u2019re the fleeing audience members.\u201d</p> <p>By then I\u2019d recognized the lone figure that had run over the car silhouettes to perch on an HHR roof and brace its feet while shouting a challenge.</p><p>Actually, it braced all four feet and howled a challenge.</p><p>Quicksilver.</p><p>By now, Ric and I had scrambled out of the Caddy as fleeing people on the ground and victims on-screen streamed toward us.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the zombies escaping the film?\u201d Ric asked me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the zombie expert,\u201d I shouted back.</p><p>Then I blinked at his face. \u201cYour brown contact lens is missing.\u201d</p><p>He put his fingers to his cheekbone. \u201cI bumped into the cheesy screen door frame leaving the food stand with all the boxes in my hands. That must have jolted the contact out. I\u2019ve got another dozen packed in Dolly\u2019s trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014did your naked silver eye\u2014call the zombies off the screen? Have you got a brand-new way to dowse for the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese things aren\u2019t real,\u201d Ric said. \u201cThey\u2019re figments of old film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are CinSims, and they\u2019re solid enough to dance cheek-to-cheek with casino customers. Where\u2019s the projection booth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never raised anything without a dowsing rod,\u201d Ric objected, still working out the phenomenon.</p><p>\u201cEyes have \u2018rods\u2019 in them, don\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t there millions that control the black and white part of vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s anatomy in miniature, not ... not a piece of wood or metal from the real world.\u201d Ric\u2019s hands fisted in a balked desire to hold a physical Y-shaped implement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rationalize. Something\u2019s going on here, and even if we didn\u2019t start it, we have to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver\u2019s protective instincts had realized that. He was leaping into the oncoming zombies, giving them gnaw-for-gnaw. They ignored him, shrugged him off, even though his teeth gritted to tear off what little clothes and, in some cases, flesh, were left on them.</p><p>Not my fave movie monsters, and now they were coming right for us. Luckily, they were vintage zombies, very, very slow and shambling.</p><p>Dolly\u2019s trunk levitated behind me like a large shiny laptop screen opening. Ric must be going for his contact lenses ... no, for his licensed Glock semiautomatic, our only serious weapon besides my cop duty belt.</p><p>I tossed the paper cups, closed the glove compartment, and grabbed the metal Club on the passenger side floor that locked Dolly\u2019s steering wheel in iffy locations, like near the Vegas Sinkhole. It made a better weapon than a wooden billy club.</p> <p>As Ric slammed the trunk lid shut, a woman rushed past him, screaming, \u201cHe must be one of them. That glass eye gleams like solid ice.\u201d</p><p>By now we were playing dodgem cars with our bodies, slipping between the few high-riding elderly SUVs the Gas Wars had left on the road to hide from the suddenly animated horde of screen zombies.</p><p>I heard the scrabble of claws on metal. Quicksilver leaped to the ground beside us, a disgusting bone in his teeth. I had no idea if the bone belonged to friend or foe but ordered, \u201cQuick! Leave kitty.\u201d</p><p>Ric rolled his oddly colored eyes.</p><p>I think even the oncoming zombies paused to mill about in confusion at hearing that command. I\u2019m sure they assumed a tasty tidbit to gnaw was nearby.</p><p>I saw the whites of Quick\u2019s baby blues as he reluctantly dropped the big, juicy bone that now was in living color. Was it a prop, or part of a 3-D zombie? I knew he wouldn\u2019t gnaw on a victim. He was K-9 to the core.</p><p>Come to think of it, some of the fleeing moviegoers had vivid red scratches on their faces and arms.</p><p>Oh, shoot, I thought, just as Ric shot his automatic into the air. I noticed that his pockets were stuffed with extra ammo, not candy bars from a food mission to the snack shack.</p><p>Speaking of snack shack, I heard bones cracking and splintering all around us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to reverse this film,\u201d I shouted at Ric. \u201cWhere\u2019s the projection booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front of the concessions building,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s built like a bunker. We\u2019re going to have to mount an assault. I bet the projectionist is quaking among his reels in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what we have to get away from him. This movie must stop before the cast devours the audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You run for the building. You see it over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe zombies have almost reached it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow, shooting. Beware of spraying bone chips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Quicksilver will lead,\u201d I muttered, as the dog loped into the open, hurling his hundred and fifty pounds on fragile zombie shoulders and bringing these skeletal remnants down, even as they clawed their way forward on their bellies.</p><p>Shack to shack and jelly to jelly, it\u2019s a zombie jamboree.</p><p>Was that Irma jiving me, or my own mind in over-drive-in?</p><p>Since Quicksilver had committed his bone and blood to the zombie attack, I ran after him, swinging my steering wheel security device right and left. It cracked on so much moving sagging flesh and bone that I didn\u2019t have to look very hard to see what effect I was having.</p><p>I heard Ric pounding behind me, letting off single, on-target but sadly ineffective shots.</p><p>Ric and I shouldered against the projection room\u2019s locked wooden door, hearing the loosened film strip snapping like a playing card in the wire wheels of a fifties Schwinn. Why else did they call them \u201cBicycle\u201d playing cards?</p><p>Ric kicked open the door.</p><p>Quick dodged inside the squat structure as Ric and I slammed the door shut just behind Quick\u2019s long wolfish tail and right on a couple of clawing arm bones aimed at joining us.</p><p>\u201cAiiiii,\u201d the farm boy projectionist was chattering.</p><p>I recognized those dungarees and that plaid shirt from my previous life in Wichita and wanted to sit down beside the young guy to reassure him.</p><p>Ric brandished his sinister matte-black firearm, jerked the boy away from the old-fashioned Mickey Mouse\u2013eared projection machine, and threw him to the dirt floor. He was a lot safer there.</p><p>Outside, the clawing sound of fleeing human and hunting zombie beat a tattoo on the crude wooden door. Soon it would be toothpicks and we would be on the zombie menu. I guess they liked to serial snack on a night out too.</p><p>As Ric and I stared through the lit square that cast the film images larger than life on the massive screen, we saw writhing human and zombie silhouettes looming large on the rural landscape.</p><p>My silver familiar, meanwhile, had lost the charms and was looping itself around and around my wrist in lengths of thin but hindering chain.</p><p>Before I could draw Ric\u2019s attention to this, the familiar leaped like an anorexic boa-constrictor-turned-bicycle-chain onto the film projector, wrapping around the shiny silver nitrate surface.</p><p>The reaction resembled a diamond saw blade mating with an oil slick.</p><p>The turning reels ground and squealed, and then the film strip came splintering off its track, glittering with a silver aura that reached the screen and set white lightning dancing across the moving black-and-white images of predator and prey.</p><p>In the projection booth, the splintered film, bleached to white, coiled around and around on the floor, an endless maggot, while the boyish projectionist sobbed with horror.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cPlease stop it. I\u2019m killing them. I\u2019m killing the customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d I said, squeezing a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all right. Every one of them. This is all just a real scary feature at the drive-in.\u201d</p><p>Ric disabled the projector with the butt of his gun, watching the young guy to make sure he\u2019d know the demonic machine was dead and gone. Ric rolled the unreeled film into a fire-hose thickness around his forearm.</p><p>I winced at one more vintage film destroyed, even if it was from the sunset of black-and-white.</p><p>Only zombies were left ranging around the deserted cars, including Dolly.</p><p>\u201cThis bunch have escaped the film forever,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ... destroy them.\u201d</p><p>We ventured outside for a wide-screen view of the situation.</p><p>Ric set his teeth in the moonlight. \u201cI haven\u2019t got enough ammunition, or time, to shoot all of them to writhing bits. They\u2019ll be on us in a couple minutes.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver was still barking himself hoarse trying to round up these monsters as if they were merely feral Zobos.</p><p>\u201cRic.\u201d I put my hand on his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t call him back. \u2018Leave kitty\u2019 won\u2019t cut it. He knows better. I won\u2019t leave Quicksilver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your familiar?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>I lifted my arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I could use a pair of silver whips right now.\u201d</p><p>Ric grabbed my left wrist. A lightning-bolt-shaped cuff bracelet twined my forearm.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Pretty ... but pretty useless,\u201d I complained. \u201c\u2018Into the valley of darkness,\u2019\u201d I began, pushing forward.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ric was eyeing the scene, calculating the fan of zombies ranging farther and farther from the screen. \u201cWe need to go back to the projection hut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe projector\u2019s broken,\u201d I protested, but he grabbed and dragged me along.</p><p>I spotted the unreeled old-fashioned film flapping on his arm. In front of the hut\u2019s pathetic little darkened window, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019re at the last row of sound poles. Grab an end of the film and move to the nearest pole on your right. I\u2019ll take the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not square dancing,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>The damned zombies growled, drowning out normal speech. I saw cadaverous, nauseating faces and bodies, all rotting, coming into far too sharp a focus. At least Quick was backing up toward us now, belly down and barking.</p><p>\u201cGrab the pole, Delilah,\u201d Ric yelled.</p><p>Somewhere, very far behind me, Irma giggled insanely.</p><p>I grabbed, he grabbed, and the film between us suddenly snapped and went luminous. A coat of speeding mercury covered the aluminum-painted poles and raced among them left and right and forward and back, creating a buzzing, snapping grid of some sort of electric power the zombies walked, relentlessly and slowly, right into. They winked out like cinders at a barbecue.</p><p>By then, Quicksilver had retreated almost back to us. He took a fast look-see to make sure we were still standing, then had to dart forward to sniff each former-zombie hot spot.</p><p>\u201cThey did something like this to stop The Thing,\u201d I told Ric. \u201cNow that was classic horror movie. No mindless sleepwalking and gnawing. I think it was scientific stuff, not paranormal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this was,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose some silver nitrate remained on that unreeled film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or maybe some of your silver familiar. I just know you\u2019re not going to believe where I got this silver network idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the jagged lightning bolt form of my forearm band.</p><p>\u201cThe familiar was trying to tell us something. Use conductivity\u2014whether electric, metallic, or magic, I don\u2019t know\u2014but it worked.\u201d</p><p>A few fading zombie ghost-images were still circling the drive-in fringes when Ric burned the film in the deserted snack shack\u2019s hot-dog turning machine and\u2014 zombie by zombie by bone by bone by blood by blood\u2014 they each went up in flames in turn.</p><p>Vehicle engines were coughing into life all over the parking lot, choking, and then turning and grinding through the maze of aisles leading from the drive-in lot. Folks had crept back to claim their cars. I saw the half-moon, its hard center line softened to a blur, reflecting off Dolly\u2019s generous dollops of chrome. She looked fine.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I need to wash my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to visit that no-woman\u2019s-land again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t touch Dolly with these hands, much less Quicksilver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah. Your dog is a carnivore too. He was good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never understand males. I\u2019m going to freshen my face, all right? And then we get out of this hell-forsaken retro-ghouls-gone-wild scene. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Ric shrugged. I think Quicksilver, standing beside him with legs braced and hackles still up, shrugged too.</p><p>I just wanted to wash my hands and face and apply some fresh Lip Venom gloss to my desert-dry lips. The familiar had morphed into a Swatch telling me it was half past the witching hour. Everything looked okay inside the women\u2019s restroom. The concrete-floored sink area was deserted; the black-spotted mirrors above the dripping sinks were blurry and misted. Nothing to fear in them.</p><p>I pulled out my Lip Venom tube, shaped like a high-octane bullet, and slicked it over my lips. Ric and I still had to get to a motel room for the night.</p><p>That\u2019s when I heard the whimpering from the stalls around the cinder-block corner.</p><p>Yes, it smelled like a urinal in here. Where a lot of the guys had also been suffering from periods, or just bleeding out. No, I was not going to leave the Cold Creek Drive-in without a civilized touch on my lips and libido and self-respect.</p><p>I turned when the whimpering and lap-dog noises got overpowering.</p><p>Quicksilver would never go into a girl\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Crawling out on the unspeakably wet concrete floor came terrified humans of both sexes. They\u2019d found safety huddling in the women\u2019s bathroom.</p><p>Not even the zombies would go here.</p><p>I was so going to personally \u201cliberate\u201d the next male john I came across.</p><p>Or the next male, who was the usual suspect and who wasn\u2019t twenty feet away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lassie,\u201d I told the familiar, \u201cwe have fifteen more miles to a motel room tonight. I hope there\u2019s only cable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THAT NIGHT AT Cold Creek Motel did us all a lot of good.</p><p>The water was hot, the sheets were flannel, and Ric slept like a baby while Quicksilver roamed the night and I lay awake trying to figure out the connection between my silver familiar, old film, Ric\u2019s new silver iris, and the raising and rescuing and slaying of zombies, offscreen and on.</p><p>I also mused for a while on two far distant kids with bizarre backgrounds, the boy turned man by a vampire bat bite and the girl turned off on womanhood by the threat of boy-vamp bites.</p><p>I decided all these issues deserved to be interred with film-phantom zombie bones, and finally went to sleep.</p> <p>DRIVING DOLLY BACK on the highways that had taken me out of Kansas to Las Vegas felt like a time trip. It had only been a couple of months but\u2014oh, my Auntie Irma\u2014how things had changed.</p><p>The golden daylight felt a world away from the night\u2019s dark silver-nitrate depths.</p><p>Having Ric along, commenting on windmills and shimmering fields of wheat in west Kansas and eagerly anticipating our last big town before Wichita, Dodge City, opened my eyes to scenery and history I\u2019d always taken for granted. It seemed so normal.</p><p>\u201cDodge\u2019s Wyatt Earp Boulevard is no more exciting than Sunset Road in Vegas,\u201d I cautioned him. \u201cYes, Boot Hill is here, smack dab in the downtown area, but it\u2019s pretty touristy tame these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe on the way back we can stop and do all the tourist shtick,\u201d Ric suggested, eyes still glued on his phone screen as it jumped from one hokey website to another. A boy and his remote, on the road.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I promised like a parent would, not really meaning it, but open to being bullied into something later if I had to be.</p><p>Ric was into the second week of his second life, so I tried to be tolerant.</p><p>\u201cNo more replays of the Cold Creek Drive-in zombie jamboree,\u201d I warned him. \u201cThat was gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a little ... weird,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut fascinating. I don\u2019t know if your silver familiar or my sterling new iris drew or repulsed the zombie attack. Maybe my revamped eye is too powerful for supernaturals, and I\u2019ll have to wear sunglasses all the time, like your new Vegas posse, Snow and Sansouci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, you three all in shades would make a freaky Blues Brothers trio for the new millennium. And those two guys aren\u2019t my posse. They\u2019re my ... frenemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be a fan already,\u201d Ric teased me, referring to my tales of Chez Shezmou while he was driving. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny you keep running into Christophe and Cicereau\u2019s main man.\u201d</p> <p>And vice versa.</p><p>Ric had reason to bring that up. Two months ago, I leave Wichita an old maid of twenty-four with an orphaned past and an allergy to intimacy. I get to Vegas, meet my own true love in the first twenty-four hours, and then start tangling with potent paranormals who suddenly find me highly flirtable material.</p><p>I guess falling in love and becoming sexually active gives a girl a glow other dudes might want to warm their hands on. Oddly enough, we were all four on the same side, intermittently. The three guys did sometimes feel like a backup group for the female empowerment identity quest: my super-trio and me, not counting the canine member who provided the falsetto howling.</p><p>At least Shezmou regarded me as only a liberating goddess, nothing personal.</p><p>While I mulled my sudden popularity with the opposite sex and my dismal record with my own, including my elusive mirror double, Ric moved on to serious topics that he faced.</p><p>\u201cDelilah, I\u2019ve got to figure out what\u2019s happening with my offbeat eye and my dead-dowsing skills,\u201d he said, pushing his sunglasses up on his forehead.</p><p>It was hard to decide whether to gaze besottedly into his hot chocolate-dark brown eye or to catch tiny glimpses of myself in the iris of his new silver one.</p><p>\u201cYour vision remains twenty-twenty in both eyes?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I can tell. It\u2019ll be good to try some things out here in the boonies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWichita isn\u2019t a small city, Ric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I read the chamber of commerce site. Two hundred thousand \u2018pop.\u2019 We\u2019ll meet my local contact about fifteen miles outside of town. Place called Augusta?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFamous for hiking trails. Not for Dolly to negotiate. She doesn\u2019t rough it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re hooking up outside the park at some fast-food restaurant named Red Ryder Ranger Station. A fellow ex-FBI agent will be our native guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I hooked up in Sunset Park,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cWho\u2019s our third here? Some hot wench from your unbridled yet privileged D.C. prep school romantic past, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>Ric shrugged with a disarming grin. \u201cCan I help who my friends are?\u201d</p><p>His answer made me even more suspicious. Ric usually slipped into Spanish when mentioning friends, but doing so now would clearly have to indicate gender. Amigo or amiga. He\u2019d just been twitting me about rival Vegas guys. Maybe I really was going to meet an old FBI flame of Ric\u2019s.</p><p>I touched the silver familiar on my chest, still posing as an art-gallery-class piece of turquoise-embedded Native American jewelry.</p><p>\u201cThat silver shape-shifter sure knows how to complement your eye color,\u201d Ric said as he noticed my gesture.</p><p>Quicksilver barked in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cYour baby blues too, Gray Shadow,\u201d Ric twisted around to tell my dog.</p><p>\u201cThis is awfully Southwest style for Kansas,\u201d I said doubtfully, fingering the familiar, which warmed to my touch. \u201cAlthough Coronado did mosey this far north hundreds of years ago, searching for silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoronado? The conquistador?\u201d Ric sounded sharply surprised.</p><p>\u201cOoh, say that again. It sounds so sexy with the proper accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoronado?\u201d Ric repeated in an are-you-nuts tone.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to confess that his authentic pronunciation of the lovely rolled r and soft d of the Spanish language was quickly becoming my instant aphrodisiac.</p><p>\u201cNo. Conquistador, hombre,\u201d I cooed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt so hard when you\u2019re at the wheel, Delilah. Dolly might end up in the ditch.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, feeling good about going back to Wichita for the first time.</p><p>Now you\u2019re getting it, Irma said. We\u2019ve got nothing to fear here but fear itself.</p><p>She was right. Wichita was my home, \u201csour\u201d home. It housed my orphanage and group homes, my fancy private high school on scholarship, my old job, the empty lot of my destroyed rented bungalow, and my old enemies. All \u201cformer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake this next exit,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cAre we heading for the horse pasture or the cow pasture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I hope we stay on the road. We\u2019re aiming at the state highway junction with the county road, where the \u2018gas\u2019 and \u2018grub\u2019 signs tower. I didn\u2019t know Kansas looked so Western east of Dodge City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions and millions of longhorn cattle have been herded over this earth since the mid\u2013eighteen hundreds. We are in \u2018bleeding\u2019 Kansas, city boy, the Free State that started the Civil War over the slave issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it fits that vampires should show up here early and often after the recent millennium meltdown. All that historic blood spilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting point. I never thought of those greaser vamp gangs that hassled me in the group homes before puberty\u2014mine\u2014as early adaptors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Ric said, redonning his sunglasses. \u201cTo give you new insight on your unhappy childhood history. You\u2019re not the only bleeding heart in this car.\u201d</p><p>I slowed Dolly to take the exit ramp, again wondering if I wanted to know more about a past that included repeated assault attempts and some unknown event or events that had made me too paranoid to ever lie on my back again.</p><p>\u201cRape survivor\u201d wasn\u2019t a convincing piece of personal history I wanted to claim. I shivered in Dolly\u2019s sun-warmed red leather interior. Usually she felt womblike, and\u2014after I\u2019d met Ric\u2014sexy. Now, she just felt damn bloody. Like Kansas.</p><p>RIC AND I sat outside at a wooden picnic bench, slurping giant paper cups of root beer, soaking up early summer sun. I\u2019d bought a corny straw cowboy hat inside the Red Ryder Ranger Station to shade my face.</p><p>\u201cYou put on your high-SPF sunscreen this morning?\u201d Ric asked, eyeing my blazing white forearms.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear. Gallons of it. Isn\u2019t that citified silk-blend blazer hot without Vegas air-conditioning to duck into?\u201d I asked in turn.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear. I\u2019ll dress down for the job later.\u201d</p><p>I looked around, hearing an oncoming horsy clickety-clank and then spotting a bleached-blond-maned woman in gold lam\u00e9 spikes and bun-hugging capris, heading into the restaurant. She was layered in brass jewelry\u2014on neck, wrists, and ankle.</p><p>Hardly a Fed.</p><p>Unless ... she was a CI, a confidential informant. Maybe she was a gangster\u2019s wife in the witness protection program. In her place, I sure would want Ric for a contact agent on that detail.</p><p>Me too, would-be mob honey, Irma said.</p><p>Ric\u2019s sunglasses were not following her tail, but aimed at other ones in the adjoining pastures. Grazing cows don\u2019t do much for me, though I find a mare and foal pretty to watch.</p><p>In a bit, my eyes spotted and followed a tall, lean man with a kick-ass belt buckle holding in a faded denim shirt over a significant belly. He bent through the wooden fencing to amble his Justin boots across the road to the restaurant asphalt.</p><p>When he got to our table, Ric stood in his pale Vegas suit and held out a dark hand glinting with bleached golden hairs. \u201cGood to see you again, amigo.\u201d</p><p>The man wearing the straw cowboy hat that made mine look like a kid\u2019s model nodded in my direction. \u201cThis your amiga?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWichita girl, born and fled,\u201d Ric said. \u201cDelilah Street.\u201d</p><p>I stood to shake hands, that not being necessary socially, since I\u2019m a lady. Something about the man required standing.</p><p>\u201cLeonard Tallgrass,\u201d Ric introduced him.</p><p>Tallgrass\u2019s sunburned skin was darker than Ric\u2019s. The black eyes in a seamed face with broad cheekbones told me Ric\u2019s ex-FBI buddy was pretty pure Native American\u2013 born.</p><p>Exactly what tribe would be hard to guess. The Cheyenne and Kiowa fought the Long Knives here, and almost every tribe in North America had been moved to Kansas after the Indian Wars before most of them were finally moved to Oklahoma. That left contemporary Kansas with a trio of tiny reservations of Kickapoos and such in the state\u2019s northeast corner. Most of its Native American population lived all over the lower forty-eight, and beyond.</p><p>\u201cMr. Tallgrass,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMiss Street. You look even better in person. That was a real interesting TV piece you did on the mutilated cows a couple months back, but there was no follow-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left the station rather unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, giving me that Western scout squint. Leonard Tallgrass had been living up to that cowboys-and-Indians clich\u00e9 with a tongue in his seamed cheek for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cThat anchorman did give it a lame mention later,\u201d Tall-grass said. \u201cReported it was found to be teenage mischief. You must have known him, the paleface with the lipstick.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a smirk. \u201cUndead Ted is an up-to-date media vampire. Apparently they prefer a vivid background for their bleached canine fangs on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of canines\u2014\u201d Tallgrass turned to squint at Dolly. \u201cThat your ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your dog in it?\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver heard, of course, and sat up in the backseat to establish his presence, front paws braced on the open window rim, looking seriously protective.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this dead-dowsing young amigo of mine doing in such fine company? And that is not a dog, Miss Street; he is Brother Wolf, and a member of my tribe. Why isn\u2019t he dining with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe guards Dolly and Ric guards me, and I guard both of them. And the food here sucks, Mr. Tallgrass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll all go to my place.\u201d He turned away, then turned back. \u201cMiss Dolly is the Cadillac?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe is prime. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>LEONARD TALLGRASS\u2019S RIDE was a new but mud-crusted hybrid black Ford 350 pickup, and his \u201cplace\u201d was an apartment in a complex with a soaring fountain in the courtyard. Inside, an art gallery of weapons ancient, new, and unknown to me decked the walls. So much for \u201cprairie squint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that necklace,\u201d he said when we were seated in his dining alcove digesting his walnut and blue cheese chicken salad with lemongrass and extra-virgin olive oil. \u201cIt\u2019s not an authentic native design, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an authentic necklace.\u201d</p><p>He slouched onto his blue-jeaned tailbone. \u201cMi amigo Ricardo has found an extremely interesting young lady. I\u2019ve already made contact with a series of your social workers.\u201d</p><p>My sass went south.</p><p>\u201cThose folks mean well,\u201d he added, \u201cbut your job clearly was to survive them, and you did. They\u2019re still here in Wichita, and you\u2019re not. You have a much better ride than any of them, and a better class of company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume my \u2018classy company\u2019 includes you. I don\u2019t remember any social workers.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey were pretty forgettable. An ungrateful job. Almost as ungrateful as ours sometimes was, eh, Ricardo?\u201d</p><p>Ric nodded.</p><p>Tallgrass took a new tack. \u201cThat cow mutilation story of yours, Miss Street, was an important one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Delilah. The station barely deigned to run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Leonard. Tallgrass will do. Was it the usual stupidity? Or a cover-up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stick around long enough to find out.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass eyed Ric. \u201cWe should check out the site. You a movie star now?\u201d He directed his formidable squint at Ric\u2019s sunglasses.</p><p>There was a long, long pause. I knew enough not to say a word. Quicksilver stood defensively, which made Tall-grass lilt a shaggy eyebrow.</p><p>Ric finally doffed his sunglasses. He hated wearing the brown contact lens and obviously hadn\u2019t anticipated an indoor meeting. So his silver eye winked like a built-in monocle.</p><p>Tallgrass observed, mulled, and finally nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve become an even more interesting young man. I think Miss Street\u2014Delilah\u2014should liberate that film she got on the messed-up cows from WTCH-TV.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to unreel a string of reasons why that was unnecessary, humiliating, and impossible.</p><p>\u201cWhile,\u201d Leonard Tallgrass went on, \u201cmi amigo takes me to that field and Mr. Quicksilver does a thorough nose job on it.\u201d</p><p>I objected. \u201cQuicksilver isn\u2019t a drug-or bomb-sniffing dog, and he certainly isn\u2019t a cadaver dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you the moment we met, Miss Delilah. He isn\u2019t much dog, but he\u2019s a lot of something else.\u201d</p><p>At that point, Quicksilver went to Leonard\u2019s chair and sat, after glancing his agreement at me.</p><p>My necklace shrunk into a plain, career-woman circlet at the base of my throat that wouldn\u2019t protect me from a mosquito bite, much less a vampire fanging.</p><p>It was The Three Amigos (like the movie) and an animated hair against my self-respect.</p><p>Guess who won?</p><p>I programmed the cow pasture directions into Ric\u2019s GPS and revved up Dolly for our return to Wichita. At least she wouldn\u2019t be getting her undercarriage dusty on unpaved country roads. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WITH THE GUYS off in Leonard Tallgrass\u2019s pickup to examine the cow-killing ground, we girls had time for less gory expeditions of our own.</p><p>First I stopped at a centrally located, low-profile place I knew, the Thunderbird Inn (Tallgrass would approve) to book a room for Ric and me. When I called Ric with the info, we agreed to meet there when it got too dark for field explorations.</p><p>Suited me. An unloaded Dolly and I made a beeline straight for my Wichita place of employment ... before I\u2019d been effectively driven out of it by a lecherous vampire, a scheming weather witch, and a rogue personal tornado.</p><p>Most TV stations are modest one-story buildings attached to tall broadcast towers occupying high ground where land is cheap, far from the city center. WTCH-TV had the usual long entry driveway and suburban neighborhood.</p> <p>I reflected that by now the male investigative team of two guys and a dog was sniffing and sifting through a cow-patty-laden field I\u2019d last seen by the gleam of a flashlight illuminating mutilated cattle corpses.</p><p>Another lovely Wichita memory, but it wasn\u2019t as scary to me as all the \u201cmissing time\u201d in my growing-up history. Right now, my major problem was to park Dolly discreetly. The aim was to avoid contact with anchorman Undead Ted Brinkman and Sheena Coleman, the station weather witch, during this hit-and-run visit.</p><p>I eased Delilah behind the far side of one of the station\u2019s mobile broadcast vans.</p><p>Wichita was having a quiet news day. Videographer \u201cSlo-mo\u201d Eddie Anderson had been happy to hear from my cell phone and was at the station as of ten minutes ago. One never knew when news would break out, so I slipped around the building to the back loading dock.</p><p>I\u2019d have to scale it in my mid-heeled suit pumps and black leggings, worn under a mini-length navy shirtdress, the casual opposite of my conservative hose-and-suit-wearing on-camera self. Eddie was an ace camera guy, but the lanky, morose type who was always down on \u201cmanagement,\u201d so he was a born liaison for a disgruntled ex-employee.</p> <p>\u201cDelilah,\u201d he greeted me with a whisper when I\u2019d clambered the four feet up to the loading dock and eased into the slightly open end of the steel security curtain. \u201cMan, it\u2019s been no fun fest with only the supernaturals running the news desk. You look like being gone agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d had some bad days before Sheena sent a \u2018freak\u2019 tornado to take out my rental house. Sorry I didn\u2019t stick around to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Eddie scratched at his scrawny new mustache. \u201cCan\u2019t blame you. They stole your paranormal news beats and then flaked out on covering them. They even rescheduled the interview we had cancelled, with the old lady at Sunset City retirement place. Then the new regime sent me back to Sunset City with Sheena, but her interview was pretty boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That old woman, Caressa Teagarden, moved to the Vegas Sunset City. At least I found her there after I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she must have been swept up and out in that targeted tornado of yours, because the old dame Sheena interviewed was named Lili West and she was a total fox of forty-something, like all of those artificially preserved Sunset City senior citizen residents. Your old Caressa lady looked senior. Kinda cool to see these days.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, knowing what he meant. \u201cShe still does. Was Lili West at the same address as our aborted assignment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, come to think of it. No general manager has ever done that to me, called me back from an assignment for no good reason, like a fast-food place mass shooting. Good thing he\u2019s gone too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred Fogelman is gone? Who\u2019s running the station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy named Javier. Hah-vee-air. Like I said, the place has gone downhill. It\u2019s all happy \u2018news you can use\u2019 now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a wonder if the station hadn\u2019t declined with Undead Ted and Sheena taking over my beats,\u201d I said. \u201cTed is an empty suit and a lame pair of fangs, and Sheena is a lousy weather witch without one reporter\u2019s gene in her artificially supplemented body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little competitive with our weather gal, Sheena? You had network written all over you, Delilah. Sheena sure had it in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it because I\u2019d agreed to go out with Undead Ted that Friday? Didn\u2019t even happen. He acted up and I kicked him out. He must have gone sniveling back to Sheena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Whatever bee got in her bonnet, it just sprung up, like a high pressure cell. While you were off for the weekend, she was in the general manager\u2019s office trashing you from that Saturday on through Monday. She tried to get our scoop footage from the cow pasture scene off the air, I know that. Then you and I were called back Monday en route to that dumb old-lady interview assignment at Sunset City the GM put you on. I think that was her doing too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaddling me with that lame feature or getting us called back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne, or maybe both,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt was just unprofessional, that\u2019s what it was. And now, Undead Ted, he just trots along on Sheena\u2019s leash like a vamp tranqued on blood thinners.\u201d</p><p>The conversation reminded me I\u2019d spent that Saturday off taking my suddenly ailing dog to the vet, then finding he\u2019d contracted blood poisoning and couldn\u2019t be saved. All from biting Undead Ted\u2019s ankle after the lech had tricked me into cutting a finger he wanted as an appetizer before mainlining on one of my major arteries after our dinner out.</p><p>I\u2019d never heard of a vampire\u2019s blood being poisonous to house pets before, like some species of plant, but then, they seldom did the bleeding and the Millennium Revelation was still revealing unsuspected supernatural variations and species. A pang of anxiety about Ric hit when I wondered what losing all your blood to vampires could do.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what went on that weekend, Eddie,\u201d I told him. \u201cI not only wasn\u2019t scheduled to work, but I ... lost my dog that Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat feisty white Lhasa? Too bad, Delilah. No wonder you were kinda down that Monday. You brought him in once. Akita or something.\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s mistake saved me from a total emotional rerun. Reporters live to inform and correct. \u201cAn Akita is a breed of Japanese dog. My Lhasa\u2019s name was Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d As if he cared. Cameramen have seen it all and are a nonchalant breed. \u201cLike the Greek hero with something wrong with his heel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the hero with the bum heel,\u201d I agreed, beating back the memories. As a pup, Achilles had always chased my heels, so the name was appropriate. I just didn\u2019t expect that the \u201chero\u201d part would get him killed.</p><p>Eddie shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was going on that weekend, or since, but it\u2019s been hell around here after you left. I\u2019m thinking of quitting too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great videographer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who does traditional \u2018news\u2019 anymore? We\u2019re a dying breed. Whatcha doing in Vegas for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestigative work for a television producer, among other, er, major Vegas Strip clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. You\u2019ve landed on your girl-reporter pumps. I don\u2019t wanta get you charged up about what\u2019s over and done at the station. Besides Sheena being Bitch Witch, it\u2019s a lot of management political correctness that\u2019s been coming on for years. Hire the minorities, like the Latino brass, and the anchor vamps and the weather witches. You know the news has been going to hell since the big flare-up after the Millennium Revelation. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, the aliens have landed,\u2019 but now they\u2019re coming up out of our caves and cornfields and They R Us. Anyway, you can download your piece on the cow mutilations to your cell off my backup flash drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I was glad simple computerized functions didn\u2019t need hookups now, just proximity. It was like zipless sex. In a second, his info was my info too.</p><p>\u201cHey, Delilah.\u201d Eddie chuckled like a TV cartoon ghoul. \u201cI added some hilarious footage of Undead Ted and Sheena screwing up on camera. I even caught \u2019em actually screwing in the dead storage vault. I YouTube that stuff now and then. You wanta come into the studio and say hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. This is all I need, Eddie. Thanks for the \u2018added value content.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a howl. Sheena accidentally had it hailing in the studio a couple weeks ago. Funny, we\u2019ve been having a lot of freakish weather lately, but no indoor hail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Midwest,\u201d I said. \u201cFreakish weather is our biggest tourist attraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be weird living in sunshine year-round in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s weird living in Vegas, but it\u2019s not all sunshine,\u201d I said in vague understatement.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you off the loading dock?\u201d</p><p>Fast Eddie bent to stretch out a lank arm with a helping hand on the end of it.</p><p>\u201cEddie, the gentleman? You must really miss me,\u201d I commented as I grabbed his hand, although I appreciated his easing me through the four-foot drop.</p><p>He straightened up to tower above me, shaking his head, even his mustache drooping morosely. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>WITH QUICKSILVER ABSENT and unable to play guard, I\u2019d left Dolly locked with her top up.</p><p>So when I opened the driver\u2019s door with my old-fashioned key\u2014direct interface, imagine\u2014I sat in the interior shade and played Slo-mo Eddie\u2019s treasure trove of scenes.</p><p>I watched his recording of my stand-up report on the dark country road by the cattle mutilation scene earlier that spring ... as if from years later or a planet away. It was a good story, told without glitches, but I seemed so young and polite and parochial-school girl.</p><p>I\u2019d reeled off the bit-role lines Hector Nightwine had given me on CSI V in Vegas a week ago with a new edge that came naturally. The portly producer was hoping my performance would either lure my double, Lilith, back to the CSI fold, or establish me as her replacement. I hoped it would lure Lilith too. I wanted to know how long she\u2019d been doing her twin act in my life before I\u2019d spotted her on CSI.</p><p>The image of the old, WTCH-TV Delilah made me rerun leaving Wichita two months ago. My first fill-up stop for Dolly at a remote Colorado gas station had forced me to fend off a trio of creepy backwoods guys and burn rubber out of there.</p><p>Having to dodge booty bounty hunters going after my \u201cCSI-autopsy-star\u201d twin the moment I left Kansas had made me a lot warier and assertive. And way less polite. Not to mention that certain confidence I derived from finally getting a sex life. Knowing how the other 99 percent lived sure increased one\u2019s daily savoir faire.</p><p>Sighing as my sweet innocent self disappeared from the small screen, I soon was snickering at Undead Ted as he practiced resting his supposedly \u201csupplemented\u201d fang-tips on his lower lip before going \u201clive\u201d on camera.</p><p>When he was caught touching up his tinted lip gloss, I fast-forwarded past, my own recent passion-pit adventures with lip gloss making me blush like a schoolgirl again. Damn! Would my pale skin always make me a patsy for the unwanted flush? Probably.</p><p>I made a fierce face at the telltale screen, then slowed it to normal.</p><p>Seeing Undead Ted and Sheena lip-locking against the station blue-screen was like watching the Christmas Chipmunks with their braces in gridlock. There was enough bleach on those teeth to off Sheena. At least, I assumed, witches remained human enough to off. But then, my idea of a happy ending was Red Riding Hood or Hansel and Gretel. Or, more apropos to the current location, The Wizard of Oz.</p><p>While cruising the snips of my old news reports, I realized that I\u2019d definitely grown by leaving my once-safe niche at WTCH. Eddie had ended my trip down bad-memory lane with Sheena\u2019s later interview with the Sunset City resident of the new management\u2019s choice.</p><p>Sheena was an anorexic blonde with inflated bust and lips. Unlike a lot of \u201cweather gals\u201d who\u2019d forged the way for weather witches to take their places, she was more about her looks and attitude than making \u201cdry\u201d weather statistics fascinating and relevant to the viewers.</p><p>Weather guys and gals had always been the geeks on the highly photogenic TV news teams of my growing-up era. The viewers sensed they had a real passion for their high-and low-pressure areas, that naughty acting-out El Ni\u00f1o, the evil confluence of clashing hot and cold fronts that makes the perfect storm.</p><p>Lightning and thunder were still-living gods that could throw panic into human cardiac systems in the heartland, but we had our \u00fcber-outlaw, our supernatural sky-dancer, our bane and our bragging point.</p><p>Here in Kansas, of course, it was that regal couple of phenomena, the Queen and King of murderously bad weather, the spinning, twirling, shimmying, livestock-sucking, clothes-stripping, tree-hurling, house-splintering, Dorothy-napping, witch-smashing ... tornado.</p><p>I actually took a certain perverse pride in having been the worthy victim of one, even if it had been an intensely personal strike from a weather witch on my TV \u201cteam.\u201d A minor, secondary-city weather witch didn\u2019t aim a teensyweensy sixty-foot-circumference \u201ctwister\u201d at just ... anybody. I had to have really pissed her off.</p><p>Why? Not just jealousy.</p><p>Sheena was becoming as much a mystery to me as Lilith.</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be allowed to continue.</p><p>I turned on Dolly\u2019s engine and checked the rearview mirror before pulling beyond the safety screen of the station news van. Dolly was idling backward when my foot stabbed the brakes.</p><p>Good girl! Dolly didn\u2019t let out so much as a squeak.</p><p>Speak of the devils you know. I recognized Undead Ted\u2019s and Sheena\u2019s profiles through the tinted side windows of an impeccably washed black Lincoln Town Car also idling in the parking lot.</p><p>A moment later the swarthy capped driver got out to open the back passenger door.</p><p>I watched a hose-sheened, long, lean leg thrust out to place a scarlet platform spike shoe on the asphalt. Ugh. Sheena always dressed like the head bitch on a seventies nighttime TV soap opera. The short skirt of a slim red suit followed, along with her red-taloned fingernails, swollen-sphincter crimson lips and \u201cdone\u201d blond hair.</p><p>The same old Sheena, only much more expensively dressed.</p><p>Undead Ted crawled out after her, gazing like a love-sick puppy at the lady in bloodred.</p><p>Everybody at WTCH had known Ted took injections to resist daylight so he could do pre-sunset newscasts. A George Hamilton product pumped melatonin into his skin, giving him that golden glow. Now his vampy complexion looked just plain sallow, freckled with a carefully cultivated thirty-six-hour brown beard smudge. He was a liver-spotted puppy.</p><p>His dried-blood-color designer suit\u2014I\u2019d seen Lightdays pads more attractively shaded\u2014was much more posh, but only two-thirds up to Ric level. Standing next to Sheena, Ted looked ... drained. Who was the vampire here?</p><p>The driver had moved around to the car\u2019s opposite passenger door.</p><p>I grabbed my cell phone and twisted my head over my shoulder to film the unhandsome couple and wait for a glimpse of their obvious lunch date. At first the Lincoln\u2019s roofline just gleamed in the sun. Then I glimpsed something black rising over the hot metal horizon.</p><p>A hat. A wide black-leather brim somewhere between a flat-crowned Western hat and the razor-sharp oversize fedora affected by seventies pimps. It was almost a hat a woman might wear ... if she were Janet Jackson onstage.</p><p>Under the sinister brim surfaced a furrowed, seamed brow the mahogany-deep color of a Greek island suntan and peaked, scowling Satanic black eyebrows. The nose was long and bulged in the middle like a digesting boa constrictor. The tip narrowed and dipped so delicately it made the nostrils into thin upward-slanted slits you might see on a serpent\u2019s face.</p><p>In contrast, the mustache had a ragged upper line and drooped down over sloppy lips almost as obscenely full as Sheena\u2019s collagen-pumped beauties.</p><p>I kept filming, thinking this moment was like watching a strike-ready royal Egyptian cobra rear its fanned head.</p><p>The man\u2019s suspicious, slitted dark eyes scanned the building and lot so intently I felt sure he\u2019d seen me. Luckily, Ted and Sheena moving around to the car\u2019s rear stopped his gaze before it passed the parked van that concealed Dolly. Black is beautiful ... camouflage.</p><p>I watched the three passengers wait while the driver came around to open the popped trunk. He handed out two exotic-skinned wooden briefcases, presenting the black one to Sheena, the brown to Ted.</p><p>The stranger with the bad-and-the-ugly eyes was shorter than my ex-colleagues, maybe five-eight, like me. Despite his dark mustache and beard stubble, I guessed his age at sixty or so. His suit and shirt may have been expensive, but both seemed wilted by the intemperate intensity of his expression and stance. His business was not being telegenic. I sensed his business was about not being seen at all.</p><p>My fingertips felt cold on the cell phone now that he\u2019d been captured inside it. The driver was already ushering him back into the rear seat, sweat beading in a salty dew line under his cap band as he came around to drive the boss away.</p><p>Undead Ted blinked in the sunlight when the driver\u2019s door slammed shut.</p><p>The big black modern luxury car glided away, a shadow of Dolly\u2019s timeless power and grace. Ted and Sheena turned and marched for the main entrance, suddenly swinging their overstated briefcases and grinning at each other.</p><p>Okay. I took my foot off Dolly\u2019s brake and I backed her out until we were clear of the van, which took several seconds. Then I wrenched her steering wheel left and spurted forward with an engine thrust no one could ignore.</p><p>I braked in front of the briefcase buddies with a deliberate squeal.</p><p>They\u2019d turned to regard my car with dropped jaws as I lowered the passenger side window.</p><p>\u201cDelilah ... ?\u201d Undead Ted began, his face turning pale saffron.</p><p>Sheena strutted toward Dolly.</p><p>\u201cDelilah Street and her Cadillac clunker, my, my. I thought you\u2019d hitched a ride out of town on a Kansas twister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That teensy little tornado missed me. Don\u2019t you two look sharp. Must have had a lunch date with the new management. Care to share the contents of those briefcases with a fellow reporter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Undead Ted spilled. Of course it was something, something they didn\u2019t want anyone to know about.</p><p>Sheena keyed his shin with her spike heel.</p><p>\u201cLooks like payday to me,\u201d I said, watching Ted writhe in intimidated silence. What a wimp.</p><p>Sheena was advancing as if she was about to do the same damage to Dolly\u2019s shiny black side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I called, waving my hand. \u201cLucky for you I\u2019m just visiting.\u201d</p><p>I accelerated before Sheena\u2019s foot could connect with anything but air.</p><p>Unfortunately, air is all around us and Sheena was a weather witch.</p><p>I hit the power button to lower the top, but that took mucho seconds. They had more time to waste in the fifties and less nimble technology. Dolly accelerated while I punched the side window button closed.</p><p>The shadow creeping over me was not just the descending top, but a nasty black cloud the size of a railroad car. My rearview mirror told me raindrops were falling on Dolly\u2019s trunk. We sped down the endlessly curving drive. Hailstones were moments behind.</p><p>I needed to hit the main street faster. I could hear the brittle pings on the driveway behind me. At a crosswalk near the parking lot\u2019s other end I roared Dolly onto the broad intersecting sidewalk and then cross-country on WTCH-TVs expansive green lawn, under a landscaped grove of maple trees, over the street curb\u2014ouch on the springs!\u2014down a few blocks, and under a gas station canopy.</p><p>\u201cCool wheels, lady,\u201d exclaimed the teenaged male store clerk who\u2019d rushed out to ogle Dolly. He cocked an ear at the hail ping-ponging off the metal canopy above us. \u201cThat rainstorm came up quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy come, easy go,\u201d I said. Sheena wouldn\u2019t want any inexplicable weather phenomena reported too close to WTCH. \u201cI don\u2019t need fuel, although this is a thirsty big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat year?\u201d he asked, following me as I circled Dolly looking for damage, as puppy-doggish as Undead Ted was these days. \u201cMaybe fifty-eight, sixty? Biarritz! I heard Cary Grant owned one of these.\u201d</p><p>I stopped cold. \u201cYou know who Cary Grant was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He was a movie star back in the last century. They owned a lot of cool cars. Can I look under the hood?\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you know Dolly would get a proposition in Wichita and I wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve got to get going. But you can polish her tail fins and trunk before we leave. Don\u2019t want any dust spots on that finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGollee, no.\u201d</p><p>I provided a flannel cloth from the glove compartment and he went to work.</p><p>You were really thumbing your nose at fate back there, Irma noted as I finally pulled back onto the main drag under a clear sky. You should have had the kid check Dolly\u2019s shocks.</p><p>I ignored her until she went away.</p><p>THE DAY WAS still young and the boys and I hadn\u2019t planned to meet back at Tallgrass\u2019s place until much later. I suspected some beer-accompanied reminiscences of mutual FBI days would occupy them after the pasture inspection.</p><p>Before my visit to Wichita delved too far into my uneasy past, I decided to do some less scary snooping on my own behalf. Dolly seemed inclined to cruise the familiar neighborhood past the station, so we veered together to the site of my rented bungalow, which a mighty specific tornado had torn off its foundation.</p><p>What a jolt to see a half-completed house already going up on the site. I\u2019d liked my life and my little house and dog and doing a paranormal reporting TV job I thought was important, informing people about their brave newly supernatural world. ...</p><p>Construction was idled today, but I spotted the back of a big sign on the lot. I drove past and craned my neck. Habitat for Humanity, it read. I couldn\u2019t help smiling. Somebody did me wrong, and now somebody was doing someone who needed it right. Of course, even nowadays I supposed the houses must be available to all \u201cminorities.\u201d I doubted we\u2019d ever see the name changed to Habitat for Unhumanity, though.</p><p>Still smiling, I decided to wheel out to Sunset City and look for Lili West\u2019s extended-life address. I\u2019d been a reporter, right? Maybe it was high time to \u201creport\u201d my own backyard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ALL THE SUNSET City \u201cretirement\u201d homes had the owners\u2019 customized look and a matching mailbox with their name out front. Security was constant and universally electronic, no visible gates and guards needed.</p><p>Despite the open look to the curving streets, no one quite knew what kept these elderly residents \u201cliving\u201d on. Rumor was that a good part of their physical presence was virtual and expensively maintained by only the very wealthy, as cosmetic surgery used to be.</p><p>Caressa Teagarden, who\u2019d either moved to the Las Vegas Sunset City about when I\u2019d left town, or had followed me there, was a Golden Age film actress originally named Lilah, who\u2019d had a twin, Lili, she was estranged from long before I was born.</p><p>I had been an abandoned infant named after my foundling location. Delilah Street. Not in Wichita, Kansas, thank you. No biblical bad ladies name streets here. I also had a double, if not a twin. Lilith Quince was my sister shadow, glimpsed in my mirror after I\u2019d seen her on TV. Lilith. Delilah. Yeah. Do the word game. Lili and Lilah all over again.</p> <p>I was curious to see if Eddie\u2019s \u201cLili West\u201d really lived here and would somehow fit into the complex crossword puzzle of my life and times.</p><p>Caressa, formerly Lilah, was unusual for this post\u2013 Millennium Revelation era in that she actually allowed herself to look old. That was a choice nowadays, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have the starch to make her decision forty years hence. Assuming I had another forty years. After anonymous docile years in Wichita group homes and educational institutions, I was suddenly finding the long, curved life-line in my right palm facing serial, sudden-death overtimes. The left-hand lifeline is the one you inherit. The right line is the one you make.</p><p>Speaking of sudden, I glimpsed an ornate wrought-iron \u201cLili West\u201d on a mailbox pillar formed from pebbled stones in concrete.</p><p>Dolly eased to the opposite curb like a well-trained greyhound, hardly requiring my hand on the steering wheel. And why not? Any superior automobile would be privileged to park outside 240 Knot Way.</p><p>When you didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d been born in a house or a hospital or just next to the nearest Dumpster, you tended to fantasize about the perfect residence. Mine were always vintage, and this was a lovely 1920s creation, not a squat bungalow like I\u2019d actually rented in Wichita, but a two-story brown stucco affair with a pine-top-high pointed roof promising numerous lofty attic gables to explore, and a towering brick chimney to match.</p> <p>My home-longing imagination was already decorating this giant dollhouse.</p><p>Inside would be built-in glass-fronted bookcases flanking a tiled fireplace, cozy window seats in every bedroom, a mirror-topped built-in buffet in the dining room, which was big enough to seat twelve, many cozy closets under stairs and in gables for the inventive child to hide in.</p><p>It would be so different from the bland, one-story group homes I\u2019d called prison.</p><p>I got out of Dolly and slammed her front door shut, knowing that solid, secure sound would be echoed here by the big wooden front door with the giant black wrought-iron hinges.</p><p>I could almost smell warm apples and cinnamon, the Realtor\u2019s favorite lures, wafting down the curving walk as I headed for the massive front door. Every town in the country had a neighborhood of homes this vintage\u2014 except Las Vegas.</p><p>True, I lived in the Enchanted Cottage on Hector Night-wine\u2019s estate, but that was a 1940s movie set made real. This house was another twenty years older, and, although not enchanted, it mesmerized me. Caressa\u2019s Sunset City residence near Las Vegas was so lakeside cottage compared to this.</p> <p>I waltzed forward until I was eye-to-eye with the big iron knocker, paused, picked up the heavy striker in the shape of a W and let it fall back with a thump like thunder. I\u2019d grown up in Wichita hoping to be invisible, but I no longer would be unheard here, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>Spiderweb leading supported the door\u2019s frosted glass round window. It was too high off the ground for me to see into, even on tiptoes. And I so wanted to peek. I felt like a kid again, with an actual neighborhood to explore besides suburbia.</p><p>The door opened to showcase a petite woman who only came up to my shoulder.</p><p>I searched her forever-forty features and found the symmetrical bone structure she shared with her aged twin sister. Her hair was a vibrant, almost statically fluffed ginger color, neither red nor brown. No wonder Eddie had called her \u201cfoxy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just for her perfect figure in miniature. Caressa must have been a knockout in her day. How could she have let herself wrinkle and whiten when she could be preserved in vibrant, living amber, like her sister Lili?</p><p>I pictured Lilith and me doing the \u201cportrait of Dorian Gray\u201d thing, with her image in the mirror puckering and melting and me not knowing if she was my reflection or a fading life force.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not selling anything door-to-door, young lady,\u201d the resident warned. Her voice was sharp and scratchy, the only thing \u201cold\u201d about her. \u201cThat\u2019s not allowed here and the penalties are severe.\u201d</p><p>Her raw, suspicious tone startled my undercover reporter instincts into coming up with a plausible story for just being curious.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not. I\u2019m ... writing a web piece on your sister Caressa\u2019s film career. My name is Delilah Street.\u201d</p> <p>Her amber-brown eyes blinked alert at mention of her sister. \u201cYou may know your name, but my sister apparently still doesn\u2019t know hers. It\u2019s Lilah West. I won\u2019t talk about \u2018Caressa Teagarden\u2019 and that stupid so-called film career of hers, but I will discuss Lilah. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I sensed odors of potpourri and perfume swirling inside and heard tinkling chimes. The furnishings emitted metallic and glassy winks from the room behind her. I was dying for a house tour.</p><p>\u201cThen come in,\u201d she invited, sweeping the huge door wide as if it weighed as little as a feather.</p><p>I studied her as I passed through a tiny entry hall into a huge main room anchored by a carved gray stone fireplace tall enough for Frankenstein\u2019s monster to reach for the sky in.</p><p>This was the dramatic ambiance I\u2019d expected for a vintage movie queen like Caressa, not the cottage she inhabited in the Las Vegas Sunset City.</p><p>Lili spun to face me on her dainty red high-heeled mules. Louboutins, I\u2019d bet. I didn\u2019t surf the discount designer websites in vain. She was wearing an aqua micro-fiber top and genie-styled capris, tight at the ankle but swagged at the hips.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWTCH did a recent feature on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm at ten. A minute-thirty. Hardly a feature, my dear. I hope you\u2019re going to deal with my poor sister in greater detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Web allows for unlimited content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, doesn\u2019t it? Pity. Brevity is the soul of substance. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver wouldn\u2019t have bowed to that spat command, but I was a reporter in search of facts that could affect my personal future. I sat.</p><p>Goodness. What was at the back of my knees was a large blue ottoman brocaded in an Asian cloud pattern. Every piece here was an exotic rarity, including the lady of the house. Her ego was as large as her body was trim. It was time to go gaga girl reporter, an easy role to slip into.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still in Kansas,\u201d I bubbled, quite honestly. \u201cYour house is so fascinating and so are you.\u201d</p><p>Lili\u2019s complacent smile as she sat on a giant brown leather wing chair confirmed my instincts.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Lili said, \u201cI was far more able to express myself wherever I was than Lilah. She needed the medium of film. I thrived on the direct effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she became a film actress and you became\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA performance artist. Surely you can sense the temperament in my house alone?\u201d</p><p>Invited to ogle the interior, I did. High against the coffered ceiling, I finally spotted Plexiglas fan blades slowly turning, turning, turning. That\u2019s what made the scene swirl around and cooled the interior.</p><p>Now that my eyes were adapting to the dimness, I spotted lots of museum-style pedestals holding rare artifacts.</p><p>Like the gold and black head of Anubis. That\u2019s when my spine decided to do the paso doble.</p><p>And ... a rare green geode bristling with rectilinear green-glass towers.</p><p>One of those freaky glass globes holding lightning in a jar that Sharper Image used to sell when it was solvent and we were still the champions of the world.</p><p>A severed tattooed arm floating in what appeared to be lime green Jell-O.</p><p>And ... a pair of silver tap shoes from a nineteen-thirties chorus line.</p><p>\u201cI have quite a collection,\u201d Lili said. \u201cPerhaps I could interest a sharp young lady like you in working as my assistant. I plan a biography as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. You\u2019d have a lot to tell. I mean, I can tell you\u2019ve lived a fascinating life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike Lilah. She withered. Literally and figuratively. She was booted out of this Sunset City, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have the wrong sort of people ruining our ambiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters are overrated, my dear. Live longer and you\u2019ll see that. Not trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe gave up and got old,\u201d Lili said. \u201cI remain active. In fact, I have my own lucrative business going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcology,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing green is quite the thing these days, and right up my alley. I was always interested in formulas and scientific effects on our world. The wind, the weather, the warming globe. I\u2019m particularly fond of globes. You may notice that many, many decorate my home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spotted the spherical glimmer of glass everywhere.</p><p>\u201cSnow globes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSome. I do not limit my horizons, dear girl. Ah. I\u2019ve forgotten to offer you tea and sympathy or at least scones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing girls are always hungry,\u201d she growled at me.</p><p>I was beginning to feel like Alice at a mad tea party with the Red Queen.</p><p>\u201cJust a nibble, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go toss something tasty together.\u201d</p><p>She clipped off on her petite red spikes.</p><p>While she was gone, I got up to do a polite but thorough inspection of her main room.</p><p>I smiled and shook up a globe of downtown Wichita. Over there was Manhattan, of course. Wait. Manhattan, Kansas. Letdown.</p><p>And ... Augusta, not in Georgia, but the nearby community with the old downtown and its restored movie palace.</p><p>They were really up-to-date ... in Kansas City and environs, and there weren\u2019t just snow globes, but rain globes and fog globes and sleet globes. And so fanciful. One even had the Emerald City of Oz inside it, with a tiny broom-riding witch shooting fog across the sky reading: Surrender Dorothy.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve found my specialty globes,\u201d Lili said, clicking back into the room with a tray.</p><p>\u201cCan you duplicate The Wizard of Oz scenes without permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my land, girl! Of course I got permission. I told you I headed a big corporation. Now sit down and drink this lovely, local tallgrass tea and have some homemade gingerbread scones.\u201d</p><p>Ah ... no.</p><p>But I\u2019d be willing to sit in front of them and ask some questions. I didn\u2019t have to. Lili was pleased to chatter about her sister.</p><p>\u201cKansas wasn\u2019t good enough for Lilah. I told her the center of the country was best for us West girls, but she had Hollywood dreams. She blew off the family business and went\u201d\u2014she rolled her eyes\u2014\u201creally west. And what did she have to show for it? A few minor roles in third-rate films. At least she changed her name so as not to embarrass us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was ... is ... the family business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing glamorous like motion pictures. Heating, plumbing, air-conditioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was ... available when you two were young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious, child! Of course. In fact, it was air-conditioning that seduced Lilah from Wichita to the Wild West.\u201d</p><p>I sipped a little tallgrass tea, and tried not to spit it out. It was chili-flavored!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said when I could speak again. \u201cAir-conditioning doesn\u2019t sound very seductive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating field, with unlimited growth potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the early movie theaters have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly right. Those Roaring Twenties were also purring with Willis Carrier\u2019s rival air conditioner. He was a city slicker who sold the idea to the Rivoli movie house on Broadway in 1925. Our father, Weatherbee West, leaped into the business at the new Augusta film palace near Wichita and captured the central U.S. market. Alas, Lilah fell in love with the movie palaces and the silent films inside them, instead of the mammoth pulsing machinery cooling them. She made the oddest remark when she took the train to California against all our family\u2019s wishes, when she left the heating and air-conditioning factory for the film factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked, sniffing a terrific quote. Not that an investigator needed one like a reporter did. Great quotes, and recognizing them when you heard them, was a reporter\u2019s lifeblood.</p><p>She said, \u201cThe heart lies between the hand and the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a great quote.\u201d I\u2019d heard it before, but where or when I couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was great,\u201d Lili snapped. \u201cI said it was odd.\u201d</p><p>I studied her petite curvaceous figure and momentarily frowning face.</p><p>Caressa Teagarden was a funky old lady, but at least she looked her age, unlike her so-called twin. What was really odd was how different they had become.</p><p>\u201cReally, I must go,\u201d I said, standing. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me so much insight into your sister. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said more than a couple paragraphs about the bitch, all you\u2019d get in a mediocre obituary for a mediocre film career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much insight,\u201d I repeated, backing toward the door. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do a double profile on you two, kind of like the John and Yoko famous fetal-twin photo.\u201d</p><p>The reference so confused Lili that she stopped stalking after me on my hasty exit.</p><p>By the time I got down the sidewalk to the curb, Dolly\u2019s engine was already running. I\u2019d been so taken by the charming house exterior, I\u2019d left the keys in the car.</p><p>So now Dolly was taking matters into her own ... gears? Talk about initiative; she had ignition.</p><p>Right on, sister, Irma chortled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES, Dolly and I were gliding into an old familiar setting, and a much more naturally scenic one.</p><p>Why does returning to your Catholic girls\u2019 high school campus make hot sessions with your road-trip lover rerun obsessively through your head as if you needed to make an accurate count of every little mortal sin for Saturday confession?</p><p>Maybe because my familiar had morphed into a hidden but taunting rainfall necklace of tiny silver beads shimmying over my breasts. Instead of wafting the scent of the motel\u2019s no-name soap, I feared I reeked with the aroma of fresh guilt.</p><p>Why should I? The co-star of my mental blue movie collection was off bonding in the boonies with Leonard Tallgrass and Quicksilver. The trio was becoming such a steady partnership I was almost jealous. ...</p> <p>Actually, I relished being on my own, since Our Lady of the Lake had sole custody of a four-year chunk of my sketchy history. Today\u2019s expedition was just Dolly and me, with Irma on standby, the way I\u2019d left Wichita two months ago.</p><p>Dolly had never seen Our Lady of the Lake, but her whitewall tires spun up and down the gently rolling, landscaped hills. The glint of the man-made lake at the campus\u2019s heart sparkled like a blue diamond through the lush shrubbery and trees. I also glimpsed campus buildings constructed of what we students had called \u201cmellow yellow,\u201d the native limestone mined from the state\u2019s Flint Hills scenic area.</p><p>In a few hours, I\u2019d moved from the ugly scene at WTCH to meeting Caressa\u2019s weird sister to cruising the only natural scenery I\u2019d ever recalled reacting to with a ... sentimental glow.</p><p>Please. So not us, Irma commented. I\u2019m happy you are going to get the goods on the reason for our inner angst and that annoying supine phobia of yours\u2014not mine, I assure you\u2014but let\u2019s move on here.</p><p>I\u2019d thought I was.</p> <p>Were you with me here too, way back when, Irma? I wondered.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have many vivid memories of this place, just a blur of classrooms and talking nuns in Flying Nun head-dresses, and of myself bundled up to the frowning black eyebrows, wallowing across the snow-piled campus in deep winter, shivering. With tiny icicles forming on my eyelashes.</p><p>My graphic memories bestirred Irma again.</p><p>Brrr. Toss the Nanook of the North reminiscences. You and me were on and off here, depending on which clique you ticked off and your nondating life. I mean, all girls. Duh. I gave up on you totally at that dorky state college, and then you hit the big time at WTCH. But I will agree that this place looked cool, at least. Too cool for half the year! Snow, I\u2019m talking, and not our seriously sexy Vegas empire builder. I mean winter, and the falling white stuff that freezes your nose and toes. Not mine, of course, but I do suffer along with you, on the inside.</p><p>Snorting, I tuned out Irma after her mention of my confounding rock-star ... \u201cnemesis\u201d was not too strong a word.</p><p>Dolly slipped into a small lot carved out for gawkers as I stopped for a look-see. My conservative pump heels moved like clodhoppers over the sloping grassy hill to the lake.</p> <p>Birds were shrieking.</p><p>Well, not really. I realized then that you don\u2019t hear birds chirping on the Las Vegas Strip, unless a few are bopping around the greenery in the Paris\u2019s Le Cafe Ile St. Louis restaurant.</p><p>As I neared the teardrop-shaped lake, I spotted a single tree-thick island in its center, reached by a wooden footbridge. I felt a creeping sensation at my neck. The silver familiar was off sex patrol and changing into an innocuous chain with a long, freshly cold pendant. The familiar ran hot and cold, depending on my whereabouts, the air temperature, and my personal emotional tenor. Now it was less \u201cFever\u201d and more The Waltons.</p><p>Saints preserve me from so-square John-Boy, Irma wailed.</p><p>I lifted the pendant. Maybe the ambiance was more ... Camelot. The familiar had morphed into a miniature sword with an aurora borealis crystal on its pommel.</p><p>I told you, Irma said. Cool.</p><p>The smile in her voice brought one to my lips. This had been a calm retreat after the group homes. Here, I had apparently ditched real memories of any trauma or abuse for occasional nightmares too unbelievable to bother anybody else with.</p><p>I studied the sun-dappled lake and tested a wetted finger to the light wind, as evening prepared to don her best gown and thought about dimming the sky. Soon the sun\u2019s rays would be slanting through the trees, and then, hours later, maybe moonlight. I searched the gentle ripples for signs of an immortal woman\u2019s naked arm.</p> <p>Nope. Still no lady in the lake.</p><p>Smiling again, I climbed the hill to reclaim Dolly\u2019s driver\u2019s seat, and I didn\u2019t stop until we parked at the limestone administration building. Maybe even an orphan can go home again.</p><p>The Young Thing at the reception desk had matching \u201cEdward\u201d tattoos inside her wrists and wore her long uniform sleeves rolled up to her elbow like a workman\u2019s shirt, the better to flaunt her workout muscles.</p><p>Golly. They were allowing visible self-expression here now?</p><p>\u201cIs the mother superior still Sister Regina Caeli?\u201d I asked, pronouncing the Latin properly as \u201cChay-lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe goes by Sister Ermangarde Wallace now. Yeah. You got it the first time. Ermangarde. You can kinda see the vocation coming there, from the baptismal certificate. Who wouldn\u2019t want to exchange that bummer name for something like Queen of Heaven? Not many new nuns now. Maybe the first names got better. You\u2019re a grad, right? I recognize the navy. Never lost the uniform, huh? The campus is crawling with all these, like, older women, coming back. Like this was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful campus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry getting a date for the St. Lancelot\u2019s military ball on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Lancelot\u2019s boys\u2019 high school is still a going concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo punks have pimples? We mostly date the guys from State College, unless there\u2019s a big St. Lancelot\u2019s formal \u2018do,\u2019 where we can put on the bustiers and the black lipstick shtick. Of course the nuns forbid cleavage, but they don\u2019t go to the dances. You don\u2019t look like a drag hag. I mean, like you haven\u2019t been gone that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne piece of advice I\u2019ll give you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarnaby. Horrible first name, I know. My grandparents used to be counterculture. Still not worth going into the convent over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Carnaby. You are going to be uncool so soon. Enjoy the hip now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. That is a sweet pendant you\u2019re wearing. You should have called for an appointment, but what the heck. Gimme your name? Mother Superior Ermangarde is still here. She never leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah Street,\u201d I said, trying out the truth.</p><p>\u201cOoh. Delilah. Biblical bad girl. I\u2019d kill for that name. Major cool. You ever done any black lipstick? With your white skin that would wring the Goth boys out and throw them away for the duration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done some radical lip gloss in my day,\u201d I purred. \u201cWhat are you complaining about? Carnaby is a cute name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dammit. \u2018Cute\u2019 is so lame today. Hold on. I\u2019ll ring the olde dame.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, the way she said \u201colde dame\u201d had a Chaucer-like, uh, ring. I bet English Literature was still a required course here. Particularly the Arthurian Cycle.</p><p>Had it only been seven years? Felt like seven centuries. I hesitated before knocking at the head nun\u2019s age-darkened wooden door. It had an opaque pebbled-glass window like a noir private detective\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d an imperiously distracted voice commanded before my knuckles hit wood. Nuns had a ninth sense.</p><p>For a moment, I longed to be back in a stinky, darkening pasture with Ric and Quicksilver and Leonard Tall-grass.</p><p>I opened the door, overcome by a scent of lemon oil.</p><p>Through the big old-fashioned sash windows behind the desk, the sun was setting, going for the gold before it turned bloodred and sank pouting into the horizon.</p><p>Sister Regina Caeli wore the same habit as always, the bulky headdress producing a decades-outdated, Matterhorn-peaked silhouette against the dusk. Its profile reminded me of the mythical Minotaur, the horned and bullish beast from ancient Crete. From what I remembered of her seven years ago, by now Sister should be about as ancient as Crete.</p><p>\u201cDelilah Street,\u201d her firm but rasping voice greeted me. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Whee. Welcome someplace at last. I felt the silver familiar changing into a chain mail necklace that covered my chest and d\u00e9colletage. Especially any hidden cleavage.</p><p>Ric would so want the details of this. The conversation, that is, not the familiar making an armored nun\u2019s wimple on my chest. Too kinky for a Catholic boy.</p><p>\u201cWE ENJOYED WATCHING your reports on WTCH in the convent recreation room, Delilah,\u201d Sister said when I was seated before her. \u201cThey were most informative. And then you recently ... disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much fired,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh. Women still have an uphill fight in the media. So now you are\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA PI in Las Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe watch the CSI Las Vegas show religiously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see ... uh, me, as a corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, doing some work as an extra, are you, Delilah? Most interesting experience, I imagine. Sorry, no. We don\u2019t really watch the gruesome parts. You did wear a complete sheet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sister,\u201d I said virtuously.</p><p>I had been clothed during my recently filmed cameo, which certainly couldn\u2019t have aired yet. And all eyes here at the convent had turned away at Lilith\u2019s nude appearance. Why watch a forensics TV show, though, if you shut your eyes at the autopsies?</p><p>\u201cWhy have you been waiting for me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOur Lady of the Lake was the closest thing you had to a home here in Kansas. Many of our girls do return for class reunions, but you missed yours in oh-eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was only five years out,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll make the tenth.\u201d</p><p>Sister\u2019s cumbersomely attired head shook. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, is it, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>So, I was going to have to admit to the mother superior and academic dean, scenic campus aside, that my four high school years were mostly forgotten and might have been as unpleasant as my group home sojourn? Naw. Better to shrug it off.</p><p>\u201cEven the pundits can\u2019t decide if the true millennial year is the turn of two thousand,\u201d Sister Ermangarde went on, \u201cor two thousand and one. Graduates from both of those years seem to have made themselves scarce when it comes to school spirit, including donations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The reporter in me was getting interested. I\u2019d always assumed I was the only disaffected one around as a kid, blaming it on being orphaned.</p><p>\u201cIs the reason the Millennium Revelation or the upheaval of the nine/eleven attack, do you think?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey almost coincided.\u201d</p><p>She tented pale white hands, balancing her chin on their prayerful support.</p><p>\u201cWhat an excellent question, Delilah. You always asked good questions in class. We hadn\u2019t considered, frankly, that the ... ah, spiritual upheaval of the Revelation may have affected certain of our graduating students in those two years even more than the unprecedented political assault of mass murder.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Sister Regina. Ermangarde was just not a name I could stomach. Then it hit me. Ermangarde. Irma? Irma who is a guard? Just when did my internal voice show up?</p><p>Please, Irma herself interjected. I am eternal. I don\u2019t punch time cards.</p><p>I brushed her rude comment aside.</p><p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018spiritual,\u2019\u201d I told Sister Ermangarde, \u201cyou really mean ... \u2018supernatural.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her hands parted and slipped over the large wooden rosary lying atop the broad white wimple. At her gesture, I felt the familiar shape-shift into something smaller and longer again, like the sword. I wondered if she\u2019d spotted my morphing metal accessory in action.</p><p>Luckily, Sister\u2019s faded hazel eyes were fixed on mine. \u201cSpiritual? Supernatural? Aren\u2019t they the same? Unlike your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Rats! I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d been wearing my gray contact lenses in Wichita to avoid being identified.</p><p>\u201cYou always had the most dazzling morning-glory blue eyes, Delilah. I\u2019d hate to think time and travail had faded them, like mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such bad luck. I left town under a cloud.\u201d I guess that description honestly applied to a wildcat tornado. \u201cI\u2019m back here to find out who I really am and don\u2019t want any WTCH-viewer getting distracted by my former persona as a TV reporter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you haven\u2019t lost faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no ... but I don\u2019t follow you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to my chest, which started the heat wave of a blush as I recalled recent activities.</p><p>\u201cWhat a splendid Celtic cross you\u2019re wearing, Delilah. The garnets are a particularly deep and limpid red, like Our Savior\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>I looked down, of course, to see my familiar chain wearing a heavily ornate cross studded with cabochons of the same intense color as\u2014strike me, lightning!\u2014Midnight Cherry Shimmer.</p><p>\u201cNo need to blush, Delilah,\u201d the mother superior said. \u201cAlways such a modest girl, the ideal Our Lady of the Lake graduate. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re the sole member of your class to pay us a visit.\u201d Her gaze sharpened. \u201cNot that you particularly got along with the more affluent girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m here,\u201d I pounced, to distract her from my scarlet-woman-red chest, the damn cross, and the flush heating my cheeks. \u201cI was the only scholarship student, as they constantly reminded me. What scholarship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That is awkward. Almost as awkward as when Margaret Mary Rasmussen raised such a fuss about your driving lessons. No need to blush over that entirely innocent incident, on your part. I\u2019m sure you were taught in Ethics the motto of the Order of the Garter, \u2018Honi soit qui mal y pense.\u2019 Evil to him ... or her ... who evil thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy scholarship,\u201d I insisted, not allowing her to distract me.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a scholarship, dear. That would require the school itself awarding the money, and we had very little for that in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any money in those days. I had to work twenty hours a week as a dorm receptionist, but everything was paid for. Classes, uniform, room, and board. There was even a \u2018necessities\u2019 fund at the bursar\u2019s office, which had me putting in requisitions for pens and sanitary pads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Delilah. Too much information.\u201d Sister\u2019s pale face colored. \u201cYou were on a stringent budget, true, but that builds character. Obviously. Look at you now. A poised professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the school didn\u2019t have the academic scholarship money for me, who or what did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is awkward, as I said. We were charged to be discreet. Actually, to silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m long gone, Sister Regina.\u201d I deliberately invoked her name at the time. \u201cWhere did I spend summers? I don\u2019t even remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a camp. In the woods.\u201d</p><p>I recalled the long-sword glimmer of a body of water far larger than the campus pond. Trees. Shadows. Horses and hoot owls.</p><p>\u201cA camp?\u201d</p><p>Sister cleared her throat. \u201cCamp Avalon in the North Woods. Very cool and bracing during the hot and humid Kansas summers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at a f-forest camp and I don\u2019t even remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, how much do any of us remember of our pasts, Delilah? Most of the girls who come back laugh about the oversized gym suits, the required physical education classes, the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe May crowning of the Virgin with flowers,\u201d I filled in. \u201cThe winter Snow Fest, the SATs, the crummy mixers with the local boys\u2019 high schools.\u201d</p><p>I could have been describing the photos in the high school yearbook, had I ever had the cash to buy any of them. In any Midwestern private girls\u2019 school yearbook. I finally had a generic nonhistory, I realized.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cWho was the benefactor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a who, Delilah. A what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething supernatural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Sister chuckled indulgently, which I doubted any Our Lady of the Lake students had ever heard. \u201cNot a yeti from Tibet, I assure you.\u201d She laughed even more unconvincingly.</p><p>The reference had my hackles rising. Achilles, my dog who died in Wichita, was a Tibetan breed, named after the land\u2019s capital city, a Lhasa apso. Yetis, aka the Abominable Snowmen, were the mystical white hairy creatures rumored living in the mountains of Tibet.</p><p>While I rocked back on my pump heels at that link, she trebled on.</p><p>\u201cNot, Delilah, a ... a witch doctor from Timbuktu. Merely a nondescript corporation from Corona, California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorona, California? It sounds like a Beach Boys song title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the corporation have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe checks were signed La Vida Loca and always went through promptly.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what I needed. A paper trail to hack into. I stood, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sister. It\u2019s been wonderful to visit the campus and see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to wander where you will.\u201d</p><p>Except it was getting into early evening, and I had a date with two guys and a dog.</p><p>OUTSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION building, the twilight was doing a fade to black, as the film direction goes. I\u2019d glanced up to check for any washed-out version of the moon to gauge how far it had passed the half-moon stage ... when my sky-gazing self crashed into a hapless pedestrian.</p><p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d the man\u2019s voice said, for no good reason.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I\u2019d been the inattentive one.</p><p>He was a bit shorter than me, which wasn\u2019t hard for rumpled, middle-aged men if I\u2019m wearing a shoe with any kind of heel. I needed a moment for his short-sleeved black shirt and wrinkled forehead exaggerating a receding hair-line to register.</p><p>I\u2019d almost flattened the only person on campus that I remembered vividly and really wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cFather Black,\u201d I said, eyeing the white collar and checking the familiar to see if it retained the cross form. It was now a large shallow vee shape. Traitor!</p><p>Schizo, Irma hissed at it, back on board again. Sister must intimidate her much more than Father Black.</p><p>\u201cDelilah Street,\u201d he echoed back, looking more confused than ever. \u201cSomething\u2019s very different.\u201d He gazed blinking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNew contact lens sunglasses,\u201d I said glibly. \u201cYou know, the kind that change shades of gray depending on the light amount? Only now they make them in contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, you look splendid.\u201d He turned to the curb. \u201cIs this your ... car?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to deny it when you\u2019re cozying up to the front fender, keys in hand.</p><p>\u201cYes. Found her at a farm sale way out near Glen Rose. A steal. I mean, not literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He began strolling around Dolly, which was quite a walk. \u201cPerfect condition. Mileage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-nine thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievably low. Not that you\u2019d lie,\u201d he added.</p><p>An awkward silence prevailed as he finished his tour and returned to my side.</p><p>Father Black had been the only person at the high school who\u2019d realized I had no vehicle and no one to teach me to drive so I could get my license. He\u2019d taken me out in his old donated Volvo to the empty church lot and quiet roads around Our Lady of the Lake.</p><p>One of the girls\u2019 mothers complained to Mother Superior that such tutoring was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and that had been that. Except the mother was instructed to finish teaching me to drive her BMW and use it for the test, which I passed on the first try because I was so mad about the gossip I didn\u2019t want to spend another moment with that witchy woman.</p><p>\u201cYou like wheeling this much steel around?\u201d Father Black asked now.</p><p>\u201cBig and safe, and if anybody tries to mess with me on the road, they\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about parallel parking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe hard here, but I don\u2019t need to do that where I live now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did ... vanish from the airwaves at WTCH rather abruptly. They never said a word. Where are you living now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLas Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLas Vegas? Delilah, that\u2019s Sin City!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot news, Father Black,\u201d I said gently. Such a sincere, mild-mannered man. I\u2019d always felt more protective of him than of myself, even during the \u201cincident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Delilah. I mean ... really and truly. I\u2019m very concerned about your safety there.\u201d</p><p>Now was not a good time to mention my pals, the parking valet demons.</p><p>\u201cLas Vegas is not as bad as you think. Frankly, Father, some of the ... people on the air at WTCH were not exactly nice and weren\u2019t friendly to me.\u201d</p><p>His usual mild expression hardened. \u201cYou mean the \u2018New and Now\u2019 supernatural news team members, especially that incompetent weather witch. The chapel on our island has been hit by lightning six times this spring, no warning on the news, out of a clear blue sky, to coin a phrase for Kansas. Fortunately, we have a most effective lightning rod. Steps may have to be taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA weather witch wouldn\u2019t ... target Our Lady of the Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone with any sense. Watch yourself in town, Delilah,\u201d he told me, his expression softening as he patted my arm farewell.</p><p>\u201cI have friends now, Father, and some of them have big teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... can\u2019t mean that vampire anchorman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my adopted wolf-mix dog. He runs about your weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh. Excellent.\u201d Father Black winked at me, a very lame wink, and walked on into the administration building.</p><p>I hopped into Dolly, revved her up, and majestically drew away from the curb and a big part of my past. On the way back down the meandering drive, I peered at the little lake and the island when I reached the scenic overlook, squinting in the dying light through my \u201csunglasses\u201d contacts. Sure enough, the spire of a steeple poked through and there was a metal needle protruding from the spire, upon which perched, like a wind vane, a sculpture that looked very much like a ... gargoyle.</p><p>Gooo-aa-l! Irma chortled.</p><p>I didn\u2019t echo her cheer. I knew already I was surely going to Hell for lying about my gray contacts to kindly Father Black. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDON\u2019T COWS SLEEP at night like everything else?\u201d I asked, irritable about being startled by every distant moo.</p><p>\u201cCity-raised,\u201d Leonard Tallgrass commented to Ric as we crouched in a cornfield bordering the grazing land we were \u201cwatching.\u201d</p><p>What you can \u201cwatch\u201d crouching in corn plants in the dark of night is zero.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Ric said in defense of my city-girl history.</p> <p>\u201cYou? City-raised? Naw.\u201d Leonard Tallgrass had spoken. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an inside-the-Beltway D.C. manner and you\u2019ll never tell me what or why, but you were used to living out-of-doors young.\u201d</p><p>I knew Ric would leave Tallgrass\u2019s pronouncement unanswered, so I broke the lengthening silence.</p><p>\u201cSay, guys. I still don\u2019t get what we\u2019re doing in a cow pasture in the dark of night, or what you\u2019ve been \u2018looking into\u2019 on the rural scene. Or why you were so interested in the footage Slo-mo Eddie got of the cow mutilation scene here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d returned Dolly to the Thunderbird Inn from Our Lady of the Lake to find Ric, Tallgrass, and Quicksilver waiting, all ravenous. After a fast-food dinner, Tallgrass wanted to eyeball my TV station tape of this very scene, then get the two-footed members of our party appropriately garbed for a nighttime \u201coperation.\u201d</p><p>So here we were two hours later in the dead of night. At least the nighttime temps dipped to a tolerable seventy degrees and the Kansas humidity was low. I couldn\u2019t believe that my quashed TV story on cattle mutilations was of such interest now, although the enlarged clawed tracks I\u2019d noticed at the original scene had looked mighty bear-like on my laptop.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we know their route,\u201d Tallgrass told Ric, \u201cI figure the herd will be ambling our way in twenty minutes or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s driving them hard,\u201d Ric said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably get here in ten to twelve minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerd?\u201d I asked. \u201cNobody herds cows overland these days. Aren\u2019t we laying a trap for the rotten teenaged cow mutilators? Probably half-breed vamps who\u2019ve never gone mainstream and are living off livestock.\u201d</p><p>A weed was shifting in the night wind right under my nostrils, so I gave up the knee-creaking crouch and let myself fall back on my rear. Ric\u2019s fingerless workout gloves grabbed my wrists to pull me up again.</p><p>Ric and I had outfitted our designer jeans for unexpected night surveillance with work boots and long-sleeved black cotton shirts from Western Werehouse. My size eight boots weren\u2019t broken in. The stiff leather would chaff my ankles raw if I maintained this classic crouch position any longer.</p><p>\u201cShe okay?\u201d Tallgrass asked softly.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018She\u2019 is fine,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI may not be Annie Oakley, but I got you guys back to the same field I\u2019d filmed two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, scout,\u201d Ric answered. \u201cAny pasture where several cows have been mutilated and some officious Fed shows up to kick out the local media is prime scouting material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was weeks and weeks ago,\u201d I objected. \u201cA lot of weather has been over this field since.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass snorted. \u201cYou got that right. Especially lately. Wichita\u2019s been having excessive \u2018weather\u2019 for early summer. Doesn\u2019t matter. When blood is shed, the earth remembers.\u201d</p><p>I shivered a little, even though it was a perfectly temperate night. Crickets chorused their approval all around. We could occasionally hear the almost metallic rustle of birds of prey briefly silhouetted by the nearing three-quarter moon, looking like a mottled football, in the dark sky above.</p><p>The guys had their night-vision, bone-finding field binoculars glued to their sinuses. They radiated teamwork and concentration for the hunt. What exactly they were hunting other than cows, they\u2019d been seriously tight-lipped about telling me, but all our faces wore swaths of cammo paint.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t blame them. I was along to share the cramped discomfort they reveled in only because Quicksilver was doing the real scout-work somewhere out there. Also, I\u2019d been pursuing broken threads of my past all day on my own in Wichita and wasn\u2019t keen on spilling the unpromising details when the male contingent had been finding out serious shit.</p><p>Obviously, Ric\u2019s FBI assignments and later freelance consulting work had brought him far north of the Mexican border. And Leonard Tallgrass was about as \u201cretired\u201d as the Energizer Bunny. Comparing the taciturn Tallgrass to something pink relieved my boredom and all-over outdoor itches and made me smile.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t show your pearly whites on point unless you\u2019re going to use them,\u201d Tallgrass grumbled in my ear.</p><p>Damn. He didn\u2019t miss a thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat about those funky tracks in the field?\u201d I whispered into Ric\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Okay, so we weren\u2019t here to share, but pounce. On someone or something.</p><p>A moment later I heard rustling in the already trampled cornstalks behind me.</p><p>Turning my body around was going to make a no-no of a ruckus, so I twisted my head over my shoulder. I could see the tassels of corn plants shifting against the lighter panorama of the moonlit, cloudy sky.</p><p>Something was crawling toward our position.</p><p>I poked Ric in the ribs and nodded behind us. He lowered the binoculars and frowned, hearing the same, steady advancing crinkle of broken foliage. I was slightly behind the crouching men, so my rear would be the thing\u2019s first appetizer.</p><p>\u201cTy-ohni,\u201d Tallgrass whispered without turning. \u201cYour wolf-heart returns, silver-woman.\u201d</p><p>I watched the shadowy earth move as if a giant furrow was being churned up. Did Kansas have any burrowing predators, beside possible post\u2013Millennium Revelation ghouls?</p><p>The moon sailed free of a train of cloud to reveal Quicksilver belly-crawling to join us. Some joker had smeared his snout and paler colored lower face with sooty cammo paint.</p><p>He crawled alongside me, offering a quick lick of greeting along my unsmudged neck just below the black shirt\u2019s collar line. He knew not to remove my cammo face paint. Cleaning us all up at the Thunderbird Inn after this outing was going to be messy and awkward, like some cheesy B-movie threesome.</p><p>More than one cow lowed, much closer. I realized the critters sounded like giant mourning doves, plaintive and knowing they were meat for nature\u2019s whims and human hunger.</p><p>After seeing the royal Egyptian vampire empire \u201cfood stock\u201d of a human herd kept for generations, I was soon converting to some form of vegetarianism.</p><p>Quick\u2019s short, coyote-style yip made Tallgrass\u2019s head nod.</p><p>\u201cThree minutes, tops, and they\u2019ll be on us,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Oh, come on. Like Quicksilver can tell time.</p><p>I curled my fingers around the black leather collar he came with, the silver discs circling it feeling fatter and overheated, as if the sun had been out. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You can tell time,\u201d I whispered in his perked ear.</p><p>He flicked me off like a mosquito, suddenly lunging to his feet, digging claws into earthen clods and darting into the clearing made by the cow mutilation incident two months ago.</p><p>Tallgrass and Ric jumped up to follow him, carrying weapons I\u2019d noticed and couldn\u2019t name. They were big, thick, black, pug-ugly automatic weapons somewhere between a submachine gun, an assault rifle, and a flame-thrower.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to watch our team members attack.</p><p>A whole freaking herd of cows\u2014longhorn cattle\u2014were moving forward as one boulevard-wide mass, with horn tips that could extend to the height of a very tall Texan, to hear those braggarts tell it. I was ready to become a believer. I\u2019d never thought of cows\u2014steers and cows, I should say\u2014as majestic, but they sure were a vision to behold, surging toward us with thundering hooves and rumbling lows and Viking helmets like an army from the clouds above brought down to earth.</p><p>The earth, Tallgrass had said, that never forgets a drop of blood spilled on it.</p><p>And maybe that explained the vampire and werewolf resurrection in our times, bleeding Kansas, the Civil War nexus, my own moon-driven monthly agonies, the notion of cattle as human sacrifices, which would really rile the beef industry, my old TV news reporter persona realized.</p><p>I\u2019d been taught my Kansas history. In the twenty years after the War Between the States, only the ten million head of Texas Longhorn cattle driven north on legendary trails to railheads in Kansas and beyond kept the nation fed. It was called the largest movement of animals under man\u2019s direction in world history. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the Karnak vampires\u2019 puny human herd, but how many had they added up to over a couple thousand years?</p><p>Yet the cattle drive I was witnessing now was beyond the ordinary, eons-old business of eat and be eaten, graze and be slaughtered, be animal, vegetable, or human and be worried.</p><p>This was a herd whipped up from Hell.</p><p>These cattle drivers weren\u2019t those legendary cowboys partnered with another grazing herbivore, the conquistador-descended mustang ponies. They were shambling along on foot, dozens and dozens of them. Mexican peons and parade prima donna hidalgos mounted on palominos of pale aspect. A skeleton corps of horses and riders, pale horses, pale riders, pale cowherds on foot beside them. Ghosts and zombies and flesh-and-blood cattle, oh my.</p><p>I was watching a multicentury parade of the blood price between human and beast laboring by in a half-phantom form.</p><p>Quicksilver was in constant motion, flashing, fog-gray bone and blood and fang nipping at the herders\u2019 paranormal heels, driving them into a single once-and-future mass of past and present, real and supernaturally preserved life ... and death.</p><p>And, among this supernatural Wild West Show rode and walked the real game-masters, actual men. From Ric\u2019s intent expression, these were the criminal elements from south of the border he had been tracking before.</p><p>Meanwhile the silver moon was pouring light down on whole flocks of clouds that were massing and cascading down to earth in disembodied herds. I\u2019d never imagined the Kansas plains could host such an abundance of forgotten and now refreshed life and death. The vast scope of the prairies made the lavish neon sprawl of the Las Vegas Strip look tawdry and pinched.</p><p>Here, in the wide open spaces, the Millennium Revelation could expand and multiply, celebrating all the dead and undead life of our endlessly evolving planet. Nothing was lost. Nothing failed to survive, but everything had been reborn in some extravagant, frightening, haunting form.</p><p>I watched this gruesome, gritty, inspiring, ghostly panorama, bedazzled by the times I was living in. Anything could happen, could be real, could require dealing with.</p><p>Especially Lilith and Lili, me and Irma, all my new frenemies in Vegas and especially Ric and Quicksilver and Leonard Tallgrass beside me joined in a quest to free the future from the past.</p><p>That\u2019s when something knocked me off my feet, pointy-toed cowboy boots and my nose both digging into the earthy ground.</p><p>So much for moon-gazing at ghost longhorns in the sky.</p><p>While I spit out dirt, someone pulled me up by the elbow and jerked me several feet sideways. It was either a very annoyed friend or a very impatient foe.</p><p>\u201cDel,\u201d Ric shouted over the major mooing, \u201cthis is the drive-in all over again, only these zombies are on fast-forward. Okay? We need to do some major mowing-down if we don\u2019t want to be mowed down.\u201d</p><p>I looked around. He was right. Most of the mounted men were literal ghost riders in the sky, literally \u201cspooking\u201d the cattle to move on. The zombies in ragged clothes and ragged flesh were darting at the edges of the herd, biting and clawing like a pack of attacking wolves, occasionally clotting when they pulled a calf down, tearing it apart while it bawled and the protective long-horned mother charged, kicking and head-pronging the hell out of the zombies, but eventually falling helpless into their never-dying, gobbling midst.</p><p>Obviously, I needed to keep a lot of bad things from getting close enough to off me. The demure silver familiar, which had so far accepted a role as the metal strap adjustment clips on my industrial-strength sports bra, went as molten as Quicksilver\u2019s collar disc on me. It seared up my shoulders and then down my arms into its major set-to weapon of choice, twin braided solid silver whips.</p><p>When the silver familiar had ripped like mercury down my arms, filling my hands with the butt knobs of twelve-foot-long whips, Ric stepped close behind me, putting his hands over mine as he had when he\u2019d helped me \u201cdowse\u201d the day we\u2019d first met in Sunset Park and we\u2019d together dredged up the unbeloved dead.</p><p>I felt my breath whoosh out of my body as an electric charge knocked me back even tighter against Ric, as if we\u2019d been melded into one body. His hands vibrated with strain on mine. An electric rainbow aura played aurora borealis all around us. I remembered an image of us in the mirror when we\u2019d first made love, when I\u2019d gladly let him kiss my virginity good-bye.</p><p>I\u2019d glimpsed our auras then, and only then. Mine ice-blue, like my eyes on fade. His hot and yellow, like his ... desire. They had blended into green and purple.</p><p>Now the aura was all ice-blue, spreading from Ric\u2019s hands through mine onto the silver whips, remaking them into argent electric eels of power, snapping and sizzling as they curled around charging zombies and wrenched off undead heads and limbs.</p><p>And what they touched still moved, but shriveled and exploded into Fourth of July sparklers.</p><p>And then the night sent its own long, seeking leather tongue of fire our way. I recognized El Demonio\u2019s thirty-foot bullwhip. I saw it aim like a striking snake at the precise part of Ric my love had healed. His back.</p><p>It was now a battle of the lizards, whip tongue to whip tongue. I ripped my hands free of Ric\u2019s, made a sweeping gesture as my fisted fingers sent my hate and fury down the silver whips in a conjuror\u2019s gesture of control.</p><p>Luckily, I\u2019d turned my face aside as the black-leather lightning strike from the past headed our way. It struck whatever force field our silver auras had cast around Ric and me, and coiled away into the air and futility like the zombie bodies.</p><p>Ric wrapped me in his arms, wrapped my arms around myself. Our conjoined powers made us into whirling dervishes, the center of an electric twister. I couldn\u2019t breathe. Think.</p><p>Outside our magic circle there danced such a demon as I have never dreamed of.</p><p>A dancing bear? It was heavy and cumbersome, all right.</p><p>So, why did foot-long spines march down its backbone and ... tail?</p><p>I\u2019d seen the marks of a trailing \u201ctail\u201d when I\u2019d first recorded cow mutilations for WTCH-TV. Which the station had quashed, pretty much.</p><p>There was no \u201cquashing\u201d this beating, switching, spiny tail.</p><p>\u201cRic? You ever see such a critter?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEl Demonio and his minions didn\u2019t call me \u2018goat-boy\u2019 for nothing. I slept with goats. This blood-sucker needed dead prey, so I escaped it. But it was out there. Always. On the edges of things. Waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never heard about such a thing in Kansas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Hispanic demon who\u2019s crossed the border after the Millennium Revelation. You could say it\u2019s native to Puerto Rico, where it was first reported, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are island nations,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know south-of-the-border geography, chica,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the one who went to kindergarten in herds of goats and donkeys. I\u2019ve glimpsed el chupacabra before. It warns of its attack with a screech that turns its eyes the color of glowing coals. I was beating off his interest in goats and kids before I was five years old. It is a far, far better beast than El Demonio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby Ric, the dragon slayer,\u201d I murmured, brushing his cheek with my palm. The thrill of admiration I felt for Ric\u2019s youthful bravery was almost sexual. I could have used a champion like him when I was five.</p><p>He quickly kissed my life and heart lines before charging up out of the cornstalks to the fight, joining his battle cry to the screech of the chupacabra.</p><p>I charged up right after him, and nearly got run over by a zombie going for Tallgrass.</p><p>Run over by a zombie? These weren\u2019t your local drive-in sleepwalking zombies.</p><p>The speeding zombie turned as my twin silver whips slashed the thigh bones out from under it and threw them over my shoulder to Quicksilver, who chomped them to bits even as they jitterbugged away.</p><p>Ric and Tallgrass planted their boots, using automatic weapons fire to blast the loping zombies to pieces of dice-size dancing bones. The whole scene was like the Cold Creek zombie jamboree on fast forward.</p><p>My arms were aching from tripping zombies that never stopped charging or moving. So many skulls were skittering through the cornstalks, chattering like joke false teeth, that the entire field was scythed down as if by Death himself.</p><p>Meanwhile, the driven herd of real-life cow flesh moved on, flanks already gnawed raw by its carnivorous herders. The sight so reminded me of the Karnak vampire empire human herds under Las Vegas that my whip slashes beat with even more fury into animated undead flesh and bone.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen myself as merciless, but I was that night, fighting to keep Ric and Tallgrass and Quicksilver whole and in action.</p><p>It became a snapping, shattering, grim reaper\u2019s Wild West Show, with the driven livestock finally passing us by, tailed by a custom convertible limousine holding a standing figure lashing the bizarre parade forward with that thirty-foot snake\u2019s tongue of braided leather. Behind the rampaging limo galloped a conquistador wearing a skull-shaped helmet and riding a weary skeletal horse.</p><p>History, pass on by.</p><p>I watched the mortal and immortal herd disappear on land and in the sky, both the physical and psychic seeming mirror mirages.</p><p>We four remained weary and standing. Alone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got what we need,\u201d Tallgrass said, panting hard. \u201cThe stragglers.\u201d</p><p>Like a prize Australian sheepdog, Quicksilver had found two fallen longhorn cows from the ground-bound Milky Way herd. The still hummocks of their bodies resembled primitive burial mounds. Tallgrass knelt by one, and something in his posture made me flinch. My whips recoiled into silver wrist cuffs, cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cYou and the dog up to dealing with reality for a while here, pard?\u201d Tallgrass asked Ric.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look my way.</p><p>What a pity. Male investigators didn\u2019t get to see and join the circle of life and swirl of the planets. We stood alone among the sacrificed stock. Real, motionless cowhide on the trampled earth. I would maybe never eat ground beef again.</p><p>\u201cUgly work,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cAlways was. I recommend the city girl leave. Ric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d he said. \u201cDelilah?\u201d</p><p>Sure. Call me a wimp and a bleeding heart. I turned and left.</p><p>Quicksilver followed, whimpering softly. He knew how near death always lurked for four-foots.</p><p>Ric joined me ten minutes later. \u201cTallgrass has field-dressed deer, which I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said by way of explanation, or apology. \u201cWe needed to understand ... dissect ... the cow mutilations you filmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Sadistic mischief, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA crime, right. Not mischief. The border drug-smuggling cartels have been using the herd cattle as drug \u2018mules.\u2019 Cows have four stomachs, don\u2019t they? All the more room for smuggled narcotics. Those you saw here a couple months ago must have dropped dead on the trek and were left behind after being gutted and stripped of the bagged drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCows? Can you abuse a more helpless animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ric said. \u201cHumans. Like us.\u201d</p><p>So, his message was ... weep not for the four-foots. The two-foots are even more pitiable prey these post\u2013Millennium Revelation days.</p><p>I walked away, sick of my own species.</p><p>Except nowadays, species was a relative term. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FORGET DRIVE-IN ZOMBIES and cow-mutilating drug lords. That was last night. Ric and I had slept in until noon. We should have been ravenous, but could only nibble on road snacks.</p><p>Today was the first day of the rest of my life, and the really scary part of my trip back to Wichita was starting now, this afternoon, with Ric and me sitting in Dolly\u2019s front seat wearing what could pass for our \u201cSunday best\u201d anywhere, preparing to enter a bland brick three-story building to find out all about ... me.</p><p>The place looks like a morgue, Irma warned me. You do not want to go there, Street, in any meaning of the phrase. We do not want to go there, even with a bodyguard as professionally accomplished as Ric.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d I said to quiet her nervous chattering.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ric asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a thing.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head, unable to explain my paralysis. I was so full of dread I\u2019d let him drive, even here in Wichita, through streets I knew like the lines on my palm. Leonard Tallgrass had provided the computer-map route past the three group homes he discovered I\u2019d lived in until I was sprung from the system to attend Our Lady of the Lake convent school.</p><p>They were all sprawling one-story ranch-styles set in modest neighborhoods. I remember there had been uproars about having group homes in single-family communities, but I was used to being something of an outcast and that hadn\u2019t really affected me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even recognize the exterior of the one home I\u2019d supposedly lived in for four years. What might go on today in these five-to-six-bedroom homes gave me the willies.</p><p>Ric\u2019s hand stretched across the wide front seat to take mine.</p> <p>\u201cYour fingers are like icicles, amor. It\u2019ll be all right. You can stop hugging the car door. Dolly will be here when we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure Quicksilver is all right with Tallgrass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hit it off like old camping buddies, you saw that. A dog wearing sunglasses waiting in a parked fifty-six Caddy convertible wouldn\u2019t be cool in Kansas, you know that. In Vegas, anything goes, but here we\u2019re undercover. Think of us as census takers. We\u2019re official. We want dates and places and details and we are a couple of mean bureaucratic badasses no one will want to mess with.\u201d</p><p>He wore a dark gray suit I\u2019d never seen, drab and slightly shiny. I had inserted my gray contact lenses again and had clipped my hair in back so it seemed vaguely bun-like but covered my neck. I wore my TV-reporter outfit, a navy suit and matching pumps that did nothing for me but make me blend in with any background, from political press conference to neighborhood murder scene.</p><p>I\u2019d copped an idea from lady police detectives. All my working suit jackets had deep, if discreet pockets. Carrying a bothersome purse makes a woman easier to dismiss as girly on the job. A narrow reporter\u2019s notebook and pencil, ID and money clip were all I needed on me. With my black eyebrows and lashes, I\u2019d only needed a pot of lip gloss and a dab of concealer for the camera. Nowadays, of course, I also armed myself with Lip Venom and Mid-night Cherry Shimmer. That was New Delilah, though. I was here in Kansas to meet Old Delilah\u2019s worst nightmare.</p><p>I still kept my eyes glued to a fire hydrant coated in shiny aluminum paint on the street in front of the Wichita Child Protective Services building. That seemed like a good omen.</p> <p>\u201cWill I recognize this Haliburton woman Tallgrass dug up?\u201d I asked, needing to clear my throat first.</p><p>Ric shook my captured hand. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Lighten up, Delilah. I know a nonentity from a bad past can be even more terrifying than a monster in the present. I\u2019ve been there, right? You saw me through. Now I\u2019m seeing you through.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, opened Dolly\u2019s heavy door, and got out, checking the building\u2019s side windows. Was anyone watching the parking lot below? My gaze panned rows of uncurtained windows with flower vases, photo frames, and office knickknacks lined up on the indoor sills.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Haliburton,\u201d Ric said, \u201cwas in charge of group homes during the years you were in the system. Tallgrass had to do a lot of white-collar-crime type of digging to come up with someone who should know everything we want to find out. Relax. This is the simplest party we\u2019ve ever crashed. Remember the Karnak.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help smiling. Only Ric would call our life-threatening expedition to an underground empire of ancient vampires \u201ccrashing a party.\u201d</p><p>The trouble was, I\u2019d mostly done all my derring-do to save someone else\u2019s skin. It\u2019s harder to be as brave on your own behalf, especially when confronting childhood monsters.</p><p>Toughen up, Irma advised. The man is gonna find answers; it\u2019s his calling. His inner kid has faced nightmares that make ours look like Saturday morning cartoons.</p><p>Except I\u2019d never been a morning cartoons person. I\u2019d hid out in the group homes to watch midnight monster movies. Any cruising vamp boys found the rec room with its Ping Pong table, jigsaw puzzles, and small-screen TV too nerdy to venture near.</p> <p>I was beginning to understand why my memories of living in Wichita had gaping holes. We walked through the social services building into a bland lobby, elevator, and halls so forgettable I couldn\u2019t describe them moments after passing through. Maybe that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t remember much about my childhood; it was so forgettable. Not terrifying.</p><p>\u201cWe have an appointment,\u201d Ric told the ash-blond receptionist in rimless glasses.</p><p>See what I mean? Irma prodded. Boring and bland and forgettable. No wonder we split this burg for Sin City.</p><p>We were shown into one of the offices without a vase or any trinkets in the window.</p><p>Mrs. Haliburton was sixtyish, with permed iron-gray hair and the required rimless glasses, and she, too, wore navy blue, which suited her pinkish complexion. Navy blue made my white skin look bluish, like skim milk.</p><p>She rose to greet Ric. \u201cMr. Montoya.\u201d She gave me a demanding stare.</p><p>Already I hated her.</p><p>Ric was all professional interrogator. \u201cGood to meet you, Mrs. Haliburton. This is my assistant, Miss Place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re formerly with the FBI?\u201d she asked Ric as we sat on molded blond-wood chairs while she reclaimed the squeaky black desk chair.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Phoenix office.\u201d</p><p>News to me. I guess if I could learn more about Ric, the trip to Wichita would be worth it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Mrs. Haliburton said with a superior little laugh, \u201cwhat you\u2019re doing here, making inquiries. We\u2019re up-to-date in Kansas, you know. We have our own FBI offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Kansas case file I\u2019m investigating,\u201d he said, \u201cinvolving a Wichita group home resident of a dozen or so years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo longer in our system?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do understand, Mr. Montoya, that our group home clients are disabled in some way, have learning or behavioral difficulties? We must protect their privacy.\u201d</p><p>Even Irma cringed inside me.</p><p>\u201cI have a signed and notarized paper from the individual in question,\u201d Ric said, producing a folded document from his inside jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cIs this related to a civil suit\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Mrs. Haliburton.\u201d Ric\u2019s smile was dazzling. \u201cMerely a routine question of information\u2014where, when, that kind of thing. So far,\u201d he added, without the smile.</p><p>Mrs. Haliburton\u2019s poodle-cut head reared back as she frowned at the paper. I didn\u2019t sense that she recognized my name.</p><p>She handed back the document, folded. \u201cWell, Mr. Montoya, Miss Place. You\u2019re in luck. Everything was computerized during this girl\u2019s residence. I can look her up in an instant.\u201d</p><p>Gulp, Irma moaned.</p><p>Ric slid me a glance, his eyes a perfectly trustworthy brown with the colored contact lens in place.</p><p>Place. I smothered a nervous giggle.</p><p>To find me a fake surname, we\u2019d worked our laughing way from Avenue to Boulevard to Circle to Drive. I\u2019d firmly rejected Lane as being too reminiscent of Lois, before deciding that only Place, in honor of the Sundance Kid\u2019s notorious girlfriend, Etta Place, also made a convincing last name. She\u2019d been a mysterious lady lost to history. I might be en route to becoming another one.</p><p>Mrs. Haliburton\u2019s scanty eyebrows lifted above the thick lenses of her glasses. Her keyboard clicked and her unblinking eyes scanned a series of computer pages invisible to us as we sat staring at the back of her monitor.</p><p>Then her frantic fingers stopped and her face went white.</p><p>Really. I\u2019d never seen anyone actually do that, and she had started out a pearly pink.</p><p>\u201cThis file is sealed,\u201d she announced, anger underlying her words. \u201cYou must have suspected that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ric said, glancing at me. \u201cNot at all. Only juvie court documents can be sealed. This isn\u2019t one of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, to my relief.</p><p>\u201cThen the file can\u2019t be sealed,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cIt is. That\u2019s all I know. I can\u2019t enter it, even if I would be willing to violate the seal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d I said, leaning forward in my slippery-seated chair. \u201cShe left the system at age fourteen, when she entered high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck with the high school, then,\u201d Mrs. Haliburton snapped at me. \u201cI can refer you to the public school superintendent during that era. He would have to approve admitting someone with a record so ... extreme it would be the only one ever sealed.\u201d</p><p>She was one of those old-time female bureaucrats who still knuckled under to men, but gave women a bad time. I suddenly knew I\u2019d probably run into her ilk many times before, among the social workers and group home supervisors.</p><p>\u201cThanks a bunch, Mrs. Haliburton,\u201d I said, \u201cbut Delilah Street didn\u2019t leave the system for a public high school. She had a scholarship to Our Lady of the Lake convent school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat place! I don\u2019t like your tone, Miss. I\u2019m giving up my time to look into this matter as a courtesy to Mr. Montoya and his former affiliation. I know nothing of what yours is.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I so wanted to snap that I\u2019d been a reporter on WTCH-TV. How could she not even recognize my face? I hadn\u2019t exactly been anonymous.</p><p>Ric put a hand on my forearm as he stood up, bringing me upright with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the superintendent\u2019s information, Mrs. Haliburton,\u201d he said, his voice as smooth as milk chocolate. \u201cWe appreciate your efforts.\u201d</p><p>He held out his open hand until she huffed a sigh and scribbled something from the screen down on a memo pad. By the time she looked up and handed it over, she was simpering.</p><p>\u201cQuite all right. Glad to oblige you, Mr. Montoya.\u201d Her glance flicked my way and hardened. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that Our Lady of the Lake is even stingier than the state with their records ... to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Ric took my arm firmly in hand until we were in the hall. \u201cAmazing,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s no love lost between you and female authority figures, whether you remember it or not. That\u2019s a valuable piece of information.\u201d</p><p>I tried to shrug off his \u201cgentlemanly\u201d custody. I was ready to explode with indignation.</p><p>\u201cState building, Del,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSecurity cameras everywhere, outside, in the elevator. Maybe even voice recording. Stifle yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d In a minute, he\u2019d be telling me I looked beautiful when I was angry, just to add fuel to my fire.</p><p>I bit my lower lip, a gesture I knew he found inciting, and shut up all the way to the parking lot. There, I stopped at the driver\u2019s side and held my palm up until he tossed the keys into it.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, mon capitaine?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe motel, to regroup.\u201d He got into the passenger seat and laid his left arm along Dolly\u2019s channeled red-leather seat back.</p><p>\u201cThe Thunderbird Inn?\u201d I wondered. \u201cSounds like a waste of precious time when here I got all dressed up to snow the ice queen.\u201d</p><p>I turned the key in Dolly\u2019s ignition, put her in gear, and sped her out of the parking lot fast to spin the dust of bureaucracy from her tires.</p><p>Ric\u2019s fingers stroked the nape of my neck and curled under the tendrils of my pseudo-bun until shivers slithered over my spine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said, \u201cthis Delilah Street is such a hot potato she\u2019s got the only sealed file in the history of Wichita\u2019s Department of Child Protective Services, but I intend to take Miss Place to the Thunderbird Inn and take her apart until I discover that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scared?\u201d I flashed him a sizzling glance.</p><p>\u201cOnly in a good way.\u201d</p><p>The silver familiar uncoiled from its role as a sedate neck circlet and icily eeled into my concealed cleavage. As my spine shivers settled in my stomach, it wove in and out through my navy jacket\u2019s front buttonholes, leaving the top two gaping open.</p><p>\u201cWay to dress up a dull navy suit,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>I depressed Dolly\u2019s gas pedal hard enough to slam him back in the seat.</p><p>\u201cJerk,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cIf you think a little sex will make me feel better about being a bureaucratic forbidden zone ... you may have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking ... a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you sent Quick on a sleepover with Tall-grass last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured we needed downtime alone. Together.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s so far past lunchtime it\u2019s dinnertime. We\u2019d better stop for fast food. Remember, chicken or fish.\u201d</p><p>Ric consulted his cell phone screen. \u201cRight at the second light.\u201d</p><p>I followed directions and slowed Dolly on a wide turn into a drive-through lane before I saw and read the big sign on the tall pole. Ric was not only back, body and hopefully soul, so was his sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cJack in the Box, dude?\u201d</p><p>When he shrugged, I noticed that even his lowbrow suit had great shoulder tailoring. \u201cAnd you are so going to get fries with that.\u201d</p><p>I did, in fact, feel a lot better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A SCRATCHING SOUND, like a cat claw raking across a hard surface, awakened me from dreams of being bound to an ancient Egyptian mummy preparation table.</p><p>Not only a dream. A memory.</p><p>I\u2019d been sleeping on my side, as usual, so in one motion I rolled out of bed and was standing on my feet in the shadowy room, my bare toes curling into nylon shag, something unlikely to carpet any ancient chamber. The silver familiar filled my right palm with a cold metal weapon of some kind.</p><p>\u201cDel,\u201d Ric\u2019s sleep-slowed voice drawled from behind me. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d He was half-sitting on the ... yes, bed\u2014not a stone table edged with a slim gutter for draining blood\u2014behind me.</p> <p>\u201cI heard something,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Ric said as he turned on the bedside lamp. \u201cWhat\u2019re you carrying?\u201d</p><p>I turned my hand over in the weak light. \u201cA humongous biker switchblade. The haft is etched with a screaming dude face wearing buffalo horns etched like a bad tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlace-appropriate, I\u2019d say,\u201d Ric said, yawning and checking his watch. It was so multifunction I couldn\u2019t even find the time display. \u201cTen a.m. I didn\u2019t hear any\u2014\u201d</p><p>The scraping sound came again, longer and louder. From the motel\u2019s metal door. I went to the curtained picture window and peeked out the side.</p> <p>\u201cQuicksilver wants in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s new. Tallgrass must have dropped him off as a wake-up call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve both had enough of our long, luxurious coed bedroom time,\u201d I guessed, going to undo the chain lock that was shimmying like a stripper from Quick\u2019s latest \u201cknock.\u201d Luckily, even his big nails couldn\u2019t etch steel.</p><p>I looked around before I opened the door wide enough to admit him. Most of the parked cars that were here when we came back for the evening were gone. The motel was in the dead zone between guest shifts.</p><p>Ric had already retreated to the bathroom, so Quick gave my weaponless hand a lick in greeting and headed for the stainless food and water bowls next to my side of the bed. I hid them under the chintzy chintz dust ruffle when we were out during the day. No problem. The maids never cleaned in the closet or under the bed, and, frankly, I didn\u2019t blame them one bit. I hurried to the bedside to slide my feet into my cowboy-boot mules.</p><p>Meanwhile, I\u2019d lost the awesome knife, replaced by a bicycle chain\u2013style bracelet.</p> <p>I put kibble in Quick\u2019s bowl and turned on my bedside lamp to use my first chance to inspect him for damage, although he\u2019d probably licked it all away at Tallgrass\u2019s place. The big black leather collar he\u2019d come with at the Sunset Park adoption event had a few more fang scratches between the silver circles that never dented, although they changed shape with the moon cycles and were now nicely three-quarter shaped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Moondoggie,\u201d I told him, causing his perpetually perked wolfish ears to flatten a bit. Quicksilver wasn\u2019t one for mush. \u201cI wonder what this collar is about?\u201d</p><p>I gave his hackles a rough fluff with both hands and ran them deep into the thick silvery gray hair of his back and chest. It\u2019s unusual that a big dog, a dog with both wolf and wolfhound genes, would tolerate being petted or even touched while eating. Quick continued gulping.</p><p>He\u2019d seemed fine after the Zombie Cattle Company jamboree. Of course, he was the first of our partnership to exhibit a healing tongue, and I was not about to try mine out again on anyone but Ric. I leaned down to murmur, \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d in one big-bad-wolf-large ear. He was too busy wolfing his food to react to my little nothings.</p><p>Just then, Ric came out of the bathroom, and I turned to look. A new man, freshly showered, bare-chested and barefoot, contact lens inserted, and jaw shaved so close he must have lost half of his follicles.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d I suggested. \u201cI\u2019d get your baby-pink bottoms off that unsanitary motel carpet and into some shoes, then I\u2019d tell me why the super-close shave. I know you had to have one yesterday for your new girlfriend, Mrs. Haliburton, but today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019ve got to make the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport in less than an hour to pick up a big gun I had flown in.\u201d He frowned at my wrist. \u201cLost the switchblade. Too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I feel naked without major edged weapons too.\u201d</p> <p>Naked we were not. Quicksilver had a prudish streak for an unfixed dog, but that wasn\u2019t why both Ric and I, without consulting each other, had brought along jogging outfits for pajamas. We needed to be action-ready in case something big and bad besides Quicksilver wanted into our motel rooms along the way. Stray supernaturals of exotic ilk were still turning up all across America.</p><p>Like us.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about those fast-forward zombies and company,\u201d I told Ric.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not until we settle Mrs. Haliburton\u2019s haughty hash. We\u2019re not leaving the Child Protective Services building today without more answers than are in your skimpy file.\u201d</p><p>He was at the tiny closet, donning his one French-cuffed silk shirt. White, that made his Latino skin gleam like a bronze god\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI could steam out the wrinkles over a tub of hot water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time, although I\u2019d enjoy watching you be domestic. Wrinkles will ease out with my body heat and won\u2019t show under the suit jacket. Trust me, I\u2019ve traveled before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tempt me with bare cheeks and references to body heat and are ready to bolt out the door. You are sure all business this morning, Montoya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t whine,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours later. You have anything to do here while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>I gestured at the wireless router I\u2019d bought and installed yesterday beside the small flat-screen TV. \u201cGoing to catch up on the local news.\u201d</p><p>Ric thoughtfully pulled on his suit pants under his shirttails, whether in deference to Quicksilver or me, I wasn\u2019t sure. He grabbed his conservative diagonal-stripe tie and bureaucrat-navy jacket.</p><p>\u201cYou okay with me taking Dolly solo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you ask? Guess I gotta be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear your on-camera suit. We\u2019ll have to grab a late lunch after the next assault on Mrs. Haliburton and her minions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to tell me whom you\u2019re picking up at the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom? Guess,\u201d he challenged on the way out the door after snatching Dolly\u2019s keys from the dresser top. \u201cI\u2019ll honk when I\u2019m back.\u201d He flipped the Do Not Disturb sign to the outside knob as he left.</p><p>Hmm. He was looking way too polished for Mrs. Haliburton.</p><p>Quicksilver finished his loud lapping and came to where I sat on the foot of the unmade bed, remote in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see where Mommy used to work?\u201d</p><p>He made that doggy gacking sound, too conveniently for it not to be a comment on my phony tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for anything suspicious about my former newscast co-workers,\u201d I told him. \u201cFeel free to add any of your opinions. Gacking is okay.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I was glad to be alone for this chore. It took my mind off what Ric was bound and determined to do, for my own good: uncover the source of my phobia against lying on my back.</p><p>Men can be so singled-minded. It had never occurred to him what I might most be afraid of now, even more than finding myself in my must-not-do sleeping position, a possible memory of rape. Childhood rape. I\u2019d reported on such atrocities, and there was no way the word \u201csurvivor\u201d could ever undo the reality of having been a \u201cvictim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIN OR OUT?\u201d I asked Quicksilver when I heard Dolly\u2019s mellow Miss Piggy scream for attention, otherwise known as a horn, ninety minutes later.</p><p>He was at the door before me, so out we went, after I\u2019d turned over the Do Not Disturb card. Actually, I was pretty disturbed when it came to the butterflies in my stomach region doing a maraca rumba.</p><p>Sure enough. Ric was watching for me with his arm thrown over Dolly\u2019s front seat and an expensively high-lighted blond head of hair sitting in the passenger seat. He was either using Dolly to chauffeur a glam rock \u2019n\u2019 roll dude or ... another woman.</p><p>Dog, I thought. Whoops. I\u2019d never known I was the jealous type.</p><p>Quicksilver didn\u2019t pause in shock. He lofted over Dolly\u2019s polished black side into the backseat and arfed loud and sharp right into the nape of the blonde\u2019s neck.</p><p>That turned her around pronto.</p><p>Oh. Ric\u2019s mother. Foster mother. The star psychoanalyst and Washington, D.C., professor. Georgetown University and all that jazz.</p><p>I raced to the passenger seat. \u201cDr. Burnside! I must apologize for my dog.\u201d</p><p>She turned around again to regard his now-grinning face. \u201cMy, what big teeth he has. But he also has his mother\u2019s eyes,\u201d she added wryly. Then she got a good look at my undercover gray contacts. \u201cYou certainly can hide your lying eyes, Delilah. Ric\u2019s explained the situation to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have. I mean, he shouldn\u2019t have dragged you into this, Dr. Burnside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was \u2018Helena.\u2019 Has something changed?\u201d Her eyes were a paler shade of blue than mine, but they narrowed with understanding into the transparency of water. \u201cAh. Goldilocks is sitting in your chair, Mama Bear.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the heavy door open and stepped onto the parking lot asphalt. \u201cYou sit up front. I\u2019ll take the rear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... the dog.\u201d</p><p>Ric spoke for the first time. \u201cI suppose he doesn\u2019t want to wait and scare the maid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Helena said. \u201cI go for younger men. What is he, three or four? That would be the twenties in human years. Move over, bud. Ladies last. And last.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver gave a small whimper of confusion and edged over ... to the middle.</p><p>\u201cLike that, is it?\u201d Helena said. She reached into the side door pocket. \u201cThese yours, fellah?\u201d She held up the extra-large sunglasses.</p><p>Quicksilver bowed his head so she could slip them on his long snout.</p><p>\u201cRic,\u201d I said warningly in a low tone as I sat in the passenger seat. Now I knew why dogs growled softly.</p><p>\u201cWait and watch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou clean up nice too.\u201d</p><p>So I shrugged. I\u2019d let my hair grow from its TV-reporter neat bob since moving to Vegas, and the ends were waving a bit so I got some blue-black highlights to match my eyes. Which were now hidden, of course. Still, my clipped-back bun had some oomph and the silver familiar had made itself into a three-inch-long piece of vintage Eisenberg Ice rhinestones on my tame navy lapel.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we having that late lunch?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cClosest decent place,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m starved, but on to Mrs. Haliburton first. I want to be hungry when I back her into a corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe so does not deserve us,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THREE MOLDED-WOOD CHAIRS were now lined up before Mrs. Haliburton\u2019s desk, Ric and I flanking Helena Troy Burnside, whose suit was a smashing power red, probably Prada.</p><p>Quicksilver was guarding Dolly in the parking lot, but he\u2019d made his druthers clear.

This is most unprecedented, but I\u2019ll download the files to any device you wish, Dr. Burnside.\u201d</p><p>Helena extended a business card across the desk that Mrs. Haliburton whisked into her custody. \u201cBoth addresses?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cI always like a backup, don\u2019t you?\u201d Helena replied.</p><p>Mrs. Haliburton ignored her while clicking in the e-addresses. She hit enter with the high-handed flare of a concert pianist, totally unlike her tightly wired self.</p><p>\u201cI think you will find that this young woman, Delilah Street,\u201d she spat out, still addressing her computer screen rather than our party, \u201cwill be very sorry indeed to have the contents of these files in anyone else\u2019s hands, even hands with so many highly placed connections. I know your specialty, Dr. Burnside, is severely damaged, and damaging, children, but you will have those therapeutic skills sorely tried in this case, as our social workers here in Wichita did thirteen years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Gulp, Irma whispered. And she doesn\u2019t even know about me.</p><p>\u201cGulp\u201d was right. I was sitting with the two people in the world whose respect I most wanted.</p><p>Ric laid his arm across the back of my chair, standing and drawing me up beside him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your cooperation, Mrs. Haliburton, but warnings are unnecessary. I\u2019ve found in my FBI work that files are sealed more often to protect the holders, not the subjects.\u201d</p><p>Helena was checking her mini-netbook. She looked up and nodded. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>Ric escorted me to the door, opened it for his foster mother, and ushered us into the hall.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s shaking, Helena,\u201d Ric told his onetime therapist in a furious undertone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that harpy frighten you, Delilah,\u201d Helena consoled me. \u201cLittle people like to make big threats.\u201d She took my other arm. \u201cNow, Ric tells me you\u2019ve invented another fascinating cocktail, the Brimstone Kiss. I know where you got the idea for that one.\u201d Helena smiled and added, \u201cLet\u2019s find a well-stocked bar that can make it, where we can munch on a sinfully caloric bar menu.\u201d</p><p>She could make happy talk; it wasn\u2019t her secret file that was heating up her personal computer.</p><p>Ric knew how to calm my nerves. He let me drive again, with Helena in the passenger seat while he and Quicksilver occupied the rear.</p><p>Ric searched his phone screen. \u201cHere\u2019s the place for us. The Petroleum Pavilion on Polo Drive. Delilah\u2019s cocktails always use exotic and expensive ingredients,\u201d he explained to Helena, about to pass me the GPS.</p><p>\u201cDolly and I don\u2019t need that high-tech aid,\u201d I said. \u201cAny description of the physical neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Ric said, \u201cthe usual waterfront, probably a lake, near an exclusive gated community, riding stables, the ubiquitous golf course designed by the world\u2019s finest over-paid landscaper\u2014hey!\u201d</p><p>His recital broke off as Quicksilver whapped the cruising sunglasses off his snout and leaped out of the convertible, running ahead of Dolly on the street.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to squint at some tiny screen in the sun like a vampire in extremis,\u201d I told my passengers. \u201cQuick loves to find lost golf balls in Sunset Park. I\u2019ll just tail him as he follows his world-class nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHOT DAMN!\u2013BRAND CINNAMON schnapps,\u201d Helena mused over our glasses in the mahogany-paneled, crystal-lit bar.</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d she persisted, \u201cdid you come up with such off-beat ingredients for your Brimstone Kiss, my new favorite drink, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>Blush modestly ... not. Helena was a psychotherapist whose already acute insights could pick up random visualizations from people\u2019s minds and subconscious after the Millennium Revelation. I did not want Ric\u2019s onetime \u201cmother\u201d glimpsing my forced interlude with Snow. She even knew who and what he was. Well, the albino rock star\u2013hotelier part, anyway. Nobody really knew what brand of \u201csuper\u201d Snow was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m self-blocked, Delilah,\u201d Helena assured me, already betraying that I was an easy read at the moment. \u201cBelieve me, I can feel the heat between you and Ric without any amplification, and I couldn\u2019t be happier for the both of you.\u201d</p><p>What luck that she couldn\u2019t tell my mental reruns right then had been about Snow.</p><p>I consigned thoughts of that bastard to the Inferno Hotel\u2019s subterranean Nine Circles of Hell attractions and explained.</p><p>\u201cThe Brimstone Kiss concept begged for a liquor brand with a \u2018hot\u2019 taste and name. I think Vegas pretty much twenty-four/seven these days, and it is truly Sin City now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw that on my brief visit,\u201d Helena said. \u201cSo ... this is an ultra-Goth cocktail with a sweet undercurrent of innocence lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could write ad copy in today\u2019s Las Vegas,\u201d I agreed with a forced smile.</p><p>In the middle of our granite-topped table sprawled a platter of tomatoes and mozzarella, crab-stuffed mushrooms, and angel-winged shrimp, a post-Revelation delicacy discovered in the deep sea. Food definitely took the edge off my nerves.</p><p>Ric and I slipped into feeling triumphant and mellow, while Helena was scanning her screen between bites and sips.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI\u2019ve got the gist of the files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould Delilah be shaking in her pump heels?\u201d Ric wondered. \u201cThey\u2019re really not her style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d Helena said, \u201cunless she has multiple tattoos.\u201d She turned the screen toward us.</p><p>\u201cMe? Tattoos?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cRic?\u201d she consulted him.</p><p>He liked playing with the idea, and my skittish state. His eyes warmed as they met my startled expression.</p><p>\u201cTattoos? Oh, not a one, Dr. Burnside. I swear.\u201d His hand slipped under my social services\u2019 bun to caress the \u201clove bruise\u201d on my nape. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of anybody or anything else, especially a needle, coming between my baby and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say, \u2018Get a room,\u2019\u201d Helena commented, \u201cexcept you kids already have one at that dreadful motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolly and Quick are the reason,\u201d Ric explained. \u201cWe needed dent-free parking, which eliminated ramps, and a place that doesn\u2019t ban hybrid wolves. Don\u2019t worry. I booked you into the downtown showplace.\u201d</p><p>She nodded approvingly. \u201cWe need to go somewhere private to discuss these files. Your place or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d Ric and I answered as one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so relieved,\u201d Helena said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in a motel since before the Revelation. I shudder to think what vibes I might pick up in that tacky room of yours.\u201d</p><p>So did we.</p><p>SUNSET WAS THINKING about taking a bow by the time we ambled out of the fancy bar. Fountains gushed like Old Faithful through the trees, probably installed in \u201cwater features,\u201d as they were in Las Vegas. The rich loved gushers on their property.</p><p>I was feeling calm, although edgy and curious about the tattoo remark. I\u2019d been an overly careful girl, dodging preteen trouble from the \u201cbad boy\u201d half-vamps on my trail, studying and moving on, hoping not to get noticed, hiding in the midnight dens or dorm rooms where the TVs blared all night, blocking out danger and questions.</p><p>We ambled toward the parking lot, Ric and me an openly entwined couple, Helena still cruising her backlit screen with a frown I didn\u2019t like the look of, but was too happy to worry about.</p><p>The sound of a sustained, deep, threatening growl interrupted our separate reveries. We stopped and looked ahead to the isolated, distant spot where Ric had parked to avoid door nicks.</p><p>A group of six men surrounded Dolly.</p><p>Ric\u2019s hand left my waist to push his suit coat aside and reach for the firearm at the small of his back. Yep, my guy \u201ccarried concealed,\u201d thank, uh, thank my recent friend of a friend, Anubis, Egyptian god of the underworld. (My religious high school education made me take God too seriously to invoke Him for any minor life crises.)</p><p>Wait. These guys dressed like Vegas werewolf mobster Cesar Cicereau\u2019s tame \u201csmall job\u201d muscle. They were probably dead men, and they wore plaid, all right. Green and yellow and blue plaid baggy trousers now in danger of a thorough ripping, along with said contents.</p><p>Quicksilver was standing in Dolly\u2019s backseat, his thick fur raised in a fearsome Mohawk from between his flattened ears to his seriously bushed-out tail. His snout was curled back, black-lipped to display the formidable mountain range of his wolfish fangs.</p><p>I rushed to put myself between Quick and his gentleman callers. That allowed me a glance into the backseat. Which was pretty much filled with small, dimpled white balls bearing three gilt initials on each one.</p><p>\u201cThose are our balls,\u201d a tremolo tenor announced behind me. \u201cIs that your ... dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour balls?\u201d Helena intoned curiously, moving past the late-middle-aged men with a well-preserved wiggle. She turned to confront them. \u201cI am so sorry. What shall you do without them?\u201d</p><p>They gaped, open-jawed like Quicksilver, but not nearly so formidable.</p><p>I started shoveling golf balls out of Dolly\u2019s pristine red upholstery. \u201cTeeth okay, not claws,\u201d I instructed Quick. \u201cThis is not Sunset Park. Down. Back. Leave kitty!\u201d</p><p>Men in checkered caps topped with white fuzzy balls scrambled at my last silly command to reclaim airborne presents from Christmas Past.</p><p>Ric leaned against Dolly\u2019s side, eyes buried in his hand, trying not to laugh, but utterly failing.</p><p>THIS TIME I let Ric and Helena use their high-tech toys and Ric drive.</p><p>A not-too-chastened Quicksilver ran alongside Dolly, giving chase to bad drivers in Ford 350s who cut off good drivers at every opportunity. I wondered where the motorcycle cop genes had come from. Maybe he was an escaped K-9 dog, who knows?</p><p>We reached the Old Town in no time. I sat in the back-seat and consulted Ric\u2019s phone. A nineteenth-century warehouse had been gutted to house the boutique hotel, with soaring atrium and piano bar, but it was no Marriott, nor did it have Billy Joel live.</p><p>Like all hotels now, especially in Vegas, it boasted wireless access everything and all-suite rooms. The surrounding city center featured restaurants, shops, and Indian artifact museums.</p><p>The ambiance was charming, but Quicksilver was confined to the parking garage and Dolly. Downtown Wichita, no matter how restored, was not post\u2013Millennium Revelation Las Vegas.</p><p>Good lord, I was homesick for Vegas.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Helena said, giving her foster son positive reinforcement for his choice. \u201cWe can order room service while we study the files.\u201d</p><p>My stomach started calisthenics again.</p><p>\u201cThe files\u201d were my files. Were I tattooed. Which I wasn\u2019t. What was that about?</p><p>Maybe you got all the tattoos, Irma cooed. And I got all the men.</p><p>In Helena\u2019s room, we all doffed our hot, sticky business suit jackets and sat at a slate-topped table near a sink/small refrigerator unit.</p><p>Helena\u2019s phone buttons linked her net-comp to the room TV screen.</p><p>\u201cSome of this is very puzzling,\u201d she warned us. \u201cMost of it, in fact. Ric, take Delilah\u2019s hand in yours. Delilah, let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this,\u201d Ric asked, now uneasy too, \u201ca shotgun wedding?\u201d</p><p>Helena\u2019s face looked a little old for the first time, shadowed by the suite\u2019s trendy spot-lighting.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s good, but I can say this is not the Delilah we know. And love.\u201d</p><p>She punched a tiny button on her keyboard, and scanned copies of printed pages hit the big screen.</p><p>Most were tiny-typed reports. A few photos flashed by: me looking like a deer in a police lineup spotlight, front and profile. I gasped audibly.</p><p>Helena clicked into close-up. \u201cNo panic. See the tattoo on her neck? Almost lost under the hair at her nape? A coiled snake, I think. It looks like you, but the expression is defiant and knowing. Not you, Delilah. Or the photos have been manipulated. Easy to do. Look. Here\u2019s a from-the-hip-up photo. You can see the twin cobra tattoos on her biceps. Definitely not you, even I can see that.\u201d</p><p>I eyed the loose-limbed, gaunt version of me in a raw preteen ranginess I didn\u2019t remember, wearing a Rolling Stones wife-beater tee-shirt, a chain hip-belt, and stone-washed jeans.</p><p>Young Lilith. It had to be.</p><p>I shook my head, feeling Ric\u2019s hands compulsively running over my arms and hands, circling my hips, covering\u2014sheltering, claiming\u2014the parts of my screen-revealed body.</p><p>\u201cHonest, Mom-doc,\u201d he said, sounding like a defensive teenager for the first time in my hearing. \u201cNo marks on her that I haven\u2019t put there. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI,\u201d Helena said, raising her palms.</p><p>She shut her eyes, revealing azure eye shadow gathering like a glittering monochromatic rainbow in a few faint age creases.</p><p>\u201cI said this was a puzzle,\u201d she reminded us. \u201cThese images are not Delilah. Not only do my eyes and your joint testimony tell me that, but my ... amplified insight. This might explain why Delilah had a difficult childhood. She had, at times, a supernatural shadow persona. This girl. This very disturbed girl. No girl is bad, but this one had very little good shown toward her and returned it in kind to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn evil twin?\u201d Ric put my thoughts into words.</p><p>I\u2019d never told him about Lilith, another dirty little secret kept to ensure his peace of mind and my keen sense of privacy.</p><p>\u201cThe TV soap operas are dead, Helena,\u201d he said, dismissing his foster mother\u2019s theory. \u201cThey lost their audience years ago. Evil twins have been a hokey plot device since forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me hokey. Few would dare, young man.\u201d</p><p>How fascinating to watch the two revert to a non-blood-kin parent/son mode. I liked Ric going hot-blood and testosterone-y in my defense, something he\u2019d never do if we were facing real danger. I\u2019d never had an inner teenager\u2014 except for Irma, come to think of it, who acted like an eternal teenager\u2014but I felt like a prom queen now.</p><p>Wichita was peeling off all my hard-won defensive layers. I couldn\u2019t indulge that luxury for too long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about a post\u2013Millennium Revelation effect,\u201d Helena said. \u201cThe dates when \u2018Delilah\u2019 was picked up for juvenile delinquency are after January first, two thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never \u2018picked up\u2019 for anything,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou admit you don\u2019t remember a lot about your childhood, until after high school, really,\u201d Helena pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d Ric argued. \u201cYou remember the high and low points. I know I do, and I\u2019m a star graduate of your methods, Helena.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThe records show her\u2014you, Delilah\u2014 with a history of running away from the group homes and hanging out at pool parlors, garages, tattoo and piercing shops with \u2018a bad crowd.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cI hid out in plain sight, in the group homes. I had a metal nail file for a weapon, yes, but it was against those creepy half-vamp punks who gave me a hard time. I wasn\u2019t even menstruating then, but they still came after me.\u201d</p><p>Helena\u2019s lips folded tight. Then she said, \u201cI believe you, Delilah. I believe you had your own history in your mind, and ... this person in the police photographs was never a conscious part of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an unconscious part,\u201d Ric insisted. \u201cShe was a virtual virgin. Only it was real. She had a lot to overcome before we ... became a \u2018we.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she bleed the first time, Ric?\u201d Helena sounded all cold-blooded physician.</p><p>He glanced at me, embarrassment a no-show in this emotionally charged conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhy should she, Helena? Did you?\u201d he fought back for me. \u201cModern girls are way more active than some kind of ... Victorian fading flower. The hymen can break in school sports, horseback riding\u2014\u201d He turned to me. \u201cDoes Our Lady of the Lake have riding stables?\u201d</p><p>I nodded numbly. Some of the girls were even rich enough to keep horses stabled there; some of us just snuck in and patted them, or were occasionally invited to ride. I didn\u2019t feel these details merited breaking into this semi-mother-son debate.</p><p>\u201cRic.\u201d Helena\u2019s gaze turned steely. \u201cYou know and I know and Delilah knows she\u2019s got a deeply ingrained phobia against lying on her back, in bed or out of it. I can literally see the black cloud of suppressed fear hovering at the rear of her brain, and that\u2019s a formidable barrier to sexuality. You\u2019ve done an admirable job of easing her around that barrier, but you can\u2019t change the underlying pathology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no \u2018job,\u2019\u201d Ric exploded. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love, and I can live with that black hovering ghost without knowing its name forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Delilah, Ric? The files show an off-the-books medical \u2018procedure\u2019 when she was twelve. With an obgyn. Mrs. Haliburton can lie, but the files can\u2019t. It\u2019s against the law to destroy them, although they can be censored and blacked-out and buried in bottomless circles of bureaucratic hell. Somebody came along later and knew they\u2019d be liable for something. The trouble is, whatever went so very wrong is also buried in Delilah\u2019s psyche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what those files blacked out,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll find every last blotted-out name\u2014doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, \u2018bad crowd,\u2019 whatever, including supernatural stalkers. I\u2019ll track them down and I\u2019ll take that wolf-hound with me to gnaw the balls off them until they squeal their guts out.\u201d</p><p>I believed every word, remembering how Ric had gone after Haskell, the rogue cop who\u2019d roughed me up. And maybe my big dog had too.</p><p>\u201cYou have to face it,\u201d Helena said. \u201cRevenge won\u2019t erase whatever it is Delilah confronted at a way-too-early age, likely rape.\u201d</p><p>Rape. The only four-letter word that rocked my world off its axis. I\u2019d sensed the ugly word circling and hovering in my blacked-out history and now it was in the open, slavering for my will and soul.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ric and Helena.\u201d I finally spoke for myself. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of decoding those defaced files. I\u2019m an ex-reporter, remember? I know Wichita history, names, and places.\u201d Then I looked only at Ric. \u201cI\u2019m pretty damn good at fighting impossible odds. And Quicksilver will get his teeth into any dirty work required more enthusiastically for me than for anyone else on the planet.\u201d</p><p>He stopped cold, unable to keep up the fa\u00e7ade that I hadn\u2019t been seriously damaged, here and then. In Wichita, years ago.</p><p>\u201cNow, let me see those files,\u201d I told Helena. \u201cI appreciate your help, Madam Freud, but they are mine, you know. I\u2019d like a printout to take back to the motel room. Can you manage that without letting the hotel staff get a duplicate file, or snoop? I don\u2019t trust anyone about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWE NEVER HAD a decent real meal today,\u201d Ric commented from Dolly\u2019s passenger seat as I drove us back to the Thunderbird motel, a sheaf of rare hard copies in a folder on the red leather seat between us.</p><p>\u201cTakeout time,\u201d I said. \u201cLet Quicksilver choose.\u201d</p><p>We passed a Wendy\u2019s, a McDonald\u2019s, and a Captain Kirk\u2019s before a sharp bark came from the backseat. Red Riding Hood\u2019s, wouldn\u2019t you know? We got the family basket. Brisket and cottage fries.</p><p>Leaving Quick on night duty with the bulk of the basket, we brought the remainder inside to pick at.</p><p>I fanned through the folders.</p><p>\u201cI love you, and I don\u2019t want you hurt, now or in the past,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I pointed out, with feeling. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was leery about coming back to Wichita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so sure you were haunted by just a natural, general fear because of the Revelation hitting when you were only a preteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s all it is. I do know if an abscessed tooth is a constant pain, you need to pull it out before it poisons you.\u201d</p><p>WHEN RIC FINALLY fell asleep, I got up and went to the cheesy medicine cabinet over the sink mirror I\u2019d avoided seeing myself in.</p><p>I really didn\u2019t want to mirror-walk in Wichita. That disconcerting new option was a Vegas wrinkle. Helena was right that the Millennium Revelation revved up paranormal powers in ordinary people.</p><p>I suspected now that I\u2019d never been ordinary, the thing I\u2019d longed for most as a kid. I wasn\u2019t worried about facing Loretta Cicereau, the vengeful ghost I\u2019d bound. She was in mirror-suspension back in Sin City. I was beginning to see that even supernatural power depended on places as well as people.</p><p>Wichita had its own circuit box. Power could travel from node to node, but you could tap into only what mojo you had built up in various locations. Here, I was more plugged in than I wanted to be.</p><p>I took out my gray contact lenses, although they could be worn for weeks without changing. Then I leaned the heels of my hands on the cold sink surround and pushed my trademark blue eyes close to the cheap-grade mirror.</p><p>\u201cSo you had to stick me with a sealed juvie record, Lilith? You sure weren\u2019t borrowing my clothes in those days. They were all Goodwill and buttoned up to here and down to there to keep the creepy boys away. How did I get funneled into a socially and psychologically deviant population? I was just an orphan. And you did everything you could to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes in the mirror blazed with anger and angst. Me, or Lilith, or Memorex?</p><p>\u201cIt ever occur to you, Dee,\u201d my mirror lips curled in answer, \u201cI was taking the pressure off you?\u201d</p><p>Her glossy black head of hair shimmered like Midnight Cherry as she shook it. We really had great hair. Why I had never seen that? Because Lilith was hot, and I was not.</p><p>Now she was saying she took the ... heat ... off, so I could remain safe behind my defensive devices, my solitary ways, my old movies, my wounded shyness?</p><p>\u201cSo hopelessly na\u00efve,\u201d she went on. \u201cThe times they were a-changing, but you just wanted to soldier on in your stupidly smart, safe, low-profile way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour escapades gave me a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody wanted to pin a case file on you and forget you. I met their expectations and then they left you alone.\u201d</p><p>I could feel my fingernails trying to dig into fake stone.</p><p>\u201cLilith, did you get me raped?\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes in the mirror shut.</p><p>Funny, I could see that.</p><p>Was this denial or ...</p><p>\u201cLilith, did you get raped in my place?\u201d</p><p>She tossed that superstar hair of ours, and flashed our ultrabright baby blues.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>She shrugged and sneered and went on. \u201cBut the system got you, after all, in its own way. It always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Don\u2019t ever say that. I\u2019m not. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m in here and ... you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more than a mirror existence,\u201d I told her even as I realized it. \u201cYou have powers. You didn\u2019t really kill yourself to get autopsied on CSI V Las Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI, Delilah Street. I can see why you wanted to disown me, though.\u201d She turned her half-profile to me. I could see the tiny blue topaz in her right nostril. \u201cThe only personal distinguishing mark you ever voluntarily went for. And you lost it fast. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>Had I lost more than a subtle piercing, because of her?</p><p>I sighed. \u201cLilith, I don\u2019t like where this road trip to Hell is leading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a theme park joyride, Dee, but you have way more allies than I ever did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to claim the tattooed lady with the smokin\u2019 past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I can always use chutzpah in Mirrorland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But where you need it is here and now, baby. Kiss the past and my baby blues good-bye. And screw Ric for me while you can.\u201d</p><p>My fist headed for her face on that last taunt, but my knuckles stopped on cold mirror and at the brink of my own confused, angry image.</p><p>Lilith was right. The only way of going forward to the future was back to the past.</p><p>It was a paradox, and my vehicle was not a DeLorean car, but one of Detroit\u2019s nostalgia best, Dolly. Frankly, the vintage past I so loved in general had been pretty much a real-time bust in my case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTWELVE YEARS TO young people your age,\u201d Helena Troy Burnside told Ric and me with a rueful smile, \u201cmay seem like an eternity. Luckily, it\u2019s just a little over a decade for us old folks.\u201d</p><p>She flashed the printout of a Wichita map from the Web. We\u2019d come to her hotel suite that morning to pick her up for the drive to where I\u2019d been sent twelve years ago for a mysterious gynecological procedure at age twelve.</p><p>\u201cWe have the same cast of characters,\u201d she added. \u201cNot encouraging to you, Delilah, as a patient, but as a reporter you know what that means.\u201d</p><p>I nodded grimly. \u201cThey know what happened to me there, and why.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t add that I\u2019d been freshly armed with several dire hints from my mirror twin. Why hadn\u2019t I ever told Ric about Lilith, the last secret I\u2019d kept from him beside my internal invisible friend, Irma. I knew why.</p><p>Who wants to be dating The Three Faces of Eve, even if he\u2019s too young to have ever seen that old movie on multiple personalities?</p><p>Of course, I was firmly my own person; I just had these slightly weird add-ons. Some people called that \u201cbaggage.\u201d Before and after the Millennium Revelation, some folks called that \u201chaunts.\u201d</p><p>Ric rubbed the nape of my neck, massaging away tension, secretly caressing a shared intimate mark, and tapping my inner \u201cchica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be with you,\u201d he promised.</p> <p>Yeah. That\u2019s what made it so scary.</p><p>Leonard Tallgrass had requisitioned Quicksilver again. While Ric and I were delving the personal side of my Wichita links and past, the local ex-FBI agent was drawing a bead on the area\u2019s powerful paranormal and criminal elements.</p><p>Frankly, I couldn\u2019t wait to get my angsty stuff over with, and get back in the field with the crime fighters.</p><p>Ric drove us to another bland three-story building. I was beginning to long for the soaring hubris of Vegas with its gouts of spot-lit fire and water and neon spitting up at the cloudless sky.</p><p>The office waiting room boasted the usual upholstered chairs and magazine racks, with a huge fish tank framing a lethargic trio of clown fish.</p><p>Helena accompanied me to the reception window, leaving Ric to flip through an actual print edition of Modern Mother and Infant featuring Madonna and her latest adopted Third World child on the cover. Menopausal adoptions were the new \u201cFollywood\u201d superstar rage.</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The receptionist frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t find a \u2018Delilah Street\u2019 in the records. You\u2019ve been here before?\u201d she asked, her gaze darting between Helena and me.</p><p>I looked too old to need escort to the gynecologist\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cIt was more than a decade ago,\u201d Helena said so briskly the receptionist almost saluted. \u201cDr. Youmans was the physician.\u201d She nodded to the door behind us, which read YOUMANS, HORTON, AND FLIEDERBACH.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are Miss Street?\u201d she asked, her flicking glance settling on me.</p><p>She knew her patient name game. Helena didn\u2019t look young enough to carry an offbeat name like Delilah.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cFirst visit, virtually,\u201d the receptionist said. \u201cThe doctor will want to do a thorough exam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will we,\u201d Helena said sweetly.</p> <p>We went to sit with Ric, where his foster mother proceeded to tell him how the cow ate the cabbage. This cow was in a much better place than the zombie-driven herds moving through the dark of Kansas nights.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you in,\u201d Helena told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not related.\u201d</p><p>Ric was cool with it. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until I hear the doctor going into the consultation room, then get a \u2018family emergency\u2019 call on my cell and barge right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRic,\u201d Helena said. \u201cThis is women\u2019s business. Did it occur to you that Delilah would prefer to keep it private from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hate to intrude behind those pink doors, but we don\u2019t have much private from each other, and she knows I can take it.\u201d</p><p>And he knew I\u2019d seen his soul stripped bare. Turnabout, fair play.</p><p>Helena shook her smooth blond head. \u201cWhat a different generation. Philip would sooner be waterboarded than set foot in a gynecologist\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Ric grinned. \u201cYou might be surprised, if it involved your well-being.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and smiled to herself.</p><p>Then my name was called, for everybody in the waiting room to hear.</p><p>\u201cDelilah Street.\u201d</p><p>Helena accompanied me through the door. I saw Ric station himself at the brochure rack near the receptionist\u2019s pass-through to keep an eye on the action in the hall and consulting rooms.</p><p>\u201cDoes this ever change?\u201d Helena asked after we were shown into a room.</p><p>We\u2019d sat on two light side chairs. I eyed the rolling stool near the sink counter, and the recliner lounge with the metal stirrups at the foot and a paper cloth down the center. It sat against one wall like a bizarre sacrificial altar.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in such a place before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean this specific place, in your memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a gynecological appointment?\u201d She sounded shocked. \u201cNot at college, or after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ... phobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... you\u2019re in your mid-twenties. Birth control.\u201d She was looking flustered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the Pill for severe menstrual cramps. Have been since college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to have had a pelvic exam done then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There are underground places where you can get all sorts of pills.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019d managed to avoid such routine school inspections for years. Amazing what a determined minor can do. I was newly impressed by Teen Me. I was also getting tired of apologizing for my back-lying phobia and my monthly pain and my apparently abnormal history.</p><p>\u201cThe only pelvic exams I\u2019ve ever had were from your foster son.\u201d</p><p>Her face produced a raging flush I thought only my ultra-pale skin could show.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Delilah. I deserved that. You were indeed a \u2018virtual virgin,\u2019 as Ric said. How clumsy of me to ask those questions. I needed to know what to expect when the doctor comes in and wants to do that procedure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go well,\u201d I said, \u201cbut why would we need to go that far? I just want to ask some questions. You\u2019re certain this is the doctor who saw me when I was twelve, with the result that I buried the experience deep in my subconscious?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Even the nurses are the same. The doctor is in his early sixties now and president of the local medical society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t know he was doing pelvic exams and who-knows-what-else on helpless twelve-year-olds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think not. Let me ask the questions, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a reporter. I\u2019m good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know his type too. He\u2019s of the doctor-as-God generation. He\u2019d respond better to someone of my maturity. Don\u2019t you trust me to be your advocate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be my own advocate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But ... this will work better. We\u2019ll surprise Dr. Youmans into frankness better if you remain quiet and in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I did that before, and it didn\u2019t turn out so well.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and shook it. \u201cWe have no authority here. Surprise and subtlety are the keys. I know you don\u2019t want to be s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSold down the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201c... to be superseded again. Let me try first. Please?\u201d</p><p>I folded my icy hands together and choked back a sudden tide of rage. My heart was pounding and my breath came fast and shallow. Between my fingers, the silver familiar assumed the form of curved surgical scissors.</p><p>My blood-fury surprised me. I fought for control, as I must have twelve years ago, not knowing what this place was and what they did here. I still didn\u2019t, quite.</p><p>A nurse came in and cast a glance at Helena.</p><p>\u201cThis is just an annual exam, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked me. \u201cI\u2019ll take your blood pressure, and leave the robe and sheet on the examination table. It opens to the front. Strip completely, of course. A nurse will accompany Dr. Youmans, Mrs. Street, but you\u2019re welcome to stay. My, BP one-forty over ninety, a bit high, Miss Street. I know seeing a new doctor can be nerve-wracking. Dr. Youmans is very gentle.\u201d</p><p>She left as I hurled Helena a betrayed look.</p><p>\u201cI do know how to handle this, Delilah. Trust me. It would be more effective if you donned that paper robe, at least. You don\u2019t have to strip. Just give them the impression this is an ordinary visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d I asked as I struggled to put the paper robe over my clothes. It was like wrestling a crepe-paper cutout in a cartoon. Laughable.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t. Consider this a trial, Delilah,\u201d Helena told me. \u201cI have the evidence in my possession. This doctor doesn\u2019t know it, but he\u2019s on trial here. Don\u2019t give any testimony until I ask you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me beforehand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I know what happened here, but I need to frighten him into admitting it. Your striking looks will be the first weapon. I suspect he\u2019ll remember you quickly enough when I get him going. I\u2019m a psychologist, Delilah. I know how to unravel this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about me unraveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave woman and you must have been a very brave girl. This won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s the only way to get the truth into the open for the peace of mind you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Ric know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Listen, I can\u2019t mislead you. My suspicions are ugly, but, in case I\u2019m wrong ... I can\u2019t tell you them prematurely. I wouldn\u2019t do this in most cases. Hell, Delilah, only in yours. It\u2019s my professional opinion that the truth, no matter how brutal, will free you. If the facts are what I think, it would destroy most young women. But one must go to extremes for the people one loves. I think you understand that.\u201d</p><p>I stared into her eyes through a glaze of tears. Hers, not mine. Then she took a deep breath and the unemotional scientist glared through, icily controlled again.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve scared the spit out of me, Helena Troy Burnside. But I\u2019m tired of worrying about what I might be afraid to know. You want me to sit on the end of that torture table and swing my feet while we wait for Dr. Frankenstein?\u201d</p><p>She smiled tightly. \u201cYes. Exactly. Look as innocently at ease as you can manage, and let me do all the talking.\u201d</p><p>Boosting myself up onto that table with the sinister stirrups took all the gumption I could muster under the circumstances. Everything about this place was conjuring a hellish conjunction of my darkest fears, distant and recent.</p><p>I recalled the elaborate but primitive Egyptian mummification chamber with the central stone table for the dead body I\u2019d awakened on only days earlier. I reran the TV mock documentaries I\u2019d seen through the years about alien-abducted victims lying paralyzed with fear on examining tables.</p><p>Looking up, the big rectangular milk-glass light in the ceiling and the goosenecked high-power lamp affixed above the stirrups seemed both ancient and alien.</p><p>Would white linen\u2013sheathed, sloe-eyed Egyptian waiting women soon file in to witness my blood-draining and sacrifice? Or would dumpy nurses wearing old-fashioned white scrubs surround the table to imprison me?</p><p>What was really going on here? Did I have an appointment with some long-uncaught pedophile doctor Helena would now expose in his turn, somehow relieving me of anxiety and guilt? Had I been some modern maiden sacrifice, turned over by the social workers, maybe because of the bad rap Lilith had overlaid on me? Was there no end to the betrayals?</p><p>I eyed Helena, so calm and competent. Did she really know what she was doing to me, what she was risking? I thought of Ric in the waiting room, where the men were always kept while unspeakable things happened to the women behind closed doors.</p><p>Where was Quicksilver? His instincts were supreme. He was my \u00fcber-guardian, like poor little Achilles. Those were the only \u201cpeople\u201d whose instincts I could always trust. I was ready to jump up and run out, but a flutter of sound and murmurs outside the room\u2019s door made me freeze with fresh panic. I could hear paper files being shuffled.</p><p>Then a white-haired doctor bustled in wearing his white coat, looking just like a bushy-browed kindly old Dr. Gillespie CinSim from Young Doctor Kildare, 1938, except he wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair.</p><p>Man not alive! I\u2019d been abused by my favorite CinSim doctor as played by the great Lionel Barrymore?</p><p>My hands tightened on the razor-sharp scissors between them. At least the silver familiar could never desert me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMISS ... STREET?\u201d Dr. Youmans said, overlooking Helena in his focus on his clipboard of papers and me, the patient in a plain paper wrapper, which said a lot for his focus.</p><p>The doctor kept skimming the sheets I\u2019d filled out in the waiting room, glancing toward me, until his glance was finally hijacked by the legendry beauty of Helena Troy Burnside sitting in the chair against the wall.</p><p>Even I stared at her. She was suddenly glowing with a Millennium Revelation\u2013bestowed glamour, brimming with charm and confidence. A brilliant, gorgeous trap.</p><p>\u201cMrs. ... Street?\u201d the doctor said, dazed. \u201cI see the patient is fairly young. You\u2019re not expecting anything out of the ordinary? Besides dysmenorrhea, the patient has no complaints\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Doctor,\u201d Helena said, reassuring. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a routine physical. My daughter has been living abroad and I\u2019m afraid she hasn\u2019t been getting regular care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. These young women all feel immortal, especially these days,\u201d he said with an admonishing chuckle. \u201cYoung ladies must have their annual checkups.\u201d</p><p>His comforting smile as he turned to me slid off his face like melting snow. He glanced back at Helena.</p><p>\u201cYour ... daughter? But you\u2019re so gloriously fair-haired and she\u2019s so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Doctor, that my original, natural hair color is long forgotten by all concerned.\u201d</p> <p>As he automatically moved to the foot of the exam table, it was all I could do to avoid kicking him in the crotch. I wonder how many females who\u2019d had to \u201cassume the supine position\u201d here had entertained that impulse. Probably none.</p><p>Me, Irma whispered.</p><p>I ignored her. She wasn\u2019t corporeal, and I was. And ... I\u2019d been here before. On this table maybe, facing this old guy in a white coat. Only the first time I\u2019d still been innocent and trusting.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize her?\u201d Helena inquired. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no. She\u2019s quite striking, of course. Rose Red to your Rose White, if you\u2019ll pardon a fairy tale reference, madam.</p><p>\u201cBut, but ...\u201d He pulled the rolling stool behind him under his lying white-coated ass.</p> <p>I inhaled slowly, gathering.</p><p>\u201cShe was only twelve,\u201d Helena mused. \u201cA ward of the state. That was before I adopted her, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course,\u201d Dr. Youmans murmured robotically, his parchment skin paling to match his starched white coat.</p><p>\u201cLike any new mother,\u201d Helena reminisced, quite convincingly, \u201cI wanted to preserve every detail of my darling\u2019s early years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dr. Youmans murmured, eyeing my shod foot with a frown. Apparently my feet should be bare when placed in the icy steel stirrups.</p><p>Helena was on her own feet and flourishing an old-fashioned manila folder.</p><p>\u201cYou may not recognize me, Dr. Youmans. That\u2019s all right. Not everyone is plugged into the internet media, even these days, especially those in your generation. Helena Troy Burnside is my name, and I\u2019m a doctor of sorts too. Academically. I have some small international reputation for working with ... troubled youth. Frankly, they have good reason to be troubled if they had this young woman\u2019s medical history. Why would a twelve-year-old girl sent to a gynecologist for unspecified \u2018procedures\u2019 not be troubled by the experience ever after?\u201d</p><p>He swiveled on the stool seat to face her. She had him pinned between the stirrups, and me. He looked up at my face for the first time, recognition drawing his benign aging features into a mask of horror and fear. He began babbling.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Burnside. Naturally, I\u2019ve heard of your ground-breaking work. I was a volunteer for Child Protective Services for many years. Social service groups always have insufficient budgets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were a cost-cutter. On a minor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome cases were extreme. I was told this ... child was deemed potentially ... ah, promiscuous.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, but Helena leaped into the breach, evidently expecting that.</p><p>\u201cOn what evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the first year of the Millennium Revelation, for God\u2019s sake. These ... predatory supernaturals were showing up everywhere. Some were half human and had to be housed somewhere. The group homes were festering with adolescent boys, who are ordinarily randy little beasts and now we had half-breed supernatural boys on our hands. Half-werewolf and half-vampire and all lusty, bloodthirsty, powerful young monsters. This girl ... you\u2019ve adopted, this Delilah. Yes, I remember her now. She was underage, but that didn\u2019t stop the vampire punks from going after her like she was bait. They\u2019d have propagated some drastic hybrid on her. The social services could hardly deal with first-generation supernaturals, much less second-generation ones. She had to be stopped ... protected from generating. The damage to her physical system alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Helena said sardonically, while my mind struggled to understand what he had confessed to, and he had confessed to something. \u201cInflicting damage to prevent damage. How original.\u201d</p><p>Helena shook her papers. \u201cOld records never die, Doctor, nor old sins. What did the social workers want you to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to Delilah. She still doesn\u2019t know what was done to her here.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, cringing.</p><p>Helena\u2019s District Attorney act was so fascinating I\u2019d finally done as she\u2019d advised: just watched and listened. It distanced me from the trauma. Also, I really liked to see the old doc cringe. No one was ever going to find me on an ob-gyn examination table again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Helena was pacing, digging her heels into the room\u2019s mushy vinyl tile. \u201cYou were paid by the state to do what to this underage young girl?</p><p>\u201cIt was for her own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they all say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very simple, safe procedure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA procedure utterly mystifying to a young girl who\u2019d never even had a pelvic exam, don\u2019t you think, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but every young girl must face that sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout any knowledge of what\u2019s about to happen to her? Without informed consent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a minor. A ward of the state. No consent was needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, Dr. Youmans. She was a minor.\u201d</p><p>Damn! I couldn\u2019t help not personalizing for a moment. Perry Mason would have been proud of Helena. I was.</p><p>Meanwhile, the door had been pushed ajar as the hall outside the room started buzzing. The office staff was assembling like Howard Hughes\u2019s attendant vampire nurses in Vegas. My personal horror story had become a courtroom drama, and the theatrics of the scene gave me a strange sense of it not really being about me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do to her?\u201d Helena demanded in a ringing voice.</p><p>The sound of doors being slammed against walls indicated that Ric was no longer content to eavesdrop from the waiting room.</p><p>The office door hit the wall and sprung off its hinges. The nurses flooded in after Ric.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d a nurse objected. \u201cThis is a private office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it commits crimes against the public,\u201d Ric said in his deepest, darkest crime-busting voice. \u201cDelilah! Take off that obscene paper sheet.\u201d</p><p>I readily complied, then hopped off that obscene table and took a place against the wall beside Helena. It was her show.</p><p>Ric came over to hook an arm around my shoulder and touched the surgeon\u2019s scissors in my grasp with a questioning look.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer it. The silver familiar would be what it would be. Maybe since they were armed with superior knowledge, I needed to be armed somehow. The over-crowded room finally took me back in time, to my first personal appearance here.</p><p>I was small, lost, and fearful, back in the don\u2019t-go-to place, where even Irma was silent. This was in the time before Irma, and even before Lilith. Maybe even the time when Lilith came out, dark debutante that she had been and still was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much for her, Helena,\u201d Ric\u2019s voice rumbled against my side.</p><p>\u201cWho is this man?\u201d the head nurse demanded, coming to the defense of her doctor. \u201cWho is this strange girl? She\u2019s never been a patient here. You lied,\u201d she accused Helena, even as her worried face betrayed uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cRic,\u201d Helena told him, \u201cDelilah has to face the reasons for her fear, just as you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a lot younger,\u201d he argued. \u201cStill malleable. Delilah\u2019s grown past whatever it was. Look at her! You\u2019re sending her back to childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough love, Ric. And it\u2019ll get tougher. Stay with me. Fear is an infection worse than its cause.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the alarmed doctor again, then brushed past him to a cloth-covered tray on the sink counter, lifting it and then the cloth like a magician producing a trick.</p><p>I stared at the horrible array of instruments revealed. Again, I was jerked into a terrifying moment of my past, one just days ago, when I\u2019d awakened paralyzed with panic on the Karnak mummification table, doomed to be forced to watch the blood slowly drained from my veins.</p><p>The wall behind me felt ice-cold, like a stone embalming table, even though I was still standing. The solid cold surface and being upright were the only things that kept me clinging to a shred of sanity.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Helena said, lifting a long, thick steel tube, \u201cwas what you used on a twelve-year-old girl. She\u2019d never even bled, until you forced this into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Helena,\u201d Ric said, turning my head into his chest and clapping a hand over my only exposed ear. \u201cYou\u2019re putting her through worse than that old medical rapist did. Don\u2019t move an inch, you slimy bastard. I can still strangle you with one hand.\u201d</p><p>The emotions of other people\u2019s fear and anger swirled around and above my still, small center, absorbing what to me was a grotesque reality and blending it with the disguised reality that had haunted my nightmares ever since.</p><p>Lord, I was a textbook case.</p><p>Staring at the implement Helena brandished, I\u2019d recognized the \u201cturkey baster\u201d wielded by the white-skinned or garbed \u201caliens\u201d of my nightmares. It was my industrial-strength version of the \u201cneedle in the navel\u201d procedure alien abductees claimed had happened to them ... only it hadn\u2019t been anything so fine and small as a needle and it hadn\u2019t been aimed at my navel.</p><p>I could feel Ric\u2019s anger and tension, his muscles taut and strained to their breaking point. Any minute he could spring on the old man to tear him apart, like Grizelle the Inferno Hotel\u2019s shape-shifting white tiger.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Ric demanded.</p><p>\u201cAn old-fashioned speculum,\u201d Helena said. \u201cModern ones aren\u2019t cold steel, but warmer plastic. A woman finally had some say in how her body was examined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is medieval,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cMen are wimps,\u201d Helena answered. \u201cYou have no idea. You have no idea of how severe a menstrual cramp can be, nearing labor even.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say \u201cAmen,\u201d but words were caught into a mute ball at that icy center of my gut. I watched Helena pull open the top drawers in the sink cabinet.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d she announced, \u201cthe next thrilling stage of the \u2018unspecified procedure.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She held up something, steel again, that looked like a fancy eight-inch-long bottle opener, something with a wing nut on one end and a long undulating Art Nouveau stem and a silly fluted bottom.</p><p>\u201cA cervical dilator, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked one of the gathered nurses.</p><p>She poked it in their directions and they retreated like Hammer Film vampires at the sight of a silver cross.</p><p>No one in this room dared leave. Helena\u2019s expertise and anger held the medical personnel at bay, and if Ric relaxed his convulsively comforting grip on me, he\u2019d probably tackle someone. Or I would.</p><p>He had his own childhood reasons for justifiable murderous rage. Now, the still-vague wrong done me, a wrong that violated me where he was most intimately involved ... for the first time I feared that the truth could break him as well as me.</p><p>What was Helena doing to us all? Could she put Humpty Dumpty back together again?</p><p>She was not about to stop her avenging angel act now. I knew in my soul that to intimidate the truth out of the medical staff, she had to risk damaging me, and possibly Ric, more. She must believe that the outcome would free us both, but even a Millennium Revelation\u2013assisted shrink could be wrong, as wrong as whoever had ordered my ... institutional rape ... had been wrong twelve years earlier.</p><p>Helena\u2019s voice was shaking with fury now.</p><p>\u201cCan any of you med-school robots imagine her confusion, her fading trust, her growing panic, her incredible agony? Grown women have a tough time with the pain of cervical dilation, because you can\u2019t give a patient anesthesia in a medical office. You didn\u2019t even give this twelve-year-old any ibuprofen before she came in. I see nothing to reduce pain on the chart. Nothing to make it easier, or make her suspect that something bad was coming. Can you imagine the nightmare you became in her psyche? You heard her cries and screams. Several nurses must have had to hold her down. She\u2019d not yet been culturally trained to lie on a gynecological table and handle pain like a super-soldier.\u201d</p><p>Heads hung, but mine was among them. The humiliation was profound. I\u2019d been a lamb to the slaughter. I had been trained by then. Don\u2019t move no matter what, they\u2019d said. It\u2019ll make it worse if you move. Still, the nurses had to hold my arms, I remembered.</p><p>I remembered ...</p><p>\u201cI was cold and shaking afterward,\u201d I heard my own dazed monotone. \u201cSo dizzy I kept almost passing out. I remember they had me sit in an office and they gave my first cup of hot coffee to drink, because I\u2019d been \u2018a big, brave girl,\u2019 and crackers.\u201d</p><p>Helena went ballistic. \u201cShe went into shock? You obviously treated her for it. That\u2019s not on the record, Doctor. How could you conspire with self-serving social workers who were afraid they\u2019d have to answer to a juvenile pregnancy to make the innocent object of possible assault pay like that, and let the boy would-be rapists run rampant? Why didn\u2019t you put the males on drugs?\u201d</p><p>The old man spoke up, his voice hollow. \u201cYou know. Prescriptions are recorded and must be justified. Putting adolescent boys on medications reserved for sex offenders ... too many in the system would question it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many male supervising doctors and lawyers and administrators, you mean,\u201d Helena corrected. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s still no systemic male contraceptive pill, promised since the sixties. Let the women take all the risk.\u201d</p><p>Helena held up the beautiful silver instrument so like an Art Nouveau wine bottle opener. \u201cYou needed the cervical dilator to force open her immature cervix and insert an intrauterine device to prevent pregnancy. That was the \u2018unspecified procedure.\u2019 The social workers couldn\u2019t control the boys, so the girl had to pay, to bear the risks and pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Dr. Burnside,\u201d trembling old Dr. Youmans said. \u201cDelilah was an exceptionally beautiful child, like the young Elizabeth Taylor, if you remember the actress that far back. They were all after her. We had to protect her from the consequences of a juvenile pregnancy, from birthing some half-supernatural monster.\u201d</p><p>His words, sincere, but representing years of denial, stirred me to speak for my lost self at last.</p><p>\u201cI had ways of defending myself against them, the vampy-boy creeps, you old fool!\u201d I felt the shout torn out of me. \u201cBut I had no defense against you. Not against my group-home keepers. They could take me anywhere, order anything done.\u201d</p><p>I stepped away from the wall on trembling legs. The silver familiar had gone into hiding, as if I had to stand alone, without any of my guardians.</p><p>\u201cYou unethical cowards should never be allowed to practice medicine again,\u201d I shouted. \u201cLook at you! Was it easy money, a contract with the social services? Yes, those creeps were threatening me. Did nobody think about really protecting me where I had to fight day after day? Were you willing to let me be gang-raped as long as no evidence showed up? As long as no \u2018helping\u2019 medical or social professional would be held accountable for being unable to control the group homes?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the goosenecked lamp and yanked it, wrenching the electrical cord out of the wall. I swung the metal lightbulb hood at the overhead light fixture, bringing huge splinters of the plastic lens and then the shattering fluorescent tubes down on the examining table, dimming the awful glare, making the table a sea of sharp shards.</p><p>\u201cI remembered you all as aliens,\u201d I told them all, \u201caliens who\u2019d abducted me, and you are. You are alien to the human race, the real unhuman ones.\u201d</p><p>I started tearing the paper covering off the wave-shaped examining table. I kicked over the foot-operated white trash can that would have held the bloody cotton. I grabbed the tray and crashed all the metal instruments to the floor. I launched myself at the table itself and somehow pushed it off center and into the wall.</p><p>When I paused for breath and brushed my hair off my face, the room was a shambles and the nurses were cowering in a sheeplike clot by the wall rack crowded with torn, years\u2019-old magazines now out of print. One title read Modern Contraception.</p><p>\u201cT-t-this is my office,\u201d Dr. Youmans said. \u201cYou\u2019ve trashed it. I could s-s-sue you.\u201d</p><p>Helena stepped into the mess to put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou sue us? I didn\u2019t find any place in the buried records where you ever actually removed the IUD from your underage patient.\u201d</p><p>The silence said everything I needed to hear.</p><p>I lashed out with my boot-toe, dead center of where it hurts a guy the most.</p><p>\u201cAnd you gave me hideous menstrual cramps for eternity? May you have phantom ball pain for the rest of your days, Dr. Malpractice.\u201d</p><p>I held back from contact, but he cringed, writhed, and cupped his privates anyway.</p><p>A nurse objected from the corner of the consulting room. \u201cThis is ... this is a physical attack. The police\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ric stepped between us. \u201cI\u2019m a Fed. You don\u2019t want to involve the locals.\u201d He glanced to the doctor\u2019s clenched knees and protective, palsied hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky she\u2019s taking it out on ... uh, inanimate objects, Doc, and only figuratively. Me, if she wrung all your necks, I\u2019d just call it in as self-defense. Who\u2019s to say different? The last time Delilah was here she was assaulted against her will by all of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSHOCK THERAPY MAY be okay to use on an illiterate boy once enslaved in the Hell Zone between the U.S. and Mexico,\u201d Ric told his foster mother.</p><p>Angrily.</p><p>He slapped his palm on the table of her boutique hotel suite, making Helena\u2019s eyelashes flinch. \u201cNot on Delilah. Not with me there.\u201d</p><p>Me, I was beyond flinching. I\u2019d batted my last eyelash. My mind and emotions were churning, trying to make sense of the last half of my life. The post\u2013Millennium Revelation part, when I\u2019d been physically altered against my knowledge and will.</p> <p>Ric was not done ranting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something to spring on a woman who blotted out a childhood medical assault because it was too damn traumatic to remember at all.\u201d He stopped behind me, bending down, voice lowered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t damage your hands or feet, did you, paloma? Butt-kicking inanimate objects can hurt you more than it will ever damage them.\u201d</p><p>I let him kneel beside me to examine and clasp my fingers. His hands were as warm as his riled temper, and my ice-cube core of dazed fear and fury was melting. I was mad enough at Helena to let him rage, which was rather mean, because I could see Ric\u2019s every accusing word flayed the foster-mother inside the scientist.</p><p>\u201cShe had to confront it, Ric.\u201d Helena\u2019s soft, controlled voice was pleading. \u201cShe had to see what had happened to her in a legal as well as a personal sense, and grasp it all at once. She needed her \u2018day in court,\u2019 because she won\u2019t get justice in any real sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe could still bring a civil suit,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cAnd put her character on trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is fucking flawless,\u201d Ric shouted.</p><p>Damned if my lips didn\u2019t try to break their grim parade formation to smile a little shakily. That kind of described our amorous adventures so far.</p><p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Helena murmured, as she must have reprimanded the teenage boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard\u2014and said\u2014it all, Helena,\u201d he returned. \u201cYou can\u2019t do your demure act on me like you do on the D.C. military brass when you want something, including Philip. I was a feral boy. You and I fought like chupacabras over a goat corpse in \u2018therapy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways so colorful,\u201d she murmured, daring to glance at me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything Annie Sullivan didn\u2019t have to put up with when she was domesticating the deaf and mute child Helen Keller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat rough?\u201d I said, my voice cracking from not having spoken since shouting myself raw in that ... butcher\u2019s office.</p><p>Ric flung himself into the chair next to me. \u201cDrink some wine, Del. It\u2019ll soothe and calm you.\u201d His lips brushed my temple, doing more than any wine could.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask Helena some questions,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said, glaring across the table.</p><p>Helena answered mildly. \u201cShe means alone, hijo. Girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout today, or about then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Helena shook her head gently from side to side, meaning \u201cYes, and this and that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout ... us?\u201d he asked, his voice hardening with a touch of ... dread.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a head shrink, not a medical doctor, Ric. I need to determine the degree of damage and how Delilah\u2019s doing with her current life issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m fucking flawless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Your chica\u2019s claws are in fine condition,\u201d she told Ric with a gleam of humor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be gentle. I know you were.\u201d</p><p>I watched his dusky face flare dull red.</p><p>Wow. I\u2019d never seen anyone or anything make ex-FBI man Ricardo Montoya, the Cadaver Kid, blush.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to go, what am I supposed to do,\u201d Ric asked. \u201cWhen am I supposed to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a cell phone,\u201d Helena said. \u201cYou do know how to use it? Just pick it up when it ring-tones and put it to your ear and talk. Try the bar, Ric. It\u2019s guy country at this hotel.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea he was being given the Lauren Bacall brush-off to Humphrey Bogart, in paraphrase, but he left.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel provided me with this insanely overstocked room bar,\u201d Helena told me, pointing to a pair of louvered doors. \u201cWhip me up a new drink before we settle down to talk. Your Vampire Sunrise is the party circuit hit of Alexandria, Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRic\u2019s right. You\u2019re a very talented girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia, huh?\u201d I walked over and swept the double doors open on a mirrored wall of liquor bottles and glasses. \u201cNo minibar for Helena Troy. You figure keeping me busy will ease the angst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally, it does. And I figure we need something stronger than this sissy wine Ric ordered. Men think we women are made of glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bar glass,\u201d I said, pulling down a few bottles and setting up two martini glasses. \u201cI wish there\u2019d been more glass in that consulting room to smash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me try something mind-bending here first.\u201d</p><p>I mixed some flavors in a set of three shot glasses, sipped and remixed, sipped more. My mind and mouth were working in concert again, as she\u2019d intended. I wondered what poor Ric was downing in that main floor bar in the noisy, echoing atrium.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Counselor,\u201d I said, placing something dark, tall, and bloodred before her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got your client off the hot seat and into the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed a moment in relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you calling this?\u201d she then asked, sipping the drink and closing her eyes again, this time in relaxation. \u201cDelish, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s named in honor of my biggest Darkside Bar fan from the party state of Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I sipped from my own glass. \u201cIt\u2019s a Virtual Virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re ready to talk,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>\u201cWay too overdue. Do you like my cocktail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it. A Virtual Virgin, wouldn\u2019t that be fun to dabble in again?\u201d</p><p>Of course my dead-white skin flushed like Mrs. Haliburton\u2019s chagrined face. Helena didn\u2019t truly understand how recently that condition had been mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cChilled Coca-Cola, or you could use Dr Pepper, for starters. Some black cherry vodka and then citrus mixes to cut the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack cherry vodka,\u201d Helena mused over our tall, footed glasses.</p><p>Besides exotic ingredients, I prefer stemmed barware for my cocktails, when possible.</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d Helena persisted, \u201cdid you come up with black cherry vodka for your Virtual Virgin, my new favorite drink, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cherry was obvious and my mood is a bit dark right now.\u201d I was not about to explain Ric\u2019s addiction to my Midnight Cherry Shimmer lip gloss. \u201cYou could leave out the vodka for minors and those who dislike strong spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot us, Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and leaned back in my chair. The numbness was wearing off. My reptile brain was curling back up to sleep after giving almost everyone around me a good tail-lashing.</p><p>I\u2019d never had anyone to tell me these things. \u201cThis IUD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA method of birth control for decades, of varying usefulness. Not really meant for nulliparous women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m this nulleperous woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNulliparous. The word means non-child-bearing. We\u2019re both nulliparous women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d I said, lifting my martini glass rim to hers. \u201cWhy is the installation process so gross? Computers do it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAncient Arabs put stones into the uterus of a camel to prevent pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure don\u2019t want inconvenient pregnancies in beasts of burden,\u201d I noted. \u201cWeird, the Rolling \u2018Stones\u2019 recorded a song titled \u2018Beast of Burden.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last century\u2019s twenties, a German named Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg placed rings of silk\u2014and later, silver\u2014within the uterus of his female patients to prevent pregnancy. Too much bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can testify.\u201d That mention of silver unnerved me, so I sipped my Virtual Virgin and let Helena enlighten me further.</p><p>\u201cStarting in the sixties IUDs became much more workable and popular. The trouble is the body tends to reject foreign objects unless the uterus has hosted a fetus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all sounds like a biology class at Our Lady of the Lake, where they told you all the scientific stuff, just not exactly how the egg and sperm get together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can gloss over that part too, Delilah. What\u2019s crucial is that you were not even in puberty, yet you were fitted with a birth control device without your knowledge. Your ignorance of the medical procedures made the act an assault. It was a crime, and it\u2019s a sin that it\u2019s not prosecutable in a court of law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were one of these leprous women,\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Liparous,\u201d she corrected. \u201cYou\u2019d be used to routine pelvic exams since puberty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that turkey baster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be a familiar if not favorite article once a year, when you were given a Pap test for cancer. It\u2019s criminal that you haven\u2019t had any basic female organ care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the dilator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be used briefly to obtain a scrap of uterine tissue to test for abnormal cells. It would be a necessary\u2014 possibly uncomfortable, but no more\u2014procedure for your good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the procedure, the pain, I experienced as a kid was no worse than a woman who wanted an IUD would go through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept such women are usually sexually experienced.\u201d Helena stared into her Virtual Virgin. \u201cYou weren\u2019t. You weren\u2019t accustomed to penetration, to intimate invasion. Your fear and natural resistance would make it far more painful. For a young girl of your age and history, it would be a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour highly creative subconscious converted it into an alien abduction dream. Since others went public with such claims, it gave you something \u2018real\u2019 to cling to after what must have been a devastatingly surreal experience. That\u2019s not so different from Ric converting his first adolescent wet dream stimulated by a vampire bat bite into an appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The immature mind needs cultural coat hooks. Yours was alien abduction. I\u2019m sorry, Delilah. You needed to know the truth, no pussyfooting around it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand, for those responsible, it was an unconscionable dereliction of duty. Which Ric realized, and which infuriated him. Essentially, the social services powers-that-be then punished you for being attractive to predators. Blame the victim.\u201d</p><p>Now that she\u2019d put it in bald terms, the injustice of it all hit home. It wasn\u2019t even just the single invasive, controlling act. It was all the consequences, even more to my mind than my body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019ve always hated my looks,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI thought it was my coloring, my white skin looking even paler because of my black hair. I thought vampires went for me because I already looked like a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went for you because they were also teenage boys and you were a very pretty girl. Still a predator-and-prey situation, but one we call \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I shook that damning head of black hair.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Helena said carefully, \u201chere\u2019s why Ric is probably drinking boilermakers down in the bar. I need to ask about your sex life together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019re virtually his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtually, Delilah? That\u2019s a dividing line these post\u2013 Millennium Revelation days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the me-never-on-my-back-thing, it\u2019s none of your business. Now my phobia makes sense, and I feel a lot better that I wasn\u2019t hallucinating aliens. I also feel better knowing that a woman of my age would have experienced pretty much the same thing I did, minus the panic, to get a routine Pap smear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible you\u2019ll actually make an annual appointment now?\u201d Helena smiled ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s for the good of your health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m finding a woman doctor who will understand my issues. The twentieth century must have sucked for women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen the nineteenth. I read about it in grad school.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my Virtual Virgin glass\u2014weren\u2019t we all that at one time?\u2014and we clicked rims.</p><p>\u201cDelilah,\u201d Helena said, \u201cyou have to realize this is devastating for Ric too. He literally didn\u2019t know what he was doing, with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owes me. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMama Doc, don\u2019t worry. Ric was the best thing that ever happened to me. You raised him right. We\u2019re so much better for each other than you could ever imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the male mind. Now that your true history is revealed, he\u2019ll feel like he\u2019s been a ... an insensitive human battering ram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. He can\u2019t be insensitive and I can\u2019t deny I like what he can deliver. Are we done here? Best haul him back from that den of macho iniquity downstairs. We still have some troubling cases to solve in Kansas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire your spirit, but I know more about the damaged psyche than you\u2019re willing to admit. And there\u2019s one more revelation you need to face this millennium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing medical? I\u2019m not going \u2018annual\u2019 for a good year, at least. And it\u2019ll be on my terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing invasive. And very, very soon. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, I know you\u2019ve experienced a huge shock on all levels, physical and mental, but there may be a bigger one coming.\u201d</p><p>Exploring her classical Helen of Troy features, I saw faint worry lines beneath the mineral makeup and even the composure.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>She took a long, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWe still need to find that IUD.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I SAT NERVOUSLY in another examining room with one of those freaky tables wearing a paper sheath and steel stirrups. Too bad I wasn\u2019t wearing spurs. It was interesting, but not comforting, that all this \u201cfemale\u201d scenery unnerved me more than 3-D zombies streaming off the wide vista of an old drive-in movie screen.</p><p>\u201cWomen really lay themselves down on that sacrificial altar once a year?\u201d I asked Helena in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>Yeah. My voice felt like it was being closed up in a black box in my throat.</p><p>\u201cMore often if they\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Helena said. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey get used to submitting to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen have had to get used to submitting to a lot over the centuries,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with now, Delilah, is just modern gynecological practice. Thanks to the Web, I was able to find a woman doctor who\u2019s tops in her field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still wouldn\u2019t mummify a killer crocodile on that torturous-looking table,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Helena looked both confused and repelled. \u201cWhy would anyone want to mummify a crocodile?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d I answered direly, confused to hear women laughing together outside the closed door.</p> <p>I\u2019d never remembered having much to do with doctors, but I sure didn\u2019t like it when the door burst open and a white-coated black woman strode in, her head bowed over a slim manila folder.</p><p>\u201cDr. Youmans refused to release any records, Dr. Burnside,\u201d the woman murmured. \u201cAnd it says here Delilah Street is a juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look juvenile?\u201d I asked, standing up from the office chair to meet this new doctor eye-to-eye.</p><p>She met my demanding glance with her own, then set the folder onto the usual sinister countertop holding a sink and a box of tissues and the array of steel implements.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Her smile came easy. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Sabitini Torres,\u201d she told me. Then she eyed the still-seated Helena.</p><p>\u201cYou said this was an emergency when you made ... I should say, demanded ... an immediate appointment this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Helena wasn\u2019t going to rise and she wasn\u2019t going to give a centimeter.</p><p>Dr. Torres eyed us both ... tall brunette woman with attitude, clearly past twenty-one years, and seated regal blond woman, clearly past menopause. Both clearly unrelated.</p><p>I looked the doctor over, grudgingly approving the sleek fuchsia silk dress glimpsed under her lab coat and the steampunk buckled platform shoes on her feet. Her skin was a glowing negative, an undiluted black like my hair, but her tresses were braided into a cornrow pattern as intricate as a maze. She resembled an ebony version of the famous ancient Egyptian head of Nefertiti, with more Nubian features. She would outclass the ancient vampire sister-pharaoh at the Karnak Hotel in a heartbeat, had both of them been living at the same time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Helena had been digging into her over-buckled designer bag to extract a sheaf of papers.</p><p>\u201cThis is what we hacked out of Dr. Youmans\u2019 computer records.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Torres winced. \u201cYou hacked his records? The ethics\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead them,\u201d Helena suggested sweetly. Sweet was obviously not her usual modus operandi.</p><p>Dr. Torres leaned against the torture table and skimmed them as rapidly as an IRS tax examiner preparing to administer a big fat fine.</p> <p>Her exquisitely penciled eyebrows went up. And up.</p><p>She eyed me with narrowed, incisive black eyes. She looked at Helena, bit her full bottom lip, and nodded. \u201cI see. I\u2019m glad you insisted on getting right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe records don\u2019t show the type of IUD used,\u201d Helena said.</p><p>\u201cThe records don\u2019t show anything they ought to. You think this ... young woman still has this thing?\u201d</p><p>Helena nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, suspicious of the knowing shorthand these two women exchanged as if they were soul sisters. Ebony and ivory. Like me.</p><p>Oooh, Irma crooned in my head. I don\u2019t like this conversational trend, either. Cool doc, though. What the hell lipstick color is she wearing? Be sure to ask. Would look even better on us than Midnight Cherry Shimmer does.</p><p>Will you please, I told Irma, not remind me of intimate episodes in a clinical house of horrors like this?</p><p>I bit my own lip in turn. I\u2019d made such a huge private emotional and sexual leap with Ric these last several weeks I was having trouble regarding myself as a public plumbing problem.</p><p>\u201cThat would be ... malpractice,\u201d Dr. Torres was saying.</p><p>\u201cThat would be ... obscene,\u201d Helena answered, standing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her mother?\u201d Dr. Torres.</p><p>\u201cHere and now, yes.\u201d</p><p>I let my gaze snap to Helena. I couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d said. She was ... adopting me.</p><p>For the time being.</p><p>For a never-adopted child now an adult, that was mind-boggling.</p><p>Did even she understand how this would impact me? I veered between choking up and getting furious. Hearing the never-used phrase \u201cher mother\u201d for the first time at twenty-four. Thinking ... too little too late.</p><p>This visit to Wichita\u2019s medical offices was resurrecting my insecure inner orphan and kick-starting my outer ungrateful bitch. It was giving me emotional whiplash.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I reminded them.</p><p>Jeez, it was like Kipling. \u201cWhen two strong women meet ...\u201d They were east and west and black and white, and both damn scientists.</p><p>Helena\u2019s faded eyes turned to me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We don\u2019t need more probing, Delilah.\u201d She eyed Dr. Torres. \u201cA sonogram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how,\u201d I asked, \u201cam I to drape my chic paper sheath for that procedure?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Torres\u2019s low chuckle escalated into an infectious laugh, making her the woman in the fuchsia dress first and the doctor second. She eyed me with sympathetic warmth. \u201cGirl, my nurses and I will give you such a runway wrap you will want to wear it outa here.\u201d</p><p>I grasped at her good humor. I could tolerate only so many life-shattering moments at once.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a ... a free braiding?\u201d I bargained like a kid. I\u2019d seen Vegas tourists getting that treatment alongside the \u201cbeachy\u201d hotel pools. Nobody had ever done my hair for me before, as far back as I could remember.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>That is how I ended up drinking an awful lot of bottled water while three nurses braided my thick, wavy Irish hair into a magnificent mass of shiny blue-black plaits. The women were so adept they manipulated a couple paper sheaths into a loose Egyptian-style linen gown.</p><p>Was I going to come out of this a Macy\u2019s Parade balloon, a taco wrap, or a fashion model? While I drank the required water, the familiar fashioned itself into an intricate basket-weave ankle bracelet in slow motion to keep me entertained.</p><p>Forty minutes later, a fairly relaxed me was shown into another consulting room, where a computer screen sat beside the examination table. Helena was installed on the visitor\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all the time, Delilah. This is totally external. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the results,\u201d I said, hopping up on the table before anyone could order me to do it.</p><p>Helena\u2019s eyelids fluttered shut for an instant. This still wasn\u2019t easy for her. She was being strong for me. I\u2019ve never had anyone do that before but Ric.</p><p>Okay, Irma said. Cut the surly ingrate act. We need to know why we are the way we are, or will be.</p><p>I nodded, Helena taking the gesture for solidarity and loosing a sigh.</p><p>I was no longer a lamb to the slaughter when the nurses came in and unwrapped my torso to spread some gel on my abdomen. I told them I\u2019d get a really naughty tattoo there before any future incidents like this. If you can\u2019t avoid \u2019em, surprise \u2019em.</p><p>The gel was warm and sticky like blood, and the radiologist, a white-coated woman named Irene, gently but firmly ran a wired paddle over me while staring at the TV screen. The pressure was uncomfortable, but at least it only lasted a few minutes. I was wiped off and told I could use the bathroom and \u201cchange back\u201d in a small adjoining cubicle.</p><p>What would I \u201cchange back\u201d into, I wondered.</p><p>My heart was pounding again, my fate in the hands of these two doctors, one for the reproductive organs and one for the head.</p><p>Dressed, I was led back into a consulting room. This one had no ominous equipment lurking in it, no stirrup-equipped tables or televised sneak peeks into discreetly hidden organs. Just two women doctors wearing bravely smiling faces.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Miss Street.\u201d Dr. Torres gestured me into the chair beside her built-in desk. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had severe menstrual cramps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I can remember, which can be ... spotty. Could this IUD have caused that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost possibly. The body doesn\u2019t like foreign objects in it, even donated organs.\u201d</p><p>Or blood? I wondered. All of Ric\u2019s had been replaced.</p><p>Helena sat forward, impatient. \u201cThis is speculative, Dr. Torres. Delilah could have spontaneously ejected the IUD during one of her painful periods and never noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso possible,\u201d the doctor conceded, \u201cbut not the case. The IUD is still there.\u201d</p><p>An ugly chill\u2014or the silver familiar\u2014climbed my spine. The familiar usually \u201cdefaulted\u201d to a thin hip chain. Had it automatically girded the body part that was most compromised?</p><p>\u201cIf you found the device,\u201d Helena said, \u201cyou can remove it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Torres pursed her fluorescently fuchsia lips.</p><p>We gotta get that brand and color name before we leave, Irma nagged.</p><p>Even Irma was trying to distract me from what was coming. I\u2019d been screwed up for real, my body writhing monthly to rid itself of a parasite that had existed inside me for more than half my lifetime.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Dr. Torres said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remove it?\u201d Helena was disbelieving. \u201cWhat type is it?\u201d</p><p>Reaching a hand with short, unpainted fingernails inside a bottom desk drawer, Dr. Torres finally pulled out what looked like the T-shaped end of those white plastic \u201cstrings\u201d on clothing price tags, a tiny, tamponlike string dangling from the end.</p><p>Gross, Irma moaned. I am so glad I\u2019m all sass and no moving parts.</p><p>\u201cThe common form now,\u201d Dr. Torres said, \u201cis a plastic and copper T. It can also have embedded hormones instead of copper. They are very safe and effective, although not for women who\u2019ve never had children.\u201d</p><p>Helena\u2019s face had gone almost as white as mine always was. \u201cAnd for children who\u2019ve never had periods? What would one of these things do? Nothing but cause unnecessary trauma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand your anger, Dr. Burnside. It was unconscionable to use such a device. It would, though, prevent pregnancy later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d I burst out. \u201cI had a major phobia about any of that insertion stuff.\u201d No wonder I\u2019d fought off vamp boys so fiercely. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been taking the Pill to help with cramps for years. That\u2019s double exposure for no point. I want that thing out of me. Now!\u201d</p><p>Hold it, Irma urged. You don\u2019t know that this IUD is the source of all your pain.</p><p>There is periodic pain, and then there is unrelenting psychic pain. My brain rebelled at processing all this bad news.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take it out,\u201d Dr. Torres said in a soft, sad voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Helena and I expressed simultaneous shock.</p><p>The gynecologist stood to pull a thick, spine-worn trade paperback book from the shelf above her desk, riffling through.</p><p>\u201cThe IUD as a birth control device goes back to prehistory, practically. About sixty years ago, it was modernized and offered as an option to the Pill. They experimented with different shapes, but plastic was the \u2018new\u2019 material that offered so much \u2018promise.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah didn\u2019t have a T-type, did she?\u201d Helena asked, sounding sick with worry.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was this.\u201d Dr. Torres started to hand the open pages past me to Helena, but I grabbed the book first.</p><p>And there it was, my giant, hovering alien abduction nightmare apparition, reduced in a photo to a speck of translucent white plastic on a palm, maybe an inch high and a bit wider.</p><p>Here was the huge white sting-ray-shaped mass suspended over me like a lighting fixture, down to the long thin tail stinger, the IUD\u2019s \u201cstring.\u201d The ray\u2019s angel-like \u201cwings\u201d were scalloped and spined like a bat wing, not a boneless manta ray\u2019s form. Each tiny \u201cspine\u201d ended with a sharp point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d put stickery things like that inside the uterus?\u201d I asked, unbelieving. \u201cHow\u2019d they get it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne quick yank,\u201d Dr. Torres said with a sigh. \u201cMedicine is still primitive in some respects.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. That was insane. What male doctor had thought that one up?</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do that with Delilah\u2019s?\u201d Helena asked. \u201cPrepping her with a sedative pill and a couple local anesthetic injections into the cervix?\u201d</p><p>Great. Now the aliens\u2019 needle wasn\u2019t going into my navel but my cervix. Twice, yet. Who were the \u201caliens\u201d here? My body tensed to run, my hands squeezing the chair arms, my calves bunching to spring me away.</p><p>\u201cWe could,\u201d Dr. Torres said, \u201cbut the IUD has ... altered ... with time.\u201d</p><p>Helena reached a hand out for mine, but I resisted taking it. I didn\u2019t need comfort, I needed escape before they screwed up my insides worse. Right now, I had no allies but Irma, and she had been struck speechless again too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s medically impossible,\u201d the gynecologist went on. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a sonogram. The tiny IUD and string you see pictured is gone. Its manta shape has spread and thinned into ... tentacles ... like endometriosis leeching onto the very bones of her pelvis. And it\u2019s ... not the same anymore. It\u2019s impossible, insane actually, but ... the copper appears to have transformed into sterling silver.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I SAT IN ONE of the motel room\u2019s two cheap armchairs wondering why the Millennium Revelation was turning me into some million-dollar silver-metal woman.</p><p>Well, maybe I was just a thousand-dollar one, given the current price of silver on the stock market.</p><p>Dr. Torres hadn\u2019t had much explanation, except to say that the new \u201cintertwining\u201d with the bone wouldn\u2019t have caused menstrual pain, but that she couldn\u2019t recommend I ever have children, given the pressure that puts on the pelvis. Otherwise, I was fine.</p><p>The familiar had completely disappeared, unseen and unfelt. I figured it was hiding out among the plaits of my hair the kindly nurses had made.</p> <p>Quicksilver sat on the floor beside me, my palm on his thick-furred wolfish head.</p><p>Ric and Quick had been waiting in Dolly for me and Helena to leave that last doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cDelilah, your hair,\u201d Ric had said anxiously. \u201cThe braids. What about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome, James,\u201d Helena had cut him off. \u201cA new hairdo can be a healthy distraction for a young woman.\u201d</p><p>Ric got the idea fast.</p> <p>\u201cLove the look,\u201d he said, and then drove us back to the Thunderbird Inn without comment, Quicksilver riding in what had become his doggy rumble seat. Leonard Tallgrass finally had found an occasion to get my dog back to me. Just in time.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten out and, trailed by Quicksilver, unlocked the motel room door. When I turned back, I saw that the others had remained in the car.</p><p>\u201cYou relax here on your own for a while, Delilah,\u201d Helena suggested. \u201cI\u2019m taking Ric for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanished to the bar again?\u201d he objected, his hopeful expression turning anxious.</p><p>I wanted to joke that I was the one who could stand being taken out for a drink, but Helena shut up her foster son with one tough-as-a-nail-gun look and the command \u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>Off they drove while she enlightened him about the bizarre state of my insides.</p> <p>No one could stop Quicksilver from looking anxious, though. I ran my hand over his head, saying, \u201cI know, I know. Just be patient.\u201d</p><p>At least dogs didn\u2019t need to have the messy facts of female anatomy explained to them.</p><p>Helena supposedly knew what stressed people required. I wasn\u2019t so sure she did now. Was there anything worse than being stuck alone in a Wichita motel room feeling that alien spawn had set up shop in your very guts for some unholy reason? The past I\u2019d been struggling, successfully, to put to rest had punched a literal hole in my very being.</p><p>Though this was summer, the room felt cold. I ran my hands down my chilled upper arms and over my clenched, denim-clad thighs. I rocked myself back and forth, recognizing the motion as a childish self-comforting ritual from the group homes.</p><p>Quicksilver\u2019s warm furred side pressed against my legs, but my teeth began to chatter anyway. It wasn\u2019t the temperature in the motel room, because the summer day was ideal, offering the rare but perfect Midwestern moments between winter heat and full summer air-conditioning, between mayflies and mosquitoes.</p><p>A faint purring drew my hands to a pair of dangling silver cat earrings suspended from a wire curved like spectacle frames over my ears.</p><p>At least the silver familiar had the smarts not to pierce anything on me at the moment. I tried to count my other \u201cat least\u201d blessings. At least my \u201crape\u201d had been medical and institutional. At least what had been done to me without consent had been done to hundreds of thousands of other women by their own request. So I was not as alone as I felt. It\u2019d probably hurt them too, but they\u2019d known what to expect.</p><p>Quicksilver whimpered and rested his jaw on the chair arm, producing that \u201chang dog\u201d look. Gosh, I didn\u2019t want to bring anybody down with me. I was lucky I had people\u2014and a dog\u2014who cared to stand by me during this.</p> <p>I thought about all the things I\u2019d survived here in Wichita, and in spades in Las Vegas lately. Feeling sorry for myself had never worked. It was time to think, not feel.</p><p>What if, over the years ... my body had turned the intrusive bit of plastic into something more useful? Something I really needed. Maybe it was a pre\u2013Millennium Revelation \u201cgift.\u201d Maybe it was the source of my current silver talents: my ability to see things in mirrors and walk through them and reflective surfaces. Maybe it had even \u201cgrabbed\u201d and created the silver familiar from Snow\u2019s lock of hair as an external extension of itself. Maybe it had become my inner armor, my protector.</p><p>I had no idea how long I sat there in the demi-dark with the window curtains drawn, but eventually a knock came on the door.</p><p>I looked around. The perky patterned comforter was installed on the bed, so the maid had come and gone. Still shivering, I went to the door peephole.</p><p>I spotted a baseball cap with embroidered script and a rose on it, seen through enough gaudy coleus leaves and tiger lilies for a New Orleans funeral. Undoing the chain lock, I confronted a gawky delivery boy obscured by baskets of tissue and greenery.</p><p>I could now read the fancy script on the cap: Flowers \u2019n\u2019 Bowers.</p><p>\u201cKin I put some of this stuff down, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole Spa for a Day Super Package.\u201d</p><p>I swept the door wide and stepped back.</p><p>He quickstepped to the table by the window and relieved his forearms of basket handles and his hands of the ambushing greenery and a tall bottle of champagne.</p><p>While he was setting everything upright so it wouldn\u2019t fall over, he played eyeball-tennis with the occupants of the room. Since that consisted of the usual motel furnishings and Quicksilver and me, it didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cYou just need to sign that you got this stuff, uh, ma\u2019am. The charge is taken care of.\u201d</p><p>He produced a receipt pad and a pen. An overbearing odor of roses was rising like swamp miasma. I hesitated to take custody of the lot.</p><p>\u201cYou, ah, alone here, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe champagne can be tough to pop. I kin jest get that, ah, started for you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>I realized his roaming gypsy eyes were now concentrating on my figure.</p><p>\u201cI can handle a champagne cork by myself,\u201d I said. \u201cAlso, the dog is great at extracting things that are in my way.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and gulped simultaneously, backing toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJest our friendly Flowers \u2019n\u2019 Bowers super-service, ma\u2019am. You take care now.\u201d</p><p>I intended to, turning the dead bolt and restoring the chain lock as soon as his skinny ass was out of the way.</p><p>Meanwhile, Quicksilver was using his supersensitive nose on the array of baskets and audibly sniffing. I joined him in exploring our bounty.</p><p>The champagne was a no-name brand. I twisted the bottle\u2019s wire basket open and managed to maneuver the cork out with a pop that made Quicksilver jump and growl.</p><p>Two stemmed plastic glasses hid among some potted bachelor\u2019s buttons.</p><p>Everything was beyond cheesy, but whoever had sent this knew that any kind of bubbly right now would unravel the knots in my neck and shoulders as if they were made of satin instead of steel.</p><p>I gulped the first chintzy glassful of slightly sour champagne and poured another.</p><p>The showy flowers surrounding the potent posy of tea roses weren\u2019t scented, so I set them on the dresser in front of the mirror. I didn\u2019t linger to probe any images in it, including mine.</p><p>There was another bottle of bubbly, this one full of pink powder.</p><p>I imported it into the bathroom and took a long, foamy, pink bath.</p><p>By the time I got out, wrapped in a towel with my braids clipped atop my head, the safety chain was off its slide. I didn\u2019t want to know who and how, but Quicksilver was obviously out on patrol and Ric was waiting on one of the plastic chairs. He\u2019d taken off the visiting-social-services tie, and I liked the view through his top three open shirt buttons. Also his smile.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cMom-shrink gets way too lost in her head ... and yours and mine. I owe her respect, but I don\u2019t buy that my absence will make you feel better than my presence tonight.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. \u201cShe thought I needed to be alone here all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought you needed to be left alone,\u201d he said. \u201cDios, Del. I came back to say you\u2019re safe with me. We\u2019re camping partners tonight, no more. I just want to be with you, mi virgen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtual Virgin,\u201d I corrected. \u201cThat\u2019s ... really noble, Ric.\u201d I went to sit on his lap, my thick plaits tumbling to my shoulders as the savvy familiar slithered down into position as a slender ankle bracelet. \u201cYou responsible for the homey spa package, hombre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheesy,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d I said, giving him a peck on the lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do like the braids. Muy ex\u00f3tico.\u201d He diplomatically neglected to mention that they evoked an ancient Egyptian wig and our second most dangerous, latest adventure.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He nuzzled my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm and soft and scented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm and hard and drenched with virtuous lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to comfort you, Del. Nothing more. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you to fall short in the romance department, Montoya,\u201d I drawled.</p><p>He seemed surprised, but my mood had peaked the moment he entered the room. All the nightmares of the last two days had shot into the distance like a fey maze. Mama Helena had been wrong and Ric right. I\u2019d needed some pampering to ease my stress and now I was buzzed on cheap champagne and a fierce willfulness to be taken extreme advantage of.</p><p>\u201cLook, Ric. What I was put through years ago was inexcusable, painful, and traumatic, but now I know the truth. I\u2019d imagined a lot worse than an insensitive bureaucracy resorting to the sexual double standard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, are you sure you\u2019re all right with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ... yet, but it has nothing to do with us. I\u2019m supposed to be unfairly punished again? No sack time with you? I\u2019m feeling like a new woman. Have you got the moxie to get me over on my back for the first time and crush me into the mattress with your manly needs?\u201d I challenged before his lips hushed mine.</p><p>I could say he groaned, he growled, he rasped, he husked, but what he did was say nothing, just moved his lips to the sweet spot on my nape he\u2019d made his signature start and stop of our erotic journeys. The moment they touched my damp skin I folded like a bad poker hand onto the trinket-laden bed. He was already there, and rolled me over on top of him.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so sugary, so salty, so sharp,\u201d he murmured into my neck, \u201cjust sleeping partners for now, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith benefits,\u201d I said, laughing softly until we were silent but not still, my lips glued to his neck scar, until he came and I fell asleep from emotional exhaustion and, my current BFF, cheap champagne, satisfied. There was nothing anybody had done to me in the past to stop me from being what I wanted to be in the future.</p><p>I AWOKE SLOWLY, still habitually lying on my right side, aware of dim light illuminating the bed. Ric was awake, watching me, his head braced on his elbow and hand, the soft light from the parking lot caressing the sharp lines of his forehead, nose, and cheekbones. He belonged on a twenty-foot-high pillar in my particular temple.</p><p>I looked down to see his other hand resting on my hip. My legs had scissored open while I slept and he\u2019d pushed a leg between them. The sight of his face and our entwined bare legs set my pulse throbbing.</p><p>\u201cMorning?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe middle of the night. Now shhh. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>He swept my left arm over my head, torquing my torso, lifting my breasts, almost pushing me onto my back on the pillows, but not quite.</p><p>The slight frisson of panic I felt at the position was ... fleeting.</p><p>\u201cBusy?\u201d I asked, looking down as he caressed me.</p><p>I\u2019d finally got past considering my white skin as drained, lifeless, helpless vampire bait. Ric loved seeing it on his so-sleazy but right black satin sheets. I loved seeing his darker hands in stark relief on my pale skin, so visible wherever they roamed.</p><p>Him not still \u201conly\u201d a man after his near-death experience, as Snow, and now Sansouci, had warned me? Forget it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ravishing me again?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d His hand stroked my inner thigh. \u201cSlick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I should pay for it.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved on, disappeared. I gasped with frustration, breathing hard now while his dark eyes watched my every breath. All black pupil, his eyes, with only a wire-thin band of silver around the left one. The irises of his eyes had always been so deeply brown I never could tell when his black pupils swelled with arousal. Now, the silver was a dead giveaway.</p><p>I gave away a little mew-purr of satisfaction myself.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t the stage director here. Ric was watching more than my face. I felt a featherweight touch over my chest and breasts, then a circling at their center. Repeated.</p><p>Ready. So ready. My hips swayed. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Was he kidding? My navel flamed as though freshly pierced when the dowsing rod between his hips brushed my belly.</p><p>His eyes were downcast, his fingers circling as I arched my back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, hombre?\u201d I prodded him. \u201cI\u2019m going crazy. Loco.\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved to my mouth, tracing my lips, sliding over their sensitive inner slick. I tried to consume his fingertips, but one stiff forefinger pressed down on them, urged silence, stillness.</p><p>The room echoed with the sound of a panting trapped wild animal. Me.</p><p>He was being so damn slow the wanting had boiled down to a painfully tight, aching ring at the fork of my body.</p><p>Ric finally extended his bracing elbow and ran his free hand into the hair at my temple, bringing my face into the light as his finger stroked my lips again. Something deep crimson, thick and shiny coated his forefinger tip. It looked like blood.</p><p>\u201cRic?\u201d</p><p>He read my suspicion and let me taste the fingertip.</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sweet,\u201d his voice corrected.</p><p>\u201cFruity. Ric, what the hell\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth. Slick. Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe label\u2019s so tiny it\u2019s hard to read in the semidark, but I\u2019d say it was our old friend Midnight Cherry Shimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight. That it is. Cherry. You got mine weeks ago, bloodless as it was. Shimmer? No moonlight here. Lip gloss? You\u2019ve been ... into my purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me delving in your purse for interesting things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d</p><p>His hand was back on my inner thigh. So close to that taut, throbbing hot spot ... my thoughts sounded like they belonged in a book with half-naked men on the cover. Nothing wrong with that, but I craved a less clich\u00e9d vocabulary to express this wild, maddening overdose of desire. All I could get out of my throat was ...</p><p>\u201cFinish it!\u201d I would not add \u201cfor God\u2019s sake.\u201d I didn\u2019t want any deities peeking in on this action.</p><p>He laughed. Fondly. \u201cNot even halfway there, Delilah. You do seem to be addicted to that naughty Lip Venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLip Venom? That tingle? There? You put Lip Venom on\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it on your lips, amor. And on your lips.\u201d His hand caressed my thigh, the thumb stroking deliciously near the source of my budding agony (the wait) and ecstasy (the forthcoming climax), but not nearly close enough.</p><p>\u201cAnd my navel,\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cAlways so fast with a deduction, but a little slow tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not slow tonight. I don\u2019t need more foreplay. I want ... closure.\u201d</p><p>The answer to my demands was his lips sliding over mine, inside, outside, but nothing yet in my lady\u2019s chamber. I was so glad I gagged Irma during these sessions. Just my own voice in my head was aggravation enough.</p><p>He kissed me from here to eternity. His face and mouth focused every erotic thought and feeling on my candy-tipped breasts as Midnight Cherry Shimmer passed from my flesh to his mouth and back to me again in fascinating rhythms that had me in their spell.</p><p>Enough body paint and tease. I needed the main act ... now. So ...</p><p>I let my sensually torqued torso roll me flat on my back for the first time in my remembered life, for the first time during our erotic encounters.</p><p>Instead of clenching with the usual panic, I was amazed to feel the fearless confidence of a big cat luxuriating in a belly-exposing stretch. I angled my head back, exposing my throat, then arched my spine from my hips to my shoulders, offering Ric a full frontal self he\u2019d never seen from me before. This should snap his so-called control like a twig.</p><p>Ric\u2019s hands slipped under my back, supporting me. He leaned away to study my body as if it was an Old Master painting. He ran one hand up my arms and fixed my wrists in position.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my bow,\u201d he finally said, lowering his torso over mine, his voice thick. \u201cI\u2019m your arrow. Always.\u201d</p><p>Then the Spanish words came tumbling out between kisses he pressed on my flesh from my wrists to my forehead and lips, pausing for a long passionate minute to burn a bruise into a dangerously near-visible spot above one collarbone. His restless mouth suckled my tinted and flavored nipples until they caught fire, too, and then blazed a further trail down from navel to tilted pubic bone.</p><p>Yes. Home at last. Finally. He slid deep inside me, his weight flattening me into the mushy motel mattress. I now had the luxury of seeing his eyes, his mouth, his expression both dreamy and excited. The mere act of our breathing hard with his pelvis so compressed on mine brought me the shuddering, screaming-into-his-mouth tsunami I\u2019d sensed surging up from my tropical zone.</p><p>My banshee howl threatened to raise the dead and lasted long enough to send a bunch of them straight to Hell for evil thoughts, but Ric laughed into my neck after his own echoing orgasm ebbed away and tapped my thigh with a \u201cwe\u2019re done\u201d pat as he rolled away.</p><p>Whoo.</p><p>\u201cYou can fool around with my purse any time,\u201d I said when able to manage a whole sentence.</p><p>We were sweat-slick, streaked with tracks of shimmering black cherry gloss, and satisfied as hell.</p><p>\u201cBetter shower,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come along in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came along for a minute just now. Uhh. Do I have to get up, I\u2019m so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticky,\u201d he finished. \u201cShower. Motel sheets. We don\u2019t want to leave a trail of Midnight Cherry Shimmer for the maids to giggle at.\u201d</p><p>I rolled out of the bed and went, gingerly, to the bathroom, shutting the door and turning on the lights.</p><p>Okay. Karaoke queen at a nude rock rave, thoroughly had, agreed with me. This is what Ric had finally seen with me on my back. My cherry-shiny nipples matched my passion-swollen lip-glossed mouth.</p><p>Some of the glinting lip gloss had even slicked the new bruise already darkening my white skin. I touched the spot, only sexual excitement tingling in the deepest depths where I\u2019d once been most pain-violated. Keep the creative pelvic examinations coming, mi hombre, I thought without Irma\u2019s help. My body is your bow and you are my arrow.</p><p>I rubbed my fingertips to disperse the dark crimson shimmer, but ... the color was bright red. Bloodred. Ric\u2019s suction kiss had broken the skin. Ouch. A bit alarming in this day and age, but that could happen when the love was deep and the sex was hot. I knew that now.</p><p>My fingers returned to my throat, feeling a salty sting. The skin there was thinner, more sensitive. It was just a small break, not like he\u2019d ... bitten me. And if he had, that wasn\u2019t anything unheard of. I\u2019d bitten him accidentally first.</p><p>I smiled, exploring the fact of feeling both satisfied and freed.</p><p>Our previous back-avoiding positions deserved reruns but\u2014so call me unliberated\u2014I\u2019d loved being finally able to lie under Ric, watching him love me, being his bow and welcoming his arrow. Taking his weight and making it work for us. For the first time, I felt that Ric had been able to do with me what he was born to do ... dowse the depths of my heart, body, and soul.</p><p>HOT WATER was sluicing like tears down my body.</p><p>Now that the romantic interlude was over, Irma joined me in the shower.</p><p>Whoo-ee. Guy on top rocks. And all that juicy red lip gloss our boy was laying on your touch-me-not zones. Sexy new wrinkle. I wish someone would rouge my nipples with, say, Chambord raspberry liqueur from an Albino Vampire. I bet that would drive Sansouci and ole Shez wild.</p><p>TMI. No improper names, please, I told her. Glad you approve, but why wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re my self-appointed inner slut, Irma.</p><p>Recognition at last. Listen. Don\u2019t overthink the wild thing. There are guys who like women in spike heels to walk all over them. The S and M parlors are full of mock and real blood and thunder. This was a little harmless purse-diving with benefits. Like you didn\u2019t go ballistic? You love the guy, bottom line.</p><p>That\u2019s why I worry. Bottom line: neck sucking still troubles me. A last, lingering hang-up.</p><p>What do you know? You had a bizarre, isolated upbringing and the sexual experience of a cantaloupe before you met Ric ... at age twenty-four. I take that back. Who knows what cantaloupes can get up to?</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>See. You should be more realistic and worldly by now. It\u2019s like if it feels too good, it\u2019s gotta be a problem for you. That is so twentieth century.</p><p>I sighed. I just don\u2019t want Ric to see I\u2019m worried, I thought at last.</p><p>Simple. You gotta be a little less Deliverer and a lot more Delilah with him. Relax and enjoy. I do so need the girl talk afterward. Take it from me. Celibacy sucks. And so does great sex.</p><p>I rinsed well to ensure no Midnight Cherry Shimmer would stain my clothes and shivered with good memories. Irma was right. Midnight Cherry Shimmer and Lip Venom could work both ways and maybe even better in reverse ... on Se\u00f1or La Vida Loca. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDON\u2019T WORRY, MOM-SHRINK,\u201d a mischievous Ric told Helena Troy Burnside as we escorted her and her chic Chanel carry-on bag to the airport waiting area the next day. \u201cIt makes you look your age.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in to kiss her cheek and drew quickly back, to duck her reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou cactus-tongued young devil.\u201d Helena\u2019s mock annoyance ended with a smile.</p><p>Then she eyed me. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Yesterday was all revelation and darkness and angst, and now you two crazy kids are acting like\u201d\u2014she suddenly did get it\u2014\u201c... honey ... moon ... ers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working it out in private therapy,\u201d Ric told her. \u201cHard.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust don\u2019t go off and do anything foolish without sending me and Philip an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing rash,\u201d I assured her, \u201cor requiring dyed-to-match satin sandals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always an email or phone call away,\u201d she reassured us in turn.</p><p>I leaned in, feeling awkward. I smelled an old-lady-type perfume like Est\u00e9e Lauder White Linen (a name too evocative of ancient Egypt for me) and maybe a lingering whiff of psychic shell shock.</p> <p>I imitated Ric in laying light hands on her silk-suited sleeves and kissed her smooth cheek.</p><p>Eek, Irma caroled. I kissed a girl.</p><p>\u201cDelilah, dear\u2014\u201d Helena embraced me back to cover the sudden tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege to be with you at ... this watershed time in your life.\u201d</p><p>She turned almost blindly to click off on her kicky Stuart Weitzman pumps to check in at the gate.</p><p>\u201cKiss-ass,\u201d Ric whispered mockingly in my ear. \u201cI always thought Helena secretly would have liked a daughter.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t meet his eyes as fast as I wanted to. \u201cShe\u2019s a cool lady. We both owe her.\u201d</p> <p>We walked away from the gate, not looking back. Ric slung an arm over my shoulders. \u201cYou did that like a pro, chica. Bueno. Brava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, favorite son,\u201d I asked, overdue in moving on from my Hallmark moment with his foster mother, \u201cwhy\u2019d you need to get Helena out of town so fast?\u201d</p><p>Our pace had picked up and Ric moved on the conversation too. \u201cTallgrass and I have haven\u2019t been just spying on cows and zombie trail riders while you\u2019ve been pursuing sentimental journeys to Old Wichita landmarks,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for a nexus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new brand of car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Nexus. GM would love that. Not bad marketing, but no. We now know the what and why of weird events that have been going on in Wichita lately, but not the who and where. So, it\u2019s time we all get back on the same investigative track and take these suckers down. Okay by you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t preclude nocturnal time-outs,\u201d he added, grinning until I elbowed him in the Dos Equis six-pack.</p><p>BY THE TIME we reached a demure, top-up Dolly in the parking lot, Leonard Tallgrass\u2019s big-wheel black pickup was parked alongside her, with Quicksilver on guard in its high empty bed.</p> <p>\u201cI saw you three heading into the terminal,\u201d Tallgrass told Ric through his rolled-down window. \u201cThat your foster mother?\u201d</p><p>Ric nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe married?\u201d</p><p>Ric nodded.</p><p>Leonard Tallgrass shook his head and reinstalled his straw Stetson. \u201cAlways knew there wasn\u2019t any justice in the universe.\u201d He nodded at the high-riding pickup\u2019s rear. \u201cNo dogs risk their lives to ride in my truck bed, not even your whip-smart Quicksilver, Miss Delilah. So get down your Dolly Parton\u2019s top, and I\u2019ll lead you three to the most amazing sight Wichita has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTALLGRASS IS A character,\u201d I told Ric as he drove Dolly two tailpipe-lengths behind the black pickup.</p><p>\u201cHe plays on that, yeah. Since he\u2019s Native American, people underestimate him. Not even the Millennium Revelation changed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re wearing your silky, pale Vegas suit today, dude,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThat for seeing off \u2018Mom\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s on Tallgrass\u2019s orders. And, except for those fashionista hair plaits, you look ultra-reporterly, as I requested, in those closed-toed pumps and that navy Catholic girls\u2019 school suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that a personal or professional request?\u201d I asked.</p><p>I may have triggers of my own, but I was beginning to target his. Ric liked me either very buttoned up or very stripped and unzipped, although he\u2019d put up with in-between if he had to.</p><p>\u201cProfessional,\u201d he answered promptly. \u201cWe might be going into the devil\u2019s den today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t tell me any more?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou work better as an investigator on instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That could be a put-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Del. And it\u2019s a compliment. Tallgrass and I have an agenda where we\u2019re going, but if you want to strike out on your own, do it. You have those sterling-silver instincts. Where is that little devil now, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I had to think about it, finally dredging up a thin silver chain from the modest vee opening of my jacket.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe,\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019ve got an Our Lady of the Lake class ring on a chain around my neck? I couldn\u2019t afford to buy a class ring when I graduated on scholarship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they can be ordered retroactively,\u201d Ric said, following Tallgrass on a left turn and then gawking up at the sky. \u201cWow. Would you believe that?\u201d</p><p>I was still clinging to the promise of a class ring when I looked up past Dolly\u2019s red visor to an endless blue summer Kansas sky pierced by a seventy-story Hollywood sound-stage icon made real. We\u2019d been exploring the wrong, west side of town. Obviously, the big-time action was all on the east side, where the sun rose.</p><p>Well, using my new \u201cat least\u201d philosophy, I at least had a watchdog and a couple of ex-FBI guys to accompany my triumphal entrance to the Emerald City of Wichita.</p><p>Hah! Even Quicksilver looked a tad worried about driving right under the Emerald City. Once Ric and Tallgrass had parked our bulky vehicles beside each other in the lot, we paused to gaze up and up at the slick towers so like a cluster of giant sparkling water bottles, green and shiny.</p><p>\u201cFits the prairie setting. They look like plastic silos,\u201d I commented.</p><p>Tallgrass chuckled, looking down through his high driver\u2019s seat window.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell my pal Ben Hassard that. He\u2019s fought like a cornered wolverine to get this opportunity for our tribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Native American project?\u201d Ric asked.</p><p>\u201cYup. First one outside reservation land. Whole new world, amigo.\u201d Tallgrass collapsed a couple sticks of Black Jack gum in his mouth and chewed it like a wad of Red Man. \u201cI did my best to discourage Ben, but he\u2019s got this far and is in there dealing with the white man even now.\u201d</p><p>My eyes and ears were panoramic webcams, recording, recording. This was a Big Story, right here in Wichita, where the unending march of gambling money that funded state operating needs met the reinterpretation of what was owed the decimated Native populations. Entertainment entities from CSI to Emerald City were taking over the heartland\u2019s minds and landscapes.</p><p>Too bad I didn\u2019t have a venue to report anymore.</p><p>Quicksilver nudged his head under the loosely curled hand at my side and whimpered. He either agreed with me about the sad decline of professional news reporting in the post\u2013Millennium Revelation world, or he wanted a puppy biscuit.</p><p>RIC WAS COUNTING on me to be a quick study, so I did my Wizard of Aahs fan-girl bit and filled them in.</p><p>First I had to go through the \u201cdazzle\u201d phase.</p><p>The Wizard of Oz, known for its spectacular Technicolor, was on my list of key black-and-white movies because it started with the classic Kansas farm and tornado scenes. Color technology was literally being expanded that very year, 1939, to become the forever-future format.</p><p>All black-and-white photo and film freaks felt nothing had the impact of a stark yet incredibly nuanced noncolor palette. Black resulted from all colors of the rainbow put together. White was the absence of all color. These perfect partners produced a new rainbow in shades of gray.</p><p>Like all near-Millennium babies, though, in real life I jonesed on opulent color in reel life. So the first glimpse of the Emerald City finally sold me on Oz, the motion picture. The studio artists, beset more by a tight schedule than the MGM budget, had blended a Disney cartoon castle with the blown-glass bubbles of futuristic space communities and had shown it all through green-colored lenses.</p><p>Add the nitrous-oxide, high-pitched voices of trilling Munchkins to the sound track, and I was in heaven.</p><p>Today, I gazed in real life at a double rainbow halo arching over seventy-some stories of gleaming gemstone-green glass towers. Then the genius of it hit me. The Emerald City was the quintessential green project. It was fantasy-futuristic for our times.</p><p>So cruising around the stunning structure again to park in the mostly deserted lot, we considered what to do.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get,\u201d Ric told Tallgrass, \u201cwhy we\u2019re here to snoop. Anybody who\u2019d use domestic cows as drug mules and souped-up zombies on speed as herders wouldn\u2019t be involved in an airy-fairy project like this Cloud Cuckoo-land extending umpteen stories above us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo big little words,\u201d Tallgrass answered. \u201cMoney laundering. Fantasyland always comes down to profit, and don\u2019t we Native Americans know it.\u201d</p><p>WE ALL PILED into Tallgrass\u2019s extended-cab pickup for a strategy session, me and Quicksilver all ears, Tallgrass laying it out on the dashboard computer.</p><p>He flashed a promo photo of the immense Emerald City.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t even thought of gambling palaces this spectacular in Dubai or Macao,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018native\u2019 to the region legendry,\u201d Tallgrass said with irony. \u201cAlso much glitzier than the usual Indian casino with Powwow Bars and teepee men\u2019s rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cWhen I was first reporting there was a huge civic fight against opening an Indian casino in Wichita. The civic powers wanted gambling operations and all the negatives that go with them to stay in Oklahoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018powers that were\u2019 decades ago wanted all the Indians relocated to Oklahoma,\u201d Tallgrass said, \u201cand that\u2019s where all the oil happened to turn up later. We up-prairie tribes lost out. Several U.S. tribes have sued for the right to establish casinos on land off the tiny reservations left to them. And won. After all, it was all ours once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorders make for murderous neighbors,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the last say on that, amigo,\u201d Tallgrass told him. \u201cYour forebears, though, still have a nation despite the drug cartels. We Indians don\u2019t.\u201d He eyed me over his shoulder. \u201cBut we will have a nice Native American casino on the fringe of this new Wichita \u2018megalopolis\u2019 east. Kind of a sideshow like the Oz movie\u2019s Professor Marvel is in.\u201d</p><p>Ric and I exchanged glances. The western part of the state could barely support a dilapidated drive-in revival. How was the eastern side of Wichita supposed to draw a steady tourist influx?</p><p>\u201cWho are the underwriters?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMegacorporations,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cThey come in and things happen. When they\u2019re through with us, you won\u2019t be able to fly over Kansas without seeing a new neon galaxy spread over our waving fields of grain. Hell, we\u2019re going to get our own CSI TV show too. Bet you could write up an episode about the serial cow murders, Miss Delilah, and make a pretty penny.\u201d Tallgrass chuckled.</p><p>\u201cTV scripts don\u2019t pay that much,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this CSI thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been previewed on the local station, WTCH.\u201d</p><p>I was still frowning with unhappiness at the idea of Hector Nightwine Productions invading my former home-town while Tallgrass continued to bemoan\u2014and brag about\u2014the high-profile new enterprises coming to Kansas in general and Wichita in particular.</p><p>\u201cThis is way beyond the government having to lay out tax money to get business hiring. The international arms of your Vegas conglomerates are involved. Gonna call the concept \u2018Wicked Wild West.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I got it. \u201cA little Dodge City and a lotta Dorothy Gale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Emerald City under glass is built where all the fertilizer plants used to be and stink up the air for miles around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is kind of genius,\u201d I said. \u201cOz under the Ozone Dome. Everything would have to be licensed, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese hotel-casino outfits have billions to burn.\u201d Tallgrass was cruising his Favorites menu for visuals. \u201cMunchkins, flying monkeys, talking scarecrows and tin men, witches and wizards. They all fit in with the times. Sort of a metaphor for who we\u2019ve got representing us in Congress these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill the same old cynic,\u201d Ric said, laughing. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t there been national news on this new gambling Mecca on the prairie? I can see there\u2019s not much between Vegas and the Gulf Coast and Atlantic City, but aren\u2019t you Wichita folks right on top of Branson, Missouri, and all the established country music theme parks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne word,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cIt almost sounds Native American. Old theme parks are \u2018hokey,\u2019 amigo. This new stuff that\u2019s going up is big, slick, costly, and tapping into the American Dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Tallgrass winked at me. \u201cAbout little country girls making it in the big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Dorothy Gale in the Emerald City. I get it,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your involvement with this project?\u201d I asked, sniffing a story.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he said, spreading palms so dark and seamed I couldn\u2019t even detect the major head, heart, and life lines scribed on them. They had to be there. Didn\u2019t they?</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t let his pseudo-innocence and time-inscribed palms distract me.</p><p>\u201cLike you said, Tallgrass,\u201d I went on, \u201cthe Kansas tribes are reduced and scattered, and the reservations are handkerchief-size. What\u2019s left of the Kickapoo and Kiowa would need someone they could trust, but sophisticated to the ways of the white man\u2019s chicanery. Someone with native blood\u2014and FBI experience\u2014to investigate the big boys so their fringe casino project doesn\u2019t get taken or fail to pay off the tribe.\u201d</p><p>Ric was eyeing our negotiation-cum-mutual interrogation, and enjoying it. Watching allies from his past and present interact, even spar with each other, said a lot about each of us.</p><p>I was not about to let him down by looking gullible.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tallgrass conceded. \u201cI looked more than anyone expected into the major backers. And you.\u201d</p><p>That had both Ric and me taking deep breaths.</p><p>Tallgrass picked up his remote control. \u201cRicky here told me he was bringing you back.\u201d</p><p>Ricky?</p><p>I knew I looked offended, and I felt offended. My spine stiffened as I sat up straighter in the cramped backseat. Ric had been telling other people about me, and not me about them? He didn\u2019t trust me, after I\u2019d beaten down the gates of mortality and thrown the dice on my soul with Snow to save his life?</p><p>Tallgrass\u2019s red-brown eyes on my face drove as deep as rusty railroad spikes.</p><p>\u201cYou understand,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwe all have blood family, and some of us have foster family, but the wisest of us have chosen family. I have no children but one, and now maybe two, and possibly three.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I was feeling adopted again. Was he saying Ric\u2014 and me and Quick\u2014had a foster father?</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Tallgrass said, looking only at me, \u201cI\u2019ll show you what\u2019s been running on WTCH-TV in the week before you two showed up here.\u201d</p><p>Ric reached for my hand over the seat back. Stiffly, I extended it. It had been a rough couple of days. Holding hands like rapt teen lovers at a drive-in, we watched the tape Leonard Tallgrass had recorded from local TV.</p><p>A discordant synthesizer caught the ear. A streak of camera pan teased the eye.</p><p>\u201cThe mystery woman was first seen as an anonymous corpse on a Las Vegas autopsy table,\u201d a deep male voice-over announced.</p><p>The camera panned over a naked Lilith from black hair to Glitz Blitz Red\u2013polished toenails, pausing on her nostril pierced by that damn tiny blue topaz stud I used to wear. I flinched to see those staring blue eyes identical to mine. Tattoos would have added some visual interest and helped cover all that dead-white motionless flesh. Where had that adolescent ink gone? Body makeup? Or had it been removed?</p><p>I was cringing at Lilith\u2019s exposure, which was my own.</p><p>Then the ad spot featured reflections of a faint face seen through a plastic visor. Mine, filmed far more recently. Hector Nightwine wasted no time, or no wine before its time. I could see the fat-cat bastard sipping a rare vintage as he previewed this totally unauthorized footage in his office.</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d his voice-over announced, \u201cthe drama continues on CSI Madame X, as this bewitching mystery woman lures a crack forensics team into deciphering the enigma of her life ... or death, and finding that every turn of every criminal case on their books leads to the limpid corpse and possible reincarnation of ... Lilith. Premiering in Wichita and worldwide for the fall season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard!\u201d I was hopping in my seat, hitting my head on the headliner. \u201cHe\u2019s using my attempt to use a bit part in his seriously sick show as a lure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d Ric asked. \u201cYou filmed a bit for Nightwine as a corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Not exactly. This is not the time to go into it, Ric, other than that when I get back to Vegas I\u2019ll take the CinSim King, Hector Nightwine, apart from cravat to spats. I\u2019ll liberate his CinSims and set up shop for my own show.\u201d I sounded like the Cowardly Lion on a tear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your definition of a bastard?\u201d Tallgrass asked.</p><p>\u201cYou try to use him because he\u2019s such a slimeball and find out he\u2019s used you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said. \u201cI know a few of those. In fact, one such creep may have used the local man behind Wichita\u2019s costly side trip to theme-park Oz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like your local investigations on my behalf have borne unexpected fruit for your concerns,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>Tallgrass\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cUnderhanded dealings thrive where big money is involved. Sometimes too close to home. How about we soak the fuse on this particular would-be entrepreneur\u2019s dynamite show concept in cold water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMi hijo is a man of endurance and integrity. I am the long-tried soul of patience and power. Your dog is a creature of two times and one spirit. Your former city and talents are the intersection for us all, Delilah Street. Shall we go see what we can kick in the area of big crooked butt?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>HONEST TO GOD, when you opened the glass doors to enter Emerald City\u2019s first-floor, business-operation office, your toes encountered a yellow brick road painted on the recycled glass floor tile.</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d Ric said, tight-lipped and suspicious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a homegrown operation,\u201d Tallgrass noted, \u201cbut don\u2019t kid yourself. Millions are at stake here. Ben has been nervous as hell about the final costs, so nervous that he spilled something to me about \u2018outside pressures\u2019 on the project.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass flicked me a stern look.</p> <p>\u201cSo you and your oversize Toto here give us Kansas rubes a break, Miss Ex-reporter. Just because we\u2019re \u2018country\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean major crime isn\u2019t trying to mop up the cornfields with us. I think Ben is finally scared enough to let us in on what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, glad I was wearing my serious navy suit and pumps and not checked gingham, pigtails, and ankle socks.</p><p>I started down the yellow brick road. Quicksilver sniffed and studiously avoided putting one furry foot down on the design.</p><p>A small sign outside the main office read WICKED WITCHES NEED NOT APPLY.</p><p>Tallgrass knocked, and then entered, the three of us following. A plump receptionist with long, skinny fingernails nodded Tallgrass through to the inner office.</p> <p>The place was unadorned business vanilla, not trying to broadcast the usual developer ego.</p><p>The man behind the desk jumped up to greet us. \u201cLeonard Tallgrass, you old Cayuse! You see what a mighty fine hot spot on the prairie we\u2019ve raised here? Way bigger than barns. All we need to install is a few more showstopping features and this hotel-casino is gonna make Wichita and Wicked Wild West the new destination vacation.\u201d</p><p>He stepped around the desk. \u201cThese are your FBI friends, with a K-9 dog, yet? Don\u2019t think we need that, but you never know. Sit down, folks.\u201d</p><p>You had to like Ben Hassard. He ran close to three hundred pounds. He wore his Sears white dress-shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows and his tie knot down toward the first flush of curly gray hairs on his chest.</p><p>\u201cPardon my informal air, folks. I\u2019ve just finished some scary negotiations with a big shot from Vegas. Very showy fella. I woulda sworn he was going to sweat deal-killing concessions outa me, but I bought him off with a taste of Emerald City hospitality, a sweet bit of luck, and a bottle of Old Crow.\u201d</p><p>He came around the desk for introductory handshakes with Tallgrass\u2019s crew.</p> <p>\u201cRic, eh. Nice suit for an FBI type. Almost as good as that Vegas bigwig\u2019s. Miss Street. Glad Tallgrass brought some class along.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then held out a hand to Quicksilver.</p><p>Quicksilver didn\u2019t do doggy tricks. I held my breath as Quick\u2019s intelligent, almost-human blue eyes studied the plump, lined palm, then looked in Ben\u2019s eyes. He slapped a clawed paw into the hand. Ben had the sense to give it one, firm shake and retreat behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cOld Crow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tallgrass nodded, so Ben pulled four water-spotted lowball glasses and a half-empty bottle of whiskey from a desk drawer. I couldn\u2019t imagine which \u201cVegas bigwig\u201d would negotiate in person in these modest circumstances. Or for what. Except maybe Hector.</p><p>\u201cYou seem in a better mood, Ben,\u201d Tallgrass noted, sipping the amber alcohol.</p><p>\u201cYup. Drink up. I got the special features Emerald City needed to open. At an unbelievably good price, which is lucky, because construction overrun costs were killing me and the backers. Really, I kinda think I took the guy, Las Vegas or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of construction overruns, Mr. Hassard?\u201d Ric asked, setting down his homely glass after a polite sip.</p> <p>\u201cOh, the usual.\u201d He waved away Ric\u2019s question to eye Tallgrass. \u201cLeonard, I overreacted on the phone with you earlier. Things aren\u2019t that bad. We just have to open fast to start recouping investment, and now the last, best pieces are in place. Wanta see?\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass sat there with his black pupils lost in his most skeptical scout squint, but Ben pressed a button on his desktop intercom.</p><p>\u201cGeraldine, send in the CinSims.\u201d He winked at us. \u201cWe never had any of these in Kansas before. This is the jackpot, trust me. Fresh from the download.\u201d</p><p>Mystified, Ric and I exchanged a glance. I deigned to drink some cheap whiskey neat. Ugh. Tepid, strong as rubbing alcohol, and throat-stinging. I\u2019d never met a spirit that needed a cocktail recipe more.</p><p>Let\u2019s see ... we were at Emerald City. How about ... an Old Scarecrow Old-fashioned?</p><p>Quicksilver\u2019s claws scrambled as he rushed to his feet behind me.</p><p>I heard what sounded like a high-pitched crosscut saw belaboring a twig. Quick growled warning.</p><p>I turned to see a small creature with enough spiked hair to serve as a toupee for a male American Idol contestant dance down the middle of the painted yellow brick road into the office. I bent to pat the dog.</p><p>\u201cToto,\u201d a light, worried voice called, \u201cstay away from that witch!\u201d</p><p>I straightened and jumped back just as a sextet of black-and-white CinSims trouped in, fresh from the film and the farm. I knew them instantly, even though they were bathed in a soft yellow light.</p><p>The original black-and-white film of the movie\u2019s prologue was later \u201ccolored\u201d to make it sepia-toned. That was a \u201cfan fact\u201d most people wouldn\u2019t know. Only characters filmed on the silver nitrate of black-and-white film could be bonded with zombie bodies to create the signature Vegas Cinema Simulacrums, familiarly known as CinSims. So Ben\u2019s Vegas CinSim-supplying bigwig was a vintage film expert. Who? Smelling more and more like Hector.</p><p>I must say my hackles rose to match Quicksilver\u2019s. Was nothing sacred from exploitation, even the sepia-colored prologue to The Wizard of Oz?</p><p>Dorothy Gale, with her earnest face and curled\u2014not braided\u2014pigtails, was still calling her little terrier, but frowning at someone behind me.</p><p>I turned, and nearly jumped out of my plaits and navy pumps to see the scowling Almira Gulch, as thin and mean as a barbed-wire hangman\u2019s noose, chasing the agile little dog around my intervening body.</p><p>I bent to scoop up Toto, so the dog could \u201carf\u201d and snap at the squinty-eyed woman\u2019s face. Like my own Achilles, Toto was a spot-on judge of character.</p><p>Dorothy\u2019s Auntie Em, sweet and worried, came up behind her niece, along with kindly Uncle Henry and the trio of fedora-hatted oddball farmworkers, Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke.</p><p>Oh, had the descriptive connotations of the word \u201chunk\u201d changed since 1939. The prologue\u2019s Hunk became the sweet-natured but weak-kneed Scarecrow searching for a brain in Oz. The carnival huckster who\u2019d doubled as the wizard himself, Professor Marvel, brought up the rear.</p><p>\u201cLook at them CinSims go!\u201d Ben Hassard crowed. \u201cI feel like the brave little tailor. \u2018Eight at one blow.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly handed a warm, soft, wriggling Toto back to Dorothy Gale, a bit unnerved. I\u2019d never seriously touched a CinSim, and couldn\u2019t believe they felt so ... lifelike.</p><p>Ric and Tallgrass edged nearer to inspect the flock of CinSims while Almira Gulch kept a vindictive eye on Toto in Dorothy\u2019s arms and Quicksilver shadowed her every move.</p><p>These CinSims reminded me of Ric\u2019s Zobos, disoriented and not in touch with their surroundings, interacting only with themselves. They hadn\u2019t had enough exposure to the paying public yet. The Vegas CinSims I knew were firmly themselves and adapted to their fates. These newly hatched celluloid \u201cchicks\u201d made me feel sorry for them ... except for Almira Gulch.</p><p>I slipped back to Hassard\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to build a special attraction around them, like the MGM Grand did before it dumped the Oz theme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what those Las Vegas hotels did. All I know is I got these very Kansas characters in exchange for one old movie just found in the restored Augusta film palace basement down the road.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cVegas moguls. One night in the penthouse suite and he was all hot to deal. I do have some classy \u2018amenities\u2019 in that suite.\u201d He winked. \u201cAnd awomenities too.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back, hoping Hassard wasn\u2019t referring to imported party girls.</p><p>It was becoming clear who the visiting Vegas bigwig was, and the thought of Hector Nightwine cavorting with hired heartland hostesses was too ugly to bear.</p><p>I could see him parting with the Oz CinSims. They were far too homey and wholesome for the producer of the CSI V forensics TV franchise. I wondered what he\u2019d got in exchange. Some notorious X-rated early foreign film, no doubt, like Hedy Lamarr\u2019s Ecstasy with the first feature-film nude scene. Hector mentioned she and Dorothy Lamour had been guests at the Enchanted Cottage decades ago.</p><p>That reminded me that Howard Hughes in his heyday had dated both of those black-and-white film bombshells and he\u2019d be chasing after classic girlie movies too.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hassard was saying in answer to my question. I can\u2019t afford to put all my eggs in one basket. I\u2019m going to let these CinSims make themselves at home throughout the hotel-casino. That way, customers will keep running into them in different areas and think we\u2019ve got more than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might keep Almira Gulch microchipped and confined to one location,\u201d I suggested. \u201cShe is the villain of the piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old gal in the battle-axe hat?\u201d Hassard squinted her way and was met with a withering stare. \u201cI see what you\u2019re getting at. Yeah. Maybe I\u2019ll station her at a casino cashier\u2019s cage. She\u2019s ugly enough to scare folks off from bothering to collect their winnings. I\u2019ll have my tech person handle that in the morning. Meanwhile ...\u201d</p><p>Hassard stepped up to the milling group. \u201cOkay, you CinSim people. I need you to scatter throughout the building. Check it out. Find some casino spots that appeal to you. And you, miss. Yes, the girl in the checked jumper. Make sure to get your little dog outside for enough \u2018walks,\u2019 if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>For the first time I considered the embarrassing issue of CinSim elimination. I hoped the zombie element of the combo ruled there, although feral film zombies certainly ... ate.</p><p>\u201cOkay, gang.\u201d Hassard clapped his hands and shooed the CinSims out of his office like a flock of farm chickens, Quicksilver escorting Almira Gulch and giving her a last warning growl.</p><p>Ric, who\u2019d been conferring with Tallgrass all the while the CinSims had offered comic relief, approached Ben and me.</p><p>\u201cOld friend,\u201d Tallgrass said to Hassard. \u201cWe four\u201d\u2014 Quicksilver nosed his hand\u2014\u201cah, five, need to sit and powwow, as they say in the cowboy movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaal, sure,\u201d Ben said. \u201cPull up your chairs again. Here\u2019s one for the little lady.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taller than he, but I accepted the chair Ben Hassard scooted under my navy-skirted rear.</p><p>\u201cAnother round of Old Crow, gentlemen and lady? Big doggy? Maybe you need to walk the dog, Miss Street?\u201d</p><p>Quick and I gave him such a tandem look of disdain that he hastily sat behind the desk and began pouring more of the Old Crow into glasses.</p><p>\u201cNone for me,\u201d I said, fanning my fingers over the glass. Ric followed suit, but Tallgrass nodded, then drank it all in one go.</p><p>\u201cBen, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gotta have a frank talk here.\u201d</p><p>Ben gulped from his glass, and then added Ric\u2019s and my portions to what was left.</p><p>\u201cYou saw it, Tallgrass,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the final piece of the hotel-casino in place. Those silly CinSims haven\u2019t their like in a thousand-mile circumference. I know they\u2019re kinda corny, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorny?\u201d I exploded. \u201cYou have an iconic CinSim coup here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, miss. Of course I know that. I just don\u2019t know what to do with them. Yet. The tribal casinos have been hit harder than Las Vegas with this Millennium Revelation thing and the economic crash. I got a lot of Indian money riding on this. Not your Native American charity stuff. This is our investment for the new century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe see that,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cThis is a major and impressive construction, Ben. And it\u2019s Kansas grown and bred. But you haven\u2019t been honest with us, and that\u2019s a bad start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d Beads of sweat appeared on Ben\u2019s brow as if dowsed up by an invisible crown of thorns. \u201cTallgrass, you\u2019re the consortium\u2019s ally. If you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsortium, Ben?\u201d Tallgrass sounded angrier than I\u2019d ever like to confront. \u201cYou had the dream and the tribes gave you the money. Now we want an accounting. Who\u2019s been blackmailing you and who have you paid off and how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Ben asked bitterly. \u201cSniffing around with your slick FBI friend and this woman and that dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook the dog in the eyes when you ask that,\u201d Tallgrass said.</p><p>Hey, what about Ric and my totally righteous histories?</p><p>Quicksilver lifted his clawed paws onto the desk edge and thrust his big, fur-aureoled head nose to nose with Hassard.</p><p>Ben Hassard wiped the back of his hand across the sweat streaming down his forehead.</p><p>\u201cEvery contractor pays extra here and there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not to the union, then to what\u2019s left of the mob or to meet some government regulation a crooked congressman put in for his local lobbyist. We know that. That\u2019s the way things run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the Indian way,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cWe dealt with honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor was a European myth and our stupidity, Tallgrass. You know that. I had to pay off some people. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Ric and I exchanged a glance. We were the \u201cWhite Eyes\u201d in an old argument.</p><p>I realized it was best we keep our mouths shut and our ears open. Quicksilver and his wolfish heritage had more cred here than we did. We could say the Irish and the Mexicans had as many bones to pick with history as Native Americans, including genocide, but this was not our personal risk or our showdown.</p><p>\u201cWho did you pay off?\u201d Tallgrass wasn\u2019t leaving here without an answer.</p><p>Hassard just looked scared.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said.</p><p>Both men glared at me. Ric shook his head slightly, warning me to back off. This was an all-male, all Native American powwow.</p><p>Quicksilver pulled his paws from the desk to my knees and regarded me intently.</p><p>I wrapped my hands around his collar and went, like Tallgrass, with the dog.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hassard, I filmed something the other day at my old workplace, WTCH-TV.\u201d</p><p>Hassard froze like an ice sculpture. For some reason, that TV station was not only familiar, but an object of fear.</p><p>\u201cLet me dig out my phone. Ric, while you, Tallgrass, and Quicksilver were off on rural investigations, I was delving into my history here in Wichita ... which included this bitchy local weather witch, Sheena Coleman and ... the station\u2019s vampire anchorman I call Undead Ted.\u201d</p><p>By then I\u2019d got the film on-screen. The familiar had become a wrist bangle etched with an Egyptian Eye of Horus symbol, all the better to peek.</p><p>\u201cA contact of mine at the station downloaded some ... personal film to me, including the footage we got at the first cow mutilation site a few months ago. Before I left, I filmed Sheena and Ted returning from what looked like a payoff lunch meeting. They were chauffeured with a likely suspect, aka an ugly customer. I\u2019ve never seen, not even since the Millennium Revelation, a man who walked more like a snake. Anybody recognize Mr. Rattlesnake-skin Briefcase?\u201d</p><p>I ran the first part of the sequence by Ric and Tallgrass and, finally, Hassard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Hassard finally admitted. \u201cThat blasted local TV weather witch has been hitting our construction site with out-of-season rainstorms and hail and threatening lightning strikes to bring the entire structure down unless we pay up big. We\u2019re at the breaking point, Tallgrass. I don\u2019t dare stop paying or all the tribes\u2019 money is kaput.\u201d</p><p>He put his head in his hands and shook it. \u201cWe\u2019re so close to launch time and to EC making enough to get these blackmailers off our back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get blackmailers off your back unless you become the worst bucking bronco around,\u201d Tallgrass said.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s the money man,\u201d I said.</p><p>Tallgrass and Hassard shook their heads at the paused scene.</p><p>Ric got my phone screen last and stared in silence. He kept so uncharacteristically still I began to feel like I\u2019d goofed.</p><p>\u201cI should have uploaded this to all your cell phones right away,\u201d I said. \u201cI was distracted by Sheena\u2019s parting weather volleys and ... visiting some sentimental spots in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what\u2019s bothering me,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>He licked his lips, maybe nervous or maybe getting ready to confess.</p><p>\u201cI recognize the man with the money. The less he\u2019s on our radar the better for us. He might have some way of tracking his presence on neighborhood networks, and he\u2019s the kind of bastard you really need to get the jump on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRic?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked me hard in the eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the drug cartel kingpin, El Demonio. Torbellino is his surname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scumball kidnapper and zombie smuggler from years ago in Mexico? A kingpin now? Here in Kansas? Why? No ... it can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I\u2019d ever forget his inhuman face, Delilah? If El Demonio has expanded his foul drug smuggling and zombie-running operations from the crime cesspool of the border up into Kansas heartland, where he\u2019s allied with weather witches, we have to grab the chance to take him and his cartel down before the whole country is fouled.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018We\u2019?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cWithout backup or state troopers or the Reserves? He must have a ton of really fast zombies, not to mention his usual crime-lord army of gunmen.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass objected in his low-key way. \u201cWe must find Torbellino\u2019s base of operations first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the bastard\u2019s stink before,\u201d Ric said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start tracking at the WTCH-TV parking lot. When El Demonio made the mistake of setting shoe sole on asphalt, he made himself Quicksilver meat.\u201d</p><p>Quick had already leaped up to view the film. Now he was lunging for the office exit, ready to track and tackle.</p><p>\u201cDelilah.\u201d Ric turned to me. \u201cStay with Ben in case he gets fresh contact from the blackmailers.\u201d</p><p>I was about to object to being left out of the track-down my minifilm had made possible, but I knew I\u2019d blown it by regarding Sheena and Ted\u2019s unsavory connections as part of my personal history instead of something bigger.</p><p>So I nodded.</p><p>Ben lifted the Old Crow bottle to me with a questioning look as a peace offering. We\u2019d both failed to recognize and report something important to our best friends.</p><p>I watched Quicksilver\u2019s thick, plumy tail flash out the office door, Tallgrass and Ric right behind him.</p><p>After a moment of mentally bemoaning being left behind, I pulled my chair up to the desk just as Ben, his hand shaking, poured amber whiskey into the water-spotted glass that had been mine.</p><p>\u201cMiss Street prefers a smoother and costlier blend of poison,\u201d a beautifully resonant but all too recognizable voice said behind me.</p><p>My silver familiar turned tail and slipped down my clothes to wrap itself around my right upper thigh like a garter as I gulped down two fingers of Old Crow straight anyway.</p><p>Then I turned to confront the unexpected newcomer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>BEN HASSARD WAS on his feet, nodding and bowing like a bobble-headed doll.</p><p>\u201cI hope you continue to enjoy the accommodations, Mr. Christopher,\u201d he told the white man in white, \u201cand that our ... discussions down here didn\u2019t disturb you in the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour CinSims fanning through the hotel disturbed me. You do understand that the farmyard chickens and pigs and horses are part of the package, as well as Miss Gulch\u2019s bicycle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses and pigs and chickens? Oh, my.\u201d Ben cast me a helpless look. \u201cMiss Street was right. I\u2019ll need some sort of unifying attraction ... perhaps around a theme of Kansas, the Barnyard State.\u201d</p> <p>Their byplay gave me mental time to insert Vegas\u2019s one and only albino rock star into this place and time and enterprise. I wasn\u2019t surprised that Hassard hadn\u2019t recognized the stage persona of Cocaine, lead singer of the Seven Deadly Sins rock group. Snow in white-suit civvies looked like a taller, younger, sexier ... oh, Mark Twain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Vegas bigwig who\u2019s been so generous with CinSims leases?\u201d I asked, none too smoothly.</p><p>Shock does that to even a professional objective observer, and I was in no way objective about Snow.</p><p>His Western-style suit was not that different from the white Italian designer ones he wore offstage, but his river-boat gambler hat seemed so like the ghost of El Demonio\u2019s black one it gave me shivers. Snow\u2019s long white hair was tied back into a very pass\u00e9 mob-style ponytail that suddenly looked back again, big-time. And, of course, he wore the eternal dark sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cMe, generous?\u201d he replied.</p> <p>I could tell his hidden eyes were taking in my plain navy suit. Some men\u2019s looks could be said to undress a woman. His summation seemed to be burying my outfit under a chador.</p><p>\u201cHardly generous,\u201d Snow addressed me again. \u201cThis was a business deal. Ben and I are both well satisfied, and now I have the unexpected bonus of ... requisitioning Miss Street\u2019s presence in my suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Ben said. \u201cMiss Street is not a potential, er, hostess, Mr. Christopher. Her presence is not a matter of acquisition. In a month, Emerald City will be fully staffed instead of running with a skeleton crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Christopher,\u201d I put in, mispronouncing his name with glee, \u201cknows perfectly well, from long experience, that I am not biddable. Is there a reason why I should accompany you upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe view,\u201d Snow said, drawing it out like a slow sip of an Albino Vampire cocktail, \u201cis spectacular.\u201d</p><p>And ... I\u2019d get some private time to pump him on the what, how, and why of his astounding personal visit to the hinterlands.</p> <p>I thanked Mr. Hassard, gave him my cell phone number, and asked him to alert me instantly if \u201cmy party\u201d returned.</p><p>Snow waited beside the door the CinSims had just trooped through on a yellow brick road.</p><p>THE EMERALD CITY offered green glass elevators that shot riders atop each of the needle towers through an aquatic funnel of green gelatin, with a laser show of chartreuse lights lancing the emerald haze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only here for the ride and the view,\u201d I mentioned.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why do you care about any impression a sleazy operator like Ben Hassard has of you?\u201d</p><p>Nah, we get a classy operator, Irma noted, happy to back me up with the Big Bad Wolf. She loved these settos of ours. That riverboat gambler suit fits Snow\u2019s frame just a tad looser than his rock show catsuit ... and did you catch those albino ostrich-skin cowboy boots with the ebony heels and platinum ankle chains? If I could get me a pair I would die right here and happily go to Hell.</p><p>Snow did resemble the quintessential Western dude, down to the white string tie with a platinum longhorn skull slide. I\u2019m sure he impressed the local yokels no end.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about me,\u201d I told Snow. \u201cIt\u2019s about the truth. Why did you wait to make your appearance until Ric and Leonard Tallgrass left? Did you want to separate me from them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust cutting you out from the common crime-chasing herd. You\u2019re a devout Our Lady of the Lake graduate, I hear. I wanted to show you the Holy Grail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe the cup Christ sipped from at the Last Supper still exists in this world, somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, but that\u2019s not my obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be pleased that I\u2019m going to ... satisfy what is your obsession.\u201d</p><p>Now that was a veiled threat if I\u2019d ever heard one.</p><p>APPARENTLY PROGRAMMED, OUR elevator had reached the top. The faceted emerald doors split open on another vista so green it seemed to be underwater.</p><p>Gosh, Irma whispered. We\u2019ve got a few of those obsession thingies. Wonder which one our sexy host is so bound and determined to cater to? He does owe you at least a spanking for transferring the physical pain and marks of Ric\u2019s bullwhipped childhood slavery to his own truly porcelain albino body. I\u2019ll watch.</p><p>Shut up, I told Irma. I was already jumpy, knowing we were dealing here with Christophe, the billionaire casino king. I was all too aware of his slick Oklahoma oilman wardrobe and the draw of the white silken shirt and suit jacket across the Snow-white skin of his back with every move. Yet he seemed all business, all entrepreneur now. Nothing of the raunchy rock star remained. And certainly nothing of the victim of a paranormal pain transfer.</p><p>The room beyond the private elevator sported a sprawling conversation pit upholstered in so many shades of green velvet I thought I was in mossy Ireland. I noted that the suite had his and her powder rooms off the entry hall, like the layout at werewolf warlord Cesar Cicereau\u2019s Gehenna Hotel penthouse. Effete Vegas luxuries were infecting even Wichita.</p><p>Snow went ahead into the massive main room to open the verdigris-lacquered doors of a green-mirror-backed bar.</p><p>\u201cI have absinthe and Albino Vampires and cr\u00e8me de menthe cocktails,\u201d he offered. \u201cAny preference?\u201d</p><p>I stared at a trio of green glass bottles. \u201cWait a minute. You\u2019ve bottled my Albino Vampire recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust add the vodka of your choice, from Grey Goose to lighter fluid. Much more economical than by the martini glass at the Inferno Bar. And of course, also much more profitable to me in the larger mass market.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m stunned that I\u2019m allowed into this temple of greed wearing just my plain navy interview suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. You\u2019re quite right. I\u2019m violating the hospitality of the Emerald City Hotel and Casino. I should have directed you to the suite Green Room first thing. It\u2019s a must for every occupant. You do want to taste what this theme-park gambling joint will offer the paying customers?\u201d</p><p>He gestured to a pair of zebrawood doors striped in pale and vivid green.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the absinthe,\u201d I said over my shoulder, stepping through.</p><p>Whoa. I was in some kind of New Age subway tunnel, with nowhere to go but forward.</p><p>The setup, despite its relentless laser-green glow, immediately reminded me of the detoxifying entrance tunnel to germ-phobic Howard Hughes\u2019s 1001 Knights getaway on the low-rent end of the Strip.</p><p>Green laser lights buzzed and swiveled as they rose and fell on either side of me, etching my form as if I were a jigsaw puzzle piece. I walked through an emerald-green mist, feeling warm and then cool. Unseen air vents lifted my heavy plaits to writhe and untwine around my face and shoulders like Medusa\u2019s serpents\u2014not Kelly green, I hoped.</p><p>I came though the opposite doors feeling I\u2019d enjoyed a steam room, sauna, and massage. In fact, I felt absolutely wonderful.</p><p>Snow was waiting with two tall, thin glasses of opaque, chartreuse-tinted absinthe. The drink had been a nineteenth-century fad with a bad rep because an herbal ingredient called wormwood had a marijuana-like effect.</p><p>\u201c\u2018A great star fell from Heaven,\u2019\u201d he recited as he handed me one glass, \u201c\u2018burning like a torch, and ... the name of the star is wormwood.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018And Kansas, she said, is the name of the star,\u2019\u201d I sang like the Good Witch Glinda.</p><p>If Snow wanted to quote the Book of Revelation to an Our Lady of the Lake girl, I could quote The Wizard of Oz right back.</p><p>\u201cNice pipes,\u201d he said, the sunglasses dipping to eye my legs.</p><p>I was shocked to view a thigh-high slit in a long green satin skirt that showcased the familiar as a silver \u201cgarter\u201d snake.</p><p>\u201cPassing through the Green Room has a stunning effect, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Snow commented. \u201cLike going through a glamorizing car wash for humans. They call it the \u2018Emerald City Dorothy spa option.\u2019 The lasers take your measurements and melt off your everyday wear, \u2018painting\u2019 the bedazzled client with more formal clothes. I see the females get a gown fit for a movie queen, so the obsessed gambler has his lady distracted from the moment they enter their suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the gaming man only gets a fistful of green casino cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. They offer a spa experience for gentlemen clients too.\u201d He held out his suited arms. \u201cThey need the money man relaxed and ready to rock and roll the dice and roulette wheel all night long. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d dress like a riverboat gambler on purpose? My only ... successful resistance to the process was to reject the bilious green color.\u201d He eyed me from top to toe. \u201cWell, you are black Irish, and the plaits didn\u2019t suit you as well as having your hair loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate wearing green,\u201d I muttered to dismiss his compliment.</p><p>Green was for jigging, red-haired, freckled Irish lassies, not a dark and deep depressive diva like me. Okay, I dramatize. Shut up, Irma.</p><p>However, I was determined to avoid any and all of the green mirrors in the suite in case they skewed my mirror affinity, so I found his comments a mystery, except for the hair, which I\u2019d felt unwinding. He led me through another set of doors, and down a dim aisle of shallow stairs.</p><p>A giant movie screen faced us, but it was matte black and mirrored nothing.</p><p>Looking around, I spotted glassy green reflections bouncing from multiple surfaces, all too fractured to add up to a mirror. That was comforting. I didn\u2019t want to display any mirror-walking tricks in front of Snow.</p><p>I could only glimpse a tiny reflection of myself in his sunglasses\u2019 lenses. Although my hair was still black, I was wrapped in shiny shades of green, like a Christmas present.</p><p>\u201cIf I were a talking mirror,\u201d Snow said, the sunglasses moving up and down me like the laser lights, \u201cI could report that you\u2019d whip that slinky green vintage gown you\u2019re wearing off a black-and-white movie screen in a Wichita minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s green, I doubt it. The latest antiterrorist technology and clothes manufacturing trends could account for much of the makeover wizardry,\u201d I speculated. \u201cNothing was that \u2018magical.\u2019 The laser measurements. The melting outer garments. Even the clothes spun like webs onto living mannequin forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Snow said. \u201cMillennium Revelations may come and go, but if you sell entertainment to the public, you always have to have a gimmick.\u201d</p><p>He led me down the plush-carpeted stairs to a row of pistachio-colored leather theater seats. I noticed that my navy pumps were as plain and simple as ever, but now dyed teal-green. I wondered how my blue eyes had fared in the Emerald Tunnel.</p><p>Snow continued playing tour guide.</p><p>\u201cYou must be dying to know what I\u2019m doing here. Please sit, Delilah, and prepare to observe the wonder of the century.\u201d</p><p>I placed my long-stemmed glass in the chair\u2019s builtin beverage holder and arranged myself. My satin gown seemed to be made of green linguini, it draped so easily over me and the chair, but when I leaned back I felt a chill. The leather was room temperature and cool. My back was bare from tailbone up as the leather accepted the pressure of my skin. My naturally pale, unblemished skin.</p><p>If I\u2019d been asked to lie on a reclining chair of thorns I couldn\u2019t have been more pained.</p><p>Seeing Snow again had focused my mind on the whip strikes I\u2019d transferred to him from Ric. Were they still raw? In an ordinary human being, they surely would be.</p><p>No matter how luxe and silken the surroundings, that unspoken fear rubbed my expectations raw. The cushy ambiance prickled me all the more as I pictured that supernaturally white skin beneath the silk shirt festered and scabbing and feverish, no matter how much Snow always mastered cool.</p><p>Or ... not. That was the bed of nails he had me on, constructed from my too-vivid imagination and my guilt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re here,\u201d I blurted.</p><p>He\u2019d taken his own chair, sitting forward as taller men will, leaning his forearms on his knees, pure white hands loosely laced together, not putting his back flat against the leather back. Was he trying to make me think the worst?</p><p>A reporter knows only to push. I eyed my wristwatch, squinting at a hard-to-read greenish abalone-shell dial now encrusted with green garnets. I assumed emeralds would not be bestowed on the wives of even gambling whales.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d I asked, \u201cis Vegas impresario Christophe doing at a remote casino operation like Emerald City in Wichita? Not even you can jet back to Vegas in time for your seven p.m. show,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cUnless you have dragon wings.\u201d</p><p>His pale lips split in a smile that revealed yet whiter teeth. \u201cCan you have caught me out in a trade secret, Delilah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shape-shifting dragon?\u201d</p><p>I dearly hoped so. That would make him a major new supernatural on the Millennium Revelation map and way too inhuman\u2014and huge\u2014for me to worry about having hurt.</p><p>That was the crazy part. I was worried I\u2019d hurt the impervious Snow when he probably had the power to destroy me six times over with a wave of his little finger. I looked closely. That milk-white digit now flaunted a peridot-set green-gold ring.</p><p>Apparently he hadn\u2019t escaped the Emerald City Green Room\u2019s do-over as thoroughly as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Snow set his white riverboat gambler\u2019s hat on the empty chair seat next to him. He tilted back his profile and throat and ran his fingers through his tied-back hair, releasing it to his shoulders, smiling at the blank screen straight ahead.</p><p>I charged ahead. \u201cYou can\u2019t convince me you\u2019d be interested in investing in some over-the-rainbow casino property in Wichita, Kansas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I am.\u201d He finally sat back and directed the sunglasses\u2019 blind gaze my way. \u201cAnd, since you\u2019ve turned up at this opportune moment, I\u2019m here to show you a movie.\u201d</p><p>What is it with these guys? Irma crabbed. First Ric and now Snow. We\u2019re lounging around here like blond bombshell Jean Harlow and Mr. Rock Star Hottie wants to watch a movie with us? Your chances of even copping us another hickey here are zero, baby.</p><p>I sipped the slightly bitter taste of green anise in the absinthe, glad Irma was right. This was a rare retro moment in La-la Land. Private screening. Major Red Carpet slinky gown. Retro cocktail. I glanced again at Snow. Irma was right again. That bleached Southern Comfort, Rhett Butler outfit didn\u2019t do him a disservice.</p><p>Tomorrow is another day, baby, I told Irma.</p><p>Then \u201cRhett\u201d hit the twentieth century\u2019s greatest contribution to humanity, the remote control. The minute he did, reels of a silent black-and-white film began flickering on the screen, and my pulse started doing the jitterbug.</p><p>I sat forward, no longer worried about exposing my uneasily naked back to Snow, Rhett, or whoever. The scenes and figures I watched were pretty jitterbuggy too. That\u2019s the way silent films were seen in the early days, like 1927, in that herky-jerky motion.</p><p>Immediately, I recognized the astonishing, luminous images of an imagined ultramodern city combining the space opera scenery of Flash Gordon with the despair of a union movement for robotic workers.</p><p>Some would say this was the most classic film ever done by the German expressionist director, Fritz Lang. The studio and censors had hacked the film apart even before it was exported to the larger world. The Nazis would embrace the mechanized super-city as their own, making Lang loathe the product of his own genius. No complete authorized edition existed to this day. A rumored one found a few years ago in Rio had proved fraudulent.</p><p>\u201cSnow,\u201d I breathed, \u201cwhat do you have here? Not the complete lost footage? That would be ... priceless.\u201d</p><p>His sunglassed gaze remained fixed on the screen. \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 for nothing. Yes. Somehow the foot of the Oz rainbow pointed to the archives of a restored Wichita-area Art Deco movie palace, the Augusta, and this lost, rare, impossible footage. That\u2019s what I want here. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll take back to the Inferno Hotel, an entire new wing built around this vintage futuristic vision. I\u2019ll call it the New Metropolis Towers and Condominiums and maybe, if you treat me right, you\u2019ll have visiting privileges.\u201d</p><p>I was so freaking sold. \u201cImagine guests living in this vintage film city of the future. So the subterranean Nine Circles of Hell aren\u2019t playground enough for you? You\u2019re reconstructing the film world\u2019s Art Deco Tower of Babel in Vegas? You realize those biblical Babel builders blasphemed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize,\u201d Snow said, \u201cthat \u2018blaspheme\u2019 is a pretty archaic concept? Especially in Vegas? Just tune in to your film fanatic mode, Delilah. I must say having you sitting here in that seriously anti-Code evening gown much enhances my viewing pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would wear a green clown suit for the privilege of seeing Metropolis uncut.\u201d</p><p>Snow chuckled, returning his hidden gaze from the screen. \u201cI knew you\u2019d appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to overstate how rare this film was. The Holy Grail of vintage films indeed. Remembering it was twelve years from the grim but luminous black-and-white futuristic robotic fable of Metropolis to the hypercolorized, deceptively happy fable of The Wizard of Oz shows how fast the art of film developed\u2014by leaps and bounds\u2014and so had its audience.</p><p>I rapidly scanned my all-things-vintage memory bank.</p><p>Metropolis was a dark antitechnology tale of Maria, a sweet, loving girl who became the movie\u2019s model for the ultimate roboticized worker-drone. The \u201cmanufactured\u201d robot queen bee built on Maria in Metropolis had inspired George Lucas to create the shiny gold C-3PO robot in the Star Wars film saga, but a more recent descendent was Seven of Nine, that sexy mechanical Borg female \u201cconstruct\u201d of nineties Star Trek television.</p><p>Now I stared at the moments of heroine Maria\u2019s on-screen re-creation, a human woman being made into a silver-metal superwoman, perhaps the most powerful image of feminine power since the Neolithic fertility goddesses. Only this dame wore body armor.</p><p>She stood on platform soles of solid metal. She packed it at the hips like a gunslinger, and don\u2019t we all, a little? I was reminded of the secondhand cop duty belt I wore for action expeditions. Her metal-gloved hands curved out from the sides of her thighs. Like a gunslinger\u2019s.</p><p>Her torso was covered by a stiff metal \u201cstomacher\u201d bodice Queen Elizabeth I (no monarch to mess with anywhere, anytime) would wear.</p><p>Her breastplate was topped off by steel cannonballs, size 36C. Her shoulders stood up high and rounded too, and her neck sinews combined something of the swan with something of the suspension bridge.</p><p>Her face was sculpted in perfect symmetry, but blank of eye, taut of lip, and dominated by a nose that soared into a delicate pillar to the top of her head, which wore a smooth metal bonnet. She looked like she\u2019d never had a bad hair day, having no visible hair. She also looked like she could kick Alien ass or take down Billy the Kid. Or both at the same time. She was eternal. And she was awesome.</p><p>So was the visionary film world that had created her.</p><p>I watched, mesmerized, aware that Snow alone had the chutzpah to reconstruct this vanished apocalyptic vision of Metropolis in Las Vegas. Of course, in the film, the robotic superwoman had been destroyed. That would not happen again, from the rapt way Snow\u2019s sunglasses fixed on the screen. She would escape pre-WWII Germany and get her full second round in post\u2013Millennium Revelation Las Vegas.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you showing this to me?\u201d I asked, hardly noticing the time until the 153-minute film had burst like a bubble on the dark screen and vanished. But my absinthe glass was empty.</p><p>\u201cYou always want answers, Delilah Street,\u201d Snow said, stretching out his white ostrich-skin boots and lacing his hands behind his neck in a way that showcased his long, dramatic frame. \u201cThe mysteries Wichita holds for you are far more serious than my being here. But ... the film I\u2019ve just acquired is a lost treasure few would appreciate. I simply wanted to show it to somebody.\u201d</p><p>Unsaid was the fact he wanted to show it to somebody who understood what a rarity it was, that he needed my mind and companionship. For an instant, I actually felt sorry for him. It must be lonely at the pinnacle.</p><p>And then I got one of my intuitive glimmers. \u201cHow did you find this here in Wichita? Through the Augusta Theater restoration, but only you knew what it was, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His long, white, lazy fingers reached out to touch the silver bracelet I hadn\u2019t realized had made a green circle of thorns on my wrist. The familiar morphed again into a green-enameled silver garter snake, reared a tiny scaled head, and hissed at him.</p><p>He laughed, but withdrew his hand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve hired what the antique dealers call \u2018pickers\u2019 to look for it for decades. The Augusta is a 1935 movie theater on the National Register of Historic Places. It was never a huge urban film palace, but it is pure Art Deco, rather similar to how you\u2019re looking now, Delilah, all green and silver and black, like your sterling serpent. It\u2019s been restored on a shoestring by devoted locals, and no one was more surprised than I to find that an uncut version of Metropolis numbered among their souvenirs. Of course, they had no idea what they had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I told him. \u201cI just didn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d share the find of several lifetimes with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want to know after seeing Metropolis? Come on, Delilah, you can be cheekier than this.\u201d</p><p>I studied my host, an enigma who was as ancient as a same-named medieval Christophe ... as modern and deadly as Cocaine ... as cozy-familiar and icy as Snow.</p><p>I held my breath while Irma bit her tongue. My tongue wasn\u2019t so easy to harness.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you giving the Brimstone Kiss after your shows anymore?\u201d I asked, not having planned to go there.</p><p>He braced his elbows on the theater seat arms and again ran his albino fingers into the hair at his temples as if he had a nagging headache. Me, I hope.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I demanded. \u201cThe fabled Brimstone Kiss was your signature. Did I ... use it up?\u201d</p><p>I was thinking that maybe he ... it had only one life to give ...</p><p>Jeez, that sounded like the title of a long-gone soap opera.</p><p>He turned to face me, the unreadable sunglasses burning like coal into my anxious regard.</p><p>\u201cNothing to do with you, Delilah. Sorry.\u201d A slight smile lifted his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t be tied down to a concert schedule anymore, you see. That\u2019s why I moved the Seven Deadly Sins to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>He stood and opened his arms like a showman, an albino Buffalo Bill doffing his hat and taking a bow. \u201cA CinSim, of course, is doing my show tonight.\u201d</p><p>I stood too.</p><p>\u201cA CinSim of yourself? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimplicity itself.\u201d Snow shot his cuffs, enjoying his Green Room showman\u2019s suit, revealing the new Technicolor emeralds in his white-gold cuff links. \u201cI had myself recorded on vintage black-and-white film, then ordered the CinSim from the Immortality Mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the mob. They fill orders for anything from anyone with the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your ... zombie CinSim can\u2019t bestow the Brimstone Kiss?\u201d I asked to be certain.</p><p>\u201cWhy would it? The Brimstone Kiss is extremely personal.\u201d He moved closer, his voice softer. \u201cHadn\u2019t you noticed? Oh, that\u2019s right. You never got the multiorgasmic effect. You were too busy, as usual, Delilah, detesting the easy O and sacrificing yourself to a Judas kiss to save your own true love. You\u2019re much like Maria, the worker\u2019s champion who was made into the emotionless \u00fcber-robot in Metropolis. You, too, believe \u2018the heart must mediate between the head and the hands.\u2019 But the heart harbors all the seven deadly sins, Delilah. Anger, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Gluttony, Lust. ...\u201d He listed all the members of his Seven Deadly Sins rock band but himself.</p><p>His cool right hand slid around to the small of my back and my entire spine tingled. I was right. It was naked. My back. So was his palm.</p><p>I froze in shock and defense.</p><p>\u201cHave I forgotten one?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPride, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Pride.\u201d He named his own role in the band so softly that I turned my head to hear it even as he stepped closer.</p><p>Pride made me hold my ground.</p><p>By turning my head aside, I\u2019d put us into a perfect tango position, tightly together but facing in opposite directions.</p><p>I tried to insert my hands between us, between his chest and mine, to push him off.</p><p>Who are you kidding, kid? Irma was nattering nervously in my head. This guy\u2019s got the ripped body of that giant white marble statue of David at Caesar\u2019s Palace. That Michelangelo sure knew how to do guys. Wink. Who knew an Old Testament sheep boy could be so hunky? What else here of interest do you think might be giant?</p><p>Shut up, I ordered her. I can\u2019t think.</p><p>That\u2019s the point, baby. ... Irma\u2019s voice faded.</p><p>I really did need to think, to put all sorts of incidents and innuendos in my life together. Item: the lightningstrike scars I\u2019d seen on Snow\u2019s chest in his performance catsuit. Item: the new star-shaped scar on Ric\u2019s neck that so needed my attention.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t just about sex, but life and death, which made sense. Risk. Love. Hate. Hope. I was beginning to put all the mysteries within an enigma together and started to say it aloud, step by step, to Snow, of all people.</p><p>\u201cThe Brimstone Kiss became the Resurrection Kiss in the Hell underneath the Karnak,\u201d I told him, my voice more breathless than I liked, catching the frantic rhythm of Irma\u2019s heated running internal commentary.</p><p>\u201cI was there,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cI warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt became something else in the hotel bridal suite you so ironically donated as Ric\u2019s recovery room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I became your proxy whipping boy, you mean?\u201d</p><p>I wet my lips, nervous and ashamed. I instantly knew the moment he\u2019d seen that gesture of weakness, because he pulled me closer, forcing contact, forcing confession.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you as a whipping boy,\u201d I told him hotly. \u201cI never would have tolerated owing you for that. I was simply healing Ric.\u201d</p><p>My self-defense sounded lame.</p><p>\u201cSo Grizelle reported,\u201d Snow said, \u201cwhen her fury permitted her human speech after it was all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call her off me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to save your revenge for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I just wanted to save you ... for myself.\u201d</p><p>I was not going there. \u201cGrizelle didn\u2019t tell you how I healed Ric?\u201d</p><p>In the extended silence, I saw there was something I knew and he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Finally!</p><p>My hands stopped fighting his custody. Now I knew what buttons to push where. His Brimstone Kiss had affected me and mine beyond belief. For good or ill? I didn\u2019t know yet. Could I return the \u201cfavor\u201d? Did remnants of his Brimstone Kiss still linger on my lips? Was he as vulnerable to me as I was to him? Would he hate that as much as I had? A coward wouldn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how I heal, and in your case, hurt,\u201d I said, feeling breathlessly bold.</p><p>My rogue fingers slipped the middle mother-of-pearl buttons on his shirt open. So easy with silk. Almost an \u201ceasy O.\u201d No big surprise, except I could feel a tiny tremor of shock as my warm fingers touched Snow\u2019s supercool flesh. His or my shock, I didn\u2019t know. Or care.</p><p>I leaned away to\u2014why the hell not?\u2014wrench the shirt open. Snow\u2019s strong hands at my back kept me from over-balancing, accommodating my attack. He would.</p><p>\u201cDelilah, do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked. Softly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Having bared the center of his albino chest, I stared at the lightning bolt scar tissue, shiny and silver, meeting from all four corners of his torso at the breastbone above those abs of stone and below those pecs of marble.</p><p>His white leather performance catsuits cut to the navel flaunted these anti-ink tattoos onstage for all and anyone to see. Who or what had inflicted them. Real lightning? A fire? Torture, even? Fiery torture?</p><p>\u201cA great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch.\u201d He had just quoted an ancient mystic to me. Was the great star not just Cocaine of the Seven Deadly Sins rock band, but a true falling angel? Even Lucifer himself, which means \u201clight\u201d? And the \u201cwormwood\u201d was regret for all that was lost? Heaven exchanged for the Inferno Hotel and the Nine Circles of Dante\u2019s Hell beneath it?</p><p>I knew what I needed to do. I brushed my parted lips over the solid center where the lightning-strike scars met, over his heart, if he had one, and then repeated the gesture with my tongue. It was like licking frost from a steel pole in a Wichita winter\u2014an icy, tingling shock.</p><p>Well, he wasn\u2019t a vampire. That was a dead issue. I felt his heart stumble and then jackrabbit under my palm.</p><p>Did he feel the pleasure effect, though? Or just shock?</p><p>\u201cSecond Circle of Hell, woman,\u201d he muttered, his voice soft but so deep in his chest that my hands sensed its breath-catching vibration.</p><p>Oh, he did feel it. I had what every woman in Vegas and beyond wanted. I had Snow in the palms of my hands.</p><p>My heart was beating pretty wildly by then. Triumph almost felt like erotic excitement. I was the puppet master here.</p><p>I ran my lips and tongue diagonally across his chest from rib to opposite nipple. His audible intake of breath tautened his pec for my attack. His hands were digging into my shoulder blades, pulling me closer.</p><p>That was ballsy, Irma gasped.</p><p>She was right. The scars made a giant X on his torso, but the nipples weren\u2019t part of the zone. I just couldn\u2019t resist payback for how he\u2019d pulled my gown down to my waist so unnecessarily during the Brimstone Kiss.</p><p>This really was rather fun, salving my conscience while driving a sex symbol crazy. Any way you want it ...</p><p>I opened the one button on his blazer and unclasped some way-too-Texan silver belt buckle courtesy of the Emerald City makeover attraction.</p><p>I was expecting his knees to buckle at any moment, but no such luck.</p><p>\u201cPleasure,\u201d I pointed out rather redundantly, \u201cfor pain. I can offer it in equal parts. Have I made up for one whiplash yet?\u201d</p><p>He was breathing hard, but still able to speak. \u201cOh, Delilah,\u201d he said putting his mouth on the hair covering my ear. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d be crazy enough to let you cut my hair, or tell you that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard that rumble with my cheek and ear pressed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like this onstage?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike they\u2019re all in the palm of your hand?\u201d</p><p>His soft laughter stopped when I applied my tongue again and ran it down to his navel.</p><p>\u201cHow far do these lightning scars go?\u201d I asked, parting the zipper on his pants.</p><p>\u201cFrom Heaven to Hell and back again. How far are you going to go?\u201d</p><p>He sounded amused now, and more in control than I wanted, but his breath was coming quick and shallow.</p><p>I took stock. My cheeks burned and my lips tingled. It was either go down, to Hell, or up, to Heaven. Low road or high road.</p><p>I\u2019d proved my theory. The silvered tissue of scarred skin was subject to my healing, soothing, and even surreal sexual influence. So I\u2019d also proved that I could undo Snow as much as he had undone me. We were tied at the moment. His hands shifted to the top of my shoulders, ready to assist me in sinking to a new level of competitive sensuality.</p><p>Instead, I surprised us both and went up, my fingers ripping open his top shirt buttons and pulling the string tie loose and his collar agape to tilt my face sideways and suck vampire-hard at the hollow of his throat.</p><p>Who was helpless and exposed now? I wanted to ask as his head reared back. He would have spoken, maybe even objected, but I breathed\u2014or hissed\u2014shhhh without missing a beat. So he let me have my way with him.</p><p>Only ... his hands fanned on my bare lower back and tilted my strong, silver-laced, satin-clad pelvic bones against his.</p><p>To feel every throb of his climax.</p><p>That forced me to break my punishing kiss and stumble back to establish my balance in every way. I kept my head tilted at an inquisitive angle. \u201cOne? Maybe two lashes paid for now, would you grant me that?\u201d</p><p>Snow had let himself sink onto the narrow hard arm of a theater chair, his clothes still split open a provocative smidge down the middle, from the pulse visibly galloping in his throat to Gehenna. Not a bad look. I\u2019d have been a killer GQ advertising director too.</p><p>So.</p><p>Delilah, the small and meek, had just had a very personal peek behind the fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>The Great and Powerful Snow was just another man behind the curtain in need of a really good blow job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AFTER THIS PIECE of impromptu performance \u201cart,\u201d I was more than ready to retreat behind the closed door of the suite\u2019s powder room off the entry hall.</p><p>The last time I\u2019d made a pit stop on the way out of a major hotel-casino\u2019s penthouse suite, it had been to wash off blood spatter after ridding werewolf mobster Cesar Cicereau of a reanimated victim at the Gehenna Hotel in Vegas.</p><p>Now, I just wanted to avoid Snow for a while.</p><p>When I entered, I discovered this was a kiss-off point for the ladies.</p> <p>Here I\u2019d been hopelessly Midwestern again, thinking vacationing married couples used this suite. Duh. It was for big spenders and their hired ladies of the night. No wonder it offered the high-tech fantasy makeover. I began to suspect the guest programmed his fantasy tart into the process. The lights in here should have been tinted red, but they, too, were green, as was anything reflected by the mirror.</p><p>I twisted to view the back of my gown ... gorgeous bias-cut green satin folds, tight through the torso and flaring into a mermaid skirt with a train. Yup, cut down to rear cleavage, which was accented with a rhinestone pin in a peacock tail design. How ironic that Snow fixated on bare white backs when his own was now hash, thanks to me. If he indeed bore no marks, the only way I\u2019d find out would be with a rematch.</p><p>Speaking of marks ... I lifted the heavy waves of unbraided hair off my neck, but no matter which way I turned and twisted, I could just barely glimpse Ric\u2019s love bruise.</p><p>Well, look at you wearing a fairly fresh new skank tattoo yourself.</p><p>Dry up, Irma, I thought.</p> <p>And then I turned to face myself in the mirror. I hadn\u2019t heard Irma. \u201cLilith\u201d stared back at me.</p><p>I knew her because she wasn\u2019t a mirror image. She wore low-rise jeans that underlined an \u201coutie\u201d belly button, pierced by a familiar blue topaz stud, whereas mine was an \u201cinnie.\u201d</p><p>That kind of summed up our opposing personalities, but we actually differed in this minor way? I\u2019d assumed we were identical in everything physical, for some reason.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d Lilith went on, \u201cback in Wichita, living it up in the \u2018whale\u2019 suite. Watching boring old movies. Riding our old friend Snow hard and putting him up wet. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between him and me,\u201d I said. \u201cOr maybe you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I never got even one orgasmic shiver out of Ice Prick. I guess he likes using you better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here again? Oh. Maybe it\u2019s the current theme. Wicked Witch green. A little envy going on, Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know, Delilah, would fill a chasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I saw your Wichita police mug shots. You got me in trouble here years ago. You were acting out and showing up on my record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI freaked out after that gross incident you know about now. I guess subconsciously I was trying to make Wichita too hot to hold me so I had to leave eventually. You sure weren\u2019t going to bust out.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were, like, the Corsican twins until that happened.\u201d</p><p>My mind did another rapid vintage movie rerun. The Corsican Brothers were guys, obviously, separated at birth, but they found each again because they felt each other\u2019s pain.</p><p>\u201cHome run, kid,\u201d Lilith said, as the reference registered on my face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stick around and wait for you to turn bean-grinder and smell the Starbucks.\u201d Lilith sounded guilty anyway. \u201cThat ugly doctor stuff drove me to act out ... and finally move on. I hitched all the way to the Sunshine State to find Mother Dearest, though it turns out she didn\u2019t want either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost people do, even us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? Oh.\u201d I remembered the La Vida Loca checks sent to Our Lady of the Lake. \u201cCorona, California?\u201d</p><p>Lilith shrugged tattooed shoulders. The designs weren\u2019t pretty, just blots of dark ink. She looked hollow-eyed and gaunt and too indifferent to really be that way.</p><p>\u201cLil ... are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight as acid rain,\u201d she answered bitterly, looking toward the ceiling and rolling heavenly blue-green eyes emphasized by seriously smoked-out eyeliner. \u201cWatch your back, Dee. There\u2019s more than Snow with a hard-on for it. Some very bad supers are on our tails and in our future. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She winked out like a night-light with a dead battery.</p><p>MY STREET CLOTHES, the unexciting navy suit, hung from a hook. On the malachite sink counter lay a set of mint-hued French underwear and a Red Carpet\u2013level emerald-green metallic gift bag I couldn\u2019t resist exploring.</p><p>Immediately, a sinuous chill whipped up my spine and down my arm to cuff my right wrist in a circle of \u201ceyes\u201d from the peacock tail pin. It was so heavy it slipped down my hand a little and into the top of the bag. Apparently the familiar was as curious as I was.</p><p>I pulled out green crystal bottles of beauty potions, even some old-time Emeraude perfume, green silk designer scarves, and emerald baubles inset in thick wrist cuffs.</p><p>I left all that heavy stuff out on the counter, but slipped out of the gown and let it coil into the empty bag. No way was I leaving another evening dress behind for Snow to send me later with an enclosed lock of his insidious silken white hair. I did not need twin familiars.</p><p>My underwear had melted off, so I donned the skimpy French stuff and my suit skirt and jacket as fast as I could. Only then did I glance down to the green carpet and spot the only red thing in the room.</p><p>The ruby slippers.</p><p>I bent to elevate them into the light from the overhead absinthe-colored chandelier bulbs. Up too close the combined red and green made them look black, reminding me of a nightmare, me standing on the yellow brick road in glittering funeral-black pumps.</p><p>At least these weren\u2019t modern, rhinestone-slathered, strappy hooker spikes.</p><p>They were the real Oz, sweet, kitten-heeled, closed-toe pumps glittering with sequins, with a plump formal bow tie on the toes. I clutched them to my chest and closed my eyes. Maybe the makeover machinery, possibly a blend of technology and magic like CinSims, had tapped my subconscious too.</p><p>If only I\u2019d had the power to click my heels and bow out of all my early years in Wichita. Or maybe they\u2019d made me what I\u2019d become, for better as well as worse. I sat on the closed commode and did an examination of conscience. I hadn\u2019t been to confession in years, but old school habits linger.</p><p>What had just happened here? How had I gone from a defensively fierce virgin to playing groupie to a rock star? I dredged up the usual mixed bag of motives, outside influences, and fears.</p><p>Guilt led the parade, of course. And pride.</p><p>When I\u2019d accepted Snow\u2019s Brimstone Kiss under duress to save Ric\u2019s life, I\u2019d expected to \u201csuffer\u201d the multiple orgasms that had sent his mosh-pit groupies on fruitless quests for another kiss that would never come. My emotions were in overdrive. I was frantic about wasting time in rushing to Ric\u2019s rescue, infuriated about being blackmailed into a sexual situation, loathing Snow and myself, terrified I would lose my free will and become a mindless sex addict. And, face it, Lilith would tell me if she hadn\u2019t split: I\u2019d always felt his sexual charisma as much as the most deluded groupie.</p><p>Afterward, for all those reasons, I couldn\u2019t bear to think of the incident, but maybe I should have. I was a trained observer, after all. Maybe in all the drama, I\u2019d missed something vital. My mind had resisted going back there, but when I did, I realized I\u2019d been a pretty inattentive witness, what with expecting to lose my soul and freedom and all.</p><p>Snow had prolonged that \u201cone only\u201d Brimstone Kiss into seductive minutes of a sensual battle of wills. To my eternal relief, I didn\u2019t experience even one orgasm, but I was so keyed up about what might happen that his sexual force did put me into a dreamy, erotic fog. Wincing, I recalled enough body contact to have a referee blow the whistle on it.</p><p>I knew Snow had expected something from the whole charade, for me either to succumb or totally resist, but I\u2019d done neither. I had been so languidly out of it for a time that he\u2019d been able to brush my mouth across his erotic zones like I was a blow-up doll.</p><p>I pressed the tops of my hands to cheeks flaming with fever at the returning memory picture and my self-disgust. Talk about zombies. I\u2019d almost gone down on the world\u2019s sexiest rock star. Missed it by that much.</p><p>Usually, my mind fast-forwarded past humiliating moments. Now I slowed down the scene. He\u2019d upheld me as I\u2019d been sinking down to the floor in a swoon, letting my ebbing mouth slide against his body in a long, semi-conscious kiss, holding me almost ... tenderly. As if he needed my kiss far more than I\u2019d needed his.</p><p>I\u2019d berated Snow once for not having the decency to ever sleep with his groupies even while he addicted them to an impossibly rewarding kiss. I\u2019d found that sadistic, but maybe he was celibate, had to be celibate, for a long, long time, as I was beginning to suspect. And I was the only one ...</p><p>Down with the ego, girl, Irma objected. He\u2019s no Sleeping Beauty, just a lech who kissed you semiconscious and copped a serial feel.</p><p>And I was just an impulsive idiot who\u2019d thought I could duel superstar charisma and win.</p><p>So ... HOPING TO slink out of the suite, I grabbed the bag holding the gown and shoes and reentered the hall, eyes on the dead-ahead double exit doors.</p><p>Curses! Snow appeared, string tie gone and shirt collar open to reveal and even frame the scarlet oval my mouth had burned into his albino throat. Instant contrition. I wanted that undone.</p><p>\u201cIce would bring the redness down,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>An onstage-style head-toss made his ice-white hair shimmy as Snow smiled down at me. Those Western boot heels made him even more larger-than-life.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d want to bring the redness down, Delilah? It amps up my rock-star image to flaunt the evidence that some hot skank has just been at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnow, you kill me. Everything I come up with\u2014 Albino Vampire cocktails, sensual tattoos\u2014you turn them to your commercial advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re not a scared, damaged little girl anymore. You\u2019re a serious and seriously sexy woman. And you\u2019ve amped up the stakes on that too, Delilah, now that you\u2019re living up to your name. You liked taunting me by planting a passion bruise dead center on my throat. You like seeing it there now. You like secretly knowing you\u2019re the one who put that bold brand on rock-star me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one?\u201d I asked, suspicious again that he, at least, believed in fate.</p><p>His hand cupped my head to bring my lips to his throat once more. That resonant stage voice whispered into the hair above my ear, but I could feel his words vibrate on my lips as his other hand swept the rippling hair up from my neck.</p><p>He knew just how to cast his erotic spell on me. I felt I was in his protective custody, cherished and challenged, terrified and thrilled.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you care to look too much in a mirror probably crowded with ghosts right now, Delilah,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut if you could see, I\u2019ve bared the lovely white nape of your neck to reveal a ripe purple passion bruise like the one you laid on me just now.\u201d</p><p>His cold white lips brushed the spot and I felt the touch as an electric jolt at the pit of my womb. His lips continued moving around my neck to my jawline, murmuring all the while.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised to know I think Montoya is a damn good influence, maybe the last positive force left in Vegas. He\u2019s a first-class crime fighter and, obviously, a hot-blooded but discreet lover. I know you two share true love and our little tangos are just an entertaining power play between what\u2019s left of the guilty girl in you and ...\u201d</p><p>His lips were almost on mine. Could the Brimstone Kiss still exist?</p><p>\u201c... whatever you think I am.</p><p>\u201cBut we liked it, Delilah, and will again,\u201d he said, releasing me gently. \u201cAnd that you can\u2019t change. Grizelle tells me I\u2019ve taken three hundred and twenty-two separate lash welts on my back because of you. Now that I\u2019ve seen what you can do for my front, I look forward to your healing every stripe on my back.\u201d</p><p>I fell back on my old friend, sass.</p><p>\u201cThis was a one-off, Snow. Maybe you can hope for a freebie, if you give me the information in future I need to do my job. Tit for tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>And it had been.</p><p>I stared at him, trying to clear my head and emotions. Grizelle had charged me with \u201cstealing\u201d the Brimstone Kiss from Snow, and maybe I had, in a way. Snow\u2019s preexisting chest scar tissue certainly was sensitive to the aphrodisiac effect of my healing kisses. I didn\u2019t know if I could heal the three-hundred-some new scars he claimed because of me, but I knew now I couldn\u2019t do it without giving him three-hundred-some orgasms.</p><p>Once had been \u201cbad\u201d enough and could be called \u201cprideful penitence.\u201d Any more would be outright infidelity and too much \u201cHollywood Madam\u201d to stomach. Yet it had soothed my outraged soul to take as complete sexual control of him as he had of me.</p><p>You crazy, mixed-up minx, Irma lectured. Who knew you had it in you? I gotta admit that parting touch on the throat, over his very voice box, was genius. You won this one. So publicly intimate. Yum. His groupies will swoon and they\u2019ll be dying to know Who.</p><p>I don\u2019t approve of that sort of thing, I told her stiffly. And thank you for not using \u201cthe word.\u201d He can hide the mark with that pink-diamond-studded collar he wears onstage. Any trace will fade soon anyway.</p><p>Yeah, but we know. And he knows.</p><p>I\u2019m in love with Ric.</p><p>Yeah, me too. But you can\u2019t help that you had unfinished business with Snow the minute you met him. That\u2019s karma, kid. It\u2019s not like Ric waited around twenty-four years for you. And, as the politicians say over and over again for the stupid media who never seem to get it ... foreplay doesn\u2019t count, just like the calories in chocolate don\u2019t. Free pass.</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe in free passes. I guess that was my religion.</p><p>\u201cA word of warning before you leave,\u201d Snow said in the all-too-uncomfortable present now.</p><p>He turned me to face the bathroom mirror through the open door, despite the possibility of ghosts. My usually colorless cheeks were as flushed as the intensifying bruise on his throat. I looked guilty. He just looked hotter.</p><p>\u201cThe Brimstone Kiss is more powerful than even I knew,\u201d Snow said. \u201cBe careful whom you kiss from now on, Delilah Street, how hard and where. Be careful whom you let kiss you, how hard and where.</p><p>\u201cBruise, but don\u2019t bite or be bitten. That\u2019s not a bad motto for handling whatever the whole damn Millennium Revelation throws your way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>GOING DOWN IN the speeding elevator, I pondered the fact that I\u2019d grown up twenty to fifty miles from The Most Wanted Vintage Film in the World.</p><p>I\u2019d expected it to be found, if ever, in someplace exotic like Rio, but Augusta, just outside Wichita, Kansas?</p><p>Umhmm, Irma agreed. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to practically lay Snow in Wichita, either. You sure got hyper once you resolved your supine position issues.</p><p>We have some kind of weird power struggle going, I told her. Seeing Metropolis was a teensy overexciting, and so was seeing that silver metal superwoman, even if the plot destroyed her at the end. They always do that to independent women.</p> <p>I hugged the glitzy green bag to my navy chest. Snow obviously couldn\u2019t be trusted around me when I was wearing vintage evening gowns. His problem. And then ... getting my very own ruby red slippers.</p><p>You are so typical of the modern female\u2019s bad media image, Irma huffed. You want it all. Sex, power, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and girly accessories.</p><p>Even as I savored the recent, unexpected triumphs, reality was starting to drop over me like a gray wool cloak of conscience, a descending storm cloud of regret. I\u2019d been up in La-la Munchkinland, carried away by the Emerald City makeover.</p><p>This was not an episode I could explain to Ric. Or mention to Ric, although Snow had given him some major compliments. I let myself bask in those positives. Even Snow had called Ric my \u201ctrue love.\u201d Why, then, had he let me ... goaded me ... seduced me ... into, ah, behaving badly? And, what was worse, predicted more of the same?</p><p>Time to stow the self-reflection and get back to what was happening on ground level. Were the boys having any luck tracking El Demonio from WTCH? Did I want them to? He was the Boss of Bosses now and mucho bad medicine.</p> <p>The elevator opened on the ground floor and I strode out, the green foil bag swinging from my hand.</p><p>Somebody grabbed that wrist and swung me around by it.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, puta.\u201d</p><p>Puta? Maybe a bit misguided sometimes, but hardly a prostitute.</p><p>As my attacker swung, I swung. My free hand, now accessorized at the wrist by a sawtooth silver cuff, slashed open his cheekbone.</p><p>The man dropped my wrist to stanch the flood of blood, so I skittered down the yellow brick road for the safety of Ben Hassard\u2019s office, only realizing as I crashed through the slightly open door that it was Siege Central.</p> <p>By the look of the unwelcome guests, I was back at the Cold Creek Drive-in Midnight Horror Show.</p><p>A metal-collared chupacabra on a chain dragged its spined tail back and forth over the floor in one corner, its red eyes gleaming in defiance of the Emerald City\u2019s all-green ambiance.</p><p>Ben Hassard slumped in his desk chair, his limbs bound to it by silver duct tape, a beaten, bloody parody of himself. Meanwhile, a group of squat, amphibian-faced men with pitted skin and totally black eyes prowled his office, every knuckle on their pudgy hands scraped bloody, their mustachioed upper lips lifting in almost a communal hiss as they spied me.</p><p>Certainly they weren\u2019t zombies or any other unhumans, but they were even worse. I\u2019d seen this subhuman type on TV and internet news sites being taken away by small armies of international law enforcement. These were the terrifying drug cartel musclemen, the men who prefaced hits with unimaginable tortures, offed whole innocent families, and killed by gruesome beheadings and acid baths.</p><p>They were all looking at me now.</p><p>Freshhhhh meat, Irma echoed my fears.</p><p>I immediately adapted my modestly high heels to a useless bimbo-spike stutter and ran into the danger instead of away. Time to embrace Dumb Blonde Gringa mode.</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh, Ben,\u201d I breathed. \u201cAm I interrupting an important business meeting? So sorry.\u201d</p> <p>All he could do was cough up blood, which I appeared to be too ditsy to see.</p><p>\u201cSay, Ben. Got a minute? Here are some goodies from upstairs. Everything looks good to go for the hotel opening.\u201d I gazed around, blinking vacantly. \u201cSo these guys here are the new security crew masquerading as bellboys and parking valets? Wow. They really set the tone. Speaking of \u2018tone,\u2019 I left my phone with all my listed shopping destinations in here.\u201d</p><p>I scooped up my cell phone from the desk.</p><p>On I babbled. \u201cAnd, Bensy, you promised, promised, promised to have this phone covered in Austrian crystals at the hotel shopping promenade by now.\u201d Stamp of klutzy pump heel as I dumped the bag under a guest chair. I cradled the phone to my cheek and eyed the screen. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d</p><p>A text message from Ric read \u201cW. Goose chase. Back ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, this stupid phone won\u2019t even work,\u201d I whined, punching my fingernails against the phone screen\u2019s keyboard like a demented typist. I managed to get off \u201cPrisoners at EC\u201d before one of the Reptilian Guard smacked the cell phone out of my hand to the floor.</p><p>I blinked at them, mainly because they didn\u2019t seem able to.</p><p>\u201cTwist-tie the stupid bitch,\u201d my abrupt personal phone operator barked.</p><p>Two of the poisonous toads jumped me. I resisted taking a bow before I was smashed to the floor with my wrists and ankles bound by wire cable.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d said one of the thugs, circling Ben. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell us who got the Augusta Theater goods the boss wanted.\u201d</p><p>The film? Metropolis? These bozos were after the film? Why?</p><p>Ben\u2019s unresponsive eyes had rolled up in his head like a saint\u2019s ascending to Heaven. I hoped he was just unconscious, not dead.</p><p>Half of me wanted to sic these creeps on the penthouse suite, where Snow was alone and rapt in his landmark film and maybe the ... aftermath of me. Serve him right. I also suspected Snow could unleash some nasty containment spell on them. My other half knew that my quota of guilt over Snow was full up for the moment.</p><p>So, only I could get Ben and me out of this murderous mess. To do that, I had to unravel why Torbellino wanted or needed the Metropolis film more than Snow.</p><p>What would link Ric and his ancient enemy, El Demonio, to a rare film now bound to become an unbeatable attraction for Snow\u2019s Vegas empire?</p><p>Besides me?</p><p>UNFORTUNATELY, A FEMALE presence did not encourage the drug cartel thugs to restrain themselves.</p><p>Their flaunted lighters and straight razors, though, could only produce bloody gurgles from Ben Hassard. These minions were too stupidly brutal to get any answers that would satisfy their absent boss. So, they were primed to commit mass slaughter to take their minds off El Demonio\u2019s reaction to their failure. I didn\u2019t want Ben to die.</p><p>I had few options, but at least I was being ignored. I\u2019d be safe until they decided to off witnesses, or play games with the helpless girl. I really had nothing to lose here but time to act.</p><p>So, I baaed softly. Baaaa-maaa.</p><p>Call me goat-girl.</p><p>The chained chupacabra in the corner perked up.</p><p>My, what a multibreed beastie it was seen close-up, a little like Barney the purple dinosaur if one wanted to put a soft and cuddly spin on it. The leathery gray-green skin and the quills defining its spine and tail gave it a lizard-like quality, and its blunt-snouted and fanged face flaunted a black forked tongue. Every exhalation broadcast the reek of sulfur. Too many bean burritos for lunch? Or was \u201cdragon\u201d a part of its pedigree? I gathered it would eat me rather than fry me long-distance. Chupacabras were notorious for draining the blood of goats, and I was certainly tied up like a Judas one.</p><p>I\u2019m a versatile chick. I puckered my lips and made sucking noises. Snow one hour, a chupacabra the next. Dolly and I have dual exhausts and aim to please. Come on, Chupie, come to maaa-maaa.</p><p>I saw the creature make a mighty lunge forward, straining the chain.</p><p>Behind me, Ben Hassard was groaning unintelligibly.</p><p>Bastards!</p><p>My low-key baas only spoke Chupacabra and I repeated them mindlessly, until the creature broke loose with a snap of its chain and a weird baying sound.</p><p>That\u2019s when I rolled under the knee hole in Hassard\u2019s desk, pushing his chair toward the back wall, hearing the unleashed monster behind me pinning the first responders in his path and sucking their blood with mucho gusto ... a Dios, El Demonio\u2019s henchmen. ...</p><p>My silver familiar shifted into a workman\u2019s switchblade\u2014an X-Acto knife. In my fingers the heavy blade sawed through my wire wrist and ankle bindings.</p><p>Still curled in the shelter of the desk\u2019s knee hole, I managed to grab the star-shaped rays of Ben\u2019s desk chair base and spin it like a lazy Susan until his duct-taped ankles came my way. An X-Acto knife would mangle the rubbery tape. The familiar morphed into heavy pinking shears and snapped its edged jaws right through.</p><p>By the time I dragged myself up to look over the desk, the once-captive chupacabra was ranging free and dining on drug cartel muscle. Literally. Its fangs pierced major arteries in their fat-solidified bodies as its black tongue sucked up the pooling blood like a straw.</p><p>The familiar was just chomping off the bonds on Hassard\u2019s wrists when the outside glass window shattered. Quicksilver leaped through to knock down the last retreating thug and run to me, leaving the downed man for the oncoming chupacabra.</p><p>I grabbed Quick\u2019s collar.</p><p>An instant later, Ric waded through the shards of broken glass to sweep us both to the back wall while Tallgrass edged around chupacabra and victim to pull Ben Hassard\u2019s rolling desk chair back to our defensive position.</p><p>The chupacabra celebrated its freedom by draining every last drop it could from the last downed thug. With loud, impolite slurping sounds.</p><p>The three conscious men, dog, and I panted in exhaustion against a wall.</p><p>Chupie straightened to scan red carnivore eyes in our direction. And burped. Full. Slowly, it waddled to the broken glass panel to make its way into the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad El Chupacabra drank its fill of El Demonio leavings,\u201d Tallgrass said.</p><p>He was bending over his friend, stanching the mass of bloody wounds with strips from Ben\u2019s tattered white shirt.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get him to Emergency,\u201d Tallgrass said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Quicksilver had thrust his big wet black nose between Tallgrass\u2019s hands and Ben\u2019s bloodied chest.</p><p>\u201cAway!\u201d Tallgrass\u2019s angry frown turned ferocious.</p><p>Quicksilver returned a deep, rumbling growl and burrowed his nose even closer to Ben.</p><p>\u201cWoman, get your dog off me,\u201d Tallgrass ordered.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off Ben,\u201d I ordered back. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need EMTs. Don\u2019t you sense it? He needs Quicksilver.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass lifted an elbow to shove Quicksilver away. I instinctively moved to protect the dog. Laughable, yes, but no one raised a hand to Quicksilver while I was around.</p><p>Ric\u2019s forearm slashed out of nowhere to meet and stop Tallgrass\u2019s blow. The gaze he directed at the older man was even more powerful. I saw the night\u2019s events had jolted out the contact lens and Ric\u2019s silver eye was fully obvious ... and fully potent.</p><p>\u201cLet the dog do his work, amigo,\u201d Ric said. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Whether he responded to Ric\u2019s authoritative look, sound, and action ... or the gaze of his altered eye, Tallgrass visibly lassoed his rampaging emotions. He pulled back, holding up a leathery palm, a gesture calming himself as much as Ric, me, and Quicksilver.</p><p>Quick had not waited for human resolution. He was hunched over Hassard in chupacabra-over-a-victim fashion, licking the bloody shirt fabric like it was a tasty vanilla wafer atop a scoop of after-dinner ice cream.</p><p>Hassard moaned and turned his pulpy features out of a horror movie toward Quicksilver\u2019s busy muzzle. The dog\u2019s tongue swiped the man\u2019s face, leaving swaths of clean, unmutilated skin behind.</p><p>A deep breath relaxed Tallgrass\u2019s bunched shoulder muscles. \u201cOh, Ty-ohni, forgive me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey tortured Ben for information,\u201d I explained. \u201cSuperficial wounds were the most hurtful. They didn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that, Miss Delilah,\u201d Tallgrass said, \u201cand I saw the noble Wolf in your Quicksilver. I just didn\u2019t know that your \u2018dog\u2019 had a shaman\u2019s healing power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had no way to tell you,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cShamans are not used to explaining themselves,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cIt is up to us humans to be humble and trust. My fear for Ben overcame my instincts. I apologize.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYou have a healing power as well, don\u2019t you? But it is\u201d\u2014his stone-faced expression crumbled\u2014\u201ctied to things this old Indian has no business inquiring into. As for my amigo, Ricardo ... I don\u2019t know what to make of you at all.\u201d</p><p>Ric slapped the man on the forearm.</p><p>\u201cForget the mystical stuff, Tallgrass. That made for tales around campfires on our stakeouts, but we have dead cartel muscle here and the attack at the Augusta Theater to figure out. Also, where that damned El Demonio is and what he wants so badly he\u2019ll expose the long-reaching tendrils of his drug operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Augusta?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver tracked El Demonio\u2019s car to the theater parking lot,\u201d Ric explained. \u201cTallgrass and I went in to question the staff, and they were acting like ... zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal zombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat came later. No, they were just intimidated people who\u2019d been roughly interrogated. Turned out some invading mob types were after certain old movie reels one of their sponsors found in the debris in the theater basement and took away to examine on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of their \u2018sponsors,\u2019\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Ric\u2019s grimace confirmed my guess. \u201cRight. Tallgrass\u2019s pal Ben Hassard. We decided to come back here to figure out what was so damn precious in those old film reels, but when we tried to leave, we discovered the parking lot was being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Demonio\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have been so lucky.\u201d Ric eyed the carnage on the office floor. \u201cNo, his henchmen were all here already \u2018interrogating\u2019 Hassard. El Demonio had left some other forces at the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombies,\u201d I guessed. \u201cHow\u2019d you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy, but with the practice Quicksilver and I got repulsing zombies at the Cold Creek Drive-in, we did okay.\u201d Ric lowered his voice. \u201cI lost my contact lens, deliberately, and found I could, ah, use it to polish up the silver discs on Quicksilver\u2019s collar. I could focus and then bounce the ... effect. It\u2019s the weirdest thing, Del. It\u2019s like I can dowse for the dead with my silver eye now. I can find them, raise them, or\u2014since we\u2019ve encountered some really rapacious ones\u2014suck the undead life out of them. Don\u2019t tell Tallgrass. He thinks we just fought hard and got lucky and had a dog with a mystical amount of wolf in him on our side.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to make of Ric\u2019s account any more than Tallgrass had.</p><p>Mulling it all over, I watched as Quicksilver stepped back to lick his big paws and start swabbing his nose and mouth blood-free. Ben struggled to a sitting position, his hands wiping his unhurt face and running over his equally sound arms and chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cI dreamed I was in the hands of devils with their hellfire pitchforks and then I was touched by an angel with the most beautiful blue eyes in all of heaven.\u201d He gazed at me like a freshman nerd meeting a prom queen.</p><p>I was not about to tell Ben his real \u201cangel\u201d needed a major shave and a claw-cut.</p><p>\u201cWhat did those devils want?\u201d Ric asked, using the dazed man\u2019s terms of reference.</p><p>\u201cSome old film cans that were found in the basement of the Augusta Theater during renovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you know right away about what was found there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI underwrote most of the Augusta Theater restoration. Having another tourist attraction nearby would enhance the Wicked Wild West concept. My backers and I planned to rope in Dodge City\u2019s tourist exhibitions too, make it into an auto-tour ending at Emerald City. You know, from fantastic Kansas history to extraordinary Kansas fantasy. Saloon shoot-outs to a genuine restored movie palace to the biggest Kansas-set move of all time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d I said, sort of gently, but not too. \u201cI know what was found in the Augusta\u2019s basement, and that you realized its value and skedaddled with it to someone who could get you the CinSims you so desperately needed for the Emerald City.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass watched his friend like an outraged hawk. \u201cYou stole something from the civic restoration project? Something valuable?\u201d</p><p>Ben shrugged unhappily, still rubbing his restored arms and shoulders. \u201cIt was just an old film, Tallgrass. I needed something new for the Emerald City, something modern like the bigwigs in Vegas have. CinSims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose animated celebrities?\u201d Tallgrass asked with disdain. \u201cWe could do that with a wax museum and animatronics.\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cLast century, Tallgrass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you found a big-time buyer?\u201d Ric asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. That was the beauty of it. He found me. The bigwig was a cinema freak. Showed up. Knew about the old film being found somehow. Already had the perfect Cin-Sims, the only ones available for Emerald City. We made the deal and everyone was happy as clams. Hundreds of thousands of clams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were cheating the theater restoration project of the proceeds of its property,\u201d Tallgrass said.</p><p>\u201cI donated plenty to them,\u201d Ben said, quivering at his friend\u2019s anger. \u201cMore than they know what to do with. I tell you, everyone was happy.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, a sizzling bolt of lightning shivered down from high above Emerald City.</p><p>\u201cSomebody up there sure isn\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>Outside the complex, thunder cracked its muscles, strained its sinews to the breaking point, and strode the sky to break its back again and again.</p><p>Earth below buckled.</p><p>Emerald City towers above trembled.</p><p>Inside the massive construction, we mere humans were gripped by the oldest gods, caught tight in the fists of thunder and fixed in the fierce eyes of the lightning.</p><p>Ric\u2019s arm clasped me tight. He whispered in my ear. \u201cEl Demonio has failed to find this film on two fronts, at the Augusta Theater and in breaking down Ben Hassard. He\u2019s not done. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s loosed his local accomplices, the weather witches, on Emerald City and us. I think they\u2019re a bigger force here than we guessed. I\u2019m sorry, Del.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorrier,\u201d I was able to shout back into the wind. \u201cWeather witches? Like Sheena at WTCH?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one TV weather girl is behind effects like this,\u201d Tallgrass huffed in a basso fury. \u201cWichita has had an entire secret coven of weather witches going back long before the Millennium Revelation, which only empowered them more. They can blackmail and they can be bought. They\u2019ve provided weather cover for El Demonio\u2019s drug drives. Now that his thugs are chupacabra meat and Ric and Quicksilver scorched a crew of his zombies to ashes, he\u2019s bought or forced the weather witches to bring us to our knees until he has what he wants. I can\u2019t believe this is all for a few thousand feet of old film footage.\u201d</p><p>Neither could I. Something much bigger must be at stake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I murmured, knowing no one could hear me.</p><p>Snow\u2019s Fortress of Solitude was about to be shattered anyway, by ... weather witches and ... me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>BEFORE I COULD corral my scattered thoughts or solve the whole mess or say a word, another crisis invaded the blood-and-body-strewn office.</p><p>\u201cChickens?\u201d Ric demanded as a black-and-white flock flooded the floor with panicked clucking and fluttering wings. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d</p><p>By then the Wizard of Oz CinSims were all homing on Ben Hassard\u2019s office like pigeons caught flying in the midst of a Manhattan ticker-tape parade.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to a storm cellar,\u201d Hunk, the future Straw Man, said, appearing at my side to grab my arm. \u201cCome along, Dorothy. Forget the dog.\u201d</p> <p>What I\u2019d forgotten was that my hair, after the Emerald City makeover treatment, flowed in black waves to my shoulders, as Dorothy Gale\u2019s had after the film\u2019s EC make-over scene. I\u2019d also forgotten that my hair was so dark and my skin so white I looked like a ready-made CinSim with colorized blue eyes.</p><p>The CinSim Toto skittered past my ankles and I chased him, wishing for a basket.</p><p>\u201cStorm cellar?\u201d Tallgrass speculated to Ric. \u201cThe hotel must have lower levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spotted a service door on the way in from the parking lot,\u201d Ric answered. \u201cJust outside this office wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be one inside as well,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cTyohni,\u201d he ordered. \u201cHunt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d I cried, appalled to see Quicksilver bound away into the earth-shaking chaos outside the office area on another person\u2019s orders. \u201cLeave kitty!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cLeave the dog, Dorothy!\u201d</p><p>Strong, callused hands held my forearms prisoner. The hands of ... farmworkers. The other two Gale farm workmen were not about to let \u201cDorothy\u201d run out into the storm. Hickory, the Tin Man, and Zeke, the Cowardly Lion, had already shooed Uncle Henry and Auntie Em toward Ric and Tallgrass.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ric said, pulling Hickory and Zeke off me. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Dorothy. You boys get the old folks.\u201d</p><p>When Quicksilver barked from just down the hall, we herded the party to the door marked mechanics he\u2019d found.</p><p>Those Wizard of Oz CinSims were a loyal and determined bunch, but after a small taste of running around at large in Emerald City they weren\u2019t too pleased to be jammed back in the basement.</p> <p>Hickory tried to grab me again and take me with the CinSims, but I slipped from his custody as Tallgrass pushed him into the stairwell and slammed the metal security door with its exterior lock shut.</p><p>I breathed a sigh the strength of a snow-globe tornado. The Wizard of Oz was as much about hands, head, and heart as Metropolis. My hands, head, and heart were happy to have all the Kansas farmyard folk and critter CinSims tucked away in the Emerald City\u2019s high-tech sub-basements. They\u2019d have lots of room to roam, although the chickens and pigs and horses could be seen ranging through the outer offices in confusion.</p><p>Then my panicked Scarecrow brain got ticking again.</p><p>Where was Dorothy? And Toto? And Professor Marvel?</p><p>And, most of all, where the hell was Almira Gulch?</p><p>\u201cIs everybody unreal we can get our hands on stowed safely below?\u201d Tallgrass asked.</p><p>\u201cSome major players are still out and about,\u201d I admitted, \u201cbut the same thing happened to them in the opening scenes of the movie, so we can\u2019t expect to totally override their conditioning.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass frowned at me. \u201cYou Vegas people live in a fantasy world, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo do we Plains people,\u201d his confidential rasp whispered. \u201cMillennium Revelation,\u201d he pronounced with a Quicksilver-worthy snort. \u201cNot new to us. My people and your people may yet save Wichita, and all our asses.</p><p>\u201cAll right, \u2018Dorothy.\u2019 You\u2019re the white man\u2019s lucky charm, but clearly also the key to the entire puzzle we\u2019re all facing now, filmed and real, past and present.</p><p>\u201cYou take us on that corny yellow brick road to the heart of Wichita, Emerald City edition. Got it? How are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>How could I ever explain Snow to Leonard Tallgrass? Maybe as a ... wizard. Or a shaman. How would I ever explain to Snow why everyone in our ragtag party and everything evil in Wichita seemed to have a serious stake in his prize vintage movie? I sure didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Tallgrass prodded me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come clean and take us all to the top of Emerald City to see a man about a movie.\u201d</p><p>RIC AND TALLGRASS, Quicksilver and I, stepped out of the shuddering elevator shaft and onto the penthouse floor to feel the tower itself shimmy and the very height make us shiver like wind chimes.</p><p>Snow was there to greet us, a commanding figure reminiscent of a CinSim ghost.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d he asked our survival party. \u201cThe view here is spectacular, not to mention strategic. Let me show you.\u201d</p><p>Tallgrass looked him up and down ... and up and down again. \u201cYou are Ben\u2019s Las Vegas bigwig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a wig,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI wear my hair long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA noble tradition, if a trifle old-fashioned,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cRic? What do you know of this person Ben calls Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristophe. It\u2019s French. He\u2019s a Vegas bigwig, all right, and a man of many names,\u201d Ric replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he can be trusted for the long run, but if he has interests at stake that mirror ours, he\u2019ll be prepared to indulge in mutual using.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t renege on deals,\u201d Snow said. \u201cAnd nobody takes what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Tallgrass nodded. \u201cMy people have heard that first lie from the white man, but we endorse the second claim. You\u2019ll have to prove your honorable intentions.\u201d</p><p>Thank goodness no one had asked me to recommend Snow.</p><p>At my side, Quicksilver whined. I believe the major position he meant to convey was impatience.</p><p>Snow led our party onto the open-air balcony that surrounded the highest residence Emerald City had to offer. The evening air had that heavy, sullen stillness that promised a major storm was about to break loose. A fully three-quarter moon hung like a leaky football in an unclouded bit of night sky.</p><p>We all adopted Tallgrass\u2019s signature squint as we stared out over green and gold rolling Kansas fields shivering in the rising wind. Everything was colored the sick chartreuse color the landscape took on before a major storm. It was like looking through a glass of absinthe.</p><p>An out-of-season blue-black front of storm clouds was rolling in from the northwest. Kansans knew that cloud cover for a raging monster spawned on the flanks of the Colorado Rockies, whose howling high winds would lash the land with icy cold and snow. They called it a \u201cblue norther.\u201d</p><p>Snow held out a pointing forefinger, his long white hair flowing back in the wind, making him resemble the monumental Crazy Horse statue carved from the Black Hills of South Dakota.</p><p>\u201cThere are three attack positions,\u201d Snow said. \u201cTo the south, west, and north.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over the balcony to watch heat lightning flirt with a familiar broadcast tower.</p><p>\u201cWTCH is to the west,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>Ric held me to anchor us against the driving wind. \u201cThe drug cartel\u2019s cattle-drive path runs south to north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that unholy traffic that destroys the earth and its beings has roused the gods of my people,\u201d Tallgrass said. \u201cFrom the north comes the Wendigo. That\u2019s where the zombies drive the drug-laden cattle for slaughter. Wendigo is a giant evil spirit, a starving cannibal who dines on the greedy and devours them all. El Demonio\u2019s enterprise is a desecration deserving of death, and that restitution will come, no matter if we stand in its path, no matter what we do.\u201d</p><p>A monstrous conjunction of elements was assembling on the verdant stage of Kansas that night, no doubt. I studied the scene.</p><p>Lightning was building around three towers. Emerald City was the highest, and the most obvious target. Next highest was the broadcast tower to the west, WTCH-TV. Alma mater.</p><p>Speaking of my actual alma mater, I looked to the unmentioned east. The spire of a church was catching jagged lightning bolts. Was the lightning rod atop it cast in the figure of a gargoyle? Or a dragon?</p><p>\u201cWe have enemies converging from all four points of the compass?\u201d Ric asked, noticing the direction of my gaze.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cThe east is an ally under fire, Our Lady of the Lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ric asked. \u201cWhat did we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what somebody else wants first,\u201d Snow answered.</p><p>Ric stared at him for a long, hard moment. I feared he would take Snow\u2019s comment personally, or Snow would mention Ric\u2019s new silver eye.</p><p>Neither spoke.</p><p>Tallgrass broke the silence. \u201cWhat more does El Demonio want? His band of bad men and their dead minions have been invading Wichita for years, like a blood tide seeping up from the Mexican border killings. Now everything evil is drawn to these fantastical towers on which we stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no military historian,\u201d Ric said, \u201cbut if you\u2019re the center of a three-pronged attack, you need to snap one leg out from under the triad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver and I will take out the west,\u201d I volunteered.</p><p>\u201cNo, Delilah.\u201d Ric tightened his grip on me. \u201cIt\u2019s insane to go out into the teeth of that oncoming physical and mystical storm. Stay.\u201d</p><p>I looked over the lurid green-lit landscape that still resembled a Fanny Farmer deluxe box of mint and chocolate squares, with caramel drizzles on top. Wheat and corn and molasses and apple pie. Kansas farmland, as it had always been. I measured the blue-black tornado twisting Emerald City way and the lightning bolts flash-dancing around Our Lady of the Lake\u2019s spire and the WTCH broadcast tower.</p><p>I saw the snarling face of Tallgrass\u2019s terrifying Wendigo in the oncoming blue norther.</p><p>And I was supposed to be scared of Sheena Coleman?</p><p>Weather witches were the weakest link in the forces arrayed against us, but one of them controlled the highest tower. Besides, it\u2019d be a pleasure to take out the witch that blew down my house.</p><p>Who\u2019s a storm chaser?</p><p>Ace reporter, that\u2019s who.</p><p>\u201cI have an issue with the station\u2019s lousy weather witch, and Dolly\u2019s horses know the way,\u201d I told everyone and no one in particular. I didn\u2019t want to cross any glance that could stop me. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut down that broadcast tower and be back in no time. Quicksilver! Time to do your job.\u201d</p><p>I slipped Ric a crooked smile and didn\u2019t look back, although I heard him being forcibly restrained, probably by Leonard Tallgrass.</p><p>Quick and I zipped into the open elevator and hit \u201cM\u201d as in \u201cMain.\u201d We had sixty-some stories to plummet down and a bunch of flatland to cross.</p><p>You can\u2019t take me out into this monster storm with you, Irma objected. It\u2019s murder.</p><p>Eh. Murder-suicide, technically, I told her. I\u2019m not being heroic and I\u2019m not being stupid. Do the math.</p><p>I\u2019d figured out the best use of personnel. Tallgrass had to remain at Emerald City to protect his tribe\u2019s investment and deal with its oncoming cannibal vengeance god. The Wendigo sounded like another Lord of the Slaughter, a Shezmou with bear teeth, the power of all the earth\u2019s winds at his back, and really bad breath. Nasty.</p><p>Snow had led the rescue party for Ric and produced a dragon to do it. I was pretty sure he\u2019d come up with something spectacular to save the newest lynchpin of his Vegas empire, not to his mention his albino skin and the ordinary hides of everyone around him. And me, probably. Now that he knew what I could do for him, he\u2019d want the satisfaction of forcing or tricking me into healing those whip welts I\u2019d accidentally bequeathed to him in my uniquely soothing way.</p><p>What about our beloved Ric? Irma wailed.</p><p>Snow saved him before and he will again, I told her. Ric\u2019s too vital to some part of this puzzle. Snow will save Ric and me ... us, just for my future crawling potential.</p><p>What about El Demonio and his zombie army?</p><p>That I don\u2019t know. Ric may have to settle that score all by himself.</p><p>Irma went silent as the elevator reached the main floor. Quicksilver and I picked our way through the fallen corpses of El Demonio\u2019s thugs. True, I had tricked the chupacabra into becoming my hit man, but in the ghoul-eatghoul world of the Millennium Revelation, it wasn\u2019t how you got things done, but that you did.</p><p>Outside, litter skidded across the deserted Emerald City parking lot like skeletal fingers playing the \u201cDevil\u2019s Waltz\u201d on an asphalt keyboard. The temperature outside at ground level, including wind chill, had dropped to a blood-freezing forty degrees.</p><p>There was no point in putting Dolly\u2019s top up.</p><p>The wind would just rip it off.</p><p>Quicksilver leaped in the front passenger seat with a shit-eating grin.</p><p>\u201cYou have been just waiting to ride shotgun again,\u201d I accused.</p><p>He showed fang.</p><p>\u201cRiding shotgun is good for you,\u201d I told Quicksilver. \u201cSave your footpads for later.\u201d</p><p>Dolly\u2019s engine choked for a moment, but revved high and hard when I peeled out of the lot into the dark and stormy night.</p><p>\u201cYou never knew these WTCH folk,\u201d I commented.</p><p>Quicksilver remained mum and curled his claws into the front seat upholstery. I cringed, but kept silent. My mind started toting up losses to motivate my righteous anger. Achilles. My job. My house. My history.</p><p>The streets were eerily deserted, so I ran about a dozen red lights, feeling like a ghost.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take whoever\u2019s there down,\u201d I told Quicksilver. \u201cThey would put orphans like us up for adoption in a cage,\u201d I added, in terms he would relate to.</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cThey are so wrong.\u201d I kept up a running dialogue as I pushed Dolly up to seventy-five on the abandoned city streets. Ric would be proud. \u201cThey sold out the serious profession of The News, of informing the community, for impure greed. Sheena just wanted blackmail money for giving bad weather to good people and good weather to bad people. Undead Ted was a lame tool. Literally. El Demonio could plant his shills in management and hide the fact that Wichita was becoming a drug-smuggling hub.</p><p>\u201cNow the broadcast capabilities of WTCH-TV can multiply the powers of all the southeast Kansas weather witches. We have to cut the power to the tower. Any ideas?\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver lifted his furred throat and howled at the three-quarter moon peeking between the gathering storm clouds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we see eye-to-eye on the storm,\u201d I said. \u201cIt generates a lot of power that\u2019s not answerable to anybody but Mother Nature. Let\u2019s hope we can tap that.\u201d</p><p>By the time I cruised Dolly through the WTCH parking lot, the cloud bank had sped to meet us so fast that I could see only darkness above the tree line, and hear only the wind hissing and the lightning spitting.</p><p>Most of the cars and vans were gone. Storm-chasing, I hoped. That\u2019s what real news people would do. I was after unreal news people. Only Undead Ted\u2019s Prius and Sheena\u2019s vintage iridescent pink Geo Storm were still there.</p><p>Dolly\u2019s headlights spotted someone hunched at the driver\u2019s side of Sheena\u2019s Storm, trying to break in.</p><p>\u201cUndead Ted.\u201d I hailed him as I pulled Dolly alongside, sandwiching his body between her hefty black side and the Storm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d he responded. \u201cAnd your car is creasing my best suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sheena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go in there, Delilah. Some kind of crazy feminist rave is going down. I had no idea Sheena was so invested in \u2018career at any price.\u2019 She\u2019s got all her gal pals doing the Macarena around a Crock-Pot in the station kitchen. When I heard their chant was calling for \u2018eye of Newt Gingrich\u2019 and a \u2018samp of vamp,\u2019 I got the hell out. I think that crazy Slo-mo Eddie is hunkered down filming it all.\u201d</p><p>Go, Eddie, go. He\u2019d win the YouTube viral sweepstakes of the week with that footage. That would out Sheena\u2019s secret coven.</p><p>\u201cSheena alone has power to skew the weather,\u201d I told Undead Ted, \u201cbut not to brew up a megastorm like this.\u201d</p><p>He joined me in looking up at the roiling blue-black sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Delilah,\u201d he said. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I really did have the hots for your blood type. And I was right that you\u2019d taste like clarified blue blood. Awesomely rare.\u201d</p><p>A gourmand vampire? Euww.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want in Sheena\u2019s car?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded at two briefcases on the floor mat. \u201cMy share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m shutting Sheena down. You don\u2019t want to ever show your sorry face in Kansas again.\u201d</p><p>He scrambled into his Prius and lurched away at top speed.</p><p>As he left, I spotted a sudden hailstorm heading for us through the lot. Sheena was still watching the exterior. No way was that witch going to ice-blast the pristine finish on my vintage car. Taking my job and my rental house was one thing, but Dolly was family.</p><p>Also pretty much Detroit tank.</p><p>I gunned her over the curb and the lawn, cutting across to the concrete canopy sheltering the station\u2019s main entrance. The hailstorm passed over, tinkling down a few stray ice crystals.</p><p>Now that Dolly was safely parked out of the elements, Quick and I headed into the eerily rainless storm for the broadcast tower.</p><p>I\u2019d always taken this five-hundred-foot Eiffelesque structure at the station\u2019s side for granted. Now, it was scary. A fan of lightning bolts as tall as the tower itself grew from its top, glowing so white-hot the tendrils looked pink against the night sky.</p><p>The tower sat on a concrete pad next to a shack unsavory enough to house an illegal still. Dozens of thin guy wires anchored the mass for hundreds of feet around. Toppling the tower would be impossible. Cutting off the dark artery of cable that ran up it would not, but this electrical storm could ground itself through me, a process called electrocution. I so wished I had paid more attention in those required science classes. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t raining. Yet.</p><p>Maybe that was why the silver familiar wasn\u2019t morphing into something handy like a hedge trimmer or hatchet or a hacksaw; using it would kill me. Or it just didn\u2019t do yard work.</p><p>Quick\u2019s sharp bark drew me around the shack\u2019s side to where the metal conduit housing the cable met ground to run into the shack. Simple. Cut the power to the tower by hacking the conduit and interior cable in half. I needed a real tool. ...</p><p>The shack\u2019s exterior toolbox was filled with goodies I pawed through by lightning flash. If I had a hammer. ... I picked up one with a rubberized handle. It wasn\u2019t suitable for cutting a coax but reminded me that tools around here would need insulated handles. I finally lifted up an awesome little Tin Man hatchet with a wooden haft.</p><p>Hoping that the nonmetal handle would interrupt a lethal electrical shock, in seconds I was hacking at the conduit like a demented ax murderer. I\u2019d cut through the outer metal and was denting the rubber insulation when Quicksilver growled and rushed something behind me.</p><p>Sheena stood screaming beside me, her blond hair flaring in the wind to show her brunet roots. \u201cStop that, Street! That hacking is giving me a throbbing headache.\u201d</p><p>I ignored her and kept slinging my hatchet, counting on Quicksilver to keep her at bay.</p><p>Suddenly a hurricane gust of wind lifted me off my feet while Sheena yanked me back by my windblown hair. The hatchet flew from my hand into the dark as Sheena and I fell struggling on the concrete. Another lightning flash showed Quicksilver nosing at the half-cut-through cable.</p><p>No! He could electrocute himself. I kneed Sheena in the stomach and swung her off me by her hair, struggling to my feet in the straight skirt and heels. I\u2019d never wear a business suit anywhere again.</p><p>\u201cQuicksilver,\u201d I screamed. \u201cLeave kitty!\u201d</p><p>Everything happened in jerky slow motion, as if lit by a nightclub strobe light.</p><p>Quicksilver regarded me with calm, stubborn doggy inaction.</p><p>By the next flash, Quicksilver had lifted a leg.</p><p>A rear leg.</p><p>I shut my eyes.</p><p>\u201cQuick, no!\u201d Water would short out the cable, of course, but Quicksilver would be fried.</p><p>Sheena was clawing at my skirt to pull me back down, but I back-kicked her away and charged for Quicksilver ...</p><p>Just as lightning flashed and showed his hair snapping with static into a gorgeous electric-blue halo, leaping toward me ...</p><p>As the tower-top lightning streaked to ground with the sound of berserk electrical snapping. The wet cable shorted out the tower, making it a dazzling firecracker flaring, and then fading to disappear against the night sky.</p><p>Sheena was moaning behind me. \u201cYou witch! My coven\u2019s been grounded. You\u2019ve broken my perfect storm.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver, still looking twice his normal size, regarded me with calm, stubborn doggy inaction. I reached my fingers to his punk-rock coat, and got a nasty little shock.</p><p>That\u2019s all. He\u2019d been smart enough to piss and run before the current could connect. We turned to bustle back to Emerald City.</p><p>Halfway to the parking lot, Sheena caught up to us. She must have been planning a quick getaway too.</p><p>\u201cStreet!\u201d she shouted. \u201cWait. What have you done to my car?\u201d she screamed. \u201cWhere is my Storm?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the parking lot. Lightning had struck the small car into a twisted mass of blackened metal with a burnt pile in the middle.</p><p>\u201cMy money!\u201d Sheena wailed, running to the wreckage to claw at the remains.</p><p>\u201cWill she ruin her perfect manicure clawing for those burnt bills?\u201d I said to Quicksilver. \u201cMoney is the root of all evil.\u201d</p><p>I ran to the station portico to jump behind Dolly\u2019s steering wheel as Quicksilver took the passenger side, having done his business and being ready to leave. I tried to call Ric, but my cell phone had been fried. Better it than me or Quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think your whole perfect storm is going south,\u201d I yelled to Sheena as we sped down the exit road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I HAD TO watch for the broken glass in the station driveway, so it wasn\u2019t until we were almost at the street that I looked up at the sky again. I glimpsed Emerald City\u2019s towers coated in heat lightning, the highest point practically touching the threatening storm clouds.</p><p>Without the weather witches adding harassing phenomena to the storm, it had boiled down to a fixed, churning vortex spinning fog and lightning and darkness around the Emerald City towers, which were being swarmed by climbing hordes of El Demonio\u2019s zombies, swinging like disintegrating apes up the glittering slick green sides on thin steel guy wires. Talk about flying monkeys.</p><p>When had El Demonio and his crew besieged Emerald City?</p><p>I may have disabled the broadcast tower, but Emerald City was WTCH-TV now, threatened by an evil new power, and there was no longer any coaxial cable to fall victim to Quicksilver\u2019s bladder magic.</p> <p>By going to the ground to take out the WTCH-TV tower, I\u2019d put an unbridgeable gulf between myself and my stranded allies in the Emerald City towers.</p><p>I drove up to the deserted parking lot with despair in my soul.</p><p>The storm was so ferocious and high.</p><p>I was so isolated below.</p><p>There were so many fierce, hungry zombies in the many stories between.</p> <p>I needed to rejoin Ric in Snow\u2019s suite. I had a lobby to cross and an elevator to get into, with dog. I parked Dolly away from any trees that could fall on her, in a dark part of the Emerald City lot.</p><p>Slipping around the side of the building, I noticed that the storm-green light distorted colors, making what was dark blacker, what was sickly yellow-green paler. So I was glad for the dark navy shoes and suit I wore and only wished I had pants. Even Quicksilver\u2019s crisp gray and cream coat looked jaundiced, like a ... an absinthe-toned CinSim.</p><p>I peeked in the first lobby window. Had the chupacabra come back?</p><p>No, it was El Demonio himself lounging on a visitor\u2019s chair, sending tremors down his thirty-foot bullwhip so it twitched like an impatient tail. The light gave his clothing and skin a greenish reptilian cast. His squinty black eyes were bloodshot enough to match the chupacabra\u2019s. I wondered if the man who\u2019d been surnamed Torbellino had disappeared entirely into El Demonio over the past twenty years, if the Millennium Revelation had brought out a true demon in him.</p><p>The lobby bodies had been piled in a corner, where a few limbless zombies chewed frantically on the remains. I suspected they had fallen during the assault on the towers and had broken off too much to keep going at anything but devouring, so they\u2019d been relegated to the \u201cclean-up\u201d crew.</p><p>Other thugs sat around with the head man, drinking from liquor bottles. An empty one of Old Crow rolled back and forth on the floor as the storm shook the building.</p> <p>Toto came skittering through the ruins, sniffing for the yellow brick road. A thug pulled out a semiautomatic, but although the bullet sprayed green splinters from the recycled glass floor, the small black flash disappeared behind another chair.</p><p>\u201cWhere is that vicious little dog?\u201d a woman\u2019s shrill voice demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll show that Dorothy.\u201d Almira Gulch came stomping through in her old-maid dress and ridiculous crushed black straw stovepipe hat, a basket over her arm. \u201cThat dog needs to be put away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, lady,\u201d drawled one of Torbellino\u2019s men.</p><p>She turned on the boss man after stepping daintily over his bull-hide tail. \u201cYou, sir, look like a man of authority. I want you to put that dog in a cage and that stupid girl Dorothy who let it bite me in jail.\u201d</p><p>The thug who\u2019d shot at Toto lifted the gun, but Torbellino raised a lazy hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your ammunition. These things aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re real nuisances,\u201d the guy answered, taking a bead on Miss Almira Gulch\u2019s hat.</p><p>\u201cI said, don\u2019t,\u201d Torbellino ordered through gritted teeth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a carnival shooting gallery. This is our Armageddon, ass. Either grow or die, and those snoops on our Kansas drug-drives are threatening my operation going international. We\u2019d be outa here with our prize if some damned necromancer hadn\u2019t turned all the elevator wires to silver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, boss, you want this silver thingamajiggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the power of the ultimate Silver Zombie. I\u2019ve had these cheap Mexican models for the digging up, sure, for decades. But the Silver Zombie would be able to find and dig up whole armies of new undead meth-heads. I\u2019d be King of the Zombies. I could run this continent. Hell, I could run this hemisphere with that one heavy-metal piece on the crime game board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. If the weather witches\u2019 storm doesn\u2019t knock those holdouts out of their pretty glass tower, our zombie cattle-drivers will finally reach the top and throw them off. It\u2019s just bad luck some rich guy made off with the Silver Zombie before we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t all this throwing off and knocking off lose you the Silver Zombie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. No more than your bullet can kill these kinky CinSims running around here. They\u2019re zombies too and already dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they ... look normal and talk and wear clothes and don\u2019t eat anybody\u2019s brains. That one there acts just like my Aunt Clara and I\u2019d really like to clean her clock. One shot, boss, please?\u201d</p><p>Almira was heading through again, like the clockwork CinSim she was and would be until she became a full-fledged hotel-casino attraction and some of the actress underneath her, Margaret Hamilton, a perfectly nice lady, came out to soften the film persona.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d El Demonio shouted, \u201cor you\u2019ll end up in my local body farm and get raised to run with the cattle, like these stupid zombies. Don\u2019t push me. I really need a better grade of zombie.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the broken door, I\u2019d heard everything. I parted my Green Room\u2013permed hair and pulled it forward into two pigtails. The silver familiar obligingly split and clipped each tail into place.</p><p>I played director and gave Quicksilver a short but key nonspeaking role.</p><p>The moment Miss Gulch vanished, I nodded at my dog.</p><p>Quick padded silently through the broken door and slunk around the furniture so he could appear right behind El Demonio\u2019s chair.</p><p>Toto zipped out again, thanks to Miss Gulch\u2019s absence. While the men\u2019s eyes were automatically drawn to the streaking little dog, I eased on down the lobby\u2019s trashed yellow brick road and into the armed thugs\u2019 view.</p><p>Interacting with them at just the right level was the biggest difficulty.</p><p>\u201cWhere has my little dog gone?\u201d I said sadly. \u201cThat awful witch in the even more awful hat wants to take him away to be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, are you Dorothy?\u201d one guy asked. \u201cYou came through here before. You should be in the storm shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I\u2019ve got to find my dog first. And then I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>By now I had edged over and past Torbellino\u2019s whip and was even with his chair.</p><p>Quick whisked out from behind the chair and ran into the hall.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d I cried, dashing after him.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss,\u201d the dazed thug was saying. \u201cThis whole scene looks more like that Alice down the rabbit hole thing, only with dogs.\u201d</p><p>I heard the real Toto following our trail, arfing all the way.</p><p>\u201cSay I can shoot this one, please.\u201d</p><p>No one or no thing guarded the elevator bank. I pressed a button and hoped.</p><p>\u201cYou, there. Dorothy. I want that dog!\u201d</p><p>Miss Gulch didn\u2019t seem to notice Toto had added a hundred and forty-six pounds. Or that Dorothy had added a bust and a business suit. Like feral zombies, feral CinSims seemed to degrade. I was getting a whole new insight on CinSims, but probably wouldn\u2019t live long enough to come to any conclusions but my own.</p><p>\u201cShaddup in the hall,\u201d came from the office area. This order was followed by a sharp crack of a whip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Dorothy,\u201d I told Almira, \u201cand your hat is horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of all the nerve, you young whippersnapper. You\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened ... on another CinSim, garbed in checked pants, brocaded vest, and black hat.</p><p>\u201cAlmira Gulch,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re a mean, wicked woman. I\u2019ll see Dorothy home before the big storm turns into a tornado. You\u2019d better find your bicycle and ride like Hell for home yourself. Come on, Dorothy, and your big dog too. There\u2019s no time to be lost.\u201d</p><p>Professor Marvel grabbed my arm to hustle me into the elevator car, with Quick behind me turning to snap at Almira Gulch to stay behind.</p><p>\u201cThis is very kind of you,\u201d I told my CinSim escort, \u201cbut I hear the elevator cables don\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for their kind. I\u2019ll have you know, young lady, I have been to Kansas City in my travels, where everything is up-to-date, and have ridden in these new-fangled things called elevators for years. Oh my, I have ridden in even more exciting aerial transportation, my dear. Now. Up, up, and away.\u201d</p><p>We did indeed whoosh upward in a working elevator. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A PERFECTLY SOUND Ben Hassard awaited us in the penthouse suite entry hall, although he wore a roomy Asian robe over his trousers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so relieved that you and the dog made it past those vicious criminals, Miss Street,\u201d Hassard said. \u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one to worry about at all,\u201d said Professor Marvel, sketching a bow. \u201cI must leave now. I\u2019m expected in a storm cellar. Or was it a storm?\u201d</p><p>The doors automatically closed on him. The future Wizard of Oz was running out on me, just as he had on Dorothy, at the end.</p> <p>\u201cAnother CinSim,\u201d Ben, er, marveled. \u201cI must say they do put on a show, popping up here and there. Glad you look hale and hearty. Tallgrass and the other FBI man and Mr. Christopher are conferring in the screening room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreening room? What are they doing there?\u201d</p><p>After my impulsive exit, I\u2019d expected a warmer welcome back.</p><p>I followed Quicksilver into the main room and saw the storm churning like the contents of a giant blender outside the glass doors to the balcony. It sounded as loud up here too.</p><p>Ben Hassard followed, apologizing. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong about the film I sold Mr. Christopher. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s the source of all my troubles. That demonic mobster wants something on it. Perhaps some hidden material that\u2019s incriminating.\u201d</p> <p>I had no time to disabuse Hassard of his relatively safe and normal worldview as I headed for the home theater, opening the double doors so all three could enter at once, Hassard, Quicksilver, and I.</p><p>The movie was unreeling, but standing silhouettes obscured most of the screen.</p><p>\u201cSo I get it\u2019s a priceless piece of film history,\u201d Ric was arguing. \u201cAm I supposed to believe you just wanted it as a collector? A little something the Mexican drug cartels were so hot to have they\u2019d torture and kill for it?\u201d</p><p>Snow\u2019s powerful stage voice sounded weary, as if Ric had been grilling him for a long time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, Montoya. I\u2019m planning to model the centerpiece of my billion-dollar Inferno Hotel and Casino expansion on the look of this film. It cost almost three million dollars to produce in 1927, a phenomenal amount for the time, and I plan to reproduce the sets in reality at a phenomenal amount for our time. The film is a guide, but also the crown jewel of my new multientertainment facility. I have no idea why an international thug like Torbellino would want a cultural icon such as Metropolis.\u201d</p><p>I could hear Ric\u2019s exasperated sigh from the doorway as he turned back to view the silent film. \u201cThere must be something in the film that will make El Demonio richer and more powerful. Nothing else motivates him.\u201d I saw his profile turn toward Snow\u2019s. \u201cOr Vegas moguls like you.\u201d</p> <p>Snow\u2019s silhouetted shoulders shrugged. I recognized the lines of his jacket, but wondered if Ric had seen his albino throat bearing the telltale bruise\u2014in his case\u2014of an angrily returned paranormal kiss.</p><p>Oh, gosh. Did lips leave recognizable prints too? I\u2019d left enough Midnight Cherry Shimmer on Ric during this trip for him to recognize the pattern, if so.</p><p>Tallgrass was sitting in one of the aisle seats actually watching the film, so Quicksilver trotted down the shallow stairs to sit beside him.</p><p>Ric turned back in a flash. \u201cDelilah? You\u2019re safe and back.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the doors to embrace me. \u201cWe saw the lightning fizzle out, so I figured you and Quick were all right even though we couldn\u2019t reach your cell phone. The WTCH tower is down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill standing but shorted out. Dead. The tornado the broken coven summoned is still threatening Emerald City and so is the Wendigo. And Tallgrass, you might want to look into Lili West at the local Sunset City, when this is all done. I think she\u2019s the head weather witch around here.\u201d</p><p>Ric laughed and pulled me closer as Tallgrass looked on, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou did some A-one detecting on your solo day in town, Del. And El Demonio and his men in the lobby? How\u2019d you get past them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy being born Black Irish and passing for a CinSim. They\u2019re not too tuned into the vintage motion-picture world. They mistook Quick and me for Dorothy and Toto, who are still running loose down there.\u201d</p><p>Snow\u2019s brief bark of laughter startled us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about Delilah being trapped between a supernatural storm and a horde of zombies, Christophe?\u201d Ric demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis \u2018Demon\u2019 of yours, like all brutal and greedy humans, is also stupid. What would he do with a piece of rare film like Metropolis? He\u2019d be too ignorant to even exploit its characters as CinSims, and the only truly valuable one, the only commercially sexy one, so to speak, is the woman-made-robot.\u201d</p><p>I resented Snow making light of the monster who\u2019d controlled Ric\u2019s childhood. I had to say something.</p><p>\u201cEl Demonio lives to torture and kill, with drugs and drug money and with his own hand. I think you can imagine what more than three hundred strokes of his bullwhip would feel like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Snow left the shadows to come and face me. \u201cYou make that experience so very vivid, Miss Street. Thanks for educating me.\u201d</p><p>Sunglasses don\u2019t offer much eye contact, so I stared at his throat. A white silk aviator scarf, like those he gave away at the end of his rock concerts, concealed the place my mouth had bruised.</p><p>Oh, this was awkward.</p><p>That\u2019s what you get for confusing sex with revenge, Irma twitted me. You owe him again. That look is so dashing young Howard Hughes on him, don\u2019t you think?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have repulsed me more, which got my brain in gear.</p><p>\u201cSnow\u2019s right, though,\u201d I said, walking past him and Ric to face the movie screen. \u201cI can see that Torbellino would like the same things the Nazis did about this film. The jerky, robotlike workers slaving away belowground like zombies twelve hours a day. The masters lording it in their gleaming towers like Vegas moguls. It\u2019s El Demonio\u2019s hidden zombie empire, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t covet this film for sentimental reasons, Miss Street,\u201d Snow said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if he\u2019d need an Oscar award for Best Exploitation of Humankind he could display on a shelf.\u201d</p><p>Oscar. Hollywood\u2019s prized golden statuette.</p><p>The movie screen even now was revealing the passionate young girl and worker\u2019s salvation, Maria, being \u201cprocessed\u201d by the masters into a gleaming, unemotional robot, the triumph of scientific method over humanity, losing her life and her heroic young lover. Speaking of which ...</p><p>\u201cRic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Delilah.\u201d He stepped to my side. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid ... you turn the elevator cables silver so the zombies couldn\u2019t climb them inside the Emerald City towers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver has much mojo,\u201d Tallgrass said, his voice definitive in the darkness as the unwinding film flickered over all our faces. \u201cDog has silver on his collar. Delilah Street wears silver. Mi amigo has been reborn with the Silver Eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think silver controls zombies,\u201d Ric said. \u201cAt least it seems to since I\u2019ve acquired the vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver killed vampires in the old lore, as well as were-wolves,\u201d Snow mused, as if contributing to the campfire ghost stories.</p><p>I was feeling as weary as he sounded. \u201cAnd black-and-white film used enough silver nitrate that many classic movies were destroyed to strip the silver from them. Is there any way El Demonio could\u2014\u201d</p><p>I noticed, in the meantime, that Ric had begun moving slowly down the shallow stairs toward the movie screen, as if in a trance.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the most luminous films I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cNo wonder no complete versions could be found. They would have yielded too much silver to save. And the robot, she\u2019s a moon goddess for a technological age. Look at her. She\u2019s all silver, an armored Joan of Arc. Think of the concentrated aura her image would have on the black film strip. She\u2019d be blinding. An angel of light.\u201d</p><p>He walked right up to the screen as if hypnotized, or hypnotizing.</p><p>And the silver robot moved to meet him where pixel or plasma met flesh and blood. Ric reached out a hand and a robotic arm lifted to touch a silver gauntlet to his fingers.</p><p>The theme of the film was what Lilah West had said about work and art and passion: \u201cThe heart lies between the hand and the head.\u201d</p><p>Ric\u2019s hand guided the silver robot as if leading her in a gavotte as she stepped out of the film and into the room, jerkily glancing around like Frankenstein\u2019s suddenly alive bride. Life-size, like a real girl.</p><p>We all watched, stricken to stone by Silver Screen lightning.</p><p>I knew Ric had found and raised zombies since he was a toddler.</p><p>Now he\u2019d raised the first CinSim never touched by the Immortality Mob, or bonded to any imported human corpse. One only and wholly itself. Herself. The Eve of zombies. The Silver Zombie supreme. The supernaturally scientific creature El Demonio must have wanted to conjure himself, that he could somehow use to raise and control and master a worldwide zombie empire.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d she said in a flat, dead tone viewers of the silent film had never heard.</p><p>To Ric.</p><p>Oooh, Irma bemoaned in my ear. We have got one hot little Roomba robot vacuum cleaner on our hands. Master? I wonder if she does dudes. Kiss your romantic aspirations good-bye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNOW,\u201d SAID SNOW, \u201cthat we know what Torbellino wants, we have the key to a battle plan. Mr. Tallgrass.\u201d</p><p>We had adjourned to the living room.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Tallgrass advanced, Quicksilver by his side.</p><p>Snow said, \u201cI can project the image of the Silver Zombie face ten stories high on the black storm clouds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be just a shadow of the real thing,\u201d I objected. \u201cWill it project any silver power on its own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Ric thought.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Snow decreed. \u201cIt\u2019ll have the power to amaze and distract the drug lord\u2019s forces. If I banish the weather witches\u2019 circling tornado,\u201d Snow asked Tallgrass, \u201ccan you turn back the Wendigo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. With Quicksilver\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontoya?\u201d Snow asked.</p> <p>Ric shook himself back into sober reality and stepped forward, shadowed by his glitzy robot handmaiden.</p><p>Snow posed a second question. \u201cYou called the Silver Zombie to life. Do you have the power to banish El Demonio from the lobby and his Alpine zombies from the Emerald City walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure to try,\u201d Ric said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d I asked, feeling a very selfish Dorothy confronting a contrary wizard.</p><p>\u201cYour choice,\u201d Snow said. \u201cYou can soar in the storm clouds with me or fight in the basement barricades with Montoya and friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah\u2019s coming with me,\u201d Ric said.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t argue. We had the silver mojo, no matter how iffy it was at the moment. And I still had to figure out exactly what the robot Ric had seduced off the screen was.</p><p>Quicksilver had padded over to lick my wrist. I hadn\u2019t noticed until then that I\u2019d scraped the skin raw in the battle to cut the WTCH coax cable. It healed as I watched.</p><p>\u201cGood dog. I hope our efforts to get Kansas skies back to the clear blue color of your eyes work,\u201d I told him. \u201cIs Tallgrass shaman enough to keep you safe?\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver shifted from foot to foot like the Cowardly Lion being bashful. I realized he wanted to convey, modestly, that he was accompanying Tallgrass to protect him, as I intended to protect Ric.</p><p>Who, I wondered, would ever dare to protect Snow?</p><p>THERE WAS NO question that Ric\u2019s silver elevator cables worked for our party, if not zombies. Escorting the robot was like moving an automated department store mannequin to another floor.</p><p>When we didn\u2019t move, she didn\u2019t move. When we did, she marched in our wake.</p><p>What I found Mister-Spock \u201cfascinating\u201d was that I could see the climbing zombies loosen their grips on the guy wires and plummet to the ground as our see-through glass elevator car on the inside came even with them on the outside.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s why Marriott Hotels favored glass lobby elevators and open atria. To keep the zombies down.</p><p>By the time we reached the lobby, the attacking zombies, or what was left of them, were converging with us on Torbellino and his occupying minions.</p><p>Maria might be a zombie lord\u2019s magnet, but now she was a zombie repellent.</p><p>They circled the lower floor and the yellow brick road still speckled with blood. Their skeletal jaws shivered and chattered with anticipation, but either Ric or Maria broadcast a vibe that kept them outside an invisible circle of sorts.</p><p>Unfortunately, El Demonio was inside it. He wore the same black leather hat that had shaded his sinister features in the WTCH parking lot sunshine. Here, the unblinking narrowed black eyes and slit vertical nostrils over mercilessly thin lips accentuated his resemblance to a snake despite his solid, stocky body in an expensive, but sleazy shiny suit.</p><p>He was smoking a long, fat cigar and the air reeked.</p><p>He uncoiled from his cushy lobby chair, standing and drawing the whip butt to his right side.</p><p>Ric stepped forward to confront him.</p><p>I waited for the familiar to fill my hands with the twin whip butts it had produced on occasion, but it was ... AWOL. Maria and I and all our silver mojo were suddenly no more than witnesses to the gunfight at the OK Corral.</p><p>Men! That\u2019s why they drive us nuts.</p><p>Torbellino lifted his right arm and the great long whip arched up to strike. The thing seemed as long as the Loch Ness monster, loops of braided leather that a rippling tidal wave of motion could propel until its distant, delicate tongue struck and seared flesh like a razor\u2019s edge.</p><p>Ric stared at the stirring serpent that seemed an extension of El Demonio\u2019s arm and hand. Under Ric\u2019s gaze, the dark braided leather so like scales lightened in color to shining silver. As the color lightened, the long whip grew heavy. El Demonio\u2019s arm started trembling while the whip\u2019s increasing weight dragged it down along his leg to the floor. He\u2019d become a Midas whose gift was his curse.</p><p>A thirty-foot silver whip is far too heavy to wield.</p><p>Ric had no trouble walking up to his panting, disbelieving enemy and wresting the whip butt from his palsied grasp.</p><p>He cracked the whip against his leg, not lifting the ponderous silver train, but sending a psychic shiver that reached the end to lick out like a tongue and slash the huddled zombie bodies devouring each other into smaller and smaller pieces of bone and leathery skin and shreds of hair and lacerated eyeball.</p><p>El Demonio curled into himself like a cobra in a basket, all passive body and lethal, poisonous black eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done here in Kansas,\u201d Ric told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost. You\u2019ve lost the bulk of your zombies and your most murderous human underlings. Taking over the weather witches has exposed their petty crimes of abusing the weather for financial gain. Their national council and the local law will shut them down. The U.S.-Mexican drug cartel task force will track and bust all your smuggling operations from here to whatever hell you run home to in the southern hemisphere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying that for years, hijo,\u201d Torbellino answered. \u201cLaw enforcement will never shut down the drug and zombie traffic. People want that. I\u2019ll have another zombie army in no time. I don\u2019t need just you to raise them, as when I started out. El Demonio is King of the Zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ric said. \u201cI\u2019m taking your title, and your zombies. I\u2019ve raised the Silver Zombie to help me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shiny wind-up toy?\u201d He pointed behind me to Maria. \u201cOnce again you work for me, goat-boy. You raised her without my having to pay the Immortality Mob for it. I always knew you\u2019d be useful someday; that\u2019s why I let you live. She has quite a silver suit of armor, but beware the demon within. Only I can bring it to proper life, and when I do ... The Millennium Revelation has taught me a few more tricks since I brought you up, hijo, and I can bring you down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Ric said calmly.</p><p>El Demonio seemed to turn purple with impotent rage and puff up like some venomous variety of snake. \u201cI will kill you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can. That anyone can. I\u2019ve been to death and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am death. Kill me, then,\u201d he ordered. \u201cSee if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Sometime. When you\u2019ve lost everything and it suits the world to be rid of you. For now I\u2019ll let you live. You may be useful someday. And you taught me that waiting is worse than death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen wait some more, hijo.\u201d</p><p>He took a last puff on the cigar, the exhaled smoke swirling around and around him, magnifying into a stifling cloud of fumes.</p><p>For a moment the smoke lifted to reveal a sated, red-eyed chupacabra puffing on El Demonio\u2019s cigar.</p><p>And then even the smoke was gone, leaving behind the sulfurous stench of a chupacabra.</p><p>I held my breath and darted to retrieve my frivolous bag of precious cargo from under the chair. The monster had been sitting right over it. Maybe the ruby slippers weakened his mojo.</p><p>Ric eyed it.</p><p>\u201cEmerald City souvenir,\u201d I explained. \u201cGirly stuff.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at the reeking spot still wreathed in smoke wisps.</p><p>\u201cMagician or shape-shifter?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOr demon, finally living up to his name,\u201d Ric said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in stopping his operations than catching him. I could use some pure Kansas air.\u201d</p><p>Ric turned and went into the dark and, okay, stormy night.</p><p>I followed. And that damn Silver Zombie came tagging along right after us.</p><p>THE BATTLE FOR Bloody Kansas, 2013-style, was a good ole Fourth of July fireworks show in the sky over Wichita. Ric and I heard it heating up and looked overhead as if we were viewing a predicted eclipse of the moon, only we witnessed the clash of myths and monsters.</p><p>\u201cIs that Christophe out on the balcony?\u201d Ric asked. \u201cOr Tallgrass?\u201d</p><p>From this distance it was hard to tell who or what the wind-whipped figure was. I saw the figure\u2019s arm scatter something on the wind, a golden dust that blew away in expanding circles, like a whirlwind growing shape and form and gilt scales until the winged dragon Gargouille from a Paris distant in time and space was born again as a bright gold spiraling sunrise against the dark clouds.</p><p>Of course. I\u2019d seen Snow strew these same ashes into the air beneath the Karnak Hotel to raise the French river dragon to aid in Ric\u2019s rescue. A mote of white reflected lightning near the dragon\u2019s great, lashing, metal-scaled head. Guess I\u2019d missed a hell of a bucking dragon ride.</p><p>The dragon breathed fire against ice, warmth into cold and the Wendigo\u2019s scowling cloud-face. A vee of smaller bright-winged forces also shot through the blue-black darkness. Could it be? Gargoyles in formation from Our Lady of the Lake? And down the dark and twisting clouds came a foggy stream of running wolves with luminous eyes, Quicksilver at their forefront, snapping at the head of the Wendigo, biting it away in airy fangfuls.</p><p>And there? Did I see Almira Gulch and Lili West caught up in the twister, riding a tandem bicycle, and a longhorn steer spinning over and over with a chupacabra? My old bungalow tumbling like a die on a gambling table, and the huge glass bubble of a snow globe falling with a Wicked Queen in its icy heart?</p><p>Or was my subconscious just putting forms on phantasms of the mist?</p><p>The storm clouds dissipated into smoky tendrils as we watched and the moon shone through the fading shreds of storm, as silver and serene and blank as the face of Maria\u2019s robot.</p><p>RIC AND I strolled out to the far edge of the empty lot, where I checked to see that Dolly was still safely parked.</p><p>\u201cChristophe owns this thing, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d I asked Ric as Maria shadowed us. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be happy to take her off our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Ric said. \u201cI called her into 3-D being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s just another Zobo you have to take responsibility for?\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around me. \u201cNot personally. It\u2019ll take an army to keep her out of the hands of the Immortality Mob, or your CinSim-obsessed landlord, Hector Nightwine, or El Demonio when he gets over losing Kansas and comes for Nevada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had the bastard cornered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. The Silver Zombie holds some powerful potential for him we don\u2019t know about. I didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIs death good enough for your betrayers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but it will come for them, with or without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done enough this trip,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis trip,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut the journey never ends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I TURNED FROM the green-mirrored penthouse suite bar, pleased to have seen only my reflection.</p><p>My gown\u2019s emerald-satin bias-cut skirt swirled around my legs as it wafted to display my ankles and the demure ruby red slippers I wore. So I was a bit Merry Christmas-y for summer, so sue me. This was my last personal appearance at Emerald City and I wanted to make it an occasion.</p><p>I craned my neck to see who had just committed a wolf whistle when my admittedly bare back was turned.</p><p>I faced a full house of suspects, so to speak.</p> <p>The penthouse suite\u2019s long green leather sofa now seated three men, Ric, Leonard Tallgrass, and Ben Hassard.</p><p>Snow lounged in an emerald-velvet club chair and I was even less sure now that either he or Ric qualified simply as a man.</p><p>Quicksilver lounged in front of Tallgrass on the grass-green carpeting in his \u201cSphinx\u201d position, belly down and forelegs extended. I knew he wasn\u2019t simply a dog.</p><p>The row of human male eyes were still dazzled from eyeing my gownless back with the silver familiar forming a long supple diamond dividing line down my spine. Even the familiar was putting on the dog tonight. Usually it was content to morph into rhinestones or Austrian crystals, since I was no jewelry snob.</p><p>Snow, of course, was seeing everything through very dark sunglasses.</p> <p>I held up a tall, stemmed glass.</p><p>Finally. A little male attention that wasn\u2019t focused on the Silver Zombie standing at robotic attention behind a seated Ric. She sure did shine.</p><p>Normally, I\u2019m not a show-off, but my new cocktail creation deserved a dramatic introduction. It flouted the Emerald City color scheme, being an opaque, faintly blue silver color, whereas absinthe was opaque green. A dash of vivid blue cura\u00e7ao at the bottom made it something of a Tequila Sunrise in a blue mood and reflected a circle of electric blue at the cocktail\u2019s top rim.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, and lady,\u201d I said. \u201cIntroducing the latest entry in Delilah\u2019s Darkside Bar Book of Paranormally Phenomenal Cocktails, I give you ... the Silver Zombie.\u201d</p><p>The applause and whistles still didn\u2019t give away the lone wolf among them.</p><p>Snow wouldn\u2019t whistle even onstage. Ric had a mischievous streak but had been acting too possessive lately to draw other men\u2019s attention to me.</p> <p>Leonard Tallgrass cultivated a poker face, but just might be up to it. Ben Hassard, patched up and very grateful to me, might have been unable to quell his enthusiasm.</p><p>Quicksilver had a lot of wolf in him, but was a howler by nature. And Maria, the Metropolis robot, lacked the necessary moving mouth parts.</p><p>We really must get this metal maiden a jazzier name, Irma said. \u201cI\u2019ve Just Met a Robot Named Maria\u201d won\u2019t burn out any lights on Broadway.</p><p>Irma was right. She needed an updated name. Maybe Brigitte, for the teenage German actress who\u2019d played both human and robot roles. Darn, sounded too sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the drink?\u201d Ben Hassard wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThree chilled ounces each of Fuse blueberry raspberry water champagne. An ounce of Jos\u00e9 Cuervo Silver tequila, an ounce and a half of lime vodka, an ounce of Aliz\u00e9 Bleu brandy, fruit and vodka mix, and a dash of blue cura\u00e7ao dribbled down the inside of the glass so it sinks to the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like enough goodies to make a zombie out of me,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>So I gestured to the line of four Silver Zombies on the malachite bar top behind me.</p> <p>Maria surprised me by being the first to approach, eerily noiseless for a silver metal woman. Actually, the film robot\u2019s likeness had been constructed from a new material, plastic wood, painted silver and bronze. Brigitte had to act as her own body double and wear the modern suit of armor even during nonspeaking camera shots, although it cut and bruised her body. How ironic it was, but not unlikely, that a film about abused workers would abuse its lead actress.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I realized that Maria was already a true CinSim. She had a built-in zombie body, that of the dead actress, Brigitte Helm. That is what\u2014who\u2014Ric had raised. How mind-bending was that? I thought I\u2019d keep that insight to myself for a while.</p><p>Maria turned and, doing her C-3PO routine, brought a glass to ... Ric.</p><p>The poor futuristic thing still thought like an Old World body servant. I was probably the only one in this room who knew that CinSims could \u201cgrow\u201d beyond their original film personas, so I hoped this one got wise to the imprisoned superstar future Snow had in mind for her sooner rather than later.</p><p>Did the Inferno Hotel honcho somehow read or guess my rebellious wish?</p><p>Snow stood abruptly to claim two glasses from the bar and present them to Tallgrass and Hassard, now rising from their seats to accept them.</p><p>Snow stepped back to the bar, leaned against it, and took the last glass. Of course, from that strategic position he could better view his favorite part of my anatomy and simultaneously remind me of what I owed him. Three hundred and twenty-two bottles of beer on the wall ... the paraphrased drinking song ran through my head. I\u2019d never dreamed that stupid verse would have an erotic connection.</p><p>Heck, honey, Irma pointed out, they all can eyeball your naked back with that mirror behind the bar. She giggled. Except your skin looks almost Wicked Witch of the West green. It matches your gown, but it\u2019s your least favorite color, and you\u2019re even wearing her shoes. Remember, Dorothy got the ruby slippers from the WWW\u2019s dead body through the Good Witch Glinda\u2019s intervention. Any message for the future in those facts?</p><p>Maybe for Lilah West back in Vegas\u2019s Sunset City, I told Irma. She\u2019d always wanted to play Glinda. Perhaps she finally did somehow, seeing to her wicked sister\u2019s coven of weather witches fall from grace here.</p><p>\u201cA toast,\u201d Ben Hassard announced to those present, which did not include Irma.</p><p>He lifted his Silver Zombie. \u201cTo Emerald City\u2019s booming future, to the destruction of all my immortal enemies, and to the good fortune of all my unsuspected friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo unsuspected friends.\u201d</p><p>The end of the phrase was murmured around the room as Ric moved beside me. His arm slipped around my bare waist, caressing me as he and I chimed glass rims. I felt my world had snapped back into place after a few moments of temporary insanity.</p><p>\u201cAmor,\u201d he murmured against the glass rims that separated us.</p><p>\u201cAmor,\u201d I repeated the toast, under my breath.</p><p>Meanwhile, the public self-congratulations continued.</p><p>\u201cTo unsuspected enemies and immortal friends,\u201d Snow rephrased Ben\u2019s toast, his sonorous voice wafting from behind my back. \u201cMay we always be able to tell them apart.\u201d</p><p>Quicksilver added a canine arf of agreement to that, and of course we all laughed, as the cast so often did at the end of so many movies.</p><p>Maria, the universally sought CinSim robot from Metropolis, did not laugh. She just stood there in aloof metal majesty and shone like the once and future star she was and would be.</p><p>Forever and ever.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>I was betting she was a virgin, poor thing. </p> </body></html>"]
