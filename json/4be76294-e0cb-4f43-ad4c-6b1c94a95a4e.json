Koh Phangan at its best. That was the last thing I clearly remember; everything else filters back hazy, like it\u2019s been covered in a layer of gauze. I had a few drinks, a few pills, danced my ass off, and then woke up here, in some cramped little room on the lower level of a boat. I can tell it\u2019s a boat even though there are no windows and the door is locked. The rocking motion. The sea salt air. Footsteps above me, muffled voices, and no one responds when I bang on the door. There\u2019s only the thin shaft of pale light that trickles in from under the door. There\u2019s no one in this room but myself, and I don\u2019t need a mirror to know my face has been battered. My left eye is swollen shut and my jaw is tender to the touch. Still have all the teeth, though my lip is split, but that could just be because I\u2019m dehydrated.</p><p>I stand up, sway on my feet. The room lurches and I nearly fall, but I don\u2019t. Even in this condition, I\u2019ve got good sea legs. Dad always said so. That\u2019s the only time Dad and I ever seemed able to stand each other\u2014when we were out on his yacht. Still, he\u2019d have to make sure he took his meclozine an hour before getting onto the boat or he\u2019d be puking over the side and wailing that he wanted to get back to the harbor.</p><p>I make it to the door and try it again, as though it might have somehow unlocked itself. I pound on it. \u201cLet me out of here, assholes!\u201d I shout.</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause above me, then laughter. I don\u2019t recognize the voices.</p><p>I sit down. My head feels funny. It feels funny in such a way that I know someone must\u2019ve slipped something into one of my drinks, or given me a pill that wasn\u2019t what they claimed it to be. Was Imogen in on this, too? No. She was just some silly girl on vacation from Dublin or Wicklow or one of those dumpy Irish cities.</p><p>I don\u2019t know exactly how long I sit for, my back against the wall. The fuzziness in my head has started to clear, although there\u2019s still a bitter taste in my mouth, like I licked a battery or something. Heavy footsteps approach, pause outside. The door inches open.</p><p>\u201cStay right where you are,\u201d a low voice growls.</p><p>Two men step in. I recognize neither, though if I were expecting pirates, these two aren\u2019t far off the mark. The taller one\u2019s grizzled and looks like he hits the bottle a little too often. His face is riddled with pockmarks and his teeth are terribly crooked. The younger, shorter one actually has a red bandana wrapped around his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the eyepatch?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shoots me a look. \u201cDid we say you could talk?\u201d</p><p>He throws something down at my feet. It\u2019s a plastic bottle, half-filled with water. While I\u2019m grateful for the drink, I\u2019m a little disappointed that the receptacle is not a bota bag or something a little more authentic. \u201cIs this bottle BPA free?\u201d I ask after I take a sip.</p><p>Bandana continues to glare at me but the older one chuckles. \u201cA pretty boy and a wise ass,\u201d he says. \u201cAren\u2019t you a catch.\u201d</p><p>I take another sip. The water stings the cut on my lower lip, but I welcome the pain because it\u2019s sharp and it helps clear the cloudiness from my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were fishing. You should\u2019ve told me\u2014I would\u2019ve brought my gear. Where are we, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really any of your concern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what exactly is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. And who might you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to concern yourself with that,\u201d Snaggletooth says. \u201cFor the time being, you stay here. We\u2019ll let you go, pretty boy, when your daddy-o pays up.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. \u201cHow much?\u201d I finally say.</p><p>He smirks. \u201c7.2 million.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a random number, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your damn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Snaggletooth rubs the lower part of his face. \u201cWell then I suppose we\u2019ll have to follow through with what we said we\u2019d do to you. And honestly, I\u2019d be just as happy watching the sharks rip you to pieces as I would gutting you myself. It\u2019s an exquisite pleasure to play a hand in watching lazy, self-entitled pieces of shit like you meet their ends. So your daddy-o either pays or doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t matter much to me\u2014either way, I\u2019ll be a happy man.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shine in such a way that tells me he is speaking the honest to god truth. He winks, then the two leave the room, locking the door behind them. There\u2019s no way my father would pay that much money. Not for me, anyway. Maybe for my brother, Cameron, but there\u2019s no sign of him here, and anyway, he would never let himself get in a situation where abduction would be possible. He\u2019s just not that kind of guy. I, on the other hand, apparently am.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I say, to no one in particular.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to get myself out of this one.</p><p>Chapter 2: Jill</p><p>It\u2019s bittersweet, this graduation. I attend because most of my friends are up there on stage, while I\u2019m sitting in the audience. I can\u2019t help but wonder how things might have worked out differently if the accident hadn\u2019t happened. Dad would be alive. Mom would not be in a wheelchair. I would be up there graduating, too.</p><p>Of course, I shouldn\u2019t be thinking like this, and I know it. I\u2019ll graduate next year\u2014hopefully\u2014and then I can still do everything I imagined I would. Get a job, my own place, try to carve out a life of my own. Except I won\u2019t be traveling to any far off city; I can\u2019t leave Mom, even though she\u2019s told me more than once that I shouldn\u2019t let any of this get in the way of what I want to do.</p><p>I get home that evening after celebrating out on the town with my friend, Jessica, and her family, who flew in from the Midwest. Mom\u2019s nurse, Sharon, is on her way out, but she stops at the door and asks me how my day was.</p><p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThe graduation was really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be your time soon,\u201d she tells me. Sharon is slightly heavyset with short, curled blond hair, exactly the way you\u2019d picture a nurse, minus the white uniform and nurse\u2019s cap. \u201cYour mom\u2019s still awake; I think she wouldn\u2019t mind if you stopped in there for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I drop my purse on the kitchen table next to a pile of mail. I walk down the hallway and into the living room, which, since the accident, has been converted into Mom\u2019s bedroom. The blinds aren\u2019t closed all the way on the bay windows and the moonlight filters in, casting the room in a milky glow. Mom\u2019s wheelchair sits near the bed like a faithful steed.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I say.</p><p>She\u2019s lying in bed but turns her head to look at me. Even though the room is dimly lit, I can see that her eyes have that cloudy look they sometimes get when she\u2019s on her pain medication.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d she says. \u201cHow was graduation? I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t make it to the ceremony\u2014I really would\u2019ve liked to see you get your diploma. I know how hard you\u2019ve worked for it.\u201d</p><p>I sit in the wingback chair beside her bed. Underneath the sheet and lightweight cotton blanket, her body is little more than skin wrapped around bones. We looked a lot like, my mother and I; before the accident, people used to ask if we were sisters. She always got a big kick out of that, but it was true: she looked great. She did yoga regularly and was training to do her first half marathon. Her vibrant blond hair showed no signs of going gray, and she had bright blue eyes, like sapphires with the sun shining through them. I\u2019d overheard my father say that to her admiringly on more than one occasion.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my graduation, Mom,\u201d I gently remind her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to see me graduate next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, I doubt that.\u201d She smiles thinly and sighs. \u201cYou should go to bed, sweetheart. It\u2019s late. You\u2019ve got to be up early tomorrow.\u201d She reaches over and squeezes my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to visit on Sunday,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ll email you pictures, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going down there. It would do you some good to get away. Lorrie and Bill need you. I just wish I could go with you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been working at Sea Horse Ranch, down in Half Moon Bay, since I was thirteen. My mom\u2019s childhood friend, Lorrie, and her husband, Bill, own it, and they\u2019d hired me one summer to muck out stalls and help take care of the horses. As I\u2019d gotten older, my duties expanded to include teaching lessons, training horses, finally culminating in supervising the teenagers who attended the ranch\u2019s summer camp program. Working there was, in a way, like a rite of passage in my circle of friends, yet they had all moved on; they\u2019re living in places like New York City and Boston as newly minted college graduates, on their way to fulfilling careers. I try not to think of myself as the one who got left behind, but the truth of it is, I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s still here. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to spend my summer shoveling horse shit and supervising unruly teenagers.</p><p>At some point, the ranch got a reputation for being a good place to send teens whose parents felt they were headed down the wrong path. Bill and Lorrie didn\u2019t mind; they\u2019ve always been do-gooder types who would welcome anyone into their home, and they truly believe that nothing can\u2019t be cured by a day outside spent on horseback.</p><p>It\u2019s when I\u2019m about to leave that I notice the orchid. It\u2019s sitting on a small side table by the window, half a dozen large white blossoms dangling from a curved stem. The flowers look so luscious they might be edible.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous?\u201d Mom says, when she sees where my gaze has gone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, though I\u2019m already certain I know who sent them, which makes them a lot less beautiful.</p><p>\u201cSean sent them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. But, that\u2019s better than him stopping by in person.\u201d I fight the urge to not go over there and swat the plant off the table, how the shattering ceramic would be music to my ears.</p><p>\u201cJill Freyss-Charon,\u201d Mom says. \u201cThere is no need to speak that way, especially after someone just did something so thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, though she\u2019s not\u2014there is nothing thoughtful about Sean Wentworth whatsoever. Calculating, sure. Manipulating, absolutely. But thoughtful? No.</p><p>\u201cHe just adores you, honey. I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t give him another chance.\u201d She looks at the orchid again and smiles. \u201cIt made me happy to get it. It\u2019s been awhile since I last felt happy.\u201d</p><p>Since the accident, Mom\u2019s memory has been a touchy thing. Her short-term memory is shot; I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019d told her I would not be graduating, but I would be going to the ceremony anyway to watch my friends get their diplomas. When her memory is working, all she seems able to recall is how depressed she is, which, considering she used to be the most optimistic person I knew, is pretty depressing in and of itself. She also seems only to remember the very best things about Sean; she\u2019s somehow convinced herself that the accident was the reason Sean and I broke up, and therefore, was inadvertently her fault. All untrue, of course, but she refuses or is incapable of remembering it as anything else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going, Mom,\u201d I say. I go over and kiss her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pack and then get down to the ranch. I\u2019ll give you a call tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>I go to my room and throw some clothes into my old gym bag. I\u2019d broken up with Sean not long after my parents\u2019 car accident, though it\u2019s something I should\u2019ve done a lot sooner. He was originally from Belvedere but was living in Palo Alto and attending Stanford when we met. Dad and I had gotten ice cream at his favorite ice cream shop and were sitting in Dolores Park, watching jubilant dogs chase Frisbees. It had been one of those unseasonably warm days in early April and the park was packed; people lay out under the hot sun, bare-chested or in bathing suits. They lounged in groups on spread-out blankets, drinking Anchor Steam or PBR. Sean and his group of friends were on a blanket maybe twenty feet away, and I could see him watching me out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young man over there that seems particularly intent on staring at you,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cI think he just wants some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to throw my trash away and then go buy a pint of the salted caramel to bring home to your mother. I\u2019ll meet you back here in fifteen.\u201d He smiled as he got up, and I tried not to feel annoyed. I\u2019d gotten used to men staring at me and had pretty much perfected the art of ignoring it. For the first fifteen years of my life I\u2019d been made fun of because of my height\u2014was called giraffe, beanstalk, twig, could never find pants that were long enough. And then something happened my junior year of high school and suddenly the boys at school and random men out in public began to notice me. If it was supposed to make me feel good, it didn\u2019t, because as far as I knew, nothing had changed. What had changed? It just made them seem like assholes who were more interested in the way someone looked than who they actually were as a person. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I\u2019d had to get used to guys staring, which Sean was doing, rather blatantly. By the time Dad had dumped his napkin into the trash can, Sean was striding over, blond curls peeking out from under his San Francisco Giants ball cap.</p><p>Yes, he could\u2019ve been an Abercrombie and Fitch model. He stuffed his hands into the pockets of his beige cargo shorts and grinned. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize how incredibly random this is going to sound, but could I borrow your notes from Logic? I lost my notebook somewhere between here and campus and we\u2019ve got that big test tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>At the time, it had seemed cute, charming, even, and certainly wasn\u2019t what I was expecting the first words out of his mouth to be. After I told him he\u2019d apparently mistaken me for one of his classmates\u2014There\u2019s no way I would forget your face\u2014he asked if he could sit down, then he asked if he could take me out to dinner at La Folie that evening.</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a logic test to study for?\u201d</p><p>But we did end up going out that night, and when he called a few days later, I agreed to meet him down in Palo Alto. My parents were thrilled; I\u2019d never had a serious relationship and, since I was fast approaching twenty-two, I think they were starting to wonder if I\u2019d ever date anyone.</p><p>For a while, Sean was as charming as he\u2019d been that first day. But then little red flags began to unfurl, then wave frantically. He didn\u2019t like it when I walked ahead of him, which I did sometimes because I\u2019m a fast walker naturally, and, though he was tall, he shambled along like he was in no particular rush to get anywhere, ever. Or he\u2019d get upset if I said I was going to do something and didn\u2019t\u2014something minor, say, like go for a run when I got done with class.</p><p>\u201cBut you said you were going to,\u201d he\u2019d argue, as though I\u2019d personally offended him. \u201cYou told me that\u2019s what you were going to do.\u201d</p><p>My parents loved him, though, because none of that was on display when he was around them. To the outside world we probably seemed like the ideal couple, and people were constantly telling us what a lovely pair we made and how they couldn\u2019t wait for the wedding. Nothing made me want to run screaming from the room faster than the idea of getting married to Sean Wentworth.</p> <p>Breaking up with him after my parents\u2019 car accident seemed like the natural thing to do. Everything else in my life was completely shattered; might as well let this go, too. It took almost a week. He refused to accept that I wanted to end the relationship, then he got angry, then he cried, then he made threats, and finally, it was over.</p><p>Except it\u2019s not, I think, as I take my bag into the bathroom and pluck my toothbrush from the holder. I drop that, my hairbrush, a stick of deodorant, and some shower gel into the gym bag and try to forget about that orchid. It\u2019d been over a month since I\u2019d heard or received anything from Sean and I thought maybe we really had finally come to the end. Apparently not. Luckily, though, I\u2019m headed down to the ranch for the summer, and for as worldly and cultured as Sean likes to think he is, he\u2019s really not one for being out in the great outdoors.</p><p>I drive down to the ranch, the sun dipping below the horizon to my right. I park in front of the cabin like I\u2019ve had for the past four years now. It was a cute little one-bedroom cottage that I\u2019ve come to think of as my summer home. I step inside with my duffel bag containing several pairs of jeans, my Sea Horse Ranch t-shirts, and a few pairs of shorts and tank tops. Lorrie\u2019s been in ahead of me and opened the windows, but the cabin still feels a little stuffy. It\u2019s familiar though, the knotty pine panel walls, the wide floorboards with the braided rugs. The cabin is basically a large room that makes up the kitchen, living room, and dining area, and then a small hallway that leads to the bathroom and the bedroom. Everything looks exactly how I remember it. I sit down on the couch for a minute and lean my head back against the cushions. At least I have this, I think. While it might not sound like the most exciting summer job for a college student, it\u2019s exactly what I need right now. Though the rotation of campers changes each year, everything else here is pretty much the same. And so many things in my own life have changed, so many things have not worked out the way I imagined they would, but there is still this, and other than Bill and Lorrie announcing that they\u2019re selling the ranch and shutting down operations, I don\u2019t see how anything could possibly make this summer anything but normal.</p><p>And for that, I am grateful.</p><p>I join Bill and Lorrie at their house for dinner, and we sit out on the back deck overlooking the barn and the paddocks.</p><p>\u201cHow is your mom?\u201d Lorrie asks as she scoops quinoa salad onto my plate. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get up there in the next week or so. I feel terrible I haven\u2019t been better at visiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know you\u2019re busy,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she\u2019s doing the best she can. I\u2019m going to try to see her every Sunday, if that\u2019s okay with you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Bill says. \u201cTake whatever time you need. I mean, you\u2019re certainly an integral part of the ranch around here, but family first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of family,\u201d Lorrie says, \u201cAllison has decided to work here this summer. We\u2019re hoping you can kind of take her under your wing. She\u2019s familiar with a lot of the stuff, obviously, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have plenty of questions.\u201d</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>Allison is their daughter, the baby of the family, who, in my mind, will forever be eight and throwing a tantrum about something. The past few summers she worked up in the city at some retail job in Union Square, and I wonder what must have happened to make her resign herself to work here. She\u2019s not exactly the outdoors-y type, though it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen her so perhaps things have changed.</p><p>I get my answer bright and early the next morning. During the summer, I get up at six every day except for Sundays. I go down to the barn and feed the horses, turn them out, then muck out the stalls before going to the lodge to help with breakfast. I don\u2019t mind getting up early, when it\u2019s still semi-dark out and the birds are the only things awake. I like that special time\u2014early in the morning and twilight\u2014when the sun could be about to rise or set. I fill an oversized travel mug with strong, hot coffee and sip it as I go about my work. I\u2019m just finishing up the last stall when I hear someone walking down the barn aisle.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jill.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to turn to know who that voice belongs to. Yet, I do turn, and there she is, all five feet two of her. She\u2019s got a great body, even though she\u2019s short, a fact that she\u2019s well aware of and\u2014based on what she\u2019s wearing\u2014clearly uses to her advantage. She has always been someone who\u2019s gotten what she wants.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Allison,\u201d I say. I dump another pitchforkful of manure into the wheelbarrow. She takes a step back so the errant bits of shavings don\u2019t mar her impeccable outfit: a peach-colored romper with gold sandals that lace up her tanned calves.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad probably told you already,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m a junior counselor this year. Second in command only to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I say. \u201cGlad to see you came dressed to work.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually heading over to the lodge right now to help get things set up for the arrivals. But I wanted to come find you and say hi and give you the good news. I really think it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun, us both being counselors.\u201d</p><p>I stop shoveling shit for a second and look at her. I am seven inches taller than she is and it\u2019s hard not to see her as a kid, an annoying little sister, even though she\u2019s seventeen. She\u2019s got silver hoops in her ears and pale pink blush on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDid your parents happen to go over with you exactly what it means to be a counselor?\u201d I ask. \u201cDid they give you any of the details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . sort of. I think they thought you\u2019d go over most of it. Since you\u2019ve been here so long, and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the main jobs is the upkeep of the horses. So that means getting down here by six o\u2019clock in the morning and helping muck out stalls, feed, and scrub water buckets. Brandon isn\u2019t coming back this year, either, so there\u2019s another new counselor onboard, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Karen or something. Well, maybe she\u2019ll be more of a morning person and she\u2019ll want to get up early and do the horse chores and I can take the late morning shift.\u201d</p><p>I go back to mucking out the stall so I can roll my eyes without detection. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be totally open for that,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here around ten, so maybe that\u2019s something you can talk to her about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Allison says, completely missing\u2014or ignoring\u2014the sarcasm in my voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure it\u2019s one of the first things we go over.\u201d She skips off. I watch, feeling a thread of tension slip its way in between my shoulder blades.</p><p>Shake it off, I tell myself. This is nothing to get upset over.</p><p>Okay, so maybe it\u2019s not what I was expecting. But she\u2019s their daughter, and it\u2019s a minor change in the grand scheme of things, really. And I honestly doubt she\u2019ll last more than a week if she has to get up early to do chores.</p><p>I can handle this.</p><p>Chapter 3: Griffin</p><p>Being shut up in this tiny space is something like being in one of those sensory deprivation tanks. I start seeing things in the darkness, little bursts of color, like tiny fireworks. I wonder if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been closed up in here or it\u2019s just a lingering effect of the LSD.</p><p>There\u2019s a gentle rocking motion. It\u2019s enough to lull you back to sleep, but that\u2019s impossible right now; I\u2019ve been swimming the depths of unconsciousness for so long that my muscles feel as though they\u2019ve got electric currents running through them. I never was one who was good at staying still.</p><p>So I get up. I touch the walls, which are glossy wood. I knock into a pole that\u2019s hanging horizontally along one of the walls and I realize I am in a walk-in closet. Above me, I can hear the two guys talking, though I can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying. I go over and stand under where it sounds like they are and I hit the ceiling a few times with my fist.</p><p>\u201cHey fellas!\u201d I shout. \u201cI\u2019d like to come out of the closet now.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a pathetic joke, but I smile anyway. I\u2019ve always been good at cracking myself up and, occasionally, other people, too.</p><p>To my surprise, the door opens. It\u2019s Snaggletooth, who stands there, holding the door handle, letting a shaft of pale yellow light into the room. He stares at me, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cHave I accrued enough good behavior points to warrant a trip on deck?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do something for us,\u201d he says. He pushes the door open the rest of the way.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I smile as I walk past him. \u201cThat was a joke about coming out of the closet, though. I\u2019m not gay.\u201d</p><p>He shoves me. \u201cWe\u2019re not fucking fags!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you\u2019re going to do for us. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in a bedroom. There\u2019s a queen-sized bed flanked by two mahogany side tables. There is a mirror on the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cNice touch,\u201d I say, looking up at it.</p><p>We go up on deck. The other guy is up there, pacing, drinking a can of PBR.</p><p>\u201cStay classy,\u201d I say, nodding at the beer. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind one of those right now myself. It does feel nice to be out, though. I walk over and take a piss off the side of the boat. The boat, it turns out, is not the seventy-foot pirate vessel I\u2019d imagined, but rather, a mere forty-foot cruiser, similar to the one my old man had before he upgraded. \u201cMy dad had a boat like this. It was bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your dad shouldn\u2019t have any trouble paying your ransom,\u201d says Bandana.</p><p>I shrug and look out toward the horizon. Nothing but blue sky, blue water. Sun straight overhead. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of an asshole, if you want to know the truth. If you\u2019re so eager for money, it probably would\u2019ve been better to choose a man whose paternal leanings ran a bit deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father doesn\u2019t seem to want to take this matter as seriously as he should,\u201d Snaggletooth says. \u201cHe seems, in fact, to think it\u2019s a hoax. A ruse. A prank that maybe you are in on. So you\u2019re going to call him and tell him otherwise.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s only the two of them, as far as I can tell, Snaggletooth and Bandana. I try to piece together how this might\u2019ve all gone down, but it\u2019s just one big blank, like that part of my memory was erased entirely.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the money,\u201d Snaggletooth continues. \u201cThat\u2019s part of it. But my boss wants something else from your dad, too. A confession, of sorts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I snort. \u201cA confession? To what? Being a giant asshole? Good luck with that one, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a phone out of his pocket. \u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his phone number.\u201d This is actually the truth. I never have to call him, and even if I did, I\u2019d just go to the listing under contacts and press the call button. Dad\u2019s number is programmed in my phone under Asshat, which, on the rare occasion he does call me, always gives me a smile when Asshat Calling shows up on the screen.</p> <p>\u201cJust press call,\u201d Snaggletooth snaps. I wonder whose phone this is. I press call and bring the phone up to my ear. There isn\u2019t anything in sight except for water, but we must be near land because the phone has reception. Or they have one hell of a cell service provider.</p><p>\u201cHey, who\u2019s your cell phone provider?\u201d I ask.</p><p>They both ignore me. The phone is ringing. It rings exactly two and a half times and then Dad\u2019s voicemail picks up. Which means he pressed the ignore button. Great, Dad. Thanks.</p><p>This is Carl Alexander. Leave a message and I will get back to you at my earliest convenience . . .</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave a message?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>Snaggletooth grabs the phone from me. \u201cGoddammit,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t give a shit, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you guys let me go, I\u2019ll fly home to New York and threaten to move back in, unless he gives your boss the 7.2 million and the confession. Me doing that is far more likely to get you what you want, trust me. Here, give me the phone and I\u2019ll call him back and leave that on his voicemail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Bandana throws his beer overboard.</p><p>Snaggletooth shoves the phone back into his pocket. \u201cThe condition of your release is twofold, the confession, actually, being the more important. So if we get the money but no confession, we kill you. If we get the confession but no money, we kill you. If we get both . . . maybe we\u2019ll kill you anyway.\u201d Snaggletooth comes over and stands next to me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get your ass back down below.\u201d He pulls out a diving knife, an Atomic Ti6, made of titanium, a nasty looking motherfucker with a serrated blade. I have the very same model\u2014which I had strapped to my leg last summer when I went diving off of Kadavu Island\u2014though I widen my eyes and take a step back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like knives,\u201d I say, shuddering. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go back down if you want, but it really wouldn\u2019t make a difference if I\u2019m up here. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anywhere I can go. I can\u2019t swim,\u201d I lie.</p><p>He stares at me, running a tongue over those picket fence teeth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I continue. \u201cMy dad was always after me to join him swimming at the country club, but I had better things to do. Like playing polo and eating caviar.\u201d That would actually be my brother, Cam, but they don\u2019t have to know that. The only thing caviar is good for is smearing on your front teeth for primo photo ops.</p><p>Bandana looks at me in disbelief. \u201cSo you can ride a horse but you can\u2019t swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, thinking of all my swim team trophies my mother proudly displays on the mantelpiece in the sitting room. \u201cSo if this were the Wild West and you boys had kidnapped me on horseback, I might be in okay shape, but out here on the water . . .\u201d I smile and shrug. \u201cI\u2019m as good as dead anyways. Hope you weren\u2019t planning on getting that money. Or that confession.\u201d</p><p>Bandana glances at Snaggletooth and then looks back at me. \u201cYou\u2019re lyin\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cYour dad will pay. Shit, to a guy like him, we\u2019re not even askin\u2019 for that much to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll liquidate my trust fund. It\u2019s about ten million. He might not want to deal with the headache of having to do that, though. He\u2019ll probably just tell you to kill me. Have you talked to him? Have you talked to dear old Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked to him in Thailand,\u201d Bandana says defensively. \u201cAnd he sounded very concerned.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThen you must\u2019ve dialed the wrong number.\u201d I try to imagine Dad taking that call. It probably lasted all of 2.6 seconds before he hung up. \u201cThere is someone else I could try calling,\u201d I offer. They look at me skeptically. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve kidnapped him, too.\u201d But I know that\u2019s impossible, because Cam would never let himself get into a situation where he would be kidnapped. Cam does not dance to techno, nor imbibe anything more toxic than a glass of cognac with Dad every now and then. Cam probably sleeps with his fucking eyes open, if you want to know the truth. And maybe, just maybe, if anyone can help get me out of this mess, it will be him.</p><p>Snaggletooth grudgingly hands the phone back. \u201cDon\u2019t even think of trying to call the authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead before you get word one out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, buddies; the authorities are no friends of mine either.\u201d They watch me carefully as I dial. The phone rings exactly once and he answers.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d His voice is smooth, like water running over sea glass or caramel getting drizzled over ice cream. I can\u2019t remember the last time I talked to my brother, yet every time I hear his voice, I can\u2019t help but think: This time will be different. This time he\u2019ll decide he actually likes me.</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYour brother,\u201d I add. Snaggletooth is watching me closely.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we got the right guy?\u201d I hear Bandana whisper loudly. \u201cNo one in his family seems to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d Cam says finally. \u201cCarl said you might be calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did he? Then maybe he filled you in on my . . . situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which situation would that be? Tripping on acid in Tokyo? Losing your passport in Belize? Getting thrown into a Mexican jail? Would you like me to go on? I could go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing you haven\u2019t heard before, Griffin, so I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m bothering to repeat myself, but some of us work for a living. Some of us go out into the world and try to make something of ourselves, instead of thinking life is a twenty-four hour party. Whatever situation you\u2019ve gotten yourself into this time, I highly doubt I\u2019d be able to help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even a little curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to be honest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m really not. This might come as something of a shock, but I\u2019m not trying to live vicariously through you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, and to think I bought that fluorescent pink mankini with you in mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin, shut up. Seriously, shut the fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been kidnapped. I\u2019m out on a boat in the middle of the ocean with these two guys who say they\u2019re going to kill me if Dad doesn\u2019t make some confession and pay seven million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind blows just then, almost drowning out the last part of what he said. But I hear it\u2014something in his voice changes. Instead of silky smooth, his voice almost breaks, like liquid being poured over ice. It\u2019s a rare tone for him, one he only uses when he\u2019s very interested or excited about something, and in the twenty-four years I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never used it with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he says. \u201cThey want what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney! And a confession. They say Dad has\u2014\u201d</p><p>My back is to him, so I don\u2019t see Snaggletooth come up next to me until it\u2019s too late. He snatches the phone from me and shoves it back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThat call is clearly going nowhere,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cBut . . . but it was! He actually sounded interested, you asshole! I was getting somewhere! Let me call him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Snaggletooth snaps. \u201cLike I said before\u2014we don\u2019t care whether we kill you or get the confession and money. Hell, maybe we\u2019ll kill you AFTER we get them. How about that? How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was just my imagination. Cam has never given a shit about me, even when we were kids, so it\u2019s probably just some pathetic delusion that he seemed to actually care, brought on by the drugs and lack of sleep and food. The sun beams down on me. There is not a cloud in the sky. It could be any day, any nice day where you\u2019re going out to do something fun, maybe with someone you like, someone who likes you back. A day when you don\u2019t have to spend any money, or try to impress anyone. I can\u2019t recall the last time I had a day like that, and suddenly, I feel very tired. Blame the sun, blame the salt air, blame the fact that I haven\u2019t eaten anything in at least a day. I look at Snaggletooth, still fingering the knife blade.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Chapter 4: Jill</p><p>Karen is twenty, with frizzy red hair and the type of pale skin that burns, never tans. She\u2019s wearing khaki shorts and already has her Sea Horse Ranch t-shirt on, even though the campers won\u2019t be here until tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cShow me everything,\u201d she says, as we walk down to the barn. \u201cBill and Lorrie said how you\u2019re like the horse whisperer or something. Did you read that book? The Horse Whisperer?\u201d</p><p>I look at her. \u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, it\u2019s really good. So is the movie, actually. We should watch it some night. It\u2019s one of those movies I never mind seeing whenever it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t like watching movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, once in a while, I guess, but it mostly seems like a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>I give Karen a tour of the barn. Karen is replacing Brandon for this summer, and though Brandon has always been somewhat gruff and of few words, I miss him and wish that he could\u2019ve been here for my last summer.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess the owners\u2019 daughter is also going to be a counselor here?\u201d Karen says. \u201cAllison? I think I met her when I first got here. She\u2019s so pretty. So are you. I\u2019m definitely the ugly duckling of the group.\u201d She laughs in such a way that I can tell this actually bothers her more than she is caring to let on.</p><p>\u201cHorses don\u2019t care what you look like,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighs. \u201cSo . . . do you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This place will keep you pretty busy. I mean, you\u2019ll definitely have down time, but relationships take up a lot of time. When you could be doing other things. Like showering. Or napping.\u201d She gives me a somewhat horrified look and I smile. \u201cI\u2019m joking. Sort of. Come on; let\u2019s go tack up a few of the horses so I can take you out and show you the trails.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t go with my parents into the East Bay because I had a headache. I had a headache because I\u2019d been up most of the night, arguing with Sean, and then having that really hot makeup sex that almost makes the whole argument worth having to begin with.</p><p>My parents were going to visit their friends in Walnut Creek. I was invited along because the friends owned horses and had just gotten a new one that was giving them some trouble.</p><p>\u201cCarol is sure this is something you\u2019d be able to figure out,\u201d Dad said as they were leaving. It was one of the last things he said to me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time.\u201d It felt like there was a swarm of bees clustered behind my right eye.</p><p>My parents were driving back to the city that evening when they drove their car off the Bay Bridge. The bridge had been under construction for a while, and there was a dangerous S curve that a freighter had driven off of a few months ago. Drivers were supposed to slow to 35 to navigate the curve, but most plowed on through, keeping up with the flow of traffic.</p><p>It was a tragedy and also a miracle, because no one could imagine how my mother survived the plunge from the upper deck down to the pavement on Treasure Island.</p><p>It was touch and go with my mother for a while, though. Her hospital room and the ICU waiting room became my new home for nearly a month last summer. I didn\u2019t go back to the ranch that year and I put my classes on hold. Uncle Nate flew in and after the shock had started to wear off, started talking about conspiracies, adamant this wasn\u2019t due to negligent driving and poorly-lighted warning signs.</p><p>\u201cMike has always been a very defensive driver!\u201d Uncle Nate raged, as though that fact alone meant my father could never be involved in even the most minor of traffic accidents.</p><p>For a while, I dismissed it as shock, his unique way of processing grief. Dad was his only brother, after all. And it was Dad who helped Uncle Nate in the early days of his business. Dad was really the only one who believed in him when my uncle said he wanted to start his own luxury cruise business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course Uncle Nate would have difficulty accepting it.</p><p>But then the police closed the investigation, citing it as an unfortunate accident. The few witnesses that there were had little compelling evidence to offer otherwise; and it hadn\u2019t been the first accident to occur there either. There were several editorials in the newspaper, letters of outrage, concerned citizens demanding that the city do something to better protect the general population. Perhaps it was a preventable tragedy, but it was only a tragedy at that.</p><p>No one wanted to hear Uncle Nate\u2019s insistence that it was actually something more.</p> <p>I take it as a bad sign that I\u2019m already feeling annoyed with the campers and they\u2019ve only been here two days. It\u2019s a smaller group this year, fifteen kids, seven boys and eight girls, a few repeats, including Simon, who has been coming here for the past four years and specializes in following me around like a puppy.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re working with the horses,\u201d I\u2019m telling a group of five of them, the ones with no horse experience, \u201cyou want to make sure to be calm and not make any sudden movements. Horses are very receptive to whatever energy it is you\u2019re putting out there, too, so you\u2019ve got to act accordingly. If you respect them, they will respect you.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re in something of a heat wave for this time of year; there hasn\u2019t been any fog and the temperature\u2019s approaching the mid-seventies. Clover, the chestnut mare, stands in front of me, eyes half closed, dozing in the warmth of the day. You could detonate a bomb next to Clover and she\u2019d do little more than swish her tail and maybe shift the weight from one side to the other.</p><p>\u201cSo before you put the horse\u2019s tack on, you have to groom them,\u201d I say. \u201cEach horse here has their own groom box. You\u2019ll each be assigned to a horse for the three weeks that you\u2019re here. It will be your responsibility to take care of the horse, which includes grooming, exercising, and evening feeding. I\u2019ll go through what all the stuff in the groom box is and then I\u2019ll tell you who you\u2019re assigned to.\u201d</p><p>Brett, the tall boy with tattoos on his knuckles, eyes Clover warily. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re like . . . respecting the horse but he ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 you and isn\u2019t respecting you back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you that won\u2019t happen here,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd generally, when you give respect, you get it. That\u2019s not something that just applies to horses.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a wary look, like I might be lying or trying to pull a fast one on him, but I just give him a smile and raise my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I tell him. \u201cRemember that and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems.\u201d</p><p>When I get back to my cabin that evening, there\u2019s a pink orchid sitting on the small dining room table, plus a note from Lorrie. This came for you today, but there was no card and the delivery guy couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give me any more info. It\u2019s beautiful, regardless!!</p><p>I put her note down next to the terra cotta pot. A few of the little nuggets of bark have fallen onto the table. The plant actually looks a little menacing, like it could extricate itself from its confines and start scuttling around the cabin.</p><p>I take a shower, and as I\u2019m toweling off my hair, my phone starts to ring. I already know it\u2019s going to be him before I even look to see who the incoming call is, but I answer, because he\u2019ll just keep calling if I don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like the orchid?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely. And completely unnecessary to send.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that drab little cabin of yours could use some cheering up. I\u2019m sure you could use some cheering up.\u201d I can practically hear his smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, though, Jill. I know it\u2019s coming up on the one-year anniversary of your dad\u2019s death, and I just . . . I wanted to call and see how you\u2019re holding up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Sean, really. Thank you for thinking of me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about you a lot. I\u2019d like to drive down there and see you. Or take you out to dinner next time you\u2019re in the city. I\u2019m subletting my cousin\u2019s apartment here in the marina for the summer\u2014you should come check it out. It\u2019d be great to have you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m just pretty busy with work and then when I\u2019ve got free time I need to go see my mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing your mom.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and take a deep breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to go. I had a long day and I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill, hold on. I really thought you\u2019d be ready to talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout getting back together. You know we belong together. I understand that what happened last year was pretty fucking traumatic and you needed some space. I get that. But it\u2019s been almost a year and I think that we\u2019re both ready to get things back on track.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the problem with people like Sean. They\u2019re used to getting exactly what they want, all the time, and have no fucking clue how to accept \u2018no\u2019 as an answer.</p><p>\u201cSean, our relationship is over. Which means you can stop calling me and also stop sending flowers. To both me and my mother. Okay? Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you play hard to get,\u201d I hear him say before I\u2019m able to disconnect the call.</p><p>Chapter 5: Griffin</p><p>I\u2019ve never had so much time to just sit and be alone with my thoughts.</p><p>It\u2019s a little unnerving.</p><p>I\u2019m generally the sort who likes to keep moving, who likes to be doing something\u2014or someone\u2014pretty much all the time. Perhaps at one point Dad thought that such a characteristic would be beneficial in business, but he has since determined otherwise. Somewhere along the way he made up his mind that I wouldn\u2019t be following in his footsteps, and he basically told me to go do whatever I wanted so long as it didn\u2019t involve getting thrown in jail\u2014presumably he didn\u2019t want to have to put up the bail\u2014or get involved in any scandals that might tarnish the public\u2019s impression of him. I doubt he ever had a conversation like that with Cam. When I was twenty-five my trust fund would be released to me. At which point he\u2019s probably hoping to never have to see me again. From what I\u2019ve gathered, Cam hasn\u2019t touched his trust fund yet and instead has followed in Dad\u2019s footsteps and is making money out of money. Or something. Honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure what either my dad or Cam do, but it\u2019s lucrative and gives them the idea that they are somehow better than everyone else.</p><p>Mom always liked to refer to us as her \u201cgood boy\u201d and her \u201cwild one.\u201d I\u2019ll let you decide who was who. But clearly it was apparent early on that Cam could do no wrong. In every holiday photo, he\u2019s looking straight into the camera, perfect smile, not a hair out of place. It was always on account of me we had to do half a dozen or more retakes, my dad\u2019s smile getting tighter and more forced with each one, until the official Alexander Family Christmas photo always resulted with Dad scowling. Somehow, though, the look on Cam\u2019s face never faltered.</p><p>For a few minutes, I let the self-pity wash over me. I sit there and wallow in it. What if these fools actually are for real and they kill me? I think of Imogen, and her lovely, perky tits, and the sad fact that I only got to spend one night getting to know them. And then there\u2019s Harper, and her beautiful gazelle legs, and Amanda, and her tiny waist and voluptuous ass, and Stella, who really did give the best head ever, and Marion, who screamed so loud when she came that I actually had ringing in my ears for a day afterward, and Alicia, Laura, Tess, Zoe, Kelly, Rebecca, Katy, Elizabeth . . . I can\u2019t even remember all their names. All lovely ladies.</p><p>But perhaps this is a fitting end. I mean, not to be all dramatic or anything, but I haven\u2019t really done much in way of a positive contribution to the world. Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s just easy to get caught up in all of it, in the lifestyle, in upholding this certain image, though what that image is I can\u2019t quite say. All I know is, word gets out there, and people expect you to be a certain way, and, for some reason or another, you try to do exactly that.</p><p>I stand up and feel my way over to the door. I\u2019ll just break the news to them myself. Carl Alexander III is not going to pay your ransom. He is not going to confess and he is not going to give two shits if you kill his son or not. In fact, he might even applaud you if you do, or perhaps wish he could\u2019ve done the deed himself. Maybe they\u2019ll let me go. Or maybe they\u2019ll kill me like they said they would, because it would be just as fun.</p><p>I bang on the door. \u201cGuys! Open up. I\u2019ve got to tell you something. It\u2019s big. You\u2019ll want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, it\u2019s almost unreal, like someone pressed the universal mute button or something, and then I hear one of them shout\u2014shriek, really\u2014and the boat lurches violently one way, then the other. I lose my footing and fall to one knee before I\u2019m able to catch myself. There\u2019s more screaming, followed by thunderous footsteps. The door flies open a minute later.</p><p>\u201cA fucking whale hit the boat!\u201d Bandana screams. \u201cGet your ass out here and help us!\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re trying to bail the water out, but I can tell the second I get out there that the boat\u2019s fucked. It\u2019s going down, and it\u2019s going down fast, and from the look on Bandana\u2019s face, I\u2019d be surprised if any of them can do more than the dog paddle.</p><p>The whale is nowhere to be seen, though I\u2019ve heard of this happening once or twice. Some juvenile whale who breached and misjudged the distance between here and there. Like driving after you\u2019ve skied, or on one too many hits of LSD. Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.</p><p>I dive into the water. It\u2019s cold but tolerable, and I don\u2019t think they even notice that I\u2019m gone. I don\u2019t look back.</p><p>I swim.</p><p>I swam competitively all throughout school, not because I particularly loved it but because I was good at it and also because girls can\u2019t resist a swimmer\u2019s body. The broad shoulders, narrow waist, the tight, toned muscles. So while my parents thought I was doing it for the glory of all those championships, really, I was doing it for the glory of being with all those girls, and yes, there were plenty of them.</p><p>This is what I think about as I swim. What I try not to think about is the fact that I could be going in the wrong direction and may never see solid ground again, or that I might be headed straight for a shark or an infestation of jellyfish. No, I push those thoughts to the very back of my mind and instead think of Sadie-Heather-Jen-Tara-Gwen-Alexa-Nicole . . . the list could go on forever . . .</p><p>I stop periodically. Tread water. Dead man\u2019s float. If something about my situation doesn\u2019t change soon, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll be, dead man floating. The sun is setting. My lips are dry, cracking, my muscles ache, but they\u2019re nowhere near failing. These babies can go all night, and it\u2019s looking like they\u2019re going to have to. My brain buzzes from lack of sleep, but this isn\u2019t the first time yours truly has had to do something completely strung out.</p><p>Other things I think about aside from the girls: this alleged confession my father needs to make, worth approximately the same value as 7.2 million dollars and his son\u2019s life. Or maybe worth more than that.</p><p>My father is the CEO, president, and chairman of the Concord Frazier Group, a multinational conglomerate holding company. CFG owns a few airlines, several insurance companies, several more manufacturers, and a popular soft drink company. They even jumped on the natural food craze bandwagon a few years ago with Organica, that whole food company that touts itself as being \u201cas natural as if you just dug it out of the ground, but as convenient as if you just pulled it out of the microwave.\u201d</p><p>My relationship with my father wasn\u2019t always so contentious. Somewhere, in some forgotten-about desk drawer somewhere, there might even be a photograph or two of Dad and I. Look, there I am, seven years old, at Yankees Stadium, Cam, ten years old, sandwiched between me and Dad. Or at nine, on Dad\u2019s yacht, me with a huge grin on my face because I love being out on the water, Dad trying to look like he\u2019s not about to toss his cookies.</p><p>Something happened, though, right around the time I turned thirteen. Maybe it\u2019s because I grew taller than him, or because my voice got deeper than his, or any number of things, but one day it seemed like Dad woke up and decided he just didn\u2019t like me anymore. He didn\u2019t laugh at my jokes, he didn\u2019t come to my swim competitions, he said he was busy with work and that was that. It\u2019s like he made up his mind and never looked back, which is basically how he lives his life. Maybe it\u2019s because he realized Cam could fulfill everything he wanted in a son, so I was just extra, unnecessary, a needless liability. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m about to start swimming again when I see movement against the sky. Birds, flying away from the setting sun. Birds fly back to land at dusk. I smile, and feel my lip split, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going the right way. Land is near.</p><p>Chapter 6: Jill</p><p>Sitting by the campfire is basically a part of every evening, but the main event that I think most of the kids look forward to is the Beach BBQ, which starts around six-thirty and doesn\u2019t end until well into the night, when the tired campers crawl into the tents they\u2019ve pitched in the sand at the edge of the beach. The other part of the fun is the fact that Bill and Lorrie turn in before the party commences, leaving the supervising up to me and the other counselors.</p> <p>The things that have gone on at the Beach BBQ are the stuff of legends, but the fact is, no one\u2019s ever been hurt, lost, or gotten killed and the general consensus is that it\u2019s the best part of the whole experience. It always takes place one week after the campers have arrived, kind of as a reward, as a way to say, Congratulations, you\u2019ve made it this whole week\u2014only two left to go.</p><p>The kids are excited for the barbeque. It distracts them while we\u2019re out on the morning trail ride, and at one point, Brett nearly falls off when his mount takes a misstep and stumbles coming down a gentle incline.</p><p>When we get back, Allison is complaining because she doesn\u2019t want to have to help get all the food ready.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really that good in the kitchen,\u201d she says, as she eyes Brett, who\u2019s playing Frisbee with a few other kids.</p><p>\u201cAll you need to do is either make burgers or slice tomatoes,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm . . . I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she says, and before I can say anything else, she flounces out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to be the owners\u2019 daughter,\u201d Karen says. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the only person I haven\u2019t really learned that much from since I\u2019ve been here. I\u2019ll slice the tomatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAlthough she is lucky,\u201d Karen continues, her gaze going out the window where Allison has seamlessly integrated herself into the Frisbee game by standing so close to Brett it looks like she\u2019s got a hand in his pocket. \u201cAll the boys really seem to like her. Can I tell you something? I\u2019ve never even had a boyfriend before. I\u2019ve only ever been kissed once, and that\u2019s because someone dared someone else to do that. Isn\u2019t that terrible?\u201d</p><p>It kind of is, but I smile and shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily missing out on much,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are pretty strict Christians and it was kind of drilled into me at a young age that you\u2019re supposed to wait until you get married. Or find the person that you\u2019re going to marry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Some guys would probably find that pretty attractive, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but does anyone do that anymore? You\u2019ve . . . you\u2019ve been with a guy, right? You\u2019ve probably been with lots of guys.\u201d Her eyes widen. \u201cI mean . . . I didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like that. I just meant that you\u2019re really pretty, too, and I\u2019m sure you have no trouble getting guys. I\u2019m not saying that you like sleep around or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell her, suppressing a smile. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019ve been with a few guys. But really, Karen? There\u2019s nothing wrong with waiting. If that\u2019s what you want to do. And sometimes it can be a while until you find the right person. Or maybe you\u2019ll end up meeting someone who\u2019s the right person for that time in your life, and then you\u2019ll move on. You\u2019re still young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could give me some pointers.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m really not the person to ask for that sort of thing. Allison might be a better bet. Maybe that\u2019s what you could learn from her.\u201d</p><p>Karen reaches for another tomato. \u201cI\u2019ve just always wanted to do things the right way, you know? I play by the rules. I guess that was kind of drilled into me by my parents, too. I\u2019ve never even had a beer before. I\u2019m waiting until I\u2019m twenty-one. Seven more months.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s lucky in a way, I think. She\u2019s got a totally clean slate. No baggage from past relationships. That sounds pretty good to me right about now.</p><p>Down on the beach, Bill and a few of the campers have built a fire and they\u2019re grilling burgers. I go around and help the kids that need assistance with their tents\u2014some of them can\u2019t get it staked in right, and a few\u2014including Brett\u2014are chasing each other up and down the beach with the rods, jousting. Then I go pitch my own tent a little further down the beach as a way to patrol the parameters after everyone\u2019s supposed to be turned in for the night.</p> <p>We all eat, and sit around the fire while Lorrie tells a ghost story that I\u2019ve heard every year but always still scares me the same. Bill gets his guitar out and a few of the guys get up to try their hand at night-Frisbee.</p><p>By the time full dark has settled and the fire is throwing long shadows across everyone\u2019s faces, I notice Brett and one of the other guys sneak off back toward the trail leading to the ranch. It\u2019s not so much that I want to be known as the cool counselor; rather I get that some things are just more fun with alcohol. So yes, I turn a blind eye when they not-so-covertly haul a thirty-rack down to the beach and haphazardly try to stash it under an old quilt.</p><p>Karen comes up behind me and taps me on the shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ve got beer,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cHow did they get beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows. They figure out a way every year. Allison probably got it for them with her fake I.D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re underage! I should tell Bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I give her a look. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you supervise the marshmallow roasting; let me worry about the beer.\u201d</p><p>I decline to add that when I say worry, I really mean help myself to one or two.</p><p>I watch as the kids covertly go over to the quilt and help themselves to a can. They go in twos or threes, like they\u2019ve got this whole thing coordinated, leaving some of them by the campfire while others have wandered down closer to the surf. There\u2019s giggling and shouting and everyone\u2019s having a good time. Bill is playing \u201cTeach Your Children\u201d and a few of the kids are even singing, the chorus part anyway.</p><p>\u201cI wish we had some fireworks!\u201d someone shouts.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make some!\u201d</p><p>They dissolve into giggles like it\u2019s the funniest thing ever.</p><p>I walk over to the quilt, which Brett is sitting near, Allison next to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to bust you,\u201d I tell him as he hurries to hide the can, \u201con the condition you give me one.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI knew you were down,\u201d he says, and tosses me a warm can.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ll take two. And I better not find the beach covered in empties in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d he says.</p><p>I drink one of the beers in the shadows by my tent and then go help make s\u2019mores. I\u2019ve got the technique for toasting the perfect marshmallow, and I end up making a dozen or more s\u2019mores and passing them out to the campers who seem only capable of burning the marshmallows or dropping them into the flame.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d Simon asks dreamily from next to me, after I hand him what is probably his fourth s\u2019more.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou should go sit next to Heather,\u201d I add. Heather is a little mouse of a girl who has alternated between following Simon and Allison around, contenting herself with the scraps of attention they throw her way every so often.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather. Here. Give her this s\u2019more.\u201d I pass another graham cracker sandwich to him and nudge him toward her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get something from my tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I put my tent next to yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Simon. Yours is perfectly fine where it is. Or you can go back to the ranch, if you don\u2019t want to camp.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a hurt look. \u201cI never said that.\u201d Invariably, some of the campers will go back when Bill and Lorrie do, if for no other reason than they don\u2019t feel like sleeping out in the sand. And sometimes, it\u2019s the biggest, toughest-acting kids that don\u2019t want to be the ones sleeping out in a tent.</p><p>I give Simon\u2019s shoulder a pat. \u201cWell, then, you should go enjoy yourself. Go have some fun, Simon. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, the giggles and shrieks have subsided and the campers are all in their respective tents. I lie awake in mine, knowing it will probably be a few more hours at least before I finally fall asleep.</p><p>Sean and I tried to go camping once, in Bolinas. It was a disaster and a half. We ended up leaving around eleven that night because he just couldn\u2019t handle sleeping on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI thought there was going to be, you know, lodging,\u201d he said as we left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a campground,\u201d I replied, trying not to sound as disgusted as I felt.</p><p>\u201cWell, we went camping before when I was a kid and we stayed in a cabin. You know, with beds, running water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not camping; that\u2019s staying in a cabin.\u201d</p><p>I remembered looking at him as he stuffed our gear back into the car, and wondering, What the hell is wrong with you? It seemed like not the sort of thought you\u2019d want to be having about your boyfriend.</p><p>It annoys me that I\u2019m even thinking about this, and then I start thinking of that ridiculous orchid that\u2019s still sitting on the kitchen table, and the one that\u2019s sitting on my mother\u2019s side table. I unzip the sleeping bag and get up, leave the tent. There\u2019s a light breeze that carries a few hushed whispers from the campers\u2019 tents my way, but everything seems to be in order. Most of them are probably already asleep.</p><p>I walk down to the water, let my toes be submerged in the edge of one of the waves. The water is cold and frothy and the moon is high in the sky. It\u2019s one of those lovely nights when I should be feeling more at peace than I currently do.</p><p>I catch movement out of the corner of my eye. I turn and squint, and in the milky light of the moon, I can see someone stumbling out of the water. He\u2019s a good fifty yards away from me, and I wonder how on earth one of the campers managed to sneak past me, and what the hell he\u2019s doing in the water at this time of night.</p><p>I storm down there. He trips, doesn\u2019t make a move to get up, just lies there on his back, half in, half out of the water, arms splayed, staring up at the sky.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, how many beers did you have?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd you better sleep this off by morning . . .\u201d</p><p>But I stop abruptly, probably five feet away. The full moon has made it bright enough that I can see this is clearly not Brett or one of the other campers. I don't know who it is, and not just because he\u2019s brought his hands up and is covering his face like he\u2019s got the worst headache ever.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d he says, before trying to sit up. He makes it halfway and then twists to the side and throws up. It sounds like mostly water.</p><p>I take a step closer. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem to hear me over the retching, though, and when he\u2019s done he rolls over onto his forearms and his knees, his forehead on the sand. Perhaps I should be more fearful of strange men that wash up onto the beach, but this one is clearly in no condition to do anything that might put me in harm\u2019s way.</p><p>I take a few steps closer and kneel down. \u201cHey. Where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>Finally, he looks at me. For a few long seconds, he doesn\u2019t say anything. Then, he laughs, a dry, hacking sound that quickly dissolves into a brutal cough. He pushes himself up and stands, swaying a little.</p><p>\u201cI would think,\u201d he says, his voice rough like gravel, \u201cthat I were in heaven if I didn\u2019t feel like such shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t heaven; it\u2019s Fulton Beach.\u201d I look out to the expanse of ocean that is reflecting the moon\u2019s light in milky-colored ripples. I see no boat, no vessel, not even a raft or a stick of driftwood. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not supposed to be here. Where did you come from? Where are you trying to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I knew that, I\u2019d be there by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go to the hospital? I can call an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNo, don\u2019t call anyone. Just . . . just give me a minute. Let me try . . . let me . . . Goddamn. Do you have any water?\u201d</p><p>I can see how dry and cracked his lips are and how the salinity of the water has irritated the skin around his mouth. He has been swimming for a long time, I realize. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cI really need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I say, wanting to get him out of sight before Karen sees. \u201cBut stop calling me sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, okay.

He collapses into the tent and just lays there as I pull a water bottle from the little cooler I brought with me. I twist the cap off and hand it to him, and he sits up long enough to gulp a few mouthfuls before lying back down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink so quickly,\u201d I say. I try to scrutinize his face in the darkness. I twist the knob on my LED lantern and a whitish glow fills the tent. He is no one I have ever seen before. \u201cSeriously. Where are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would tell you,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sweetheart, you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d I say.</p><p>He lets his eyes fall closed for a second, before reopening them. He\u2019s got those enviable, long, thick lashes that only guys ever seem to have, and his eyes as blue and bright as pools of tropical water. \u201cI was kidnapped. It started off really lovely and all; I was having the total Eat, Pray, Love experience, traveling the world, except in my case it was more like Drugs, Rave, Fuck, and I was partying in Thailand and I was kidnapped and woke up to find myself on some yacht in the middle of the ocean. And then a fucking whale sank the boat. Like Moby Dick or some shit. So I started swimming.\u201d</p><p>He takes another sip of water. I narrow my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit,\u201d I tell him. I know his type, which isn\u2019t all too different from Sean, actually, just maybe a little more adventurous. The privileged rich boy who happens to be so ruggedly handsome, people are constantly falling over themselves just to get in their good graces. And these boys know this, relish this, and just like to mess around with people because they know they can get away with it.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re the one who asked what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked because I thought you\u2019d tell me the truth. And you really need to stop calling me sweetheart. My name is Jill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay. Jill. I\u2019m not exactly sure what I need to do to convince you that I\u2019m telling you the truth, but that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what happened, we should call the police. If you were the victim of a kidnapping, you need to report that. It\u2019s a crime.\u201d I cringe inwardly, thinking I sound exactly like Uncle Nate.</p><p>\u201cThe police aren\u2019t going to be able to do anything. This wasn\u2019t about me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were kidnapped but it wasn\u2019t about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s something to do with my father. They wanted him to pay a ransom. Which shows how little they know my father. Going to the cops is only going to piss my father off and I\u2019ll probably end up having to see him, which I try to do as infrequently as possible.\u201d</p><p>I feel a twinge as he says this, the same quick, sharp feeling I always get whenever I hear someone saying these sorts of things about their parents. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why people who had parents they hated, or whose parents didn\u2019t give two shits about them, why they still got to be alive and my dad, who was a friend as much as a parental figure, was dead. I know it\u2019s an immature way to feel, but the reaction was involuntary; all I could do was acknowledge it and then try to let it go.</p><p>\u201cSo you were kidnapped, you swim who knows how many miles and wash up on a beach, and you\u2019re just going to do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . what am I supposed to do with you? This is a camp for teens. Random guys washing up on the beach in the middle of the night isn\u2019t going to go over too well with the owners. The campers\u2019 parents expect them to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe. I like kids. Kids like me. I was a big brother in another lifetime.\u201d He stretches, his broad expanse of torso expanding and contracting. \u201cChrist. Can I get out of these clothes? Do you mind? I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m getting your sleeping bag soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I . . .\u201d I don\u2019t have anything with me for him to put on, but he\u2019s already pulling his shirt off, and he\u2019s got this incredibly smooth skin wrapped over long, toned muscles. I look away.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d really like, though, is to be able to get a little rest. And then we can figure things out in the morning?\u201d He yawns, and I suddenly imagine him as a little boy, getting tucked into bed for the night.</p><p>He is someone\u2019s son, I tell myself. He used to be a little boy.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, suddenly too tired to do anything but agree. I nod to my sleeping bag. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours. I\u2019ll put your clothes out here to dry off. Put them back on when you wake up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d he mumbles, already half asleep.</p><p>Chapter 7: Griffin</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long I slept for, but when I open my eyes, the tent is filled with a muted light and from somewhere in the distance, I hear what sounds like a shitload of kids talking, laughing.</p><p>I lie there in the tangle of the sleeping bag, head pounding, muscles feeling like they\u2019re about to either explode or liquefy, or maybe both. I sit up slowly, my equilibrium shifting, swaying like I\u2019m still out on the boat even though I\u2019m not. I am here, on dry land. I am on a beach and I am alive and I\u2019ve got the nastiest fucking headache to prove it.</p><p>I reach for the water bottle and take a sip, then another. My lips feel like little more than parchment paper, like they could flake off at any second. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a hot shower. Jesus Christ.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to summon the energy to get myself up when the flaps on the tent are suddenly yanked back.</p><p>\u201cJill, you overslept!\u201d a voice says, and then stops abruptly. A girl is peering in at me. She\u2019s young, maybe sixteen or seventeen, and clearly not expecting to find me in here. \u201cOh,\u201d she says. She\u2019s got big greenish-blue eyes and long brown hair she\u2019s piled up on the top of her head in one of those messy bun things that are so much fun to pull out. She smiles. \u201cHi. You are certainly not who I was expecting to find in here. Where . . . where is Jill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I start to crawl forward, and then I realize I\u2019m naked. \u201cHey, could you toss me those clothes that are out there?\u201d The girl backs up, letting the flap of the tent fall. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s horrified or in shock, but a second later, she sticks her arm back into the tent and hands me my clothes, which are still damp and encrusted with sand, but I put them on anyway. I crawl out of the tent, the flap brushing my back as I make my way out. The sun is reflecting off the water in such a way that it\u2019s painful to look at it. I squint and wish I had my Ray-Bans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Allison,\u201d the girl says. \u201cAre you and Jill . . .?\u201d She lets the sentence trail off.</p><p>\u201cI know Jill,\u201d I say, though I refrain from adding whether it\u2019s biblically or not. I have a feeling Jill wouldn\u2019t appreciate that one too much.</p><p>\u201cMy parents own this place.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at her. \u201cYour parents own the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . sort of. They own the ranch. I\u2019m a counselor here. But you aren\u2019t one of our campers.\u201d</p><p>I feel as though I look like the shit someone just scraped off the bottom of their shoe, but from the way Allison is smiling at me, my outward appearance must not reflect that. Or, she\u2019s really hard up, but she\u2019s a cutie, so I doubt that\u2019s the case.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your name,\u201d she says, tilting her head and giving me a coy look.</p><p>\u201cGriffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be around for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing more of you. You should stay. You can be my guest. My parents won\u2019t mind at all.\u201d</p><p>It makes my face feel like it\u2019s about to crack, but I give her my most winning smile. \u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s the first good news I\u2019ve heard in a while.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8: Jill</p><p>After Karen and I herd the fifteen bleary-eyed teenagers back down the footpath to the ranch for breakfast, I double back to go find Griffin. He can eat something and then be on his way, wherever that might be.</p><p>But he\u2019s not there when I return. I look down the beach, but there are only some gulls, and, in the very far distance, a person walking a dog. The waves slide up the beach and back, and I wonder if Griffin disappeared just like how he had arrived.</p><p>I break down my tent and check the area for any debris that the campers might not have picked up before they had left and only find one empty beer can and a lollypop wrapper. They\u2019re a decent bunch of kids, I think, as I carry my stuff back to the ranch.</p><p>I\u2019m heading over to the barn, debating whether or not to mention anything to Bill and Lorrie about Griffin. A small part of me wonders about him, but if he\u2019s truly gone, then what\u2019s the point in bringing him up? Oh, guess what, last night some guy washed ashore and I let him sleep in my tent and then when I went back this morning he was gone. Uh-huh.</p><p>But then I hear Bill calling my name. He\u2019s standing on the porch of their house, a little Craftsman bungalow, built atop a gently sloping hill that overlooks the barn.</p><p>\u201cJill!\u201d he says, waving. \u201cCan I steal you for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I call back. I dump my gear and turn and walk toward the house. He waits for me on the porch, and as I approach, I try to read his expression. He seems as affable as always.</p><p>\u201cSounds like last night was a success,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone seems happy. Let\u2019s go into my office for a minute.\u201d</p><p>We walk inside and down a short hallway to his office. And there, sitting on the faded blue couch, is Allison. Next to her is Griffin. He looks a little more put together than he did last night, though that isn\u2019t saying much. His hair is messy and black and flecked with sand. He\u2019s got probably a week-old beard going. But underneath all that dark hair you can see he\u2019s got this perfectly square cut jaw and his eyes are large and bright blue, framed by those thick black lashes.</p><p>Bill goes and sits behind his desk, leans back in the chair. \u201cAllison came to me with an interesting proposition this morning, but I thought we should talk to you about it. It seems her friend\u2014Griffin, is it?\u201d</p><p>Griffin nods. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill, please. None of this \u2018sir\u2019 business. Griffin is interested in joining our team for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Allison\u2019s friends,\u201d I say slowly. I can see Allison out of the corner of my eye, arms crossed, foot tapping. I can practically feel her glare boring a hole into my side. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think that would be the best\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be good if there\u2019s another guy around,\u201d Allison cut in. \u201cEspecially since Brandon\u2019s not here this year. It would be good for the guy campers.\u201d She gives me a level stare and in that moment there is nothing more I\u2019d rather do than reach over and slap her across the face.</p><p>\u201cI do have some outdoor experience,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cI actually used to go to a camp like this myself, when I was younger. In the Catskills. I\u2019d love the opportunity to have some new outdoor experiences. This seems like a great place.\u201d</p><p>Bill looks from me to Griffin to Allison, then back to me again. \u201cJill,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this young man would like to stay on with us, I don\u2019t see a problem with that. A friend of Allison\u2019s, after all, is a friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open and I shoot a look at Allison, who is now staring straight at her father, a tiny smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I start to say.</p><p>\u201cOf course, if any problems arise,\u201d Bill is saying to Griffin, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to ask you to leave immediately, but we like to be inclusive here at Sea Horse Ranch. We don\u2019t like to turn people away. Especially if you\u2019re eager for some new outdoor experiences, as you say you are.\u201d Bill smiles broadly at the three of us, like he wants to gather us all in a big group hug. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get back out there and help Lorrie and Karen get everyone ready for the trail ride. It\u2019s the perfect day for it.\u201d</p><p>Allison is elated, and can barely keep herself from jumping up and down.</p><p>\u201cThis might work out,\u201d I hear Bill say to himself as we file out. \u201cNot that Karen isn\u2019t working out, but it\u2019d be nice to have another male around, since Brandon\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Griffin gives me an apologetic smile but then Allison pulls on his hand and he turns and follows her. I watch them walk off. A scrub jay screeches from the branch of one of the live oak trees. The grating noise seems an appropriate soundtrack for how I imagine the rest of this day\u2014the rest of this summer\u2014is going to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On Sunday, I drive back home to see Mom. The whole way back, my hands clench the steering wheel, my shoulders inch up closer and closer to my ears until I have to consciously remind myself to relax. Still, by the time I actually get to the house and am inside, I can feel how tight my shoulders have gotten again.</p><p>\u201cIs camp not going well this year?\u201d she asks after we talk for a few minutes. I thought I\u2019d been doing a good job disguising my irritation, but apparently not. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>I debate not telling her. What, after all, is there that she could do about it? If anything, it will just upset her, and she doesn\u2019t need that right now. So I give her a modified version.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this guy there who I\u2019m not really getting along with,\u201d I say. \u201cI just . . . I wasn\u2019t expecting him to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get along with anyone, Jilly,\u201d Mom says. \u201cYou\u2019re a very friendly person. Can you try to see the good qualities in him? I\u2019m sure he must have one or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even that I\u2019m not getting along with him, per se; he reminds of Sean, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Mom smiles faintly and looks over at the orchid. \u201cYou really should give him another chance, sweetie. He clearly cares about you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because he sends flowers?\u201d I rub my eyes. \u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d</p> <p>I leave some time after dinner, when Sharon shows up for the night shift. I give Mom a kiss and tell her I\u2019ll see her next week.</p><p>\u201cDrive safely,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that your uncle will be out here Sunday. I think he\u2019d like to take us out. Something simple, brunch maybe. I think I might be up for that. It\u2019s been a while since I last went out, but I think I feel up for it.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth but force a smile. \u201cGreat,\u201d I say tightly. Uncle Nate visits every few months, claiming he wants to make sure that we\u2019re doing okay and that the money he sends is being spent properly, but really it\u2019s because he wants to go on another tirade about his conspiracies concerning my parents\u2019 car accident, his favorite theory being that one of my dad\u2019s former bosses paid someone to cause the accident. At this point, no one else wants to hear about it. We are obligated to listen because we\u2019re family, but that doesn\u2019t mean I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s full of shit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to see him,\u201d Mom says. \u201cHe\u2019s family, Jilly. He\u2019s your father\u2019s little brother, and he\u2019s taking care of us.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. \u201cI might not be able to cover all the expenses, Mom, but I work really hard to try to make ends meet around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, honey. But you\u2019re still so young and have your whole life ahead of you; you shouldn\u2019t be shouldered with a burden like this. There\u2019s nothing wrong with accepting help from family. Uncle Nate wants to help.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cWe\u2019re not a charity case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right; we\u2019re not. But he is family, and he wants to help. And try to get along with that boy at camp. You\u2019ll just make yourself miserable if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>On my way out of the living room, I pass the framed picture hanging on the wall. It\u2019s the last photo taken of Dad, Mom, and me. We\u2019re standing on Baker Beach, the Golden Gate Bridge behind us. All smiling. All with no clue how very wrong things would go in just a few short months for our little family. She has a point, I suppose. There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll be there all summer.</p><p>When I get back, the campers are all out on the archery field. They\u2019re standing there in a line, bows in hand, facing the targets. Griffin is in the middle of this line, and as I approach, I can hear him talking to the campers.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re at full draw, your body forms a T, if you\u2019re in proper alignment,\u201d he\u2019s saying. There is movement on the line, as some of the archers readjust themselves.</p><p>Even Allison is there, right next to him, gamely trying to get control of her bow.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Griffin says. He\u2019s lowered his own bow and is walking up the line, inspecting each person\u2019s stance.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me get in the right stance? I can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Allison says.</p> <p>He sees me as he walks back over to her and he gives a little wave. \u201cNow here\u2019s a girl who looks like she knows how to shoot an arrow. Care to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay,\u201d I say tightly. \u201cI was wondering if a group would like to get together and take a ride down to the swimming hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d says Simon. No one else moves. Normally, taking the horses swimming is one of the most popular activities, but right now they\u2019re looking at me like I just suggested we all sit in a circle and pull out each other\u2019s toenails with pliers.</p><p>\u201cGriff is giving us an archery lesson,\u201d Allison says. \u201cHe\u2019s an expert.\u201d She points to one of the targets, where three arrows surround the yellow bullseye.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought he was teaching you how to knit a sweater.\u201d I look at Simon. \u201cGuess it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d I say. He hurries after me and we walk off the field, toward the paddocks to get the horses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care much for archery to begin with,\u201d Simon says.</p><p>I glance at him. He\u2019s shot up in the year since he was here last summer, and at some point, maybe, he\u2019ll be attractive, but right now he looks like a gangly colt who is still trying to get used to his new body dimensions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you wanted to stay there,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019d rather take the horses out.\u201d He jams his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cWho is that guy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently someone who is good at everything,\u201d I mumble. Simon looks at me quizzically. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he came from. He\u2019s a friend of Allison\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Simon snorts. \u201cI\u2019d say a little more than friends.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the remark, though it slides under my skin like a splinter. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he was a professional archer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he learned in Scotland. One of his friends is part of the Royal Company of Archers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t he well-traveled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a pretty cool guy,\u201d Simon says. \u201cOr he seems that way. He seems like he\u2019s good at a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s arrogant. And he happens to be good-looking, and rich, apparently, so I guess that means he can get away with doing whatever he wants.\u201d</p><p>Simon squints at me. \u201cHow do you know all that stuff about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t, really. He\u2019s just another handsome rich boy, and they\u2019re all basically the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says after a minute. \u201cI\u2019m not rich,\u201d he adds.</p><p>I shoot him a look. \u201cGood. Stay that way.\u201d</p><p>After Simon and I put the horses back out to pasture, I head back to my cabin to lie down for a bit before the afternoon activities. Allison is lounging in the hammock under the oak tree by my cabin, one leg hanging off the side. She sits up when she sees me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says. \u201cI was wondering where you were. I have a really big favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>I push my sunglasses up on top of my head. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you would do the afternoon trail ride. It\u2019s only with like six kids; the rest are going on a hike with Bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just went for a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, with Simon. You shouldn\u2019t have gone if it was just going to be the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try not telling me what to do, considering you\u2019re asking me for a favor and all.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiles and gives me a sisterly look. \u201cI\u2019m just joking, Jill. Geez. It\u2019s cute how much Simon likes you, actually. So will you do it? Do the trail ride? I was going to take Griff up to the city.\u201d She leans toward me and says in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cGriff has a trust fund.\u201d</p><p>I try to refrain from rolling my eyes. \u201cThat must make him so much more attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, are you blind? He doesn\u2019t need anything to make him more attractive. He\u2019s like the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>I let out a low whistle. \u201cWell, then, that\u2019s quite the honor.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes, as though she can\u2019t decide whether that jab is an insult to her or not.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be jealous.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. Well. Thanks for doing the trail ride. We might not be back until tomorrow, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with bated breath.\u201d I go into my cabin and lie down, trying to stave off the headache I feel building behind my eyes.</p><p>The six kids that stick around for the trail ride are five girls, plus Simon. Instead of heading to the beach, I take them inland, over golden grass and through groves of cypress trees. The fog has pulled back and the day is bright, the sound of heat bugs fills the air. The horses kick up dust as they plod along. It is warm without being overly hot, the kids are chatting happily, and I should be enjoying myself but I\u2019m not.</p><p>I can picture Allison zipping up Highway 1 in her sporty little red Honda Del Sol, Griffin in the passenger seat. The fact that this bothers me is bothering, and when Peaches, the palomino mare I\u2019m riding, reaches out to grab a mouthful of leaves from a passing branch, I jab her with my heels harder than I meant and she skitters forward, ears pinned back.</p><p>\u201cSorry, girl,\u201d I mumble, patting her neck and smoothing down a section of her cream-colored mane. I resolve to put the whole thing out of my mind. When that doesn\u2019t prove possible, I resolve to not let it bother me. Is it that people like Allison always get what they want? Is it that I can see exactly the kind of summer Allison\u2019s going to have, and the reason her summer is going to be so great is because Griffin has shown up, which therefore means my own summer\u2014which I\u2019d been counting on being as predictable as it\u2019s always been\u2014is now completely shot to shit.</p><p>But I shouldn\u2019t let it get to me. I really shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>That evening, we cook up the trout Bill and the campers caught that afternoon. I watch as all the campers clamor to sit near Griffin; they\u2019re like a bunch of puppies.</p><p>\u201cYou shot a lion in Africa?\u201d I hear one of them gasp.</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it scary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of gun did you use?\u201d</p><p>He gamely tries to answer all their questions. I set my fork down.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing even remotely cool about going on a hunting trip like that,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stops and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cHow is it any different from, say, deer hunting?\u201d Allison asks sweetly.</p><p>\u201cThere is a huge difference between hunting for sport and hunting because you\u2019re actually going to use what you kill. Hunting for sport like that is ridiculous and pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually the one to shoot the lion,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cI was pretty young at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople hunt for all sorts of reasons,\u201d Bill says. He gives me a look. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t put down others just because we don\u2019t happen to agree with everything they do.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve only eaten about half the food on my plate\u2014and the trout really is good\u2014but I stand up from the picnic table. \u201cI\u2019m going to get started on the mess in the kitchen,\u201d I say, which mostly no one hears because they\u2019ve all turned their attention back to Griffin. He gives me a curious look as I walk by and it\u2019s all I can do not to dump my plate of food on his head.</p><p>In the kitchen, I busy myself wiping up fish scales and vegetable peelings. The sound of laughter comes in through the open window and I glance out to see Griffin telling some story, gesturing with his hands, everyone is cracking up.</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly sure why I feel this much rage toward him. In a way, Allison does have a good point\u2014it is good for the campers to have a younger male around, someone other than Bill. And clearly, Griffin is able to relate to the kids and they adore him. But it is not the way I envisioned this summer going. This is the one solace I had, dependable in its total predictability, and now that\u2019s completely gone to hell.</p><p>I decide to clean the entire kitchen. While they\u2019re out there eating dessert, I sweep and mop the floors, clean out the fridge, scrub the sink. It feels good to have something to pour all this energy into and I\u2019m so focused on what I\u2019m doing that I don\u2019t realize he\u2019s come into the kitchen until he clears his throat and says, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I stop scrubbing and brush my hair back from my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sets his plate on the clean counter. \u201cYou really shamed me back there, you know. About the lion hunting.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s joking or not; his expression is difficult to read.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s something my father wanted to do. He thought it would be a good father-son bonding experience or something. The African Serengeti is totally the place I\u2019d choose for something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your dad sounds like a real gem.\u201d</p> <p>Griffin smiles. \u201cOh, he is. You have no idea. Except when it came down to actually taking the shot, he couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is that supposed to make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that. But, yes, maybe. Seeing as I wasn\u2019t the one who actually did it.\u201d He reaches across me and turns the water on, runs his plate under the faucet. His arm touches mine and I take a step back.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re leaving, there\u2019s really nothing to say,\u201d I snap.</p> <p>Something that might be a hurt look crosses his face. I try not to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to make you decide I\u2019m this terrible person, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou showing up here was enough. I\u2019ve had an incredibly shitty year and I figured the one thing I could count on was coming back to my summer job\u2014the same summer job I\u2019ve had for years now\u2014and knowing that at least this would be the same as it\u2019s always been, that at least I had that to look forward to. But no, I don\u2019t even have that, because you show up\u2014claiming you were fucking kidnapped, which is the biggest load of shit, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He holds up his hands. \u201cLook, sweetheart\u2014is it because you feel like I\u2019m stealing the spotlight from you or something? Because that\u2019s really not what I\u2019m trying to do at all. Allison said you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cAllison knows nothing about me. And I don\u2019t care about this proverbial spotlight, I just want things to go back to how they used to be.\u201d I say the last part of this sentence in a shaky voice, and I\u2019m mortified to feel tears pricking the corners of my eyes.</p><p>He looks at me, confused. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>But I don\u2019t answer. I turn and leave the kitchen, refusing to let him or anyone else see me cry. A sob rises up in my throat that I try valiantly to keep from surfacing but it\u2019s too late, and I\u2019m probably not out of earshot when I burst into tears.</p><p>I actually go and cry on my bed for a good five minutes. Finally, I stop, a few residual hiccups left over.</p><p>Get a grip, I tell myself. I sit up, my face soggy. This is pathetic. It doesn\u2019t have to ruin my summer, it doesn\u2019t have to do anything. Griffin is here, and most likely, Allison will keep him preoccupied the whole time. End of the fucking problem.</p><p>Chapter 9: Griffin</p><p>I\u2019ve got to admit that it\u2019s nice not having anything.</p><p>I haven\u2019t run through an official inventory yet, but somewhere between here and Koh Phangan is my North Face rucksack with my passport, my iPhone, a wallet containing ID, debit card, cash, the keys to my apartment in Tribeca. Also clothes, a pair of Gucci sunglasses, a bottle of Clive Christian No. 1. Perhaps all that stuff is floating in the Great Pacific garbage patch, or maybe it\u2019s been sold on the black market and some kid in Bangkok is rocking my sunglasses and two thousand dollar bottle of cologne.</p><p>But it\u2019s nice, basically being stranded here at this horse ranch in Northern Cali. For the first time in a long time I really feel like I\u2019m taking a break. Like this is something different, a change of pace. I find myself actually looking forward to getting up early. You\u2019d think, then, that I\u2019d wouldn\u2019t do anything that might jeopardize this pastoral existence I\u2019ve somehow stumbled into, but I decide it\u2019s time to call my father. Allison lets me use her phone and I walk down to one of the paddocks and lean against the split-rail fence while I wait for him to answer his phone.</p><p>\u201cCarl Alexander,\u201d he says in a clipped tone when he picks up.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Dad, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cGriffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. Who else would be calling you Dad?\u201d That\u2019s another distinction Cam made for himself early on. I don\u2019t actually have any memories of Cam calling our father \u201cDad.\u201d It was always \u201cCarl.\u201d Carl, would you let me borrow your Mercedes, or, better yet, buy me one of my own? Carl, you won\u2019t believe how Griffin fucked up again. Carl, would you pass the peas?</p><p>\u201cThere was some static on the line. I\u2019m out on the golf course. It\u2019s windy. I don\u2019t usually answer my phone when I\u2019m golfing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you did this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I did. So would you like to tell me what exactly it is I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . you know. Just had a quick question. Did you receive any strange calls from someone? From someone, say, oh, I don\u2019t know, claiming that they had kidnapped me?\u201d</p><p>He coughs, once, twice. \u201cExcuse me one minute,\u201d I hear him say in a muffled voice to whoever he\u2019s out golfing with. He gets back on the phone. \u201cI may have received a rather unorthodox call. Clearly, though, you are all right. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always are.\u201d Or at least you think you always are.</p><p>\u201cSo then I was also correct in assuming that the call was a prank. Yet another pathetic extortion attempt by people who are too lazy or too stupid to amass large sums of money on their own. It\u2019s really not difficult, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Extorting you? Because there actually were two men, who are probably dead now, who said they were going to kill me unless you paid them 7.2 million dollars. And confessed to something. What on earth could you possibly have to confess to, Dad?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lot he could confess to, I\u2019m sure. A thing or two I might even be privy to, if you want the truth, though I\u2019m no snitch. I wonder, though, just what sort of things he\u2019s done that has pissed off someone so badly they\u2019d demand that much money and a confession.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you need, Griffin? Because if not, I\u2019ve got things to get back to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t want to keep the putting green waiting. But yes. While I was being kidnapped, I lost my wallet. Can you believe it? So I need some money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall your mother. She\u2019s probably at home. She can transfer whatever you need into your bank account. You might also want to consider getting a job. Getting your life together and stop living off my dime. That thought ever cross your mind? You think your brother would call me with some ridiculous story like this? Get back in touch when you\u2019ve got some good news to share. Like I said, I\u2019m in the middle of something important right now, so it\u2019s not really a good time to be talking about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great!\u201d I say. \u201cTry not to go eight over par this time! Bye, Dad!\u201d</p><p>I throw the phone down and wonder how it\u2019s possible my father is such a fucking douchebag.</p><p>I take a few calming breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Ommmm. I had relations with a yoga teacher once, and aside from being wonderfully flexible, she taught me how to breathe. How most people go through their whole life not really being conscious of breath, and how, in almost any situation, taking a step back, looking inward, and focusing on breathing, will help you feel better almost immediately.</p><p>I pick up the phone and dial Cam\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Griffin,\u201d I say when he picks up.</p><p>\u201cI know who it is,\u201d he snaps. \u201cWhere are you? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m okay, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not . . . you\u2019re not kidnapped?\u201d A hard edge is starting to creep into his tone.</p><p>\u201cI was kidnapped. And managed to escape, with the little help of an overzealous cetacean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whale.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a noisy breath. Cam, I can assure you, is not one of those people who pays much attention to the way they breathe.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d he says, his voice low. \u201cI am going to ask you this one time. Once, you got that? And you better tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you just fucking with me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Do you seriously think I\u2019d call you out of the blue and tell you that I\u2019d been kidnapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer to that question is so blatantly obvious I\u2019m not even going to dignify it with a response. So what happened, then? Where are you now?\u201d</p><p>I tell myself the concern in his voice is because he actually does give a shit about what happens to me. \u201cI\u2019m in California. Half Moon Bay. Nice place, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back to New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh . . . not right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d really like to speak to you. In person.\u201d</p><p>I straighten. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come back to New York. I\u2019ll come get you at the airport. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . well. Okay. Okay, maybe I can do that. I mean, I will eventually, but I was sort of enjoying myself out here. I\u2019ve got a job, even. Cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job? You, Griffin Alexander, all of a sudden have a job? What, are you settling down now? You need to get your ass back to New York, because I really need to talk to you about this.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. This is interesting. If I\u2019m not mistaken, it almost sounds like there\u2019s a note of desperation in his voice. \u201cI talked to Dad, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He didn\u2019t seem all that concerned. About anything, except golfing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Griffin. There\u2019s a meeting I\u2019ve got to get to\u2014I\u2019m already late. Is this your phone number? I\u2019m going to call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I lost my phone. I don\u2019t have a phone. Which is actually kind of nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be available so I can reach you. Can you get a phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll send you one. Tell me your address. Tell me where to send you a phone. Do you need anything else? I can send you whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . just my yellow Speedo thong for the days I\u2019m not wearing the mankini.\u201d</p><p>There is a pause, and then he actually laughs, though it sounds forced. \u201cJust give me your mailing address.\u201d</p><p>I give him the address. \u201cI\u2019ll express mail it,\u201d he says. \u201cBe expecting a package. And my call. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up. I stare at the phone for a while and wonder if that conversation actually just happened.</p><p>See, the thing about Cam is that he\u2019s never acted like he\u2019s given two shits about me. Ever. I was always the annoying little brother, the tagalong, and then I was the obnoxious wild child, where it seemed like my sole purpose for existing was to fuck up and make Cam look like the golden boy he is.</p><p>But I\u2019ve always wanted him to like me. Pretty much everyone he comes in contact with does, and usually only the very successful men and very beautiful women are given the privilege of his company.</p><p>It\u2019s just as likely he\u2019s getting his assistant to go buy a phone to express mail to me, but I like to think he\u2019s hurrying down to the Mac store, stuffing an iPhone into a padded envelope, and writing my name on it himself. Waiting in line at the post office or FedEx or wherever. There is, of course, a part of me that doesn\u2019t think this package will ever show up, that doubts my brother will call, but a larger part of me hopes he will. And if he does, then . . . maybe I should have got myself kidnapped sooner.</p><p>I go for a swim, which, even after all I\u2019ve been through, is still my second favorite way to let off some steam and clear my head. The water is cold but refreshing. I follow the footpath back to the ranch, but stop before I actually come all the way out into the clearing. Jill is walking into the main pasture where they keep most of the horses, and several of the horses are ambling over toward her. She pets them, and it looks like she\u2019s talking to them though I can\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying. She pulls something out of the back pocket of her jeans and then runs her hand down one of the horse\u2019s legs. The horse lifts its foot to her and she bends, using the pick she\u2019s pulled from her pocket to dig something from the horse\u2019s hoof. When she\u2019s done, she gives the horse a hearty pat on the neck, and the horse bumps its nose against her shoulder, as if to say thanks.</p><p>She looks different, around the horses, even from this distance I can tell. More at ease, more like who I think she might\u2019ve looked like when she was younger, when you\u2019re still carefree and don\u2019t have to deal with all the stresses of life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stand there for a few more minutes. She looks at peace. It doesn\u2019t matter if anyone\u2019s ever told her about yoga breathing before\u2014in this moment, she\u2019s totally content. I\u2019ve seen a lot of girls in my time, but watching her out there in the pasture, I think she looks like no girl I have ever seen before.</p><p>Chapter 10: Jill</p><p>Brunch with Uncle Nate is grueling. Mom is thrilled to be out, though, and so for that, I am thankful, even though I know an excursion like this is going to leave her drained and exhausted for the next few days.</p> <p>I always thought my uncle was a more severe version of my father, and since Dad died, it\u2019s become even more so. The lines on his face have gotten deeper, his shoulders have gotten rounder\u2014though whether that\u2019s from stress or working out, I couldn\u2019t tell you\u2014even his voice seems louder. He yanks at the collar of his black polo shirt, as though it\u2019s choking him, even though he\u2019s only got one of the buttons fastened.</p><p>For the first half of the meal, we manage to stay on relatively neutral topics. School. Mom\u2019s health. My summer job.</p><p>\u201cHow is it going with that young man?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cYoung man?\u201d Uncle Nate says. He blots at the corners of his mouth with his napkin. \u201cIs there a special man in your life?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA young man showed up at camp and he and Jilly weren\u2019t seeing eye to eye on everything,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get along with everyone,\u201d Uncle Nate says sagely. \u201cThat is an unfortunate fact of life. Even your father, bless his soul, couldn\u2019t get along with everyone.\u201d He takes a sip of his water, ice clinking around the glass. \u201cHard to believe it\u2019s almost been a year.\u201d</p><p>Cue conspiracy talk in five, four, three, two, one\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier to accept and move on if someone was paying for the crime. If it was acknowledged in a court of law that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan. It was an accident.\u201d Mom reaches one pale hand out and touches Uncle Nate\u2019s thick wrist. \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t expect you to remember everything clearly, especially considering all that you\u2019ve been through. You experienced severe trauma, Annabel. You\u2019re still experiencing it. Life as you knew it has been completely upended. Your husband was killed. You\u2019re in a wheelchair, for god\u2019s sake! You don\u2019t want the person responsible to pay for this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Mom says softly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no it wasn\u2019t. I might not have the hard evidence to take to the cops, but this all goes back to the when Mike worked for CFG. He didn\u2019t give me all the details, but he was onto something. Something with one of those food companies, the baby formula they manufactured. Labeling it as one thing but dumping all these harmful ingredients into it. He didn\u2019t get the chance to give me the specifics, but he was planning to report it to the proper channels.\u201d Uncle Nate sits back and looks at us, as if rehashing his theory for the nine millionth time might jar something loose from our memories.</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t talk to me about his job,\u201d I say. Dad always had various white-collar jobs, but his real love was being outside, doing things with his hands. No, when Dad and I spent time together, we talked about nature, about astronomy, we talked about the weather and the types of clouds, we went bird-watching, clamming\u2014we did all the things Dad couldn\u2019t do when he was at work. \u201cAnd I think we should also stop talking about it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d want us sitting around speculating about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Uncle Nate slams his fist on the table. The silverware jumps; the glasses rattle. The people seated closest to us stop talking and look. \u201cWhy am I the only one who is not going to rest until this has been resolved? Until this family gets the justice it deserves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t know when to just leave something alone?\u201d I ask, which is something Dad himself would say\u2014though in a much fonder tone\u2014about Uncle Nate from time to time.</p><p>\u201cYou people just want to try to go on with what\u2019s left of your lives while whoever did this is out there probably doing more of the same twisted shit. I can\u2019t just sit back and not take action. It\u2019s not in my blood.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cYour father and I might have very different ways of going about things, but essentially, it\u2019s the same thing: We will not let an injustice slip through the cracks. We will not allow those who have committed crimes, for Christ\u2019s sake, to get off scot-free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I say, annoyed that the conversation has once again turned into this. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re some vigilante now? That you\u2019re going to go out and seek justice for us in your own way since you\u2019ve basically got nothing to go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you I was working on a way to get the person who I believe is responsible for this to come forward? To finally own up to it? Would it matter to you the WAY in which I went about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, yes.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Nate stares. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems a little hypocritical of you to go off and do something illegal in order to prove that someone else is guilty of doing something illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it meant getting some measure of justice for your father?\u201d He looks at Mom. \u201cFor your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs justice going to bring Dad back? Is justice going to magically fix Mom\u2019s spinal cord?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Nate waves a hand at me dismissively. \u201cYou know I love you, Jill. But you\u2019re shaming this family right now. If it was you who had been killed or injured, your father wouldn\u2019t rest until he found out who did it. I can guarantee you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only guarantee I\u2019d like from you is that you won\u2019t bring this up anymore. Because I\u2019m sick of hearing about it. Do I wish Dad hadn\u2019t died? Of course. More than you probably know, Uncle Nate. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s dead, and you making me crazy with these ridiculous conspiracy theories of yours is not how I want to spend the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each other. He\u2019s a man used to winning these sorts of stare downs, but not this time. He finally looks away and picks up his water glass again, takes a sip.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . . can we just enjoy our time out?\u201d Mom says. \u201cI\u2019d just like to enjoy the three of us being here together and not talk about that other stuff right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never want to talk about it,\u201d Uncle Nate says huffily. He takes a deep breath. \u201cBut fine. Tell me more about this young man, Jill. He\u2019s a love interest of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d I say. I take a sip of orange juice even though I\u2019m not thirsty. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t get along. I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be leaving soon, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d As if I could be so lucky.</p><p>After we get Mom back home and settled, Uncle Nate acts like he\u2019s going to leave, but instead asks me to walk with him out to his car.</p><p>He pulls his wallet out of his back pocket and extracts a check from it, which he hands to me. \u201cIf you need more, let me know,\u201d he says.</p><p>I grit my teeth and fold the check without looking at the sum, which I know contains a lot of zeros. \u201cThank you,\u201d I manage to say.</p><p>He rubs his hand across the lower part of his face and then folds his arms across his chest. \u201cJill,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cI know you think I can\u2019t let things go,\u201d he continues, \u201cand maybe you\u2019re right, but I know this wasn\u2019t an accident. I just know it. As much as I know how much your father loved you and your mother, and how proud of you he was.\u201d</p><p>I stuff the check into the pocket of my jeans and take a step toward him. He is only a few inches taller than I am. \u201cYou are free to do what you want,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut neither Mom nor I need to hear any more about your conspiracy theories, or whatever illegal activities you\u2019ve decided to do to try to get justice. Do you understand me? And this has nothing to do with how much I love my father or how very much I wish that none of this shit happened to begin with.\u201d</p><p>He uncrosses his arms and for a second I think he\u2019s going to hit me, because people just don\u2019t talk like that to Uncle Nate, but instead he just holds his hands up as though admitting defeat.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t understand. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re women. Maybe women process things differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is it, then? You don\u2019t want me to talk about this stuff in front of your mother because it upsets her\u2014okay, I won\u2019t. But I\u2019d appreciate it if you would enlighten me as to why you are so content to just sit back and do nothing. YOUR FATHER IS DEAD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI FUCKING KNOW THAT!\u201d I scream back. The neighbors across the street had been sitting on their front porch, but they quickly get up and move inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you know that then I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! It was no accident, Jill, mark my words. What kind of sign are you waiting for? What the hell needs to happen to make you realize that there is something more going on here?\u201d</p><p>I pull the check from my pocket and rip it up into tiny pieces and throw them in his face where they flutter down like confetti. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your money. We don\u2019t need you coming around here trying to tell us that we don\u2019t care when in fact we do. Just because we don\u2019t happen to deal with things the same way you do doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t bother us. Don\u2019t you get that? Or have you just got it all figured out? Go off and do whatever it is that you think is going to prove something that\u2019s un-provable. Go ahead. We don\u2019t need to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome day you will,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI hope to god that someday, somehow, something will make you realize that this wasn\u2019t just an accident.\u201d</p><p>He gets in his car and peels away, leaving me standing there in a cloud of exhaust.</p><p>Bill and Lorrie have taken the kids on a hike, so Karen and I stay back and work in the kitchen to get things ready for the cookout we\u2019ll have later. This cookout is a more toned down version of the Beach Party BBQ. There won\u2019t be any camping out on the beach and everyone will probably be back and in bed by ten, but we still have an enormous amount of food to prepare. Karen is making a giant bowl of fruit salad and I\u2019m patting out circles of ground beef into burgers.</p><p>\u201cI just feel so fortunate for this opportunity,\u201d Karen says as she slices strawberries. \u201cEspecially since Griff got here.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze the handful of ground beef that I\u2019ve got and feel it ooze through my fingers. Better than a stress ball. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize him showing up would drastically alter the quality of your time here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I get to work with someone who\u2019s clearly so gifted in . . . many areas, really.\u201d</p><p>I stifle a laugh. \u201cAnd you too,\u201d Karen adds quickly. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re so great with the horses. And he\u2019s so great at so many things. Did you see him swimming today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I missed out on that exquisite pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She stops chopping fruit and leans toward me. \u201cI think he\u2019s the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever seen. Allison is so lucky!\u201d</p><p>The screen door peels open and Griffin walks into the kitchen, alone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Allison?\u201d I say.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard you ladies might need some assistance in here getting the stuff for the cookout ready.\u201d</p><p>He walks over to where we\u2019re standing and grabs a handful of raspberries from one of the containers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to wash that first?\u201d Karen asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what pesticides it\u2019s got on it.\u201d</p><p>He pops the raspberry into his mouth. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cI smoke cigarettes. Do you think a chemical or two on a piece of fruit is going to bother me? You should be congratulating me for making healthy eating choices.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t smoke. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>He leans against the refrigerator and tosses a few more raspberries into his mouth. I look down at the burgers, but I can see him watching me.</p><p>\u201cWhy Jill,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you cared. I\u2019m touched.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about you,\u201d I say. \u201cI care about the fact that you\u2019re smoking around the horses, and setting a bad example for the kids here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually cut way back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt must have something to do with being out here in all this fresh air. My lungs just don\u2019t know what to do with themselves.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you and your lungs could come over here and help us get the rest of this food prepared, if you\u2019re looking for something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not.\u201d I push the bowl of ground hamburger toward him. \u201cBecause if I was, you wouldn\u2019t still be around. Here, you can help me make the burgers.\u201d</p> <p>He grins and starts to reach for the bowl. \u201cI\u2019m happy to squeeze some beef for you, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, can you just shut up? Do you have to act like such a moron all the time? And wash your hands first! I don\u2019t even want to know where they\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Karen is staring at me, her mouth hanging halfway open. I shoot her a look. Griffin slinks over to the sink, but I know he\u2019s still got a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unhygienic,\u201d I tell Karen. \u201cYou of all people should care about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . you don\u2019t have to be so harsh,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be working here, he\u2019s got to set a good example. The campers look up to him. Why they look up to him still remains a mystery to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, easy,\u201d Griffin says. He runs his hands under the water, soaping his arms all the way up to the elbows, like he\u2019s a doctor about to go into surgery. \u201cSweetheart, you need to settle down. I\u2019m not trying to get anyone worked up here or anything, okay? I just wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just nothing. Don\u2019t come in here and start telling me what to do. In fact, we don\u2019t actually need your help in here; why don\u2019t you go back out and find some adoring campers to fawn over you, because that\u2019s clearly where you excel. Your presence is not needed or wanted in here.\u201d</p><p>He finishes rinsing the suds from his forearms. From the corner of my eye, I can see Karen giving me a horrified look.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI guess I will go do that, then.\u201d He slinks out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d Karen asks. \u201cWhy did you yell at him like that? He just wanted to help!\u201d</p> <p>I grit my teeth. I can feel the stress building in my neck and shoulders. \u201cI think we can handle it in here,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAs long as we stop talking about it and just get to work. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nods but then looks at the door where Griffin has just disappeared.</p><p>Great. Someone else who is on his side.</p><p>Chapter 11: Griffin</p><p>The phone that Cam sent me arrived, and I might be mistaken, but I\u2019m pretty sure he did in fact address the envelope himself. I choose a whimsical ring tone and leave it my pocket, though it hasn\u2019t rung yet. Allison has been bugging me to give her the number, but I don\u2019t, claiming I don\u2019t know, which actually is the truth.</p><p>Later that night, I see Jill heading to her cabin. I watch her as she walks, the big strides she takes with those long legs. She\u2019s wearing cutoff jean shorts, with probably a four- or five-inch inseam, but there\u2019s still a lot of slender thigh there on display.</p><p>I jog after her. \u201cHey,\u201d I say as I approach.</p><p>She turns. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cNice night for a walk.\u201d It\u2019s foggy and there\u2019s a fine mist falling, but whatever.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look amused. \u201cSo take a walk, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to join me? I\u2019m not really that familiar with the area. I wouldn\u2019t want to get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. It\u2019s getting late. I want to go inside, take a shower, and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a back massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I bet Allison would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on Jill,\u201d I say. \u201cCan\u2019t you at least pretend you like me? Let\u2019s just take a little walk, and then I promise I\u2019ll never speak to you again, if you want.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. She\u2019s got a long, thin nose, and a small mouth, but full lips. I have never had a girl turn me down before, and the fact that she so clearly hates me is such a turn on that I almost tell her. But I don\u2019t. Because this is new. And fun.</p><p>\u201cSo if I take a walk with you now, you won\u2019t speak to me for the rest of the summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, only if you want it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. She pulls the hood of her sweatshirt up. \u201cI definitely want it like that. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>We walk down to the beach. She stays about five feet away from me, but I match her stride for stride.</p><p>\u201cAre we having a race?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naturally a fast walker.\u201d But she slows a little and looks at me. \u201cWas there a purpose to this walk or did you just need to burn off the last of your energy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought maybe we could try to make amends. I just see you and you seem so miserable and I hope I didn\u2019t have a role to play in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you,\u201d she says after a minute. \u201cI mean, was I expecting you to show up here like this? No. But whatever. Clearly you\u2019re not a psychopath and you\u2019re good with kids, so in that regards, it\u2019s working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Jill,\u201d I say. \u201cI do believe that\u2019s the first compliment you\u2019ve ever given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd probably the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what else does it have to do with, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bad time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer is the best time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not when it\u2019s the season that your parents were in a car accident that killed your father and paralyzed your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Good one, asshole, I think. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She stuffs her hands in the front pocket of her sweatshirt and starts walking fast again. \u201cHow were you supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, I guess. I\u2019m still sorry. When did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. So it\u2019s still pretty recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always seems like it\u2019s the wrong people who end up dying. This probably sounds horrible, but I don\u2019t think it will bother me too much when my old man finally kicks it. Which will probably happen never, because he\u2019s one of those assholes who\u2019s going to live forever.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a horrible thing to say. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t had those thoughts before myself.\u201d</p><p>We walk quietly for a few minutes, and I think I am starting to understand why she\u2019s been as hostile as she has. Though tragedy has not been a prevalent theme in my life, usually it seems like people seek routine, the familiar, to help them get through it. Her summer job here is routine; I am not.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t get along with this lion-hunting father of yours?\u201d she says, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it. And considering he was going to refuse to pay my ransom, I\u2019d say the feeling is probably mutual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going on about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. And I know\u2014no one believes me. Well, I think my brother might. He express mailed me this phone the other day, so he could call me\u2014since my other one got lost the night I was abducted\u2014and he hasn\u2019t called yet, but I think he\u2019s going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were kidnapped but your brother wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My brother is not the sort that would ever get kidnapped. He wouldn\u2019t let himself get into that sort of situation. Whereas me, on the other hand, I\u2019m always getting into those situations. It\u2019s kind of amazing I hadn\u2019t been kidnapped before.\u201d I glance at her. There is no trace of a smile on her face. Usually all I have to do is even think of opening my mouth to say something and the girl is usually falling over herself, laughing at what I\u2019m about to say. Which actually can be a little unnerving sometimes. \u201cYou and my brother would probably get along really well,\u201d I say. Yes, she\u2019s just the kind of girl Cam would go for, and he\u2019s probably just the kind of guy she would be into. Griffin the Matchmaker. Happy to help.</p><p>\u201cIf your brother is even half as annoying as you are, I\u2019d say not,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cJesus, girl! Are you this prickly with all guys, or do I just bring it out in you?\u201d</p><p>Finally, she gives me a wry smile. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018prick\u2019 in front of me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cOkay, fair enough.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both quiet for a minute. She\u2019s looking at me, and I wonder what she\u2019s thinking about, but I don\u2019t ask. It is actually nice to be standing here with her, not saying anything.</p><p>She shakes her head and starts walking again. \u201cIs your father famous or super rich or something?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely rich, and in his mind he\u2019s famous. He\u2019s Mr. Big Man on Campus at Concord Frazier Group, who I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve never heard of, which perfectly illustrates how famous he really is.\u201d</p><p>An odd look crosses her face. \u201cWhat . . . where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcord Frazier Group. It\u2019s basically a company that owns a bunch of other companies. Pretty boring shit. But to the old man, it\u2019s the most important thing in the world.\u201d</p><p>She stops walking and stares at me for a minute. I cannot, for the life of me, read the expression that has crossed her face. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she says. She turns and strides down the beach.</p><p>Chapter 12: Jill</p><p>I hurry away, a strange feeling rooting itself firmly in the center of my chest. I can hear Uncle Nate\u2019s voice clearly, echoing through my head: This all goes back to when Mike worked for CFG. Concord Frazier Group. Dad oversaw the management team that ran Organica, owned by the Concord Frazier Group.</p><p>My thoughts whirl around my head. Dad worked for Griffin\u2019s father? It seems so implausible, so unlikely that this could be the case. What are the chances of his son washing up on the beach of the summer camp that I worked at?</p><p>It was no accident, Jill, mark my words. What kind of sign are you waiting for? What the hell needs to happen to make you realize that there is something more going on here?</p><p>I can hear Uncle Nate\u2019s voice like he\u2019s right there, yelling in my ear.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s nothing, I tell myself.</p><p>Maybe it really is just a coincidence.</p><p>But what if it\u2019s not?</p><p>I glance behind me a few times, to see if Griffin\u2019s following me. He isn\u2019t; he\u2019s moved further down the beach in the opposite direction. I walk back to my cabin and go inside, shut the door, both the screen door and the wooden one.</p><p>I go back and forth between believing that it\u2019s just an insane coincidence and that it\u2019s the sign Uncle Nate was talking about.</p><p>Suddenly, I recall something else Uncle Nate said that day at brunch.</p><p>I can\u2019t just sit back and not take action. It\u2019s not in my blood.</p><p>A cold feeling settles over me, even though I\u2019m still in my sweatshirt with the hood pulled up and the cabin is actually rather warm.</p><p>Maybe Griffin really has been telling the truth all along.</p><p>Chapter 13: Griffin</p><p>The problem with people like Allison is they\u2019re used to getting what they want. I should know.</p><p>So when she finds me Saturday morning and asks if I want to take a drive up to San Francisco with her, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not so much asking as expecting.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stay here?\u201d I don\u2019t actually feel like driving up to San Francisco.</p><p>\u201cWe could. But Mom and Dad are taking the campers down to Watsonville for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatsonville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir friends own a raspberry farm. They\u2019re going to get a tour and work a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it; Mom and Dad plus Jill and Karen can handle it. I already cleared it with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Jill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your boss. With Mom and Dad. They think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>I relent, mostly because after our beach walk the other night, I don\u2019t think Jill ever wants to see me again, though I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened.</p><p>That\u2019s what I think about as we drive up to the city. I\u2019m usually not one to replay events over in my head and try to figure out where I went wrong, but the entire scene has been running in my mind like a movie on repeat.</p><p>I\u2019d thought we were actually on the path to making amends, with her opening up about her parents. Well, sort of opening up. It felt like if we were getting some place. Like maybe she was starting to not see me like the gigantic asshole she so clearly thinks I am.</p><p>But then she just took off like that. What had I been talking about? My dad? Is my dad such a toxic person that even mentioning him in conversation causes people to retract? I mean, what the fuck? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe should go shopping for a little while and then there\u2019s this great bar I want to take you to,\u201d Allison says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Bar? It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock in the morning. And you\u2019re sixteen.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a coy look. \u201cI have a fake I.D. And I wouldn\u2019t expect someone like you to care what hour of the day it is when it comes to indulging.\u201d</p> <p>She is so smug and so self-assured that for a second, I want to reach over and slap her, but then I realize it\u2019s just because she reminds me exactly of myself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have my I.D.,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She smirks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I know the doorman. He\u2019ll let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be here, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr would you rather be heading down to some fruit farm with Jill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d Though in a way, yes, I would.</p><p>\u201cNot that I want to talk shit or anything, but Jill is one of those people who\u2019s better with animals than people. I mean, that\u2019s why my parents keep her on here, because she\u2019s so good with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems pretty good with the campers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay. But she\u2019s a prude, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t know how to have fun. Why does she give you such a hard time? Why can\u2019t she just be cool about things, you know? Life is too short; it\u2019s silly to be that uptight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is dealing with some pretty heavy shit right now, though.\u201d</p><p>Allison looks at me, eyebrow raised. \u201cHas she been talking to you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I know is her parents were in a car accident and her dad died and her mom\u2019s in a wheelchair for life. They drove their car off a bridge, onto Treasure Island. A huge clusterfuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds intense. Bad way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jill. Let\u2019s talk about something else. This is boring.\u201d She reaches over and puts her hand on mine. I start to pull it back, but she tightens her grip. I look at her, but she\u2019s staring straight ahead, weaving her car in and out of traffic. Suddenly, the phone in my pocket starts to ring, and I pull my hand from hers and answer.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d call,\u201d I say. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see Allison watching me, one eyebrow raised slightly. Oh, it\u2019d be so easy to fuck with her. \u201cAre you wearing that underwear I sent you?\u201d</p><p>She stiffens, and I stifle my laugh.</p><p>\u201cGriffin!\u201d Cam\u2019s voice is loud enough that I\u2019m sure Allison can hear it\u2019s a guy and not, say, some girlfriend or something. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with you for the past three days! I didn\u2019t just send you a phone for you to NOT answer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any missed calls. I\u2019ve had this thing on me the whole time. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am, and I have been. Now that I\u2019ve got you on the phone, though, I need you to tell me EVERYTHING that happened. I talked with Carl, and he wasn\u2019t that helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d I say mildly. \u201cWell, where do you want me to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the beginning. Where were you, who were these men, what did they say? Did you go to the police yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Honestly, Cam, the guys are probably dead.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s head swivels toward me.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was being at the Full Moon Party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull Moon Party. A rave, basically. Yes, I did some drugs. But just the usual amount, not enough to knock me out. So at some point, I\u2019m guessing someone must\u2019ve slipped me something, in my drink, or gave me something that wasn\u2019t actually ecstasy, acid, K, or cocaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. Some pot, too. Oh, and a little GHB. That\u2019s probably what got me. I don\u2019t usually do that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you, Griffin? I mean, seriously, life is just one big rave for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the world is my dance floor. God is a DJ, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d he says, his voice tight. \u201cWith the story, not your drug addiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was there, the music was bangin\u2019, the vibe was tight, it was a good time. And then I don\u2019t really remember anything until I wake up stuffed in some walk-in closet on someone\u2019s yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then . . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there were these two guys there\u2014sorry, I didn\u2019t catch their names\u2014and they said that they\u2019d been in touch with Dad and unless he paid 7.2 million\u2014kind of a random number, huh?\u2014and confessed to something, that they\u2019d kill me. And then they said Dad wasn\u2019t really taking them seriously and had me call him, and guess what\u2014he didn\u2019t take me seriously, either, and that\u2019s when I called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have no idea who these guys were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never seen them before. And, like I said, will probably never see them again. Because a whale breached, hit the boat, the boat sank, and off I swam. Guess those years of swimming lessons finally paid off, huh?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet, though I can practically hear the cogs turning in his brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Cam? Do you know something about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t. But I find it highly disturbing that these men would follow you to Thailand and kidnap you and then try to extort our father. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet instead of doing anything about it, you get yourself a job in California. What are you doing, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on a horse ranch.\u201d</p><p>He snorts. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m actually a male prostitute. That seemed a more lucrative way to go.\u201d</p><p>We talk for a little longer. Cam grills me, but after a few minutes it\u2019s pretty clear that I don\u2019t have any juicy tidbits that are going to help him figure out whatever it is he needs to figure out. I don\u2019t actually believe him when he says he doesn\u2019t know anything about it, because if he didn\u2019t, why on earth would he suddenly be taking such an interest? There is a part of me that wants to believe maybe he really is just as highly disturbed as he claims to be that someone kidnapped his little bro. Yeah, sure, okay.</p><p>We get off the phone. Allison looks at me. \u201cWho was that?\u201d she says. \u201cWhat the fuck were you talking about? Kidnapped? A boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d I tell her. \u201cA story I made up. That was actually an ex-girlfriend. She wants to get back together. Wanted to. I just . . . I just had to make up a story so she\u2019d back off.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet you\u2019d do that for me.\u201d</p><p>I tuck the phone back into my pocket. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just that kind of guy.\u201d For the rest of the ride, I\u2019m left wondering what kind of guy my brother is.</p><p>Chapter 14: Jill</p><p>The Raspberry Pilgrimage\u2014as it became known\u2014is an all-day affair that sends us down to Watsonville in the two Econoline buses with Sea Horse Ranch painted on the side. The couple who owns the raspberry farm is long-time friends of Bill and Lorrie\u2019s, and the kids will get to spend the day helping out, not just with the raspberries but also the cows, chickens, sheep, goats, and beehives.</p><p>Griffin and Allison are noticeably absent from our adventure. While we drive south on the 1, they\u2019re headed north, to San Francisco. And though this would probably shock him, I\u2019m disappointed Griffin isn\u2019t here.</p><p>When you find out something that is surprising or you\u2019re not expecting to hear, your mind can do any number of things. It can go completely blank. That\u2019s what happened when I found out about my parents\u2019 accident. For a moment, I was incapable of registering a single thought. And then, when one thought finally was able to form, it was a single short word, on repeat: No.</p><p>But then, other times, your mind can go completely into overdrive, and that\u2019s what happened the other night with Griffin. I stayed up all night thinking about it. Wondering if this was the sign Uncle Nate was talking about. Wondering what I would do with this information that only I knew.</p><p>The best thing I could come up with is instead of ignoring him for the rest of the summer, I\u2019ve decided to get to know him better. Uncle Nate is right; if Dad\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an accident, of course I want to get to the bottom of it, and this really does seem too coincidental to just ignore. I even thought of calling Uncle Nate and letting him know, but something stopped me.</p><p>No, the voice said. Do this on your own. Only go to him if you find something.</p><p>Though what I\u2019m expecting to find, I\u2019m not sure. From the very little I know about Griffin, it\u2019s clear he and his father don\u2019t exactly have a stellar relationship, so it\u2019s doubtful he even knows anything about it, but there\u2019s always the chance he knows something without even realizing it.</p><p>I\u2019m preoccupied with those thoughts all day, watching absently as the kids pick berries and chase chickens and milk the goats. When we finally load everyone back onto the two buses, I\u2019m glad, because I can sit and zone out and try to figure out exactly what my plan is.</p><p>We get back to the ranch and the sun is just setting. Bill gets a fire going and the kids sit around, toasting marshmallows and talking about their farm adventures.</p><p>\u201cThat goat cheese was actually pretty good,\u201d Brett says. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be kind of nasty, but it wasn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t mind going back down there.\u201d</p><p>Several of the kids nod in agreement. It\u2019s nice to see how they\u2019ve settled into camp here, the new friendships that have been forged. I see Simon sitting next to Heather, and they\u2019re both laughing, and for a moment I forget all the other stuff and feel happy for these kids, that they\u2019re having a good time here, regardless of whatever trouble they have in their lives back home.</p><p>When Bill breaks out his guitar and starts strumming, I slip away.</p><p>I walk down to the beach and let myself flop down in the sand. There isn\u2019t a cloud in the sky and I look up at the explosion of stars, toward the east, and pick out the Summer Triangle\u2014Vega, Deneb, and Altair.</p><p>This will not be my life next year, I think. I\u2019m not exactly sure where I\u2019ll be or what I\u2019ll be doing, but it sure as hell won\u2019t be this.</p><p>I catch movement out of the corner of my eye, in the northern part of the sky. A shooting star. If I\u2019d caught it in time, I could\u2019ve made a wish. But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I let my eyes fall closed and the rhythmic sound of the waves pull me toward sleep. I stay like that for a while, in that limbo between sleep and awake when you could be dreaming or not. From somewhere down the beach, someone coughs. I open my eyes and turn my head, rivulets of sand sliding into the neck of my t-shirt.</p><p>For a moment I think it\u2019s Simon, walking down to the water, but this person\u2019s gait is too coordinated, too assured in an easy, almost gliding way. Then he lights a cigarette and sits down. I consider lying there until he leaves, or getting up and slipping away somewhere else, but instead, I stand and walk over.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t smoke,\u201d I tell him. I try to keep my tone light, though, friendly, like I\u2019m making a joke and not reprimanding him.</p><p>He turns his head and exhales and I step to the side before the cloud envelopes me.</p><p>\u201cWell, hi there,\u201d he says. \u201cWas wondering where you ran off to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were staying in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a day trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the top of his head, his hair thick and tousled and black as ink.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep me company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I was just about to head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d He looks up at me. \u201cI wanted to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cSurely whatever you have to tell me you can say to me when I\u2019m standing up.\u201d Be friendly, I remind myself.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, patting the sand. \u201cI won\u2019t bite, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cFor a minute. And you have to put that out, though.\u201d I nod at the cigarette. \u201cIt smells awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d He takes one more drag and then submerges the cigarette into the sand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll bring that with me when I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better.\u201d I dig my toes into the cool sand. \u201cI\u2019m not an uptight bitch, you know,\u201d I say. \u201cYet for some reason, being around you makes me feel like one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou just need to loosen up, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was going fine before you showed up.\u201d I think of my mother, I think of the one-year anniversary of my dad\u2019s death that is rapidly approaching. \u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t fine, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d</p><p>He nudges me with his elbow. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cWith you? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you ever change your mind . . .\u201d</p><p>I look out toward the water, the way the reflection of the moon shimmers on the tops of the waves. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have something you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He waits until I look at him to begin talking. \u201cI am madly in love with you and want to get married. And have children. We would have beautiful children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it beyond your capacity to have a serious conversation?\u201d I start to get up.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t go. There really is something I want to say, and it\u2019s actually of a serious matter. Semi-serious, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not, I\u2019m going to punch you.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I like it rough?\u201d</p><p>I sock him, lightly, on the shoulder. His arm is solid muscle and my hand probably hurts more than his shoulder does.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I wanted to say,\u201d he continues, \u201cis \u2018thank you.\u2019 For helping me out that first night. And going along with it when Allison was giving her dad that story. I could tell you were pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I said would\u2019ve made a bit of difference,\u201d I say. \u201cYou made the decision, shacking up with the owners\u2019 daughter. She gets what she wants, and they\u2019re not going to let some employee tell them otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Griffin laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s no shacking up going on there, sweetheart, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I say skeptically. \u201cGriff.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t hot. But she\u2019s what\u2014sixteen? Seventeen? All set with the statutory rape charges, thank you very much.\u201d \u201cWell, you might want to let her in on that, because she certainly seems awfully enamored with you. And honestly? Knowing Allison, you\u2019re probably not even close to being the oldest guy she\u2019s been with.\u201d Okay, so that was something of a cheap shot but whatever.</p><p>He grins. \u201cAre you . . . jealous?\u201d</p><p>I stand. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re the first good-looking rich boy I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do have some experience, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison said you were kind of a prude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Definitely don\u2019t feel bad about that cheap shot now. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because Allison doesn\u2019t actually know me. I was involved with a guy who was very much like you, if you want to know the truth, and we broke up because I couldn\u2019t stand him. Because he\u2019s arrogant. And an asshole. All things you\u2019re proving to be as well.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. So . . . this ex-boyfriend of yours. He a big guy? Think I could take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I would love to see the two of you battle it out to the death. Really, I\u2019m just trying to get through this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really curious. You should tell me what\u2019s going on with you. I\u2019m not lying when I say I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of lying . . . I\u2019ve been thinking about it. Any sane person would come clean by now if they weren\u2019t being honest about the whole kidnapping thing. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still adamant that it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>I sit back down, facing him. \u201cLook me in the eye and tell me that you\u2019re not lying.\u201d</p><p>He turns his face so he\u2019s looking directly at me. It\u2019s been probably a day since he\u2019s shaved and his face is covered in dark stubble. His eyes, though, are a clear, bright blue. His expression is serious.</p><p>\u201cI would never lie to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really were kidnapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was really kidnapped. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to know?\u201d</p><p>I look back toward the water and wrap my arms around my knees. \u201cA lot,\u201d I say. \u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of time for that.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, and for a minute I almost feel bad that he thinks I\u2019m being nice because I actually like him.</p><p>On Sunday, I go visit Mom. I make us grilled cheese paninis with tomatoes and basil, which is one of her favorite lunches, and we sit at the kitchen table, the window open, a cool breeze blowing through.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t eat much of her sandwich, though, and she winces every time she reaches forward to get her glass of water.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says, wincing again. \u201cI\u2019ve got this pain in my shoulder is all. And my back and my neck and my head . . .\u201d She laughs a little and waves her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Jill.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019s got a sad look on her face, and for a minute I want to tell her what I\u2019m up to, that if Uncle Nate actually is right about their accident, then I am going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>Instead, though, I get up and go to the counter where her array of various medications are kept. The painkillers, the antidepressants, the anti-seizure pills. I twist the cap off the bottle of the Vicodin and give her one.</p><p>\u201cHere, take this.\u201d</p><p>She does, like an obedient child, and I imagine that\u2019s how she must feel and I hate that this is what her life is.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s plan on doing something fun soon. Would you be up for that?\u201d</p><p>She puts the pill in her mouth and washes it down with a sip of water. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something, though. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big, but I\u2019d really like it if you were able to go out and just . . . I don\u2019t know. Have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweetheart. Yes, that sounds nice. Why don\u2019t you think of something and let me know. Hopefully I\u2019ll feel up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about a few things you might feel up for doing. You don\u2019t have to tell me right now, but we can try to plan for it the next Sunday or something.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cHow are things going at the ranch? Lorrie called me the other day and we had a nice chat. How\u2019s everything with that boy you weren\u2019t getting along with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. What\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin. He\u2019s actually . . . a little more interesting than I might have first thought.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiles. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know . . .\u201d I shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s just some things about him that I didn\u2019t realize at first, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, honey. I\u2019m happy to hear that. I\u2019m glad you guys were able to figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d I say, even though, really, I haven\u2019t got anything figured out yet.</p><p>Chapter 15: Griffin</p><p>Some of the campers and I are playing a raucous game of disc golf when I see Jill walking over. She\u2019s wearing her usual four-inch inseam cutoff jeans and work boots and a Sea Horse Ranch t-shirt that\u2019s on the flimsy side, which is a good look for her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be heading out for the hike pretty soon,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys go get your packs and then head over to the lodge and Karen will give you your bag lunches.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cAre you joining us?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t planned on it, as Jill had always seemed intent on keeping our activities as separate as possible, but a hike would be fun, and if she\u2019s offering, well . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d I say. A few of the kids cheer and then hurry off to get their daypacks. \u201cWhere are we hiking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to drive up to Pacifica and hike Sweeney Ridge.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cAnd are you extending the invitation because you\u2019re hoping to push me off the ridge once we make it to the top?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a patient smile. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it, but now that you bring it up . . .\u201d Her gaze goes to the retreating backs of the campers as they head down the hill toward their cabins. \u201cI would have full-on mutiny on my hands if I did that. Those kids sure do like you.\u201d</p><p>I pull a pack of gum from my pocket and take a piece out, then offer one to her. She pauses but then takes it. \u201cIt\u2019s because I carry this around with me,\u201d I say, sliding the gum back into my pocket.</p><p>She unwraps her piece of gum and puts it in her mouth. \u201cI could carry around all the gum in the world and they wouldn\u2019t adore me half as much as they do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\u201d Without really thinking about it, I sling my arm around her shoulders. She doesn\u2019t pull away, though, or try to shrug me off. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16: Jill</p><p>Sweeney Ridge is the longest hike we take with the campers, and it\u2019s one of my favorite places. If it\u2019s a clear day, as it is today, some of the views you get of the Bay Area are absolutely stunning. Dad and I used to come here a lot, and as we pull into the parking area, it\u2019s hard not to think about him and wish that he were here, too. But the kids are all excited, especially to see the abandoned Nike Missile Base covered in all its graffitied glory.</p><p>We take the Mori Ridge and Baquiano Loop, which is a seven-mile loop with about a 1400-foot elevation gain. It will be a challenge for some of the campers, but a lot of the trail is actually paved, and I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll all hang in there and be able to see the 360 degree view of the Bay.</p><p>Some of the campers have stayed behind to go canoeing with Lorrie, Allison, and Karen, so I lead the small group and Griffin brings up the rear. Behind me, I can hear Simon and Heather talking, giggling. I glance over my shoulder and they\u2019re not quite holding hands, but they\u2019re close enough to.</p><p>We come to an area of unpaved trail where there is a line of flagstones that you can walk across like lily pads. Dad and I used to make a game of it\u2014who could cross all the stones without falling off, or, as I got older and more coordinated, who could hop across the stones, or skip across them.</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about as I step on the first one, and then Simon starts to say something and I turn, right as I\u2019m about to step onto another rock. I turn my head only slightly, just so my ear is a little closer, but it throws me off balance and I slip. There\u2019s the pain as my ankle twists awkwardly, which is quickly eclipsed by the feeling of the back of my head slamming into the rock I was just standing on.</p><p>I lie there for a moment, dust rising up around me. A few of the campers have gathered around and their faces take up my entire line of vision, which is slowly draining of color.</p><p>\u201cJill? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I blink. The pain in my head is not enormous, but it\u2019s insistent and I know that trying to sit up\u2014which I very much want to do\u2014would not be a good idea. The colors continue to bleed away, until it looks like we\u2019ve been transported back in time and are in a black and white movie.</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d I say, though my voice is barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cGo get help!\u201d someone yells, and someone yells something back, and both their voices sound very far away. There is a sensation of falling, of dropping away, and suddenly, all I can see is a very narrow tunnel of sky. It would be easy enough to resist, I think, but it also, in a strange way, feels good, so instead of fighting it, I give in to the sense of falling, I let go, curious to see where I\u2019ll land.</p><p>Nowhere, apparently, because it feels like only a second has passed when I reopen my eyes. Color has returned, though the colors seem harsh and a little too sharp. Griffin is there now too, leaning over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say, trying to brush his arm off of me. Sitting up now is painful but possible, but as I start to, he puts his hand on my shoulder and holds me down.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get up yet,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just knocked yourself out. You might have a concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a concussion. How long was I out for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute, maybe. A little less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, then. Let me sit up.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me skeptically and for a second I think he\u2019s not going to let me, but then he does, rocking back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d turned so clumsy,\u201d I say. I glance around to see the worried looks on the campers\u2019 faces and I feel bad for scaring them. \u201cThough this is a good lesson to always carry a First Aid kit with you,\u201d I tell them. I touch the back of my head where a small lump is starting to form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Griffin says, leaning down. He picks me up easily, as though I were nothing more than a small child. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put me down,\u201d I say. \u201cI bumped my head, not broke my leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think of it as me repaying you for helping me out that first night.\u201d He glances over his shoulder. \u201cHey, Brett, will you carry Jill\u2019s pack?\u201d</p> <p>I let him take a few steps and then I twist myself from his arms, land on the ground slightly off-balance. I grab his arm to steady myself.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say. \u201cI appreciate you wanting to help me. But you carrying me back to the van because of a very minor\u2014emphasis on minor\u2014head injury, is just such a clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClich\u00e9?\u201d He grins. \u201cI was thinking more along the lines of romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooh,\u201d one of the campers says. A few of them giggle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need you to be romantic with me.\u201d</p> <p>He drops his head a little, so his mouth is right by my ear. \u201cWhy do you always have to play hard to get?\u201d he asks softly. \u201cLet me carry you back. I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d The pain has settled into a steady thrum that matches my pulse. It is no worse than a low-grade headache. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand. \u201cAt least let me hold your hand then. We don\u2019t want you losing your balance again.\u201d</p><p>He entwines his fingers around mine, his grip gentle, nothing like the vice-lock that Sean used to use whenever he\u2019d hold my hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say finally. \u201cYou can hold my hand until we get back to the main trail, and then you\u2019re letting go.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re really something else.\u201d</p> <p>Though he probably doesn\u2019t mean it as such, I decide to take it as a compliment.</p><p>After I reassure Bill and Lorrie half a dozen times that I\u2019m fine and don\u2019t need to take a trip to the E.R., I go lie down for a while. I try not to replay the scene over and over again, though it\u2019s hard not to and I feel a little embarrassed but also proud of the kids for how well they handled it.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door, and then Karen steps in. \u201cBrett told me what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just going to take a little nap and then I\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything? Can I make you some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Thank you, though.\u201d</p><p>She turns toward the door but then stops. \u201cDid Griffin really carry you all the way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried,\u201d I say with a smile.</p> <p>A dreamy look crosses her face. \u201cI\u2019d totally knock my head against a rock if it meant he would carry me back to camp. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin is very amicable; I\u2019m sure if you ask him he\u2019d be happy to carry you around.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a curious look, as though she\u2019s trying to decipher whether I\u2019m joking or not. I kind of am, although knowing Griffin, he\u2019d probably be down for doing something like that.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Karen. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She leaves and I let my eyes close. I don\u2019t know if I actually fall asleep or not; it\u2019s one of those in-between states where you could be awake or could be asleep, where you\u2019re having dreams but still able to hear all the noises around you.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much times passes but then I hear another tap at the door. I pry open one eye.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I say.</p><p>It\u2019s Griffin, and he comes over and sits at the edge of the bed. \u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d The headache has receded to a dull ache. \u201cKaren was just in here checking on me a little while ago. Don\u2019t be surprised if she asks you to carry her around at some point.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019m not even gonna ask. Just prepare yourself for a few more people to come check in on you after me.\u201d I give him a quizzical look and he touches my forehead. \u201cHead injury, and all. You know, you want to take the proper precautions. No slipping into a coma and dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt this is even a concussion. I\u2019m actually going to get up in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He tucks a few loose strands of hair behind my ear. \u201cEh, you don\u2019t need to. We\u2019ve got it covered. Karen and Allison took some of the kids swimming and the rest are out on a trail ride with Lorrie. It\u2019s pretty quiet out there right now, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kind of scared me for a minute back there, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out for like half a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a little longer than that.\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. It\u2019s embarrassing. In front of all the campers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed. It could\u2019ve happened to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you losing your footing and knocking yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time, but . . . trust me, sweetheart, I\u2019ve done some legitimately embarrassing things in my time, half of which I can\u2019t even remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for helping. And for offering to carry me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd relinquish my last shred of dignity? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with helping someone out. You helped me out, right? That\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you considered me a friend. I have been kind of awful to you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and pats my arm. His hand is warm, and my skin tingles slightly where he\u2019s touching me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hold it against you,\u201d he says. \u201cGirls are usually pretty nice to me, so finding one who wasn\u2019t was actually somewhat refreshing. Rest up, sweetheart. I\u2019ll come back and check on you in a little while.\u201d</p><p>I watch him leave. He pauses at the doorway and glances back and smiles, and I can\u2019t help but return the gesture.</p><p>Chapter 17: Griffin</p><p>There\u2019s a large wall calendar hanging on the tack room door in the barn, and after I come back from putting the last two horses out to pasture, I stop and study the dates. It\u2019s almost the end of June; I don\u2019t know when camp is officially over, but at some point I\u2019ll need to figure out what my next move is going to be.</p><p>It\u2019s almost a little strange, the effect that being here has had on me. In a way, I feel like a different person. The old Griffin probably wouldn\u2019t have even stayed here past the first few days, would\u2019ve flown back to New York, regrouped, and headed off on another adventure. Maybe somewhere a little more relaxing than Thailand, say, the Shetland Islands or Ishigaki. But this new Griffin, he\u2019s thinking of something different. As I stand there and stare at the white boxes and black numbers, I realize that I\u2019d like to actually go out and work. Live a normal life. I don\u2019t want to be the international party boy anymore, living off my dad\u2019s dime. Though it isn\u2019t a lot, what Bill and Lorrie are paying me is the first money I have ever received in return for my efforts. And there is satisfaction in that, and a sense of accomplishment, even though if what I\u2019m accomplishing doesn\u2019t amount to much more than hanging out with some kids and feeding horses hay.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we had such a riveting wall calendar.\u201d</p><p>Jill comes up and stands next to me. She\u2019s got a few shavings stuck in her hair, and I reach over and pick them out. I\u2019m not sure what did it, but things with Jill have definitely been going better. Better than better, even. Maybe knocking herself out on the hike actually did her some good.</p><p>I look back at the calendar. \u201cYeah, the squares are so symmetrical. I\u2019ve never seen a calendar with such symmetrical squares. I\u2019m actually just trying to figure out what my plan is going to be once things wrap up here. That\u2019s in what, August?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Kind of hard to believe it\u2019s almost July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly is one of my favorite months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Good things always seem to happen for me in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birthday\u2019s in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s even more reason, then. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly second. Though the older I get, the less I look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Birthdays are always fun; it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. And you, sweetheart, are not that old.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess good things have never really happened for me on my birthday. Or in the whole month of July, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you let me take you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to; I want to. I will even write the date down so I don\u2019t forget it.\u201d I rip a corner from the calendar and use the pen that\u2019s hanging from a piece of twine. Take Jill out. Friday, 7/2. Something about the date seems familiar, though probably it\u2019s the birthday of some other girl I once knew. I show her what I\u2019ve written and then fold the paper and tuck it into the pocket of my jeans. \u201cSo.\u201d I look up. \u201cWhere should we go? Or would you prefer I plan the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hate to disappoint you,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve already got birthday plans. I\u2019m going to do dinner at my mom\u2019s house, and maybe watch a movie, and then come back here and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner and movie with Mom sounds nice; the rest sounds terribly boring. Maybe you hate your birthday so much because you haven\u2019t done anything fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent theory, but unfortunately I\u2019m not going to change my plans. Why don\u2019t you tell me about your plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? For your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for what you\u2019re going to do after camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I haven\u2019t gotten that far yet. I have no idea, really. But you want to know something, Jill? Just being here at the ranch, and getting to do all the things I\u2019ve been doing\u2014this might sound kind of silly, so don\u2019t laugh\u2014but it\u2019s like it\u2019s opened my eyes to other possibilities, other things I could be doing with my life than just being some rich man\u2019s son. \u2018Cause that\u2019s great and everything for a while, but I want to do something different. I want to work. Doing what, I don\u2019t know, but I just don\u2019t want to waste any more time being a waste, spending someone else\u2019s money. It\u2019s actually a very, very nice feeling to earn your own money.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? My uncle is pretty well off, and he\u2019s been helping pay for my mother\u2019s medical expenses, and I think he\u2019d probably be willing to just pay for everything, if we let him, but I just couldn\u2019t be okay with him doing that. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate what he\u2019s done, but I\u2019ve never wanted to take money that I didn\u2019t earn. Something my dad taught me, actually. He had a really great work ethic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with the rich relatives always trying to foot the bill?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t smile when I say this, even though I was trying to make a joke. Not so funny, I guess. But I watch her for a second and her lips turn up at the corners in a tiny smile.</p><p>\u201cFuck the rich relatives,\u201d she says.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself.\u201d</p><p>Though Jill isn\u2019t letting me take her out on the actual date of her birthday, I think I can probably get her to agree to go out the next night. I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s caused her sudden change in feelings toward me, but it\u2019s nice, and I\u2019m not going to question it. And I find myself thinking about the fun things we might be able to do, and no, I\u2019m not just talking about getting her into bed. Which is odd, I\u2019d be the first to admit it. Any girl I\u2019ve ever taken interest in before has mainly been because of her carnal potential. Maybe it\u2019s because Jill spurned me at first, or maybe there really is something different about her, I don\u2019t know, but I sure would like to find out.</p><p>Then there is the small problem of Allison. In the past I could\u2019ve just bounced\u2014gone somewhere else, disappeared, as there are few things worth sticking around for if you\u2019ve got a lovesick girl hounding your ass\u2014but now, it seems, I have found something that is worth it. A few things, and one of those being Jill.</p><p>Cam calls me again one night when I\u2019m lying in bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling to check up on me?\u201d I ask. \u201cChrist, what time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything strange? I\u2019m worried that you might still be in danger.\u201d</p><p>Now this is interesting. If there\u2019s one thing my brother doesn\u2019t do, it\u2019s worry, and certainly not about me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything is fine,\u201d I say. \u201cI fit right in here.

Would you be available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, for like a lunch date or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Griffin, I\u2019ll take you out to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a job now, so maybe I should take you out to lunch.\u201d</p><p>Still, he doesn\u2019t laugh.

She works here, too. She actually helped me the night I washed up on the beach. Romantic, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds absolutely Hallmark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking back on it, it kind of was. Or maybe more Lifetime movie or something. But she\u2019s great. You could meet her if you came out here. And the funny thing is, she didn\u2019t like me at first\u2014like, at all\u2014but then, I don\u2019t know. Something changed. Something happened. And . . . I know how corny this sounds, but she\u2019s really like no girl I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m about to vomit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know how it sounds! It\u2019s hard to explain. I mean, I\u2019ve met a lot of girls, and they\u2019re all great and everything, but . . . there\u2019s just something about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, Griffin, I\u2019m ecstatic that you\u2019ve discovered true love, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m calling. And watch yourself with women, especially the ones that you think you might actually have genuine feelings for. Mostly, that just leads to trouble and more trouble. Anyway, I\u2019m going to try to get a little sleep, so I\u2019ll let you know about my travel plans, okay? It\u2019ll just be easier to discuss this in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure my calendar\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>We hang up, and the sleep I was so close to falling into before he called is suddenly miles away. It\u2019s funny, I think. Cam thinks that I know something, but it\u2019s pretty obvious he\u2019s the one that\u2019s got all the info. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t realize it yet.</p><p>Chapter 18: Jill</p><p>Birthdays had always been Dad\u2019s thing. He loved any reason to celebrate, but especially birthdays.</p><p>\u201cYour birthday in particular,\u201d he\u2019d always say to me.</p><p>But Dad was good at making everyone feel special, and though he never saw the need to spend much money on a party, lots of people were always invited, he\u2019d dedicate the whole day to making all sorts of good food, and the festivities would go well into the night, with everyone reluctant to leave because they were having such a good time.</p><p>I\u2019ve been so caught up in other things that it doesn\u2019t occur to me that this is my first birthday without Dad until I wake up in the morning and realize I\u2019m not going to hear him say happy birthday and give me a hug.</p> <p>We have an afternoon cookout, and some of the campers have made a cake for me, which is cute. Karen gives me a haphazardly wrapped gift of bubble bath, and Simon gives me a bouquet of flowers he picked himself. I catch Griffin\u2019s eye across the picnic table and he winks.</p><p>I drive up to Mom\u2019s some time in the later afternoon. \u201cHere\u2019s the birthday girl!\u201d Sharon says when I come through the door. She gives me a hug, and as she does so, she whispers in my ear, \u201cYour mom\u2019s having a bit of a rough day today. She was up waiting for you, but she decided she wanted to go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll just go in there and see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and a young man stopped by earlier, also.\u201d Sharon turns and goes to the counter. There\u2019s another orchid, this one a lurid magenta, like someone had colored it in with a marker. \u201cHe was very sweet, and he was asking when you\u2019d be by. Sean, I think he said his name was?\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth but try not to let my annoyance show. \u201cHow long was he here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe visited with your mom for a little bit. It actually seemed to brighten her spirits quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I sigh and look back at the plant. \u201cWant an orchid?\u201d</p><p>Sharon looks at me uncertainly. \u201cOh . . . should I have not let him in? Your mother was so happy to see him, I just . . . I didn\u2019t even . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p><p>I say goodbye to Sharon and go sit in the wingback chair. \u201cI see Sean was here,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHe remembered your birthday.\u201d Mom has dark circles under her eyes, her skin seems thin, papery. Any happiness she was feeling earlier has clearly vanished without a trace. \u201cUncle Nate sent a card. It\u2019s over there on the coffee table.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt was nice to see Sean. I told him he was welcome to stop by after we got back from dinner. Except I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to go out, sweetie. I just don\u2019t think I have it in me. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom.\u201d Though actually it isn\u2019t; the fact that she told Sean to stop by later makes my skin crawl, but I don\u2019t say anything. \u201cWe can stay in. I\u2019ll make you something. Do you feel like eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. And you shouldn\u2019t have to make yourself something on your own birthday. Why don\u2019t we order takeout. Maybe from that Thai place you like. Or whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>So we order Thai food and watch a movie. And while I sit there with a plate of spring rolls and pad thai balanced on my lap, I try not to think about what sorts of things we might be doing if Dad were still alive, I try not to think about how much better everything would be, in every possible way, if he hadn\u2019t died.</p><p>Mom has a few bites of spring roll and watches maybe half an hour of the movie before she falls asleep. I finish eating, then I go over to the coffee table and open the card from Uncle Nate. It\u2019s a generic Hallmark card, which he\u2019s signed his name to. A folded piece of paper flutters to the ground\u2014more money\u2014and I don\u2019t bend down to retrieve it.</p><p>I do the dishes and fold up the take-out containers. Sharon is sitting at the kitchen table, working on a crossword puzzle.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d I ask. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of food leftover. I\u2019m sorry; I should have asked you when we ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I already ate,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was trying to make myself scarce, at least for the time being. It\u2019s so good for her when you\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s still early, so I go and sit back in the chair and finish watching the movie. Sharon comes in and wakes Mom up and has her take about half a dozen pills. After she\u2019s done washing them down with water, she looks at me, as though she\u2019s surprised to see me still sitting there.</p><p>\u201cIs it still your birthday?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cStill my birthday.\u201d</p><p>A sad look crosses her face, and I realize she\u2019s just as eager for this day to be over with as I am. The movie credits are scrolling up the screen and I watch them for a minute, before I realize she\u2019s crying.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say. I reach over and take her hand, which feels limp and fragile, like toothpicks in a silk sack. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mom. It\u2019s okay. I know today is hard. It\u2019s hard for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to hear you say that. I hate that this is how we have to feel now. I don\u2019t want to feel this way, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter what I do. The only time I feel better is when I get my medication, and that\u2019s because I don\u2019t really feel anything at all.\u201d Her fingers twitch, and then her grip tightens, momentarily, on my hand. \u201cPlease see Sean when he comes by later.\u201d</p><p>I resist the urge to pull my arm back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least just talk to him for a few minutes. Could you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what difference it makes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know that things are going to be okay for you,\u201d Mom says. She blinks and wipes at her eyes. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be around for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and rests her head against the pillow. \u201cI never used to understand the people who thought life was such a hassle to live. People that never seemed happy, no matter what happened to them. But I get that, now. I\u2019m in pain every day. Even the simplest task is either impossible or near-impossible to do on my own. Do you know how hard that is? I just want to be realistic about things.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and take a deep breath. \u201cMom. I\u2019m not saying I think what you\u2019re going through is easy. I know it\u2019s not. But . . . but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to enjoy things, too. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to have good times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in pain all the time. I\u2019m on eight different medications that make me feel like I\u2019m underwater or wrapped up in gauze. Like there\u2019s this constant fog in my brain. Is that any way to live?\u201d She wipes at her eyes again and then forces a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jilly. I didn\u2019t mean to get into all that. Some days are harder than others.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the ache in my throat. \u201cI wish I could make it better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Just knowing that you\u2019re out there, working toward what you want. It makes me happy to think of you out there, going to school, working with the campers, hanging out with your friends. Your father\u2019s gone. I\u2019m practically gone. Sean cares about you. He remembered your birthday! I don\u2019t want to think about you being out there all alone. Not that I don\u2019t think you can\u2019t be happy on your own, of course, but everyone should have someone. Someone to come home to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time for me to meet someone,\u201d I say. \u201cSean and I . . . we gave it a good go. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right guy for me. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s more important that I wait and find the right guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But sometimes I wonder if you\u2019ve set your standards too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is, Jilly. You know that. You can be hard on people sometimes. And am I saying that I just want you to be with any old person? No, of course not. But I remember how happy you and Sean used to be together. It reminded me of the way things were between your father and I.\u201d</p><p>I do my best not to groan. \u201cMom, my relationship with Sean was nothing like what you and Dad had. I\u2019m kind of too busy for that now, anyway. Once camp is over I\u2019ve got to get back to school and actually graduate. And eventually, maybe, I\u2019ll meet someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. And you\u2019re right\u2014there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019ve just been missing Dad. It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been almost a year since we last saw him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking about that last weekend we spent together. It\u2019s really like my last clear memory I have from before the accident. When he took me on the helicopter ride in Napa?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019d always wanted to do one of those helicopter tours, and I never thought it would happen because your father was so afraid of heights.\u201d</p><p>I laugh too, thinking about the way Dad used to psych himself up before ascending the ladder to clean the gutters out every fall, before he finally hired our next-door neighbor\u2019s son to do it.</p><p>\u201cBut your father knew how much I wanted to go, and even though he kept his eyes squeezed shut half the time, by the end, I think he had a pretty good time. I know I did.\u201d Her smile fades a little. \u201cIt really was beautiful. I\u2019d love to relive that day, over and over again.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cI wish you could, Mom.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s just as handsome as I remember him, slightly more filled out. He\u2019s tanned, and he looks genuinely happy to see me, so when he asks if I will just give him five minutes and hear him out, I agree.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at you.\u201d He glances over his shoulder toward the kitchen, where Sharon is still sitting at the table. \u201cCould we talk somewhere a little more . . . private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d</p><p>He pauses as though actually giving consideration to the question. \u201cNo, but I would appreciate it if we could talk privately for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>If he had said yes, it was necessary, I probably would\u2019ve walked out the door right then, but I relent and we walk upstairs.</p><p>We stand there for a moment, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you have to tell me that you couldn\u2019t say down there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s wearing a Ralph Lauren polo with wide stripes and khaki shorts. It\u2019s odd to stand here and look at him and know exactly what his body looks like under those clothes, and to know that he knows exactly what my body looks like under my clothes.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you out to dinner.\u201d He smiles, and the smile lines around his mouth are deeper than I remember.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Sean. I\u2019m heading back soon. I can\u2019t be out too late. I appreciate you stopping by, though, and the flower, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know orchids are your favorite.\u201d</p><p>Actually, they\u2019re not, but I don\u2019t saying anything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than nice to see you. Come on, let me take you out. It\u2019s your birthday. It\u2019s still early. There\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I appreciate the offer, I really do. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019m not at the point in my life right now where I want to be involved with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill,\u201d he says. \u201cI have thought about you every day since we\u2019ve been apart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been broken up almost a year. There is no way I believe you\u2019ve thought about me every day for almost a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have. I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t believe something like that. I\u2019ve missed you. And I know you\u2019ve missed me, too.\u201d He brushes my hair back from my face. He leans closer. \u201cI want you, Jill. I want us to get back together. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. I understand why you thought you needed to break up with me; you\u2019ve been through a lot. It\u2019s been a hard year for you. But us not being together has only shown me that we are supposed to be together.\u201d His mouth is right there next to my ear. His fingertips trace the curve of my jawbone.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He kisses my throat, and his hand moves down the other side of my neck, over my collarbone, under my shirt, onto my breast. I pull back.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2014stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill.\u201d He exhales roughly and pulls me back to him. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday. Let me make you feel good on your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not why I agreed to come talk to you in my bedroom. I thought you had something important you wanted to tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. My body has an important message to communicate with yours. No words required, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Sean, stop. I have to get back to the ranch. I\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I can tell. I can always tell when you\u2019re stressed out. So just think how good you\u2019ll feel if you let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Sean, no. Get off of me.\u201d</p><p>I push him off and start to stand, but he yanks on my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Jill. You. Do you know I could walk out there and have literally any girl of my choosing? But I want you.\u201d</p> <p>I jerk my arm from his grasp. \u201cThe only reason you want me is because I broke up with you, and you can\u2019t stand not being in absolute control of everything all the time. And if you\u2019re so certain you can go have whichever girl you want\u2014go! Go out there and do that. Just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>A grin spreads across his face. \u201cGod, do you know how sexy you are when you get heated?\u201d He grabs my arm again and tries to pull me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>It happens so fast I\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s going on, except suddenly I\u2019m on the bed and he is on top of me, clawing at my shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want this.\u201d His voice is a growl in my ear, his weight crushing, pressing me down into the mattress.</p><p>I stop struggling. So this is how I\u2019m going to spend the first birthday without Dad. This is how it\u2019s going to go down. Sean\u2019s hands roam the length of my body and he kisses my forehead, bites my earlobe, starts to give me a hickey on my neck. He shifts to one side, moving off of my right leg. I judge the distance and try to position myself accordingly, then I jerk my leg up, my knee smashing into his balls. He screams, maybe it\u2019s fuck or cunt, I can\u2019t really tell, and I push him off. I stand for a moment and watch him writhing on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sean,\u201d I say, straightening my shirt. \u201cGetting to knee you in the balls was actually the best birthday present I could have asked for. I\u2019m going downstairs. You have two minutes to get the fuck out of this house\u2014and don\u2019t even think of going in there and talking to my mom\u2014before I call the cops and have them throw your ass in jail. Thank you for making this birthday all the more memorable.\u201d</p><p>I speed down the 1, and consider, briefly, how easy it would be just to yank the wheel to the right and go sailing off the cliff, into oblivion. Not that I would ever do that, but it\u2019s astonishing how easy it would be. And I also realize how easy it would be to make it look like an accident even if it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>It\u2019s still light out when I get back to the ranch, and I can\u2019t bear the thought of going in and being in my tiny little cabin. It\u2019s movie night, so the campers are all in the main lodge, so I take my shoes off and walk down to the beach, sit in the sand, and start to cry.</p><p>Sometimes it really does feel good to cry, especially when you\u2019re alone and the sound of the waves crashing pretty much drowns out any other sound. I lift my head up from my knees and that\u2019s when I see through blurred vision that I am not, in fact, the only person on the beach.</p><p>I stand and turn away, but it\u2019s too late, he\u2019s walking toward me, hurrying toward me, in fact, so quickly that I can\u2019t even wipe the tears and snot from my face before he\u2019s there.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Except I\u2019m not, because I can\u2019t stop crying and my voice is shaky and my breath catches in my throat and I feel like I\u2019m about to hyperventilate. And I\u2019m so mortified that Griffin is here witnessing this that when he puts his arms around me and pulls me into him, I don\u2019t resist. No, I just stand there and sob and I feel one of his hands go to the back of my head and he strokes my hair and says, Shhh in my ear, which sounds just like the ocean. I don\u2019t know how long we stand like that, but it\u2019s long enough for my tears to have totally soaked the front of his shirt. Finally, I can draw in a raggedy breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, lifting my head. I twist away and he lets go.</p><p>\u201cTurning twenty-three really isn\u2019t all that bad,\u201d he says.</p><p>I smile, despite myself. My hair is sticking to my face and I brush it back, trying not to envision how grotesque I probably look. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m upset about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not. But still, you\u2019re not supposed to be sad on your birthday. Come on; let\u2019s take a little walk.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hand out and gives me a half smile. It would be easy enough to just turn away, to say I was tired or wanted to be alone, but I reach out and take his hand and let him lead me down toward the beach.</p><p>We walk a little ways without saying anything. His fingers are intertwined in mine and he moves his thumb in a circular motion over my wrist bone. He\u2019s humming a song, something that sounds familiar but I can\u2019t quite place. I tilt my head a little closer to try to hear it better.</p><p>\u201cYou ever come down here before?\u201d he asks as we approach the jetty that marks the end of Fulton Beach. He hops up onto one of the rocks and then holds his hand out to help me up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here a few times,\u201d I say, hoisting myself up. The jetty stretches thirty or forty feet into the water and gets almost completely engulfed at high tide. It is that time of year when the sun will set exactly in line with the rocks, so for that moment before it dips below the horizon, if you stand at the beginning of the jetty it looks like the sun and the rocks are connected.</p><p>But he walks out, toward the end, where the waves crash against the lower part of the rocks, surf spraying in the air. He sits on the largest rock and pats the spot next to him. Straight ahead, the sky is a brilliant palette of orange, red, and pink. I take a deep breath and watch as the sun continues its plunge toward the horizon.</p><p>\u201cEveryone should get to see the sun rise or set on their birthday,\u201d he says. He looks at me and smiles. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>In the short time since we\u2019ve been sitting, it\u2019s already gotten darker, though the sun hasn\u2019t completely disappeared yet. The light is gorgeous, soft, and bending, the kind that could make anyone look beautiful. Griffin doesn\u2019t need any help in that area, but still, the effect is stunning. The light throws shadows across his face, accentuating the square cut of his jaw, the elegant, gentle slope of his nose.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter, sweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cIt kills me to see you looking like this.\u201d</p><p>I shoot him a look. \u201cGod, you are so full of shit.\u201d But I smile as I say this, and already I\u2019m starting to feel a little better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be less full of shit, though. I really am. And regardless of how full of shit I happen to be, I am an excellent listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have. Try me. And if I suck, then you can punch me in the face and never have to speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d let me mess with your pretty face?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cAh ha! I knew you thought I was hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said pretty. And there\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty. Seriously, though. Level with me.\u201d</p><p>I look out at the waves rolling up the beach, the white crests tinged pink with the setting sun. \u201cHer life has completely changed. And I can tell that she tries really hard to put on this strong front and pretend that she\u2019s not in pain all the time or that it doesn\u2019t bother her she can\u2019t remember anything, but the fact is, she\u2019s got to have round-the-clock care. And she will for the rest of her life. I just hate seeing her like that, and I hate that there\u2019s nothing I can do to change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Jill. That fucking sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does. So that\u2019s what I was kind of losing my shit over. I just don\u2019t know what to do. Because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that I can do. It was just so sad, right before I left we were sitting there talking and she started telling me how she kept thinking about the last time she and my dad went out somewhere together, how he\u2019d taken her on this helicopter ride\u2014which is actually pretty funny because he\u2019s so afraid of heights\u2014and how she wished she could do that again. And the one-year anniversary is coming up in a few weeks. And I know that\u2019s got to be hard for her. She and my dad were really one of those couples that were still in love, that still really liked to go out and do things and be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cMy parents are like roommates that fight all the time. Or that\u2019s how it used to be, anyway. Now they just stay as far away from each other as possible, which usually means my mom stays at the penthouse in New York and my dad travels around doing whatever the fuck he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveling around doing whatever the fuck you want . . . kind of sounds like what you were doing before you were . . . kidnapped.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cHey. I really was kidnapped. I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause any normal person who is kidnapped would call the police. Or would do . . . something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, something! I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2014I\u2019ve never been kidnapped before. Why would someone kidnap you, anyway? To get to your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was their plan, I think. But it just shows how they know absolutely nothing about my father. Probably to him, they were doing him a favor. Poor bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you think they wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney. He\u2019s got plenty of it. And a confession, too, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of confession?\u201d I try to keep my voice light.</p><p>Griffin shrugs. \u201cWho knows. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of shit my dad could cop to, but never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He waves his hand like he\u2019s shooing a fly away and looks out at the water. \u201cI\u2019m sure my dad\u2019s pissed off plenty of people in his lifetime. Just like I\u2019m sure my dad\u2019s been pissed off at many people\u2014myself included. He can be kind of ruthless when it comes to that sort of stuff. One track mind, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I try to sound nonchalant. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about the money. You know, the whole money equals power equals you must have a giant dick equals you are therefore superior to everyone else and can go around doing whatever the fuck you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut . . . isn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Like I told you though, sweetheart, this whole experience has kind of given me a second chance at things. Listen, I\u2019m going to tell you something and I don\u2019t want you to laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>I look out at the horizon. There is a tiny slice of sun left.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would ever give you the idea I\u2019d do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I kind of came to this realization the other night. I\u2019m glad the whole kidnapping thing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlleged.\u201d</p><p>He nudges me with his elbow. \u201cAlleged, yeah, yeah. Okay. If this alleged kidnapping didn\u2019t happen, I\u2019d still be in Thailand\u2014or no, I probably would\u2019ve gone back to Europe and been over in Ibiza or some shit\u2014still partying my ass off, getting laid, that sort of thing. Staying up all night and being strung out the next day. Getting to see the sunrise only because I hadn\u2019t gone to sleep the night before. But instead, I get to be here. Where I\u2019m actually doing something. These kids? They\u2019re pretty cool. They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re into this shit. You know, and it\u2019s cool to be outside, to just kind of be in nature, and not be on anything and thinking that the trees are having a conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>The last sliver of sun disappears. \u201cYou talk to trees?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might\u2019ve mixed some K with some molly and some really dank bud and thought I was conversing with a tree before, yes.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the life you live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the thing\u2014I don\u2019t want to live like that. I mean, I\u2019m not saying I want to go live the life of a monk or something, but I really like being here. I like what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want my job next summer? There will be a position available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you gonna be?\u201d</p><p>I hug my legs and let my chin rest on my knees. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Somewhere else. I\u2019m going to graduate next year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. What are you studying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSociology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But at the same time, I\u2019ll be glad to graduate and move on. I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enrolled in a few semesters of college. I was in the middle of pledging the fraternity but then I dropped out and actually went to Greece instead, which, honestly, was way better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to know something? I\u2019ve never even been out of California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, California is a big state . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s pathetic. So it\u2019s hard for me to imagine what it\u2019s like to be so well-traveled. Never mind Greece or Thailand, I\u2019d just love to visit the other side of this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe East Coast?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re not missing much. But I\u2019ll probably be heading back there at some point, to see my mom. She gets a little frantic if I don\u2019t come spend a weekend with her at the house in the Hamptons every August. Maybe you should come with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that . . .\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe.\u201d I wonder that if I went back to New York with him, if there\u2019d be the chance to find something out. Something that might make a difference. What are the chances? \u201cMaybe a little trip wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not a bad guy, you know.\u201d</p><p>I think of Sean, the feel of his crushing weight, his certainty that he\u2019s always right, no matter what. \u201cI know,\u201d I tell Griffin.</p><p>I let him walk me back to my cabin, long after the sun has set. He doesn\u2019t try to kiss me, but instead gives me a hug and whispers, \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d He smiles and touches his index finger to the tip of my nose, then heads toward his own cabin.</p><p>Only after he\u2019s disappeared from view do I realize that I really wouldn\u2019t have minded if he had tried to kiss me.</p><p>Chapter 19: Griffin</p><p>It\u2019s true; I almost kissed Jill on her birthday. But I didn\u2019t, for some reason, which is strange, because it means I was exercising restraint, which is not generally a quality I would associate with myself. Some of the campers and I are helping Bill hack up one of the live oak trees that isn\u2019t so alive anymore, and I try to pinpoint exactly why I didn\u2019t kiss her. I certainly wanted to. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be overreaching on my part to say that she probably would\u2019ve been open to it, since she\u2019s had that change of heart.</p><p>But then she started asking about my dad, which for me is about the biggest boner killer in existence. And I\u2019d been feeling pretty good about having this second chance at my life, at maybe doing something right, but when the topic of dear old Dad came up, it got me wondering whether or not this \u201cnew life\u201d I was going to try to forge for myself was actual just a pathetic delusion of grandeur. A favorite phrase of Dad\u2019s, actually. I mean, maybe I was no different than he was. Hadn\u2019t I spent the last seven or eight years traveling around, basically doing whatever the fuck I wanted? I don\u2019t care about money as much as Dad, but maybe that\u2019s just because it\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s never been something I\u2019ve had to be concerned about or worry about where it was going to come from.</p><p>I turn the saw off and walk over to Bill, who\u2019s showing some of the campers how to properly buck a log. It\u2019s so easy to see he\u2019s completely in his element; in fact, Bill is one of those guys who seems like he\u2019s always in his element, regardless of where he is. Unlike, say, my dad, who can only feel that way if he\u2019s surrounded by all the luxury he\u2019s become accustomed to, and about half a dozen ass-kissers, to assure him he really is top dog.</p><p>But it\u2019s Bill I want to be like, I realize, as I stand there. Bill, in his worn-out jeans, faded Sea Horse Ranch shirt, and black Stetson. He just seems so content in his element. He sees me looking at him and gives me a smile, then lets the kids go at the log themselves. He walks over.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d he says. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good with that thing.\u201d He nods at the saw.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ve had some practice.\u201d I glance over at the campers, wrangling with the log. \u201cHey, Bill, could I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you always know you wanted to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ranch? I suppose I did. My great-grandfather built the place, and I just never had the desire to leave. You know how some people get bit by the traveling bug and just can\u2019t seem to stay in one place for long?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cSounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but I just always felt like this place where I grew up was the place that I was meant to be. Some people think that sort of thing sounds awfully boring, or like I missed out on a lot in life, but really, I wouldn\u2019t have done it any other way.\u201d His gaze too, goes over to the campers. \u201cI mean, look at them. They\u2019re all having a great time out here\u2014they always do. I get to share this piece of my life with them for a few weeks every summer, and I couldn\u2019t ask for more than that. I guess if I\u2019d been born in a city, or had parents who didn\u2019t care much for the outdoors, it might\u2019ve taken me longer to find this, but one way or another, I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really appreciate you letting me stay on here, Bill. I\u2019m having a blast. I kind of feel like this is what I\u2019ve been looking for all this time, even though I didn\u2019t know I was looking for something to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of the time that\u2019s how it goes: What you\u2019re looking for finds you before you even knew you needed it. Or wanted it. I\u2019ll tell you though, Griffin, you\u2019ve got a good way about you. With the kids, especially. And there are a lot of great opportunities out there for someone like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. I could put you in touch with a few people, if you\u2019re interested. My pal John runs a teen rehab center up in Marin, and he\u2019s always asking me to send qualified people his way. I\u2019ll give you his number later. You should give him a call.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d Maybe once all this over, I\u2019ll just stay in California. The idea doesn\u2019t sound half bad. \u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s one other thing I wanted to ask you,\u201d I tell him. He looks at me. \u201cHow are things looking for Sunday? I was thinking I might take Jill out after she\u2019s done visiting her mom. You know, since it was just her birthday and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Bill says, without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it covered. Jill deserves to go out for a good time, anyway. She works hard. You two go have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI think we will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20: Jill</p><p>On Saturday night, Griffin finds me as I\u2019m coming back from the barn. He lopes over and slings an arm across my shoulders. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you have planned for tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust going to visit my mom. Head back here. Why, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about me accompanying you up to the city? I can give you and your mom some time to visit, if you want and then I thought I could take you out.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him. \u201cYou\u2019re really not going to let this go\u2014taking me out for my birthday, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can pretend it\u2019s for something else.\u201d</p><p>I think about this for a minute. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cWe can do that. I\u2019ll probably be leaving here around two, two-thirty. And you can come meet my mom, if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be thrilled to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cAh, so you\u2019ve told her about me? Only good things, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be glad to meet you. She keeps wanting me to get back together with my ex, which is never going to happen, and I think she envisions my life being completely devoid of companionship or something.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me a little closer and turns his head so his mouth is right by my ear. \u201cI will gladly be your companion.\u201d</p><p>We get to my cabin and stand there for a moment, his arm still around me. For a fleeting second, I actually consider asking him in. But instead I just slip out from under his arm.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll meet you here tomorrow afternoon,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He winks. \u201cSounds good, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>As expected, Mom is very pleased to meet Griffin, so much so that I wonder if I should have brought him over before. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve seen her look so happy.</p><p>It\u2019s a mild day, so we sit outside on the deck, and Mom asks Griffin questions about all the different places he\u2019s been, and he does have some good stories. He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans, a pair of aviator sunglasses, and he does look deliciously handsome. At one point, I slip away and go upstairs to my room. I\u2019m generally a jeans and t-shirt type girl myself, but I do have a few seldom worn, dressier outfits, and I dig one out of the back of my closet. It\u2019s a simple cotton dress, navy blue and tan stripes, giving it sort of a nautical look. I put it on and look at myself in the full-length mirror. I\u2019m not used to seeing myself in a dress, but it doesn\u2019t look bad.</p><p>Griffin whistles when I step back outside. \u201cLook at you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Mom smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you dressed up!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is one of my favorite dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I figured since we\u2019re going out after this it might be good if I wore something that didn\u2019t smell like a horse barn.\u201d</p><p>When we\u2019re getting ready to leave, I see a different orchid sitting on the kitchen table. It\u2019s as lurid as the others ones, and for a moment, I hate Sean for making me dislike orchids so much.</p><p>\u201cWhen did that come?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cA few days ago,\u201d Mom says. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to get flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. This must be the I\u2019m sorry I tried to rape you orchid. I honestly can\u2019t believe he had the gall to send it after that, but then again, perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising.</p><p>\u201cMy ex likes to send orchids,\u201d I tell Griffin.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cHow lovely. Did you know that \u2018orchid\u2019 comes from the Greek word for \u2018testicle\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I think about the last\u2014and hopefully final\u2014time I saw Sean, and I can\u2019t help but laugh either. \u201cThen that is actually very fitting,\u201d I say.</p><p>Griffin takes me out to dinner and then we walk around the Castro. It\u2019s a warm night and the sidewalks are crowded, people are spilling out from the bars. We go by a caf\u00e9 with big windows, music blaring. Griffin stops and looks in. \u201cHey, let\u2019s check this out,\u201d he says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a drag show going on inside, the place is packed. We squeeze in through the crowd, and because I\u2019m walking behind Griffin, I see the way every man in the place stops and gives him the eye, some with their mouths hanging open.</p><p>A makeshift stage has been set up in the corner, and the MC is a six-foot-tall, burly man, wearing a pink wig and a lace corset. The music thrums and we have to shout to hear each other over it.</p><p>The drag queens are actually having a contest, to see who will be on the cover of next year\u2019s annual drag calendar. They come out in all sorts of get-ups: sequins, lace, leather, with spike heels and feather boas. Griffin laughs and claps; at one point he whistles loudly with his fingers, and that gets the MC\u2019s attention.</p> <p>\u201cMerciful lord in heaven!\u201d she gasps. \u201cI do believe I am looking at the finest specimen of male I have ever seen! Are you a mirage? Maria, shine the light over there; I must find out if my eyes are deceiving me!\u201d</p><p>Then all of the sudden, there\u2019s a blinding light on us, and the whole place erupts, and there are wolf whistles and cat calls and someone starts shouting: GET ON STAGE!</p><p>And then it seems like the whole place is chanting it, and Griffin is standing next to me just losing his shit laughing. He leans toward me. \u201cShould I do it?\u201d he shouts in my ear.</p><p>The spotlight is still on us. I have a feeling if I tell him no, the men in this place would rip me to pieces.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shout back.</p> <p>The chant dissolves into jubilant cheers as Griffin makes his way from where we were standing to the stage.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d the MC says when Griffin finally gets up there. The MC makes a big show of blinking, rubbing his eyes, blinking again. \u201cYou really AREN\u2019T a mirage. Because honey, let me tell you, I\u2019ve seen\u2014and been with\u2014a few good-looking men in my day, but you . . . you take the cake, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>The crowd roars. Someone near me starts shouting, \u201cSTRIP!\u201d and pretty soon, the whole place is screaming.</p><p>\u201cI bet you can dance, too,\u201d the MC says. She sticks the microphone in Griffin\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to bust a move or two,\u201d he says in between laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly can\u2019t tease us like that!\u201d the MC says. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m speaking on EVERYONE\u2019S behalf when I say we\u2019d like to see one or two of these moves.\u201d</p> <p>The DJ is spinning some upbeat club stuff, and Griffin doesn\u2019t hesitate. He starts dancing, and he is actually quite good. Without missing a beat, he pulls his shirt off and flings it out into the crowd. Perhaps it\u2019s the lighting, or the way he\u2019s moving his body, but he looks so incredibly hot, it\u2019s almost breathtaking. And clearly I am not the only one who thinks so. When the song ends, the noise from the crowd is deafening. Griffin gives the MC a hug and then jumps down off the stage.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d he asks when he gets back over to me.</p><p>I\u2019m still laughing. I\u2019m laughing so hard, in fact, that tears are rolling down my cheeks, and I can\u2019t remember the last time that I had so much fun. Without even thinking, I put my arms around him and give him a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou were awesome!\u201d I shout into his ear.</p><p>I let go of him, and the guy standing next to me nudges me with his elbow. \u201cYou lucky bitch,\u201d he says.</p><p>When we get back to the ranch, Griffin wants to take a walk on the beach. It\u2019s late, but we\u2019re both still too pumped up from the evening to go to bed, so I agree. He takes my hand as we make our way down the trail, and we walk down onto the sand, the waves crashing in front of us.</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of fun tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks for letting me take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a riot. That thing at the caf\u00e9? I seriously can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed that hard. And those guys loved you.\u201d</p> <p>We stop, and he lets go of my hand. He turns so he\u2019s facing me; we\u2019re close enough to embrace but for a moment we both just stand there. He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I look down at the sand, then back at him, trying to ignore the tingling feeling that\u2019s swirling in my chest. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s been with as many girls as you have, I\u2019d think you\u2019d have a better line than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a line,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>He brings his hands up to either side of my face and waits until I meet his eyes before he speaks again. \u201cAnd yes, maybe I have been with a lot of girls, but that only means I happen to know what I\u2019m talking about. And you, sweetheart, are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He brings his hands down to my shoulders and lets his head drop toward mine, slowly, his eyes falling halfway shut. But he doesn\u2019t kiss me; he stops, his mouth maybe an inch from mine, lips parted slightly.</p><p>We stand like that. He\u2019s not going to kiss me. He\u2019s going to let me kiss him, if I want to. If I choose not to, maybe he\u2019ll give my shoulders a squeeze and then back away, tell me to keep my chin up or something.</p><p>I tilt my head back a little, closing the distance. Less than an inch.</p><p>He stays still. His breath is warm on my face, something tingles in the air between us. I touch my lips to his and kiss him very softly. His eyes fall closed the rest of the way and he lets out a noise that\u2019s a cross between a sigh and a groan. He moves his head away and I feel his mouth near my ear.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cGive me more.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightens on my shoulders, his hands moving down my arms to my waist. He slips one hand under my shirt and his palm is warm, first on my hip, then moving across my abdomen. He brings his face to mine again and this time I pull him toward me, wrapping my arms around his neck, kissing him, mouths wide open, tongues entwined. We pull apart only so he can slip my dress over my head. The feeling of our bare skin touching is electric. He tilts my head back so I\u2019m looking up at the sky and he slowly kisses the length of my neck. His fingertips trace lightly over the contours of my ribcage, my shoulder blades, and then he\u2019s unfastening my bra and it falls away.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he says, gently squeezing my breasts.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the groan that escapes from my mouth when he takes my nipple into his mouth. He runs his hands down my back, he squeezes my ass and then slaps it gently.</p><p>He brings his hands back around and pushes at the waist of my skirt, lowering himself to his knees. He slips my underwear off, running his hands from the innermost point of my thigh down past my knee, down my calf, the way you would to a horse to get it to lift its leg. I step out of the bathing suit; one leg, then the other. He brings his hands back up to my thighs and pushes my legs apart, lowering his head, his tongue making slow circles over my clit. He slides one finger, then another, easily into my vagina and I feel my stomach muscles contract as my breath catches in my throat. My legs have been reduced to jelly and I\u2019m not exactly sure how it\u2019s physically possible that I\u2019m still upright.</p><p>He reaches a hand up to my breast and squeezes my nipple.</p><p>\u201cI need to lie down,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>He lifts his head but keeps his fingers inside me. \u201cWhatever you want, baby,\u201d he says.</p><p>The sand is cool on my backside. He repositions himself over me, his forearms on either side of my head. He leans down and we kiss; I run my hands over his shoulders, his biceps, the skin warm, stretched smooth over the thick muscles.</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs around me,\u201d he says.</p><p>I do, and I feel the head of his cock brush lightly against my labia. He shifts his hips and the head slides in, less than an inch. He holds it there, and I arch my back, trying to get him to go deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me,\u201d I say, pressing my face into his upper arm. He swivels his hips in slow figure 8s as he kisses my throat. Suddenly, he pushes himself all the way in so our pubic bones touch and my body jerks underneath; the sensation is so intense, I think that I\u2019m about to either black out or explode in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been able to orgasm through straight sex, but I can tell that I\u2019m close. There\u2019s a tingling warm sensation filling my pelvis, traveling down my legs all the way to my toes. It builds like a crescendo, with the ebb and flow of his movements, and if he stops now I\u2019ll lose it, it\u2019ll be gone, even if he starts again, so I dig my fingernails into his back and say, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d It comes out breathless and my voice catches in my throat and I wrap my legs around him tighter and right as the feeling is about to peak he shifts his hips upward slightly and he hits some new spot, some place that Sean and the handful of other guys I\u2019d ever been with never even came close to finding and I\u2019m arching my back, trying to keep him in me as deep as he can and my brain is buzzing, a million beautiful fireworks exploding in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he says when we\u2019re finished. He rolls off me and onto his side and props his head up on one hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>It still feels as though there\u2019s an electric current running through my body, everything is tingling, there is a residual buzz that seems to have settled over me like a fine mist.</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and he tilts his head forward so our foreheads are touching.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d I say. Usually I am not so direct, not so willing to just put something out there. But there is something different about him. He feels safe, yet also exciting, and it\u2019s like this wall that I didn\u2019t even know I had up is starting to crumble. \u201cI am really happy you washed up on the beach that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that you got to be the one to rescue me. I always wanted to be rescued by a beautiful lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the one that got to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God it was you and not Allison.\u201d</p><p>We both laugh, and then he leans down and kisses me. I don\u2019t think I have ever felt so good.</p><p>But the next morning when I wake up, I don\u2019t feel good. I feel nervous, or anxious, and I skip breakfast so I won\u2019t have to see Griffin. I hadn\u2019t been with anyone since Sean, and while the experience with Griffin was about a million times better than anything I ever had with Sean, I can\u2019t help but wonder how this is going to change things between us and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m entirely comfortable with the idea of that.</p><p>Or maybe it meant nothing.</p><p>That, if I\u2019m to be honest, is scarier than anything else, but of course I can\u2019t admit that outside the confines of my own head. It\u2019s been so long since I actually liked someone that I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s happening, or, if it is, it\u2019s not going to last.</p><p>So, I drink a glass of water and head down to the barn. I feed the horses, and in the distance, I can hear some of the campers talking and laughing as they make their way to the lodge. I\u2019m letting the horses out to pasture when Karen comes in and says good morning.</p><p>\u201cGriffin was looking for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI told him I figured you\u2019d be down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d I say. \u201cDid he say what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . if he comes down here, tell him you haven\u2019t seen me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a funny look. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really should give him a break, you know. He\u2019s not a bad guy. In fact, you want to know what I think?\u201d She leans in toward me. \u201cI think he likes you. Like, a lot more than Allison. Which kind of doesn\u2019t make any sense, because you\u2019ve been so mean to him. Is that the secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What secret? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if you want a guy to like you, you should be a giant . . . bitch to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d I wave my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to work, okay? And seriously, Karen, I\u2019m the last person on earth you should be asking for advice in that department.\u201d</p><p>We start mucking stalls. It\u2019s monotonous, but the repetition is calming and if I focus on what I\u2019m doing, there really isn\u2019t much room for other thoughts to intrude. I take my wheelbarrow out back to dump, and on the way into the barn, I can hear Griffin talking to Karen.</p><p>\u201cIs Jill here?\u201d he\u2019s saying. I stop and take a few steps backward, away from the barn door.</p><p>She stutters. \u201cUm, Jill? No, no, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I figured she\u2019d be down here. You need a hand, then? How many stall you have left to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there . . . is there a message you want me to relay to her?\u201d</p><p>Nice, Karen, I think, and try not to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll run into her eventually. Here, I\u2019ll help you finish up. Where\u2019s the other wheelbarrow?\u201d</p><p>Hearing that, I leave the wheelbarrow where it is and turn and run around the side of the barn, all the way back to my cabin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s no way to avoid him once lunch rolls around, though. I\u2019m in the kitchen with some of the campers, making egg salad sandwiches. By the time I realize that he\u2019s strolled in through the door, it\u2019s too late to run anywhere, and besides, I\u2019d have to somehow make it past him to get to the exit.</p><p>Luckily, though, the campers clamor around him, they want to know if he\u2019ll do archery with them later, a few of them want to go kayaking. Just the sight of him makes me simultaneously want to run away and go over and jump on him. At one point, he looks right at me, and I look away, quickly, but not before he gives me a wink, which, luckily, no one else picks up on. My heart feels like it\u2019s about to beat out of my chest. I spoon out more egg salad onto the slices of bread.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the sandwich-making coming along?\u201d he asks. He walks over, his arm brushing mine.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I reply.</p><p>He lowers his voice. \u201cI missed seeing you this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the beach trail later tonight.\u201d</p><p>His voice is so quiet I can barely hear what he says. I can see a few of the campers watching, straining to hear what we\u2019re saying.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say finally, my own voice barely a whisper. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give me a specific time, so I wait until it\u2019s dark, and even then, I consider not going. Before I leave, I stand in the bathroom and look in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThere is seriously something wrong with you,\u201d I tell my reflection. Wouldn\u2019t any other normal person be ecstatic that this was happening? A normal person wouldn\u2019t try to avoid the person she\u2019d just slept with if she actually liked him in return.</p><p>Finally, I make myself go outside and head toward the trail. He\u2019s there, as I approach, and I wonder how long he\u2019s been waiting. He comes over and touches my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just starting to think that you stood me up.\u201d He takes my hand. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>We basically take the same walk we took the other night, and I can feel myself getting tense. He must, too, because he stops and looks at me.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We walk down to the water and I kick my flip-flops off and let the waves roll over my feet.</p><p>\u201cI missed seeing you today,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a pretty great time last night.\u201d</p><p>I look out at the water but don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cOf course I did. I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t know what my problem is. It\u2019s been a long time since . . . since I\u2019ve been in a situation like this, I guess. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing, if you hadn\u2019t figured that out.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI think I\u2019d most definitely have to disagree with that last statement, sweetheart. But, I feel a little weird about things too. It happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas it ever happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yeah. This is different for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to get into all the down and dirty details, but . . . let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had my fair share of romantic liaisons. But never with someone I really, truly liked, if you can believe that. Never had a girlfriend before. Never in a long-term relationship or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with Sean, and it was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always assumed relationships would be awful, which was why I avoided them at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that Sean was the great love of my life or anything, but I\u2019d like to avoid any more heartache, if possible. It just seems easier not to be involved, you know?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything for a minute. The waves continue to wash over my feet, pulling the sand out from under them each time they roll back.</p><p>\u201c\u2018It is better for the heart to break, than not to break,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s from a Mary Oliver poem. And though I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before, I happen to agree wholeheartedly with that quote.\u201d</p><p>I look at him in surprise. \u201cYou read Mary Oliver? She was one of my dad\u2019s favorite poets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a few summers on Cape Cod. She\u2019s a great poet.\u201d</p><p>He steps in front of me and gives me a hug. His mouth is right next to my ear. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about this right now,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI just wanted you to know that you don\u2019t have to be afraid. I know it\u2019s probably a little scary, but it\u2019s different for me, too. And you don\u2019t have to be scared, okay?\u201d</p><p>He kisses my forehead and I let myself relax into his arms, and in that moment, he\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t feel like there is anything to be afraid of at all.</p><p>Chapter 21: Griffin</p><p>There is one week of camp left. I\u2019m not exactly sure when the idea occurs to me, maybe it was even a dream I had. Woke up with the idea. But it makes sense: Bring Jill home to New York. Not for good, of course, just for a visit, some fun times, and maybe Dad will see that not only have I decided I want to be a contributing member of society and no longer live off his dime, but I\u2019ve found a girl that I really want to be with. He\u2019d appreciate something like that, and Jill is just the kind of girl you\u2019d want to bring home to the family.</p><p>I let the idea percolate for a few days. We could go stay with Mom in the Hamptons, wander around the city, do all the sorts of things I imagine you\u2019d do if you were in a relationship. Though it\u2019s hard to say if Jill and I actually are in a relationship, though I\u2019d certainly like us to be, and surprisingly, I find that I am actually nervous to talk to her about it.</p><p>I stand in front of the bathroom mirror and look at my reflection, knowing that to everyone else in the world I might look exactly the same, but I am not. I take a deep breath, watch my shoulders rise up toward my ears, then exhale, down they go. I am not the same person. I leave the lodge bathroom and go over to the phone hanging on the wall by the kitchen entrance. I dial Dad\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I say when he picks up.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d he says. His tone is hard to read. \u201cAre you still out in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Having a good time, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy with golf and the country club and everything, but I\u2019m thinking of coming through town soon. I\u2019m going to bring my girlfriend with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend,\u201d he says flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes. Try to hide your surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised; I\u2019m just trying to figure out why you felt the need to call and inform me of these trivial details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking you might want to see me, and maybe meet her, and it\u2019d be nice if we could all get together for dinner. Or lunch. Or whatever.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, as though I just asked if he\u2019d be willing to donate a kidney to charity or something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really so sure I need to meet your flavor of the week, Griffin. This all seems a little unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a flavor of the week, Dad. It\u2019s actually kind of . . . kind of serious.\u201d I get a warm feeling in my chest as I say the words.</p><p>\u201cAnd what? You feel you need my blessing? That\u2019s never mattered to you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think it\u2019d be nice if we could try to, you know, salvage our relationship. We didn\u2019t used to hate each other, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Griffin, I don\u2019t hate you. But you\u2019ve made it very clear your priorities in life, and I\u2019ve allowed you to live as you want. I\u2019m not clear as to why you suddenly feel the need to call me and start talking about our relationship. I\u2019m your father; not your therapist. You\u2019re an adult. I think I\u2019ve shown my respect for you by allowing you the freedom to do as you please. Not everyone is so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say. \u201cCam is coming out here to see me, though. That\u2019s interesting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a minute. \u201cYour brother is also free to live his life as he chooses. And while he has, without a doubt, made far better choices than you, he is still allowed to do what he wants. And if he wants to fly out to California to see you, then so be it. Good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mainly for business,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know. And if I\u2019m to be frank with you, I honestly have no interest in meeting your girlfriend. Zero. I\u2019m a busy man, Griffin, and this just isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll be able to fit into my schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re coming to New York. We\u2019ll be by the house. Our paths might cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might,\u201d he says, sounding resigned. \u201cOr they might not. Either way is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are different. I\u2019ve been doing some things differently, Dad. I thought you might like to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said: If I see you, I do. At this point in your life, Griffin, I doubt any changes that you\u2019ve made are really going to be that surprising to me.\u201d</p><p>It would be easy enough to get mad, but instead I just smile and say goodbye. He\u2019ll just have to wait and see in person.</p><p>Chapter 22: Jill</p><p>On Sunday, Mom tells me that Uncle Nate is going to Lanai for a few weeks and has a layover in San Francisco. He wants to take us out to lunch.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to get away from the ranch for a little while that day? I know it\u2019s right in the middle of the week,\u201d Mom says. \u201cI think it\u2019d be good if you could make it. He says he has something he wants to tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I wonder what that could be,\u201d I say, though I\u2019m sure I already know. And I can\u2019t help but wonder if he starts talking his conspiracy theories again, if I might just say something, even though I still don\u2019t have anything concrete to go off of.</p><p>When I get back to the ranch, I talk to Lorrie and get the time off, even though it\u2019s a Thursday and it\u2019ll be right in the middle of the day.</p><p>\u201cWould Griffin like to go, too?\u201d Lorrie asks me with what may or may not be a coy smile.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to smile back, though in response I only say, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mom would like to meet him. Your uncle, too. We could spare the two of you for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Though I doubt the idea would\u2019ve occurred to me on my own, once Lorrie brought it up, it seemed perfect. It would be good for Mom, and I have a feeling that Uncle Nate will actually really like Griffin.</p><p>I find Griffin and a few campers sitting outside, cleaning the fishing gear. His back is to me as I approach, and he\u2019s telling them all a story about a fishing trip he went on in Alaska. I pause for a moment and watch the faces of the kids that I can see; even though he\u2019s been here for a few weeks now, the campers are every bit as enamored with him as they first were.</p><p>\u201cYou had to club the fish?\u201d one of them asks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Jill hear about it!\u201d another one replies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me hear what?\u201d I say.</p><p>Griffin turns and sees me, a big smile breaking out on his face. \u201cHey, there, sweetheart,\u201d he says.</p><p>I see a few of the campers shoot worried looks at each other, and then at Griffin, and I wonder if that\u2019s really how they see me, as someone who\u2019s going to come roaring in here and ruin their good time because they happen to be talking about clubbing fish.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you guys are having fun over here,\u201d I say, sitting down. I look at Griffin. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long, but I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get lunch on Thursday in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay as long as you\u2019d like,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yes, I would love to go with you to the city.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m aware of the looks the kids are giving us\u2014confused but curious. It would probably do them some good to see me being nice to Griffin; perhaps they wouldn\u2019t get that look on their faces next time I walked up.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle is going to be in town,\u201d I tell them. \u201cHe travels a lot but he likes to come by and visit when he can.\u201d</p><p>Griffin smiles. \u201cAh, the traveling uncle. Sounds like a good guy. Count me in.\u201d</p><p>I return his smile, and try to ignore the surprised looks on all the campers\u2019 faces.</p><p>But at breakfast on Thursday morning, it\u2019s clear that Griffin is in no shape to be doing much of anything, never mind take a trip up to the city. He\u2019s pale, his eyes bright, and when I brush my fingertips across his forehead, he\u2019s very hot.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re doing so well,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go lie down.\u201d</p><p>He shivers a little, even though he\u2019s wearing a sweatshirt with the hood pulled up and it\u2019s pretty warm in the lodge. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is wrong with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt a little off last night but figured I\u2019d just be able to sleep it off. I never get sick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo back to bed,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some aspirin and some tea.\u201d</p><p>He coughs into the sleeve of his sweatshirt. \u201cI think you might be onto something there.\u201d</p><p>I drink a cup of coffee and make him lemon tea with honey, which my dad always made for me when I was sick. I set that, plus a slice of dry toast and a few aspirin, onto a tray. I pass Allison as I\u2019m leaving.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen Griff?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe went back to bed.\u201d Her eyes go to the tray. \u201cI\u2019m bringing this to him, and then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I take it to him.\u201d She holds her hands out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes and takes a step toward me. \u201cWhat are you doing, Jill?\u201d she hisses. \u201cWhat game are you playing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s sick; I\u2019m bringing him some medicine and some tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you won\u2019t let me bring it to him. Why? Do you really think he\u2019d rather you brought it than me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She looks as though she\u2019s about to pitch a fit but then thinks better of it.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a competition,\u201d I say. \u201cSo there\u2019s really no need for you to get upset about anything. Why don\u2019t you go eat breakfast with Brett? He\u2019s got an empty spot next to him.\u201d And then I walk away, not caring if the conversation was done in her mind or not.</p><p>He\u2019s huddled on the bed, buried under several blankets. I put the tray on the table and go over with the aspirin and a glass of water. He sits up, his eyes bleary, hair messy.</p> <p>\u201cChrist, I feel like shit.\u201d He pops the aspirin into his mouth and washes them down with a sip of water. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might have to bail on lunch today. Probably wouldn\u2019t make such a good first impression.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. There\u2019s tea, too, and some toast, if you feel like eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart. I don\u2019t right now, but I might later.\u201d He lies back down. \u201cWould you . . . would you lie here with me? Just for a minute. I won\u2019t breathe on you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I consider refusing, but only for a second. I stretch out next to him and he wraps the blanket around us both. I can feel how hot his face is against my neck.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, his voice raspy and dreamy sounding. \u201cI turn into a big mushball when I get sick. Just want to snuggle. When I was a kid, though, and got sick, my mom wouldn\u2019t even come into the same room. She\u2019d practically start wearing one of those face masks, and make the maid take care of me. She was kind of a bitch, the maid, but she always made sure I drank plenty of fluids and took my medicine. She certainly wasn\u2019t one for snuggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had a maid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEleanor. That was her name. Shit, I wonder what happened to Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into Allison on the way out, when I was bringing the tray out here. She wanted to do it. She said you\u2019d rather if she brought it.\u201d</p><p>I feel his laugh, rather than hear it. \u201cWell, I think the desire to snuggle would\u2019ve been nixed if she was the one who brought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . what happened between you guys? If you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d I consider that now might not be the best time to get into this sort of conversation, but then I think that maybe it is . . . with his guard down, he probably won\u2019t gloss over the truth, though I can\u2019t say whether or not it would change anything.</p><p>\u201cWe kissed. It could\u2019ve gone a lot further, trust me, but I was serious when I told you I\u2019m all set with the statutory charges. I have a good instinct, sometimes, when it comes to this sort of thing. The girls that are going to start trouble if you get too involved. And she is definitely one of them. Does that . . . does that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, your great instinct?\u201d I say, though I know that\u2019s not what he\u2019s referring to.</p><p>\u201cNo, that Allison and I kind of hooked up. It really was just a kiss. Not even a very good one at that. Not like you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, it really doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying that, you know. About you being a really great kisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, coming from someone with as much as experience as you have, I guess I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as experienced as you might think. You\u2019re my first, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see my face right now, but I\u2019m rolling my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my first girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, and I replay the words he\u2019s just said about a dozen times in my head before he says, \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you. Which I hope it is. I\u2019ve never had an actual girlfriend before, and knowing you makes me realize that I\u2019d like one.\u201d</p><p>Since we\u2019re lying there, basically spooning, he can\u2019t see my expression, but if he could he\u2019d see I am smiling, that in fact, I have a huge grin that I can\u2019t wipe off my face.</p><p>Uncle Nate seems to be in relatively good spirits during lunch. \u201cIsn\u2019t there supposed to be someone else here?\u201d he asks. \u201cI heard you were bringing a date along.\u201d He smiles as he says this, as though he\u2019s genuinely happy to hear that I might be involved with someone. When he smiles, he looks a lot like Dad.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut he really wanted to come and meet you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the boy she wasn\u2019t getting along with,\u201d Mom says. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Nate raises his eyebrows. \u201cGlad to hear you\u2019ve turned that around.\u201d</p><p>We go to a little caf\u00e9 that Mom likes and sit outside. Overhead, the clouds are starting to break up and the sun peeks out. I am, in fact, almost done with my turkey club sandwich before Uncle Nate starts talking about Dad.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make a point to be in Lanai on the anniversary of Mike\u2019s death,\u201d he says. Lanai was where my parents went on their honeymoon, one of the first destinations when Uncle Nate launched his cruise business, the place of some of my favorite childhood vacation memories. I set my sandwich down. \u201cI told myself on the way out here that I wasn\u2019t going to bring it up again. Because, believe it or not, after the last time we got together, I did some reflecting. And while I will always know in my heart of hearts that the accident was not just an accident, I can see why you might want to just try to put the whole thing behind you. This is not to say that I am going to do that, but I believe that you\u2019ve made it abundantly clear you don\u2019t want to hear about it any longer. And I\u2019ve got to respect that; I know Mike would want me to. And maybe . . . maybe there really is nothing to be done. I just don\u2019t want to believe that.\u201d</p><p>Mom reaches across the table and takes his hand. She\u2019s barely touched her lunch. \u201cAccepting what happened doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t miss him any less,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can find it in yourself to try to move on too, I think you\u2019ll be less stressed out about everything. Mike wouldn\u2019t want you to be like this, Nathan. You know he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I wonder, suddenly, if it\u2019s silly to think that anything could come of me actually meeting Griffin\u2019s father, if there really is any evidence to uncover. He annoyed the shit out of me every time he brought it up, but now that Uncle Nate is sitting here, maybe admitting defeat, I want to tell him that I might have discovered something that could lead to something else. Except . . . that would mean bringing Griffin into it, and for some reason, there is a little tiny voice that is telling me not to. That it would be a very, very, bad idea.</p><p>The feeling stays with me after I say goodbye and am driving back to the ranch. After my parents\u2019 accident, I remember lying in bed awake at nights and trying to think if there\u2019d been some feeling, some voice telling me not go with them that day. I couldn\u2019t recall anything, which made me feel relieved, if nothing else, because if there had been a premonition, why wouldn\u2019t I have tried harder to make them stay home, too?</p><p>But your mind will go in all sorts of directions trying to untangle the knotted mess of tragedy, and mine certainly did. Like, what if they had left five minutes later? Or earlier? Would it still have happened? What if I had gone with them, and looked at that horse? Maybe we would\u2019ve stayed longer. Or: My parents loved each other and had such an awesome relationship. Did Mom wish she had died, too? They did everything together; did she wish they had also met their end together? And then of course, the ever-pervasive, all-consuming, relentless one word question: WHY?</p><p>I thought there really wasn\u2019t an answer for that. But maybe there is.</p><p>Chapter 23: Griffin</p><p>I\u2019m finally starting to feel better the day that Cam is supposed to arrive. The fever has lifted, only traces of that bone-deep exhaustion remain. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw Cam, and I think it\u2019s unfortunate I won\u2019t be in top form, but who knows, maybe things will actually go better that way.</p><p>Jill and Karen take some of the campers out on a trail ride, which I skip out on since my head still feels a little funny. I get a bottle of water and walk down toward the entrance to the ranch. I sit down in the shade of one of the trees, my back against the trunk. It\u2019s one of those days where every time the wind blows, warm, fragrant air wafts over you and you can\u2019t help but feel better. I think it\u2019s a good omen, I think it means that this visit with Cam will go well.</p><p>I lean my head back against the tree and let my eyes close. I\u2019m just starting to feel that heady feeling when you\u2019re about to doze off when I hear the sound of a car approach. I open my eyes and see a sleek black BMW slowly coming down the driveway. I stand, a smile stretching across my face. The car stops and I go over to the window.</p><p>\u201cCam\u2014\u201d I start to say, but stop. It isn\u2019t Cameron. They\u2019ve got similar coloring\u2014the blond hair, tan skin, light blue eyes\u2014and they\u2019re both what you might refer to as lady killers, but it is definitely not Cam.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cSorry, thought you were someone else.\u201d</p><p>The guy peers up at me. He\u2019s wearing a San Francisco Giants hat, slightly askew on his head.</p><p>\u201cHey, guy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot sure if I\u2019m in the right place or not. Is this uh . . . is this Sea Horse Ranch?\u201d</p><p>I glance up the driveway, to the large wooden sign he just drove past with the words SEA HORSE RANCH carved out by hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, bro,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Official camp greeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool if I drive down there? I\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He shifts, and when he moves, I see that next to him on the passenger side seat is a white orchid.</p><p>\u201cNice orchid,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s for one of the girls who works here. You probably know her. Jill Freyss-Charon.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI do know her. Biblically, in fact.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a confused look. \u201cHuh? Jill doesn\u2019t go to church.\u201d</p><p>I stifle my laugh and take a step back from the car. \u201cShe\u2019s on a trail ride right now, but feel free to hang around. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>He throws me a look that says he can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being sarcastic or not. He starts to drive off but then stops abruptly, the tires skidding on the sandy gravel.</p><p>\u201cHold the fuck on!\u201d he says, and then the car door\u2019s opening and he\u2019s out, right in front of me. \u201cI know what that \u2018biblically\u2019 shit means, dude. You\u2019re fucking Jill? Who the fuck do you think you are? We only broke up because of that shit with her parents. She needed space, so I gave it to her, because I\u2019m that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d I say.</p><p>His eyes narrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she told you about the other night, but I didn\u2019t mean for it to go down that way.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about, but I only cross my arms and give him my best disappointed-in-you-look \u00e0 la Carl Alexander.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty bad,\u201d I say. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d He yanks his hat off and runs his hand through his short blond curls. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019re only getting one side of the story, right? Did you even think about hearing my side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, considering we just met for the first time three minutes ago, no, it never really crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you my side, then. Jill and I have history, right? I knew the first time I saw her she was the one for me. I could see our whole future together. Really, I could. And we had good times, together, man, and then the shit with her parents happened and she said she needed space. Which I totally get, right? And I wanted to give that to her, because I care about her. But then somewhere along the line she decides that it\u2019s going to be this permanent thing. She just makes the choice, without even talking to me about it first. Can you believe that shit?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think of all the girls that I\u2019ve been with, all the beds I\u2019ve slipped silently out of before sunrise, all the conversations we could\u2019ve had but didn\u2019t. \u201cYeah, actually, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s fucking bullshit! And then, the night of her birthday, I went over there because I wanted to talk. Just to talk. But she didn\u2019t want to listen. And I just . . . I . . . I\u2019m not proud of how I handled it.\u201d</p><p>I look at him more closely now, wanting to ask, Well what the fuck did you do? Instead, I give another disapproving shake of my head. \u201cThere are much better ways to handle a situation than doing what you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I was going to rape her,\u201d he says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to kick me in the nutsack the way she did. I couldn\u2019t walk right for three days.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip. \u201cSo your side of the story is you tried to sexually assault her but she kicked you in the balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sexual assault if you\u2019re not hurting the person. If it\u2019s someone you\u2019ve already been with. We were together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, bro. I\u2019m not that much older than you, but I think I can impart a little wisdom, if you\u2019re open to it.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand across the lower part of his face and then finally nods. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall in love with potential. Potential doesn\u2019t actually exist yet. So you\u2019re basically falling in love with an idea that may or may not actually happen. It\u2019s easy to do, but if your idea of how you think someone is and then the reality of who they actually are don\u2019t align, well, then, you\u2019re screwed. So when I hear you say that you knew the second you saw Jill that she was the one for you, that tells me you fell in love with the potential of what you guys could have had. You fell in love with what type of person she could be.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrows, and for a second, I think he\u2019s about to cry.</p><p>\u201cTry taking a few deep breaths,\u201d I say. I pat his shoulder. \u201cDude, you\u2019re young, you\u2019re a good-looking man, I\u2019m sure there are a million girls out there who would love to hop in the sack with you.\u201d</p><p>This seems to lift his spirits. \u201cThere are,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSo instead of wasting all this time and energy\u2014and not to mention, orchids\u2014on someone who doesn\u2019t want to be with you, go find someone who does. It might surprise you how happy you can be.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cYou might be right,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat was that you said? \u2018Don\u2019t fall in love with potential?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real, man. That\u2019s some deep, true shit right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue shit. Exactly.\u201d I bite down harder on my lip to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d he says. \u201cTell Jill I stopped by, okay? And tell her I\u2019m sorry, and I won\u2019t bother her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He starts to walk back to his car but stops and comes over and actually gives me one of those big, back-slapping frat boy hugs. And just as he is doing that, Cam pulls into the driveway and that is the first sight my brother has of me, embracing my girlfriend\u2019s meathead ex-boyfriend.</p><p>Cam takes me out to lunch to this small little caf\u00e9, just south of San Francisco. We\u2019re just after the lunch rush, and the place is pretty empty, but he still requests the back corner table, and when the waitress comes over to ask us if we want a refill on our drinks, he gives her a harsh look that sends her scurrying away.</p><p>He looks good, my bro, although older than I remember. I guess that happens. And he keeps tapping the tabletop with his forefinger and looking toward the entrance of the restaurant like he\u2019s expecting someone else to come through the door.</p> <p>\u201cSo how\u2019s life?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cLife is fine,\u201d he says. I\u2019m about halfway done with my burger, but he hasn\u2019t touched his shrimp salad. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to admit, Griffin, I\u2019m a little perplexed about this whole kidnapping situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. And I was too, for a little bit, but Dad\u2019s not going to tell me anything. Hell, Dad wouldn\u2019t give two shits if it happened again and the guys actually did kill me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about that? About it happening again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cNo,\u201d he says finally. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. \u2018Cause, you know, I wouldn\u2019t want to have to live the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, wondering when I\u2019m going to be abducted next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did these guys say anything else to you? What did they look like? Would you recognize them if you saw them again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . no, I don\u2019t really remember them saying anything of great importance. They seemed surprised Dad wasn\u2019t cooperating, but all that told me was they had no idea who they were actually dealing with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would I recognize them if I saw them again? Yeah, probably. But really, Cam, I doubt that\u2019s ever gonna happen. They probably went down with the boat. Maybe they washed up in San Francisco Bay or something. Maybe I\u2019ll get the call to come identify the bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fairly certain they\u2019re both dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly.\u201d</p><p>He gives a brisk nod. \u201cOkay. Excellent. Great.\u201d He signals the waitress for the check and then we leave, even though I haven\u2019t finished eating and he hasn\u2019t touched his meal at all.</p><p>He drives me back to the ranch. I ask him if he wants to come meet Jill.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he says, giving me a blank look.</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the clock on the dashboard, then at his watch. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get going. This was primarily a business trip, after all. And I wanted to make sure everything with you was okay,\u201d he adds quickly.</p><p>We sit there for a minute, the car idling. \u201cOkay then,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was good to see you. We\u2019ll be coming back to New York at some point, if you\u2019re around. Maybe you could meet her then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, neither of us saying anything. Then he holds out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll see you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I shake his hand, then get out of the car, and try not to feel like I\u2019ve just been interrogated and then dumped on the side of the road.</p><p>I\u2019m walking down to the beach when I hear Jill call my name.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says. She\u2019s wearing a white tank top and cutoffs, flip-flops on her feet. Her toenails, I notice, are painted pink. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and left already. He had a bunch of business meetings to get to, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Did you guys have a good visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, I guess so. I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll probably get to hang out with him in New York, maybe. Or maybe not. He\u2019s a busy guy. Whatever. It went fine.\u201d I try to shrug off the disappointment that I feel that it didn\u2019t go a little better. \u201cBut, you know who showed up while you guys were on the trail ride?\u201d</p><p>She reaches over and takes my hand. \u201cNo. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint: He was delivering an orchid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Sean was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stopped by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god. Did you tell him to leave and never come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually had a nice little chat. After we got past some initial . . . hostility. And what was this he was going on about\u2014your birthday? Did he try to do something to you?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at her feet. \u201cTry being the operative word in that statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he actually told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to hear his side of the story.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a skeptical look and then bursts out laughing. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid so, sweetheart. But we actually had a good talk. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have to worry about him anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jill smiles. \u201cWhy thank you, then,\u201d she says. She pulls me off the trail, far enough into the woods that you wouldn\u2019t be able to see us from the path. There\u2019s a little sandy clearing, and she stands in front of me, puts her arms around my neck. \u201cI think I need to repay you for that monumental favor you just did for me.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her arms back and runs her hands down the front of my shirt, lightly over my torso. She unbuckles my belt, pops the button on my jeans, and then kneels down in front of me as she lets my jeans fall around my ankles.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p><p>I have, what you might call, a turbulent libido, and just the sight of her, kneeling in front of me with my cock a few inches from her face, gets me instantly hard. She takes me into her mouth, moving her tongue in circles around the tip of dick. I put one hand on her head but don\u2019t try to direct her movement; I let my head fall back and fall into the sensations rippling up and down my body. Her mouth is soft and wet, and my ass clenches when she takes me in far enough that I can feel the back of her throat. She moves her head a bit and I can feel my inner thigh muscles quiver.</p><p>\u201cI need to be in you,\u201d I say. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Her shorts come off, underwear down, and I lie on the ground. \u201cRide me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cRide me like you ride those horses every day. Get on top and fuck the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>And she does. I hold her hips and look up at her gorgeous face, the way her top teeth bite down on her lower lip, how she closes her eyes when she moves her hips back and lets me get in really deep. She pauses for a moment to catch her breath and I tell her to turn around, to face the other way, but to do it while I\u2019m still in her. She stretches those long legs out and very slowly rotates, so now I\u2019ve got the perfect view of the symmetry of her back, her slender midsection, that glorious fucking ass. Holy shit.</p><p>And the girl can ride. I already knew that, but . . . she swivels, rolls her hips forward and back. I grab her ass cheek with one hand, lick my forefinger, and then slowly slide it up her butt. I don\u2019t think she even notices. A lot of girls are wary about backdoor entry, but if you do it right, they\u2019ll come like they never have before.</p><p>Which is exactly what she does, and I am not far behind.</p><p>Ahhhhh.</p><p>Chapter 24: Jill</p><p>We have a family cookout on the last day of camp, and I even drove up to the city to pick up Mom and bring her down. The kids are all happy to see their families, but sad that their time here is coming to an end. They all sit around Griffin, and as I watch, I realize they\u2019re all taking turns sitting next to him, writing their email addresses and phone numbers onto a piece of paper for him.</p><p>\u201cWill you be getting a new phone soon?\u201d one of the girls asks.</p><p>Even Karen jots something down on the piece of paper. At this point, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they started asking Griffin to autograph their t-shirts or something.</p><p>Eventually, Griffin finds his way over to the table I\u2019m sitting at with Mom. \u201cJill\u2019s mom!\u201d he says, and he leans down and gives her a hug. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you\u2014I\u2019m glad we finally get to meet in person.\u201d</p><p>He sits down next to her and has Mom charmed in about two point five seconds. It\u2019s actually interesting to watch him interacting with all the parents, the way they\u2019re equally taken with him as their kids have been for the past three weeks. I think that must be interesting\u2014to be so likable. It\u2019s a talent, really.</p><p>\u201cSo I haven\u2019t really decided what the plan is going to be after this,\u201d Griffin is saying to Mom. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to New York for a little while and see my own mom and stuff. I was actually kind of hoping Jill might come with me.\u201d</p><p>Mom beams and looks at me. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea if you go to New York,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019d be like a vacation. You deserve a vacation.\u201d</p><p>Even though it won\u2019t be exactly a vacation, per se, I\u2019m thinking that it sounds like a pretty good idea, too.</p><p>Later, though, I start wondering if it actually is a good idea. Things with Griffin have been going extraordinarily well, but I think that\u2019s in part because we\u2019re here at the ranch. Because in between us being together, we\u2019ve got work to do, there are always other people around, plenty of distractions. If I go to New York with him, there won\u2019t be work and the people around us will be strangers.</p><p>But what about the original plan, I remind myself. The original plan was that I didn\u2019t like Griffin and somehow found a way to get to New York with him to try to find out information about Dad\u2019s death. That plan seems skewed now, because I actually do like Griffin. Maybe it was a dumb plan to begin with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m almost finished mucking out the barn when Griffin appears and leans over the stall door, arms hanging down.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I keep my back to him. \u201cAlmost done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant to go for a swim after this?\u201d I feel his hands on my waist and I stiffen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve got some stuff to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Slowly, he turns me around so I\u2019m facing him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I shake my head and smile, even though the smile feels forced. \u201cI was just . . . I don\u2019t know. Thinking that maybe New York wouldn\u2019t be such a great idea right now.\u201d</p><p>He touches his forehead to mine. I stand like that for a few seconds and then pull my head back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about New York isn\u2019t a good idea?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go, if you don\u2019t want to. But I think you\u2019ll have a good time. I know I\u2019ll have a much better time if you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I let go of the pitchfork, and it falls onto the shavings with a muted thump. \u201cListen,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually New York. I mean, it kind of is, but it\u2019s like, I\u2019m your girlfriend. I\u2019m your girlfriend and you want me to go to New York with you and meet your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that freaks you out a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yeah!\u201d</p><p>I wonder if it\u2019s incredibly shitty of me not to tell him that the whole reason I started being nice to him in the first place was because I wanted to find out information about his father. If it wasn\u2019t for wanting to know that, I\u2019d probably still be hating him. The basis for our relationship is a lie, and I can\u2019t help but think that means the whole thing is going to blow up in my face.</p><p>He brings his hand up to the side of my face. \u201cDoes it feel like things are moving too fast?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like things are just . . . moving. In a direction that I never thought would happen. I mean, I didn\u2019t expect for this to happen. None of this. I thought this was just going to be my boring summer before I went back for my last year of college. This was not expected.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAre you telling me you don\u2019t like surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill, if you don\u2019t want to go to New York, you don\u2019t have to. Or, if you want to come to New York but not meet my family, you don\u2019t have to. Or, if you want to come to New York and pretend the whole time you don\u2019t know me, we can do that, too.\u201d He leans down and kisses me, really just rests his lips against mine for a few seconds. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I . . .\u201d The words are there, on the tip of my tongue. I think your father had something to do with my dad\u2019s death. And I need to find out. At the same time, I\u2019m scared to, because if he does, what does that mean for us?</p><p>Chapter 25: Griffin</p><p>SFO is one giant clusterfuck. I\u2019ve never minded airports, regardless of the holdups, the delays, the bitchy TSA workers, or the shitty, overpriced food, but by the time we make it through security, Jill\u2019s shoulders have inched their way toward her ears and she\u2019s too wound up to even sit down.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d I say. \u201cLet me give you a shoulder rub.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>So I sit, and I try to envision exactly how this little trip of ours is going to go. I\u2019ve talked with Mom about it, but haven\u2019t had any further communication with Dad. Whether or not Mom passed on the specifics of our travel plans is hard to say, and really depends on her mood. It\u2019s possible she told him everything\u2014mistakenly believing she was rubbing in his face the fact that we were coming back to see her, but then again, it\u2019s also just as likely she hasn\u2019t breathed a word. That would actually be better; taking him by surprise might be our best option.</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly sure why I\u2019m so eager for Dad to be there, other than I want him to see that I did get my life together. I have changed. You did not think I could, but look. I have.</p><p>We take a cab to the penthouse. It\u2019s early afternoon, so it\u2019s hard to say whether Dad will be home or not, but when the elevator lets us off on the top floor and I hear Debussy being pumped through the speakers, I know that Dad is home.</p><p>We leave our stuff in the entranceway, and I lead Jill through the maze of rooms, aware, for maybe the first time, how over-the-top everything is here. The Persian rugs. The marble, the crystal chandeliers. The fucking gold-framed oil paintings. I glance at Jill, but her expression is hard to read. She doesn\u2019t look impressed, so that\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cI bet my dad\u2019s in his study,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><p>She seems rather eager to meet him, which should please Dad at least. Look, Carl, here\u2019s someone who\u2019s actually excited to see you. Though I\u2019m sure once she\u2019s been around him for a few minutes, that will change rather quickly.</p><p>The heavy mahogany door to Dad\u2019s study is open partway, and I push it open the rest of the way.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dad. Looks like our paths are going to cross, after all. This is my girlfriend Jill.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s back is to us; he\u2019s pouring himself some cognac, Hennessey XO, his favorite, which of course he won\u2019t offer to us, but something very odd happens when he turns to face us. A strange expression crosses his face, and he almost drops his balloon snifter. This is interesting; Carl Alexander could be three sheets to the wind and he would never, NEVER fumble his cognac. He recovers, though, and holds out his hand.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jill.\u201d He continues to stare at her, and I continue to stare at him, because he seems completely ill at ease. Is he really so flummoxed by the fact that I have a girlfriend? That she exists? That this wasn\u2019t just some little stunt I pulled?</p><p>\u201cHave we met before?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou look very familiar.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as he says this. Jill does not return the smile. In fact, her mouth is set in a tight line, and she\u2019s looking rather uncomfortable, or mad, or some combination of both.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she says finally.</p><p>They stand there and stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is cozy,\u201d I say, after the silence has stretched to almost a minute. \u201cIs Mom here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out shopping, but I expect she\u2019ll be returning shortly. She knew you were coming.\u201d Dad sets his glass down. \u201cPerhaps we should all go out and get something to eat when she returns.\u201d</p><p>I try to keep my jaw from falling to the floor. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. I look at Jill. \u201cThat sounds good. Do you feel up for it, Jill?\u201d</p><p>Finally, the tiniest of smiles touches the corners of her mouth. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26: Jill</p><p>It was the look that crossed Griffin\u2019s father\u2019s face when we stepped into his study. He knew who I was. Everyone has always said how much Dad and I looked like each other, and Carl\u2019s reaction only made me more certain that he knows something about Dad\u2019s accident.</p><p>Griffin seems equally perplexed, though I\u2019m not exactly sure why. After Carl invites us out to lunch, we go into the living room to wait for his mom to get home. And when she arrives, it\u2019s clear that, looks-wise, anyway, it\u2019s she who Griffin takes after.</p><p>She\u2019s tall, and has the same jet-black hair, which has been swept up on top of her head. Her eyes are a paler shade of blue than Griffin\u2019s, but her nose is the same, and the mouth.</p><p>\u201cDarling!\u201d she exclaims, dropping an armload of shopping bags. \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d be back before you got here. I just spoke with your brother; he\u2019s stuck in meetings downtown and won\u2019t be able to make it, but he told me to send his regards. And that he\u2019ll try to catch up with you later.\u201d She gives him a hug, the bangles on her wrist jangling. \u201cHow was the flight? How long are you here for? What plans do you have?\u201d</p><p>She lets go of him and he turns to me. \u201cMom, this is my girlfriend Jill. Jill, this is my mom.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and we shake hands. She appraises me, quickly, coolly, but apparently she deems me acceptable because she smiles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could all go out and get something to eat,\u201d Carl says, appearing in the doorway. \u201cWe can go have a nice lunch and get all caught up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me just go freshen up,\u201d Griffin\u2019s mom says. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and leaves the room in a flurry. Carl, Griffin, and I stand there, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a place in mind?\u201d Griffin asks.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good steakhouse that just opened,\u201d Carl says. He looks at me. \u201cDo you eat meat, Jill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think this is the perfect place.\u201d</p><p>Griffin\u2019s mom comes back a few minutes later and we leave, Carl keeping his eye on me the whole time.</p><p>Lunch is like a game of cat and mouse that only Carl and I are aware we\u2019re playing. He asks me questions and I give him vague answers. Where did you grow up? What does your father do for work? How did you meet my son?</p><p>Griffin and his mother seem oblivious, though occasionally I\u2019ll catch Griffin looking at Carl in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it that you do?\u201d I ask after our salads are brought out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a businessman,\u201d he replies, as vaguely as I responded to his questions.</p><p>\u201cClearly a successful one,\u201d I say.</p><p>He pauses, his drink halfway to his lips, and he gives me a look as though he can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being sarcastic or not.</p><p>\u201cSo, I must\u2019ve missed it, but tell me again,\u201d Griffin\u2019s mom says, \u201cHow did the two of you meet? Was it over in Thailand?\u201d</p><p>I defer to Griffin on this. Carl downs his drink and says nothing.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cMy Thailand trip got cut short, actually. Another story for another time though.\u201d He shoots a look at Carl, who has folded his hands in front of him and is looking off into the middle distance. \u201cJill and I met out in California, near the horse ranch she works at. The place I\u2019ve been working at, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, you got a job! You didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s actually a lot of fun. I\u2019ve been having a good time.\u201d</p><p>His mom smiles and pats his arm. \u201cYou always did like being outside. A job and a girlfriend! How lovely.\u201d</p><p>Carl is mostly quiet for the rest of the meal. Whenever I look in his direction, though, he is looking right at me, and he doesn\u2019t avert his gaze when I return the stare. I\u2019m still not sure if he knows exactly who I am, but just the way he\u2019s acting tells me that he knows something.</p><p>I wake up while it\u2019s still dark, and for a while I lie in bed next to Griffin and watch the sky turn from inky, midnight blue to a light gray. If I\u2019m going to do something, I might as well do it now. There might not be another chance.</p><p>I slip out of bed. Griffin stirs but does not wake. His mouth is slightly open, one arm thrown above his head. He looks entirely at peace.</p><p>I walk down the hallway to Carl\u2019s study. I pause outside the door and listen; everything\u2019s quiet. I peek in. The built-in bookshelves are lined with leather-bound tomes. The desk sits at the back of the room, by the windows. There are paintings on the walls, and I wonder, as I step into the study, if there\u2019s a safe hidden behind one of them.</p><p>I go over to the desk. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, maybe something that might somehow shed some light on anything, but I am suddenly overcome with the certainty that there is something, and I\u2019ll know it when I see it.</p><p>I open a few drawers. There are papers, documents, one drawer full of pens and paper clips. I ruffle through the papers and see nothing that really makes any sense. I get to the bottom right hand drawer and pull. It doesn\u2019t budge.</p><p>I straighten, and look around the room. If there\u2019s a key, he probably keeps it on him, or in his briefcase or something. I open the top middle drawer again and extract the silver letter opener. Picking locks was never one of my specialties, but I\u2019d done it on a few occasions and hoped I might get lucky once more.</p><p>I slide the letter opener into the lock when I hear a noise behind me. I freeze, thinking that maybe it\u2019s someone just walking past the study, but out of the corner of my eye I see Carl step into view.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d ask you what the hell you thought you were doing, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d give me an honest answer.\u201d</p><p>I stand. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor something,\u201d he repeats. \u201cAnd what might that something be?\u201d</p><p>I say nothing.</p><p>\u201cI knew you looked familiar,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead ringer for your father. And then I asked Griffin what your last name was. Freyss-Charon . . . your father was Michael Charon, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He has the oddest look on his face.

He chuckles. \u201cMy son finally finds a decent woman to be with and she turns out to be the daughter of Michael Charon. Am I correct, Jill? Is Michael Charon your father? And your mother . . . Annabel Freyss? Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and he laughs, a deep belly laugh even though, as far as I can tell, nothing funny has been said.</p><p>He stops laughing and takes a step toward me, then another. I back up, narrowly missing the edge of his executive desk.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to understand,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a very wealthy man. Wealth is a good thing. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t always amass large amounts of wealth by only doing good things. Sometimes, the things you must do are . . . less than desirable, shall we say. It\u2019s simply a fact of life. It has always been that way, and it will continue to be that way until the end of time. If it wasn\u2019t me, it would be someone else.\u201d He rubs his palms together. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying, Jill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, taking another step back. Each step he takes toward me, I take one away from him. I hope I am getting closer to the door. I hope Griffin will get back here soon. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re rich. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cI can see why my son likes you. You\u2019re both wise-asses who probably know a little too much for your own good. Like your father. Did you know I knew your father? He used to work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTragic, what happened to him. Your mother, too. You see, your father, Jill, was one of those ignorant men who liked to get in the way if he felt things were not being carried out in a fair and just manner. Rather noble of him, if you think about it, but na\u00efve. For a while, I considered him one of my best employees. He really cared about doing a good job. But then he started sticking his nose in places it didn\u2019t belong. Started asking questions, and then, when he didn\u2019t like the answers, started demanding that we change the way we did things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he wanted things done right,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it; it just depends on what your definition of \u2018right\u2019 is. And unfortunately for your father, our definitions didn\u2019t quite match up. And he wasn\u2019t willing to just accept that. So something had to be done. He had to be taken care of. Though I\u2019d like to assure you, I certainly was not the one to do it. I actually had very little involvement in the whole thing, if you want to know the truth. But people will do all sorts of things to protect what\u2019s important to them.\u201d He takes another step. \u201cAre you still following me, Jill?\u201d</p><p>Hearing him say my name makes my stomach turn. He stares at me with his pale blue eyes, like nothing more than Arctic ice with the tiniest bit of light shining through. His lips are thin and his face is tight, pinched. I look at him and see nothing that resembles Griffin in the least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go,\u201d I say. My voice trembles and I swallow. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have this conversation with you, Mr. Alexander.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s there in front of me lightning fast, his face inches from mine. It seems impossible that he could\u2019ve crossed that distance so quickly, but here he is, his breath hot on my face. He grins. He is only a few inches taller than me, and slim, but he is surprisingly strong. When his hands wrap around my throat, I am surprised that I can\u2019t immediately remove them. I can\u2019t budge them at all, and in fact, he\u2019s only squeezing tighter and it feels like he\u2019s about to crush my windpipe. I flail wildly at his face, his arms, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s locked in and there is nothing that will loosen his grip. My body tingles. The color drains from everything, his face, the room, it\u2019s all black and white. A sound like white noise, or the ocean waves, starts to build in my ears, and gets louder, louder. My mouth falls open but no sounds comes out, there\u2019s nothing but the rushing noise and this intense pressure like a balloon filled to the point of popping and then . . . nothing.</p><p>Chapter 27: Griffin</p> <p>I wake up with a jolt, like someone just dumped a bucket of ice cold water over me. I can tell by the light it\u2019s still early, earlier than I\u2019d be getting up at the ranch, even. I sit there for a minute, trying to remember if I\u2019d just been having a crazy nightmare or something. I look to my right and see that Jill\u2019s side of the bed is empty. There is a bathroom connected to this room, and I can see that the door is open and the light is off. A strange feeling is coursing through my veins, like someone just shot me up with a dose of anxiety and fear. I kick back the covers and get out of bed, feeling like some sort of animal that can sense a particularly bad storm before it hits.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet in the hallway. I stand there for a second and wonder if maybe I\u2019m going crazy. What the hell do I think could actually be happening? But then I hear something; it sounds like Jill, though I can\u2019t make out exactly what she\u2019s saying. I hurry down to the study.</p><p>He lets go of her the second I step into the room and Jill collapses in a heap on the floor. He stumbles back as though she\u2019s pushed him, and he\u2019s laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>I rush over to her and can see the marks he\u2019s left on her throat, bright red, stark against her white skin. Suddenly, her body jerks slightly and she coughs, this terrible, dry wheezing sound. I\u2019m kneeling down next to her when her chest heaves; her eyes are still closed but she\u2019s gasping and coughing, trying to draw in a breath.</p><p>\u201cJilly,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. Come back to me.\u201d The color slowly starts to return to her face and her eyes flutter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d my father says from behind me. Out of the corner of my eye I see him move toward his desk, where I know he keeps his .45, top right hand drawer. He\u2019ll shoot us both, but the drawer is locked, so it buys me enough time to bypass him before he can reach the desk and take him down.</p><p>We land hard on the ground but he twists out from under me, scrambling to get onto his feet. He kicks, connects with my side, but I don\u2019t feel a thing. I grab his leg and yank him toward me. I clench both fists and let his face have it; he screams when the cartilage in his nose shatters, he spits up blood and fragments of teeth.</p> <p>I went on a fox hunt, once, when we vacationed in Devon, England. I don\u2019t remember much about that vacation, except the way the hounds ripped apart that little red fox once they had it cornered in front of a crumbling brick wall. They couldn\u2019t have been called off; they\u2019d tasted blood, they were in a frenzy, they didn\u2019t stop until there was nothing left. I think of this, suddenly, of those dogs, and I think I could be just like them and go on pummeling my father\u2019s face until there\u2019s nothing left.</p><p>But I stop.</p><p>I stand up, slowly, as he spits up more blood and rolls to his side, groaning. Jill is sitting up, leaning against the wall, rubbing the side of her neck. Her eyes widen as I approach and I realize it\u2019s because I\u2019m covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d I say, kneeling down in front of her. \u201cCome on, we have to get you out of here.\u201d I pull one of her arms over my shoulders and gently help her stand. I pull my phone out of my pocket and dial 911.</p><p>\u201cI need a police officer over here,\u201d I say, giving the dispatcher the address.</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a prank,\u201d I say and repeat the address. I look at my father, who is rolling onto his hands and knees. \u201cI need an ambulance, as well. Send an officer now. Send a few. Do whatever you have to do and get someone down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing.\u201d His voice is muffled because he\u2019s talking into the Persian rug, leaving great big blood smears all over the wool.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m doing what someone should\u2019ve done a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He raises his head, which is almost unrecognizable. It\u2019s a good look for you, Dad, I think. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll end up going to prison?\u201d One of his front teeth has been knocked out. \u201cYou think they put people like me in prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they love putting people like you in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on what charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know Dad, I didn\u2019t go to law school, remember? But let\u2019s see . . . attempted murder, maybe? Or if that doesn\u2019t suit you, I\u2019m sure they could look into some of your offshore accounts. Or they could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had my father killed.\u201d</p><p>Jill has stepped back into the room. The marks on her neck are already turning hideous shades of violet and midnight blue; I can see the impressions his thumbs made. Her voice is raspy, like she\u2019s got a severe case of bronchitis. She coughs and winces, but looks right at him.</p><p>My father stares at her for a minute and then looks at me. \u201cIs this worth it?\u201d he says. \u201cIs some stupid whore worth it to you? You\u2019ll lose your inheritance. You\u2019ll get nothing. We will cast you out from this family, you can count on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t actually want to be a part of this family. This family kind of sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ungrateful piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, you\u2019re wrong. I used to be. I\u2019m not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the approach of sirens.</p><p>\u201cYou destroyed my family,\u201d Jill says, taking another step toward him. I put my hand on her shoulder and she stops but doesn\u2019t move back. \u201cAll for what? For money? Is that all that matters to you?\u201d</p><p>My father looks down for a moment, as though he\u2019s actually considering this.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, that\u2019s all that really matters to anyone.\u201d</p><p>The blare of the sirens sounds like it\u2019s right outside the window. \u201cNot to me,\u201d I say. I hear footsteps on the stairs. \u201cGoodbye, Dad.\u201d</p><p>We spend the day at the hospital. I sit in the corner on a hard plastic chair while Jill gets evaluated. They take photos of her neck, and two detectives come in and take her statement.</p><p>At one point, I get up and go out to get a soda. One of the detectives, a middle-aged guy who actually has a rather spectacular handlebar moustache, follows me.</p><p>\u201cSo this was your father?\u201d he asks. \u201cYour father did this?\u201d</p><p>I slide quarters into the slot and look at my choices. When being interrogated by the law, nothing beats a Coke. I make my selection.</p><p>\u201cThat is correct,\u201d I say. \u201cLike we already told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think your father would do something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the reasons Jill told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in your mind, it\u2019s within the realm of possibility that your father would have another man murdered.\u201d</p><p>I retrieve the cold can and pop the tab. \u201cWell, sure,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, he just tried to kill my girlfriend, with his bare hands. I\u2019d say ordering a hit on someone probably wouldn\u2019t give him much pause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother seems to disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re also trying to get in contact with your brother, Cameron. He\u2019s not answering his phone, though. Do you know his whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we know your brother was not officially affiliated with your father\u2019s business, they did work closely together, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think your brother knew anything about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of the drink, the fizzy sugariness coating my throat. \u201cThat\u2019s a really great moustache,\u201d I say.</p><p>He ignores the comment. \u201cDoes it surprise you to hear that your mother does not think your father is capable of doing something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m happy to help in whatever way is necessary, I really am. My parents have grown apart over the years, and honestly, my mom most likely had no clue what my father was up to in regards to anything. So if you\u2019re asking me if she\u2019s lying\u2014she\u2019s probably not. Hook her up to one of those polygraph machines, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat probably won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d He strokes that glorious moustache and then turns to walk off. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch if we\u2019ve got any more questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, wondering how exactly he plans on doing that since the only phone I\u2019ve got is one I don\u2019t even know the number to.</p><p>Finally, we leave the hospital. I want to go to my apartment, but Jill insists we go see her uncle, who is sending a car for us.</p><p>\u201cI really need to talk to him,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to tell him he was right. That he was right all along.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The car picks us up and takes us to the Upper East Side. The doorman lets us in and we take the elevator up to the penthouse, where her uncle is waiting when the doors open.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nate,\u201d Jill says, and she runs to him and hugs him. \u201cYou were right about everything. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill\u2014what on earth is going on?\u201d He lets go of her and scrutinizes her face, gripping her by the shoulders. Then he sees me and does a double take.</p> <p>\u201cWho . . . what are you doing here?\u201d he says finally.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nate, this is Griffin. This is my uncle Nate,\u201d Jill says.</p><p>I hold my hand out. Her uncle has the oddest look on his face, as though he recognizes me, though I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019ve never seen the guy before in my life.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I say.</p><p>He\u2019s still giving me a look like I just told him I eat shit for breakfast or something.</p> <p>He stutters. \u201cHello,\u201d he finally says, coughing. We shake hands, his palm slick with sweat. I wipe my hand on my jeans.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Uncle Nate?\u201d Jill asks.</p><p>He coughs again and shoots me a look, then turns his gaze to her. \u201cYes, Jill. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d He looks at her more closely. \u201cWhat happened to your neck?\u201d</p><p>We go and sit in the parlor. They start talking, and from what I get from the conversation, it sounds like Jill\u2019s uncle knew about this all along. After a little while, though, I zone out, and try to make sense of the fact that not only is my father a giant asshole, he\u2019s responsible for the death of one person and nearly killing someone else. So he\u2019s even more of a giant asshole than I thought he was. More ruthless, more sociopathic, just completely fucked up. What will happen now? It\u2019s hard to picture good old Dad in Sing Sing, but if I\u2019m honest, that\u2019s exactly what I hope will happen.</p><p>I get up and use the bathroom. When I come back, Jill and her uncle are still talking, so I sit back down. From somewhere behind me, I hear the door open and footsteps approaching.</p><p>\u201cNate, you in?\u201d a male voice calls.</p> <p>I recognize that voice. It takes me a second, but then it clicks, and when he appears in the doorway, I\u2019m not surprised to see he\u2019s got a pockmarked face and picket fence teeth.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d Nate says, jumping up as Snaggletooth steps into the room. \u201cThis is my niece, Jill. And her boyfriend. Griffin.\u201d</p><p>The three of us stand there and I can feel the pieces falling into place, practically hear the click click as they align like gears on a watch.</p><p>Nate coughs again and Bruce extends his hand. \u201cNice to meet you both,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHave we met before?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He too stutters and then clears his throat and shoots a surreptitious glance at Nate.</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess you\u2019ve just got one of those faces,\u201d I say, giving him a wink.</p><p>They start talking about the Yankees-Red Sox game coming up, and that\u2019s as deep as the conversation gets. So I let it lie.</p> <p>When I finally look at my phone, I have thirty-seven missed calls, mostly from Cam, a few from my mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d he shouts when I finally call him back. I hold the phone away from my ear. \u201cDad was arrested?! You had something to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Carl? Yes, Carl was arrested. Would you like to know why? Oh, because he almost killed my girlfriend. Is Carl going to be adjusting to a new life of three hots and a cot? I\u2019d say so, and for a long ass time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU\u2019VE DONE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right thing, for once in my life. Look, Cam, I think Dad was involved in a whole bunch of shit we had no idea about. Like, bad stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like he\u2019s hyperventilating. Or crying. Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got to fucking go. Jesus Christ. You have NO IDEA how badly you\u2019ve just messed things up, you moronic piece of shit! FUCK YOU, Griffin. FUCK!\u201d He screams this last part, his voice cracking, and then the line goes dead. I stare at the phone for a minute. I take three deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth, then slip the phone back into my pocket.</p><p>Chapter 28: Jill</p><p>Testifying against the man who tried to kill me is not as cathartic as you might imagine. The courtroom is packed, and the entire time I\u2019m being questioned I feel as though I\u2019m stuck in a terrible dream where I\u2019m on stage for a school play and I\u2019ve forgotten all my lines. But I am able to look out into the sea of faces and find Griffin, and all he has to do is give me a little smile and I know that yes, I can get through this. Afterward, we fly back to California. There is no need to follow the rest of the trial or the ensuing media circus. The second session of camp starts up, and both Griffin and I dive back into the routine, glad for the distraction.</p><p>It\u2019s the night of the Beach BBQ, which has pretty much wound down to a few campers giggling in their tents. Griffin and I set up separate tents next to each other, but we both wind up outside, lying in the sand, looking up at an impossibly clear sky that looks like crushed velvet.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be down there patrolling the shore for any more kidnapped men who happen to wash up,\u201d Griffin says. He\u2019s holding my hand, running his thumb in slow circles over my wrist bone. \u201cYou know, one that might be more handsome and better in the sack than I am.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re actually the only person I want to be with. Even if your father did try to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that. Well, there\u2019s also the whole getting kidnapped by your uncle, so maybe it\u2019s a fair trade-off. Clearly, our families are both completely fucking insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then we probably are, too? I mean, it seems like such a bad way to start a relationship. That\u2019s what the basis of our relationship is: My uncle had you kidnapped; your father tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift your head up a little,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>His breath is warm against my ear. I do, and he slides his arm under my neck and pulls me toward him. I turn so I\u2019m lying more on my side and drape my arm across his face, nestle my own face in the crevice where his shoulder meets his neck. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what our families tried to do. Or actually, it does, because that\u2019s what got us together to begin with. So am I glad it all happened? Yes and no. Nobody wants shitty things to happen to other people, but sometimes they do, and sometimes good things come of it. Not to get all New Age-y on you or anything. But really, the way I see it for myself, anyway, getting kidnapped gave me this second chance to actually live a life that wasn\u2019t a total fucking waste. I don\u2019t know if it would\u2019ve happened otherwise, or it might\u2019ve taken a lot longer. And then I met you, and actually get to be with you, well, that just tells me for once I made the right choices.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting way to look at things. And who knows? Maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe every bad thing that happens is just an opportunity for a second chance, for a better way of doing things. It has certainly brought the two of us closer, and we both, in a way, have a second chance at things, and I think that just maybe that means things will work out.</p><p>Epilogue - Griffin</p><p>The day of Jill\u2019s graduation is warm and sunny. We drive over from our apartment in Hayes Valley to her mom\u2019s house to help her get ready for the ceremony. When Annabel is ready, I wheel her outside and help her get into the car.</p><p>\u201cI just wish her father could be here to see this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m really so proud of her.\u201d</p><p>The ceremony is long, and during a particularly verbose speech, I find myself daydreaming, thinking about the past year. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say that I occasionally miss the old days, but it\u2019s a fleeting type of longing, and not something I\u2019d ever go back to if I could. My days now have a steadiness to them that I think of as a kind of rhythm, a balance that I never had before. I like nothing more than waking up in the bedroom of our third-floor apartment, the sun gently filtering in through the curtains Jill and I picked out. I get up, make coffee, we have breakfast together. We get ready; she goes to the Sutter St. Women\u2019s Center, where she\u2019s doing an internship when she doesn\u2019t have class, and I head up to Marin, where I\u2019m working as an intake counselor at the Morning Glory Rehabilitation Center. I get a paycheck every two weeks, directly deposited into my bank account. We pay our bills, we go out sometimes, still have great sex. Life is good.</p><p>I talk to Mom occasionally; I\u2019m trying to get her to come out and visit, though she\u2019s resisting, for whatever reason. She is still recovering from everything that happened, and though she isn\u2019t living a life of poverty, Dad\u2019s legal fees depleted a significant portion of his wealth. Cam has disappeared. No one has heard from him, I\u2019ve looked for his face on the cover of those supermarket tabloids, but nothing. The phone he gave me never rings, though I still keep it on my dresser and check it once in a while.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever go visit my father in prison. Unlikely, but I occasionally think of writing him a letter. The only problem is I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d write. Does he deserve a second chance as well? I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Annabel and I both yell our heads off when Jill\u2019s name is called, and she walks across the stage and gets her diploma. She\u2019s the hottest girl up there, by far, and I stick my fingers in my mouth and give her the loudest whistle I can.</p><p>When the ceremony is over, it takes us a little while to find her in the crowd. She comes over, diploma in hand, and I give her a bouquet of flowers (not orchids!) and a hug.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, sweetheart,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d she says gleefully. She gives me a kiss. \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I hardly did a thing.\u201d I lean toward her, my mouth against her ear. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you one thing: I can\u2019t wait to take you home and properly celebrate.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and grins. \u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d she says.</p><p>Much later that night, after Jill and I have celebrated her new status as college graduate in our own way, I get up to get a glass of water. The moonlight filters in through the curtains and throws narrow rectangular strips of lights across the hardwood floor. Seeing it reminds me for a second of the thin shaft of lights I first saw when I came to in that walk-in closet on the yacht, and I wonder: Maybe everything really does happen for a reason? I always believed you made your own destiny, the path you were supposed to follow was whatever one you chose to go down. But for everything that\u2019s happened since I landed in Koh Phangan and made my way to the Full Moon party makes me think otherwise.</p><p>I set the glass down in the sink and head back into the bedroom. Jill is lying there, the sheet draped halfway across that long, gorgeous body of hers. For a moment, I lean against the doorframe and watch her sleep. I could do this for the rest of my life, I think. I could wake up next to this woman for the rest of my life and be totally and completely content.</p><p>I walk toward the bed when my dresser suddenly starts glowing. It\u2019s the phone, Cam\u2019s phone, and it rattles lightly against the wood as it vibrates, once, then twice. Text message. I go over and pick it up. It is from a number I don\u2019t recognize, but the message is clear enough:</p><p>This is not over yet.</p><p>I think about texting something funny back, but then don\u2019t. I wait to see if any more messages follow, but after a minute the screen darkens and then shuts off completely, though I can still see those five little words as if I were looking right at them.</p><p>I turn the phone off completely and put it in my sock drawer. Then I crawl back into bed, back into this wonderful bed where a very short time ago I was experiencing all the ecstacy and bliss a human is pretty much capable of. Now, though, I only feel a tightening knot of uneasiness in my chest, swirling down toward my gut, full of the certainty that Cam will make good on his promise and that this is nowhere near from over. </p> </body></html>"]
