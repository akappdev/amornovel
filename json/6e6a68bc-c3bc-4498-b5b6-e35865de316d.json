Once Elena had watched angels take flight from the light-filled column of the Tower as she sat in front of the distant window of her cherished apartment. Now, she was one of those angels, perched high atop a balcony that had no railing, nothing to prevent a deadly fall.</p><p>Except of course, she would no longer fall.</p><p>Her wings were stronger now. She was stronger.</p> <p>Flaring out those wings, she took a deep breath of the air of home. A fusion of scents\u2014spice and smoke, human and vampire, earthy and sophisticated\u2014hit her with the wild fever of a welcoming rainstorm. Her chest, tight for so long, relaxed, and she stretched her wings out to their greatest width. It was time to explore this familiar place that had become foreign, this home that was suddenly new again.</p><p>Diving down from the balcony, she swept across Manhattan on air currents kissed by the cool bite of spring. The bright green season had thawed the snows that had kept the city in thrall this winter, and now held court, summer not even a peach-colored blush on the horizon. This was the time of rebirth, of blooming things and baby birds, bright and young and fragile even in the frenetic rush of a city that never slept.</p><p>Home. I\u2019m home.</p><p>Letting the air currents sweep her where they would above the diamond-studded lights of the city, she tested her wings, tested her strength.</p><p>Stronger.</p> <p>But still weak. An immortal barely-Made.</p><p>One whose heart remained painfully mortal.</p><p>So it was no surprise when she found herself trying to hover outside the plate-glass window of her apartment. She didn\u2019t yet have the skill to execute the maneuver, and she kept dropping, then having to pull herself back up with fast wingbeats. Still, she saw enough in those fleeting glimpses to know that while the once-shattered glass had been flawlessly repaired, the rooms were empty.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a bloodstain on the carpet to mark the spot where she\u2019d spilled Raphael\u2019s blood, where she\u2019d tried to staunch the crimson river until her fingers were the same murderous shade.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>The scent of the wind and the rain, fresh and wild, around her, inside her, and then strong hands on her hips as Raphael held her effortlessly in position so she could look her fill through the window, her hands flat on the glass.</p> <p>Emptiness.</p><p>No sign remained of the home she\u2019d created piece by precious piece.</p><p>\u201cYou must teach me how to hover,\u201d she said, forcing herself to speak past the knot of loss. It was just a place. Just things. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a very good way to spy on potential targets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to teach you many things.\u201d Tugging her back against his body, her wings trapped in between, the Archangel of New York pressed his lips to the tip of her ear. \u201cYou are full of sorrow.\u201d</p><p>It was instinct to lie, to protect herself, but they\u2019d gone beyond that, she and her archangel. \u201cI guess I somehow expected my apartment to still be here. Sara didn\u2019t say anything when she sent me my things.\u201d And her best friend had never lied to her.</p><p>\u201cIt was as you left it when Sara visited,\u201d Raphael said, drawing back enough that she could flare out her wings and angle her body into the air currents once again. Come, I have something to show you.</p><p>The words were in her mind, along with the wind and the rain. She didn\u2019t order him to get out\u2014because she knew he wasn\u2019t in it. This, the way she could sense him so deeply, speak to him with such ease, was part of whatever it was that tied them to one another ... that taut, twisting emotion that ripped away old scars and created new vulnerabilities in a whip of fire across the soul.</p><p>But as she watched him fly through the lush black of the sky high over the glittering city, her archangel with his wings of white-gold and eyes of endless, relentless blue, she wasn\u2019t sorry. She didn\u2019t want to turn back the clock, didn\u2019t want to return to a life in which she\u2019d never been held in the arms of an archangel, never felt her heart tear open and reform into something stronger, capable of such furies of emotion that it scared her at times. Where are you taking me, Archangel?</p> <p>Patience, Guild Hunter.</p><p>She smiled, her grief at the loss of her apartment buried under a wave of amusement. No matter how many times he decreed that her loyalty was now to the angels and not to the Hunters\u2019 Guild, he kept betraying how he saw her\u2014as a hunter, as a warrior. Shooting down below him, she dove then rose through the biting freshness of the air with hard, strong wingbeats. Her back and shoulder muscles protested the acrobatics, but she was having too much fun to worry\u2014she\u2019d pay for it in a few hours, no doubt about it, but for now, she felt free and protected in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone is watching?\u201d she asked, breathless from the exertion, once they were side by side once more.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But the darkness will conceal your identity for the moment.\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow, she knew, when light broke, the circus would begin. An angel-Made ... Even the oldest of vampires and the angels themselves found her a curiosity. She had no doubts about how the human population would react. \u201cCan\u2019t you do your scary thing and make them keep their distance?\u201d However, even as she spoke, she knew it wasn\u2019t the reaction of the general population that worried her.</p><p>Her father . . . No. She wouldn\u2019t think about Jeffrey. Not tonight.</p><p>As she forced away thoughts of the man who had repudiated her when she\u2019d been barely eighteen, Raphael swept out over the Hudson, dropping so hard and fast that she yelped before she could catch herself. The Archangel of New York was one hell of a flier\u2014he skimmed along the water until he could\u2019ve trailed his fingers in its rushing cold, before pulling himself up in a steep ascent. Showing off.</p><p>For her.</p><p>It made her heart lighten, her lips curve.</p><p>Dipping down to join him at a lower altitude, she watched the night winds whip that sleek ebony hair across his face, as if they could not resist touching him.</p><p>It will do no good.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fascinated by the almost cruel beauty of him, this male she dared call her lover, she\u2019d forgotten what she\u2019d asked him.</p><p>For me to scare them away\u2014you are not a woman to stay in seclusion.</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re right.\u201d Feeling her shoulder muscles begin to pull in ominous warning, she winced. \u201cI think I need to set down soon.\u201d Her body had been damaged in the fight against Lijuan. Not much\u2014and the injuries had healed, but the enforced rest period meant she\u2019d lost some of the muscle she\u2019d built up prior to the battle that had turned Beijing into a crater, its voice the silent cry of the dead.</p><p>We\u2019re almost home.</p><p>Concentrating on keeping herself going in a straight line, she realized he\u2019d shifted position so she was effectively riding his wake\u2014meaning she no longer had to make as much effort to hold herself aloft. Pride had her scrunching her face into a scowl, but contrasting with that was a deep warmth that came from knowing she was important, more than important, to Raphael.</p><p>And then she saw it, the sprawling mansion that was Raphael\u2019s clifftop home on the other side of the river. Though the land backed up against the Hudson, the place was hidden from casual view by a thick verge of trees. However, they were coming at it from above, and from up there it looked like a jewel set in the velvet darkness, warm golden light in every window\u2014turning into pulses of color where it hit the clean lines of the stained glass on one side of the building. The rose bushes weren\u2019t visible from this angle, but she knew they were there, their leaves luxuriant and glossy against the elegant white of the house, hundreds of buds ready to bloom in a profusion of color as the weather grew warmer.</p><p>She followed Raphael down as he landed in the yard, the light from the stained glass turning his wings into a kaleidoscope of wild blue, crystalline green, and ruby red. You could\u2019ve landed on one of the balconies, she said, too focused on ensuring a good landing to speak the words aloud.</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t disagree, waiting until she was on the ground beside him to say, \u201cI could have.\u201d Reaching out as she folded away her wings, he gripped her gently at the curve where her neck flowed into her shoulder, his fingers pressing into the sensitive inner seam of her right wing. \u201cBut then your lips would not have been so very close to mine.\u201d</p><p>Her toes curled as he tugged her forward, pleasure blooming in her stomach. \u201cNot here,\u201d she murmured, voice husky. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shock Jeeves.\u201d</p><p>Raphael kissed away her words with a slow thoroughness that had her forgetting all about his butler, her body warming with a slow, luscious sense of anticipation. Raphael.</p><p>You tremble, Elena. You are tired.</p><p>Never too tired for your touch. It terrified her how addicted she\u2019d become to him. The only thing that made it bearable was that his hunger, too, was a raw, near-violent craving.</p><p>A lick of storm against her senses before he drew back with a hotly sexual promise. Later. A slow, intimate stroke along the upper curve of her wing. I would take my time with you. His lips parted, his spoken words far less incendiary. \u201cMontgomery will like having you for his mistress, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, tried to breathe\u2014and heard the rapid tattoo of her heart against her ribs. Yeah, the archangel knew how to kiss. \u201cWhy?\u201d she finally managed to say, falling into step beside him as he walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re likely to get dirty and destroy your clothes on a regular basis.\u201d Raphael\u2019s humor was dry, his voice an exquisite caress in the night. \u201cIt is the same reason he likes it when Illium occasionally stays here. You both give him plenty to do.\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him, but her lips kicked up at the corners. \u201cIs Illium coming to join us?\u201d The blue-winged angel was part of Raphael\u2019s Seven, the vampires and angels who had given their loyalty to the Archangel of New York\u2014even to the extent of placing his life before their own. Illium was the only one of the Seven who saw her human heart not as a weakness, but as a gift. And in him, she saw a kind of innocence that had been lost in the other immortals.</p><p>The door opened at that moment to expose the beaming face of Raphael\u2019s butler. \u201cSire,\u201d he said in a plummy English accent she was certain could turn cold and intimidating on command. \u201cIt is good to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontgomery.\u201d Raphael placed a hand on the vampire\u2019s shoulder as he passed.</p><p>Elena smiled at the butler, delighted by him all over again. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cElena,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s mistress but my own.\u201d Then there was the fact that though he chose to work in the service of an archangel, Montgomery was a strong vampire, hundreds of years old.</p><p>The butler\u2019s spine went stiff as a board, his eyes shooting to Raphael\u2014who gave a languid smile. \u201cYou must not shock Montgomery so, Elena.\u201d Reaching out to take her hand, he tugged her to his side. \u201cPerhaps you will allow him to call you Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Elena looked up, certain the archangel was laughing. But his expression was clear, his lips set with their familiar sensual grace. \u201cUm, yes, okay.\u201d She nodded at Montgomery, then felt compelled to ask, \u201cWill that do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, Guild Hunter.\u201d He gave a small bow. \u201cI was not sure if you would wish a meal, Sire, but I have sent a small tray up to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be all for tonight, Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>As the butler whispered away, Elena looked with growing suspicion at a large Chinese vase in one corner of the hall, opposite the stained-glass wall beside the door. It was decorated with a pattern of sunflowers that seemed oddly familiar. Letting go of Raphael\u2019s hand, she stepped closer ... closer. Her eyes went wide. \u201cThis is mine!\u201d Given as a gift by an angel in China after Elena completed a particularly dangerous hunt, one that had taken her into the bowels of the Shanghai underworld.</p><p>Raphael touched his fingers to the small of her back, a searing brand. \u201cAll of your things are here.\u201d He waited until she looked up before saying, \u201cThey were moved to this house for safekeeping until your return.</p> <p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued when she remained silent, her throat a knot of emotion, \u201cit seems Montgomery could not help himself when it came to this vase. I\u2019m afraid he has a weakness for beautiful things and has been known to relocate an item if he feels it is not being accorded the proper appreciation. Once, he \u2018relocated\u2019 an ancient sculpture from the home of another archangel.\u201d</p><p>Elena stared down the corridor where the butler had disappeared in refined silence. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. He\u2019s too prim and proper.\u201d It was easier to say that, to focus on the humor, than to accept the tightness in her chest, the feelings locking up her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou would be surprised.\u201d Touching her lower back again, he nudged her down the hall and up a flight of stairs. \u201cCome, you can look at your belongings in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She dragged her feet at the top of the staircase. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Raphael measured her expression with those eyes no mortal would ever possess, a silent visual reminder that he had never been human, would never be anything close to mortal. \u201cSuch will.\u201d Leading her to a room that flowed off what she knew to be the master bedroom, he opened the door.</p> <p>Everything from her apartment lay neatly stacked, slipcovers over the furnishings, her knickknacks in boxes.</p><p>She froze on the doorstep, uncertain how she felt\u2014relief and anger and joy all battled for space inside of her. She\u2019d known she could never go back to the apartment that had been her haven and more, a furious rebuttal against her father\u2019s abandonment. The place wasn\u2019t built for a being with wings\u2014but the loss had hurt. So much.</p><p>Now ... \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His hand closed around her nape with no attempt to hide the possession inherent in the act. \u201cYou are mine, Elena. If you choose to sleep in another bed, I will simply pick you up and bring you home.\u201d</p><p>Arrogant words. But he was an archangel. And she\u2019d made a claim of her own. \u201cAs long as you remember that goes both ways.\u201d</p><p>Acknowledged, Guild Hunter. A kiss pressed to the curve of her shoulder, his fingers tightening on her nape just a fraction. Come to bed.</p> <p>Arousal kicked her hard, her body knowing full well what pleasure awaited her at those strong, lethal hands. \u201cSo we can talk knives and sheaths?\u201d</p><p>Sensual male laughter, another kiss, the caress of teeth. But he released his hold, watching in silence as she stepped into the room and lifted a slipcover to run her fingers over the delicately embroidered comforter on the bed that had been her own, then she moved to explore the vanity with its store of pretty glass bottles and brushes set tidily inside a small box. She felt like a child, wanting to reassure herself that everything was here, the need visceral enough to hurt.</p><p>As she gave in to the emotional hunger, her mind disgorged images of another homecoming, of the shock and humiliation that had burned her throat when she\u2019d found her things piled up like so much garbage on the street. Nothing would ever erase that hurt, the pain of the knowledge that that was exactly what she was to her father, but tonight, Raphael had crushed the memory under the weight of a far more powerful act.</p><p>She had no illusions about her archangel, knew he\u2019d done it in part precisely for the reason he\u2019d given her\u2014so she wouldn\u2019t be tempted to treat her apartment as a bolt-hole. But had that been his sole motivation, he could as easily have sent her stuff to the dump. Instead, every single piece had been packed with care and moved here. Some of it had been exposed to the elements when her window shattered that night, and yet now everything looked pristine, speaking of meticulous restoration.</p><p>Heart aching at the wonder of being so cherished, she said, \u201cWe can go now.\u201d She\u2019d come back later, decide what to do with everything. \u201cRaphael\u2014thank you.\u201d</p><p>The brush of his wing against her own was a silent tenderness as they entered the master suite. No one else ever saw this part of him, she thought, eyes on her archangel as he moved closer to the bed and began to strip without flicking on the lights. His shirt fell off his body, revealing that magnificent chest she\u2019d kissed her way across more than once. Suddenly, the overwhelming weight of her emotions was gone, buried under an avalanche of gut-wrenching need.</p><p>Raphael looked up at that moment, his gaze glittering with an earthy hunger that said he\u2019d sensed her arousal. Deciding to save the talking for later, she was raising her fingers to tug off her own top when rain\u2014no, hail\u2014hit the windows in staccato bullets that made her jump. She\u2019d have ignored it, except the hard little pellets of ice kept smashing into the glass over and over again. \u201cMust be a storm.\u201d Dropping her hands, she walked to one of the windows after glancing over to ensure the French doors to the balcony were secure.</p><p>Lighting flashed in vicious spikes in front of her as savage winds began to pound the house with unremitting fury, the hail turning to torrential rain between one blink and the next. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it come in this hard, this fast.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael walked to stand beside her, his naked upper body patterned with the image of the raindrops against the window. She looked up when he didn\u2019t say anything, saw the shadows that had turned his gaze turbulent in an unexpected reflection of the storm. \u201cWhat is it? What am I not seeing?\u201d Because that look in his eyes ...</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of recent weather patterns across the world?\u201d</p><p>Elena traced a raindrop with her gaze as it tunneled across the glass. \u201cI caught a weather update while we were at the Tower. The reporter said a tsunami had just hit the east coast of New Zealand, and that the floods in China are getting worse.\u201d Sri Lanka and the Maldives had apparently already been evacuated, but they were starting to run out of places to put people.</p><p>\u201cEarthquakes have been rocking Elijah\u2019s territory,\u201d Raphael told her, speaking of the South American archangel, \u201cand he fears that at least one major volcano is about to erupt. That is not all. Michaela tells me most of Europe is shuddering in the grip of an unseasonable ice storm so vicious, it threatens to kill thousands.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s shoulder muscles went stiff at the mention of the most beautiful\u2014and most venomous\u2014of archangels. \u201cThe Middle East, at least,\u201d she said, forcing herself to relax, \u201cseems to have escaped major catastrophe from what I saw on the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Favashi is helping Neha deal with the disasters in her region.\u201d</p><p>The Archangel of Persia and the Archangel of India, Elena knew, had worked together on previous occasions. And now, when Neha hated almost everyone else in the Cadre, she seemed to be able to tolerate Favashi\u2014perhaps because the other archangel was so much younger. \u201cIt means something, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, turning to place her hand on the wild heat of Raphael\u2019s chest, the shadowy raindrops whispering over her skin. \u201cAll this extreme weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a legend,\u201d Raphael murmured, his wings flaring out as he tugged her into the curve of his body\u2014as if he would protect her. \u201cThat mountains will shake and rivers overflow, while ice creeps across the world and fields drown in rain.\u201d He looked down her at, his eyes that impossible, inhuman chrome blue. \u201cAll this will come to pass ... when an Ancient awakens.\u201d</p><p>The chill in his tone raised every hair on her body.</p><p>2</p><p>Shaking off the bone-deep cold, she said, \u201cThe ones who Sleep?\u201d Raphael had told her about those of his race who were so old they grew weary of immortality. So they lay down and closed their eyes, falling into a deep slumber that would break only when something compelled them to consciousness.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A single word that held a thousand unsaid things.</p><p>She leaned deeper into him, sliding her arms around his waist. The backs of her hands brushed against the raw silk of his feathers, and it was a quiet, stunning intimacy between an archangel and a hunter. \u201cThis kind of a disruption can\u2019t happen every time. There must be a few who Sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice grew distant in a way that was the mask of an immortal who\u2019d lived centuries beyond a millennium. \u201cWhat we may be witnessing is the rebirth of an archangel.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, understanding flickering at the corners of her mind. \u201cHow many archangels Sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows, but there have been disappearances throughout our history. Antonicus, Qin, Zanaya. And . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane,\u201d she completed for him, shifting so that she could see his face without craning her neck. He was so good at hiding his emotions, her archangel, but she was learning to read the minute shifts in those eyes that had seen more dawns than she could ever imagine, witnessed the birth and fall of civilizations.</p><p>Now, her back against the glassy cold of the window, she didn\u2019t protest as he leaned in to place one hand palm-down beside her head. Instead, she ran her fingers down the muscled planes of his chest to rest at his hips, anchoring him to the present, to her as she asked him about a nightmare. \u201cWill you know if your mother wakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a child\u201d\u2014skin touched with heat, but his eyes, they remained that inhuman metallic shade\u2014\u201cwe had a mental bond. But it burned away as I grew, and as she fell into madness.\u201d His gaze looked past her, to the pitch-black of the night.</p><p>Elena was used to fighting for what she needed, what she wanted. She\u2019d had to become that way to survive. It had toughened her. But what she felt for this male, this archangel, it was a stronger, more powerful need, one that gave her an insight the hunter alone would\u2019ve never had. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>A silent glance rimmed with a thin frost made up of the myriad dark echoes that lingered in an archangel\u2019s memories.</p><p>\u201cIf you let the memory of her spoil this,\u201d she said, refusing to back down, \u201cspoil us, then it doesn\u2019t matter if she is the Sleeper. The damage will have been done\u2014by you.\u201d</p><p>A long, still instant, but his attention was very much on her now. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, his wings spreading out to block the rest of the room from her view, \u201cmanipulate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take care of you,\u201d she corrected. \u201cJust like you took care of me by not letting me answer my father\u2019s call earlier today.\u201d At the time, she\u2019d gotten snippy\u2014because she\u2019d been afraid. And she hated being afraid. Especially of the hurt that Jeffrey Deveraux meted out with such cruel ease. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal, so learn to handle it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael brushed his thumb across her cheekbone. \u201cIf I do not?\u201d A cool question.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to pick a fight with me.\u201d She knew what haunted him\u2014that his parents\u2019 madnesses would one day manifest in his own mind, turning him monstrous. Except Elena would never allow that to happen. \u201cWe fall, we fall together.\u201d A soft reminder, a solemn promise.</p><p>Elena. One hand going down to curve around her ribs, just below her breasts, as he moved his other thumb over her lips, shaping and stroking her.</p><p>\u201cIf your mother does wake,\u201d she murmured, her top suddenly abrasive against her nipples, \u201cwhat will happen to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome say a long Sleep cures the madness of age, so she could once more become Cadre.\u201d Yet Raphael\u2019s voice said that he didn\u2019t believe such a thing possible.</p><p>\u201cWill the others on the Cadre try to locate her, kill her beforehand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who Sleep are sacrosanct,\u201d Raphael told her. \u201cTo harm a Sleeper is to break a law so ancient, it is part of our racial memory. But there is no law that bars a search.\u201d</p><p>She knew without asking that he\u2019d be undertaking such a search, could only hope what he discovered wasn\u2019t a nightmare made flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Jason,\u201d he added, \u201csee if he has heard any rumblings on this subject that I have not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he healed?\u201d Raphael\u2019s spymaster had been injured in the same violent explosion of power that had leveled a city and smashed Elena to the earth. \u201cIs Aodhan?\u201d Both angels had refused to leave her and fly to safety, though they were far stronger and faster. Even as they fell to the unforgiving earth, the two males had attempted to shield her body with their own.</p><p>\u201cIf you are,\u201d Raphael said, stroking his hand down to rest at her waist, \u201cthen of course they walk without injury.\u201d</p><p>Because she was an immortal new-Made, while Jason was hundreds of years old. Aodhan, she wasn\u2019t sure about\u2014he was so very other, it was hard to judge\u2014but the fact that he was one of Raphael\u2019s Seven spoke for itself. \u201cBeijing . . . are there any signs of recovery?\u201d The city had ceased to exist in anything but memory after the events of that bloody night, so many dead that Elena couldn\u2019t think about it without a sense of crushing weight on her chest, heavy and black and flavored with the taste of old death.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An absolute statement. \u201cIt may take centuries for life to take root there once more.\u201d</p><p>The punishing might of power implied by that observation was staggering. It made her viscerally aware of the strength of the man who held her in an embrace she\u2019d never be able to break if he decided to keep her prisoner. It should\u2019ve scared her. But if there was one thing she knew, it was that with Raphael, any fight would be no-holds-barred. There would be no stilettos in the dark, no hurtful blades hidden behind a civilized facade ... unlike the cutting words of another man who\u2019d once claimed to love her.</p><p>Her soul pinched in hurt. \u201cI can\u2019t avoid my father forever,\u201d she said, leaning back against the window again, the cold of the glass almost painful against her wings. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll say when he sees me?\u201d As far as Jeffrey knew, Raphael had saved her broken and dying body by Making her a vampire.</p> <p>Raphael gripped his hunter\u2019s jaw with one hand, placing the other beside her head. \u201cHe will see you as an opportunity.\u201d Honest words, for he would not lie to her. \u201cA way to gain entry into the corridors of angelic power.\u201d If Raphael had his way, Jeffrey Deveraux would even now be rotting in a forgotten grave, but Elena loved her father in spite of his cruelty.</p><p>Now, she wrapped her arms around herself, and her words, when they came, were jagged pieces of pain. \u201cI knew that before I asked . . . but part of me can\u2019t help hoping that maybe this time, he\u2019ll love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I can\u2019t help hoping that my mother will rise, and will once again be the woman who sang me such lullabies that the world stood still.\u201d Pulling her into a crushing embrace, he pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cWe are both fools.\u201d</p><p>Thunder crashed at that moment, lightning flashing brilliant in the dark gloom of the world beyond the windowpane. It turned Elena\u2019s hair to glittering silver, her eyes to mercury. Those eyes, he thought as he lowered his head, as he took her lips, would change over the centuries, until they might very well become what they appeared under storm-light. Come, Guild Hunter. It is late.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d An intimate murmur against his lips. \u201cI\u2019m so cold.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, moving one hand down to close over her breast. Then he took them into the heart of a tempest far more demanding in its wrenching hunger than the winds that raged outside.</p><p>The nightmare came again that night. She should\u2019ve expected it, but it pulled her into the bloody ruins of what had once been her family home with such speed that she had no chance to fight.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She closed her eyes in childlike defiance.</p> <p>But the dream forced them open. What she saw made her freeze, her pulse pounding beat after panicked beat at the back of her throat.</p><p>There were no broken bodies on the floor slicked by a dark, dark red. Blood. Everywhere she looked, there was blood. More blood than she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>That was when she realized she wasn\u2019t in the kitchen where Ari and Belle had been murdered after all. She was in the kitchen of the Big House, the house her father had bought after her sisters . . . After. Gleaming pots hung on hooks above a long stone bench, while a massive fridge stood humming quietly in the corner. The stove was a shiny steel edifice that had always terrified her into keeping her distance.</p><p>Tonight, however, that steel was dulled with a rust-red coating that made her gorge rise, made her stumble to look away. At the knives. They lay everywhere. On the floor, on the counters, in the walls. All dripping thick, heavy gobs of deepest red . . . and other, fleshier things. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Clutching her arms around herself, her thin, fragile body that of a child, she skittered her gaze across the nightmare room in search of a safe harbor.</p><p>The blood, the knives had vanished.</p><p>The kitchen lay pristine once more. And cold. So cold. Always so cold in the Big House, no matter how much she cranked up the heat.</p><p>A shift in the dream\u2014she\u2019d been wrong, she thought. This cold place wasn\u2019t pristine after all. There was a single high-heeled shoe on the dazzling white of the tile.</p><p>Then she saw the shadow on the wall, swinging to and fro.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d Hands gripping her upper arms tight, the clean bright scent of the sea in her mind. \u201cGuild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The snapped words cut through the remnants of the dream, wrenching her back into the present. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d The words came out jerky, disconnected. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms when she would\u2019ve jumped out of bed. To do what, she didn\u2019t know, but sleep never came easy after the memories hit her with such brutal force. \u201cI need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shifted until she was half under him, his wings rising to encase them in lush, dark privacy. \u201cHush, hbeebti.\u201d His body, heavy on her own, formed a hard shield against the softly swinging shadow that had chased her across time.</p><p>When he dropped his head and murmured more quiet, passionate words in the language that was part of her mother\u2019s legacy, she lifted her arms and wrapped them around his neck, trying to pull him down. Trying to drown herself in him. But he squeezed her thigh and raised himself up on one arm so he could look down at her. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Elena had always made sure to hug Beth after the day their family shattered, to ensure her younger sister didn\u2019t ever feel the chill, but she\u2019d never had anyone to hold her in turn, never had anyone to smash apart the block of ice that encased her organs for hours after a nightmare. So, the words took time to come, but he was an immortal. Patience was a lesson he\u2019d learned long ago.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said at last, her voice raw\u2014as if she\u2019d been screaming. \u201cNone of it made sense.\u201d Her mother hadn\u2019t done what she had in the kitchen. No, Marguerite Deveraux had very carefully tied the rope to the strong railing that went around the mezzanine. Her pretty, shiny high heel had dropped onto the gleaming checkerboard tile of the hallway that was the grand entrance to the Big House.</p><p>A glossy cherry red, that shoe had made Elena\u2019s heart fill with hope for a fractured second. She\u2019d thought her mother had finally come back to them, finally stopped crying ... finally stopped screaming. Then she\u2019d looked up. Seen something that could never be erased from the wall of her mind. \u201cIt was all just a big jumble.\u201d</p><p>Raphael said nothing, but she had not a single doubt that she was the complete and total center of his attention.</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d she said, clenching her hands on his shoulders, \u201cthat the nightmares would stop after I killed Slater. He\u2019ll never again hurt anyone I love. Why won\u2019t they stop?\u201d It came out shaky, not with fear, but with a tight, helpless rage.</p><p>\u201cOur memories make us, Elena,\u201d Raphael answered, in an echo of something she\u2019d once said to him. \u201cEven the darkest of them all.\u201d</p><p>Hand splayed out on his chest, she listened to the beat of his heart, strong, steady, always. \u201cI won\u2019t ever forget,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I wish they\u2019d stop haunting me.\u201d It made her feel like a traitor to say those words, to dare to wish for such a thing when Ari and Belle had lived the nightmare. When her mother had been unable to escape it.</p><p>\u201cThey will.\u201d Knowledge in his tone. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>And because he\u2019d never broken a promise to her, she let him hold her through what remained of the night. Dawn was pushing its way into the room on slender fingers of gold and pink when the sweet nothingness of sleep took her under.</p><p>But the peace only lasted for what felt like a mere blink of time.</p><p>Elena. A wave crashing into her head, a fresh bite of storm.</p><p>Groggy with sleep, she blinked open her eyes to see that she was alone in the sun-kissed bed, the rain having cleared away to leave the sky beyond the windows a startling azure. \u201cRaphael.\u201d A glance at the bedside clock showed her it was midmorning. Rubbing at her eyes, she sat up. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Something has occurred that requires your skill.</p><p>Her senses stretched awake in anticipation, her mental muscles seeming to pop with the same pleasure-pain as her physical ones when she lifted her arms and arched her body. Where do you need me?</p><p>A school upstate. It is named the Eleanor Vand\u2014</p><p>She dropped her arms, abdomen heavy with dread. I know</p><p>what it\u2019s called. My sisters go there.</p><p>3</p><p>Ten-year-old Evelyn saw Elena first. Evelyn\u2019s eyes went wide as Elena said good-bye to the angel who\u2019d escorted her to the location via the quickest route, and flared out her wings to come to a steady landing in the front yard of the tony prep school, the velvet green perfection marred only by a number of errant leaves. Miniature twisters of spring green and crisp brown, small dervishes full of irritation, rose up in the wind created by her descent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Folding away her wings, Elena gave her youngest half sister a nod of acknowledgment. Evelyn went to raise a hand in a tentative hello, but Amethyst, three years older than her sister, grabbed that hand to pull Evelyn to her side. Her dark blue eyes, so like her mother, Gwendolyn\u2019s, warned Elena to keep her distance.</p><p>Elena understood the reaction.</p><p>Jeffrey and Elena hadn\u2019t spoken for a decade after he threw her out\u2014until just before the violent events that had led to her waking with wings of midnight and dawn. And prior to being disowned, Elena had been banished to boarding school for some time. As a result, she\u2019d had no real contact with either of her half siblings. She knew of them, as they knew of her, but beyond that, they might as well have been strangers.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a surface resemblance to compel the recognition of familial ties\u2014unlike Elena\u2019s pale, near-white hair and skin touched with the sunset of Morocco, not to mention her height, the girls had their mother\u2019s exquisite raven hair and petite build, their skin a rich cream that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place on an English rose. Evelyn still carried a layer of baby fat, but her bones were Gwendolyn\u2019s, delicate and aristocratic.</p> <p>Both of Jeffrey\u2019s wives had left their marks on his children.</p><p>Looking away from the two small faces that watched her with a combination of wariness and a tight, cool accusation, she took in the rest of the people on the porch. Several other girls clustered together just beyond Evelyn and Amethyst, all dressed in the maroon and white of the school, along with a number of adults who had to be teachers. Nowhere did Elena see any sign of Raphael, which meant he was either inside the heavy building of cream-colored brick or behind its ivy-covered walls in the large inner courtyard where the girls ate lunch, sat on the grass, played games.</p><p>Elena knew that because she\u2019d made it a point to find out. It didn\u2019t matter that the three of them were only connected by the frigid ties of Jeffrey\u2019s blood\u2014Evelyn and Amethyst were still her sisters, still hers to watch over. If they ever needed her, she would be there ... as she hadn\u2019t been able to be there for Ari and Belle.</p><p>Heart encircled by a thousand shards of metal, each a stabbing blade, she began to head for the entrance. That was when she saw Evelyn shake off her older sister\u2019s hold and run down the front steps toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Rocking back on her heels at the challenge in that small, rebellious face, in those bunched fists, Elena said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>An instant of searing eye contact, gray to gray, and Elena had the feeling she was being sized up. \u201cDo you want to know what happened?\u201d Evelyn asked at last.</p><p>Elena frowned, glanced at the porch\u2014to see no one else making a move to come forward, the adults appearing as shell-shocked as the majority of the girls. Returning her attention to her sister, she fought the urge to touch her, hold her close. \u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was awful.\u201d A whisper, nothing but horror on that soft face that was of a child\u2019s yet, not of the woman she would one day become. \u201cI went into the dorm and there was blood everywhere and Celia wasn\u2019t there even though we were supposed to meet. And I can\u2019t find Bets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou discovered this?\u201d Feral protectiveness bared its teeth. No, she thought, no. The monsters wouldn\u2019t steal another one of her sisters from her. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Her gut knotted, bile rising in her throat.</p><p>\u201cNothing after that,\u201d Evelyn confessed, and the relief threatened to send Elena to her knees. \u201cMrs. Hill heard me scream, and she dragged me out the door almost straightaway. Then they made us all stand out here, and I heard wings ... but I didn\u2019t see your archangel.\u201d</p><p>At that instant, Elena glimpsed a shrewdness in those gray eyes that reminded her of Jeffrey\u2019s. It caused a painful twisting in her chest\u2014because she, too, was her father\u2019s daughter, at least in some part of her soul. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of things,\u201d she promised. \u201cBut I need you to go back up and stay with Amethyst until I figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d It could only be a vampire gone rogue if Raphael had called for her.</p> <p>Evelyn turned and ran back up to the porch, sidling up to her older sister\u2019s stiff form.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>For an instant, the only thing she heard was infinite silence. No deep voice laced with the arrogance of more than a thousand years of living. No rush of the wind, the rain in her head. Then it thundered, until she almost staggered under the unleashed power of it. Of him.</p><p>Fly over the first building and\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t. I landed already. She wasn\u2019t yet strong enough to achieve a vertical takeoff, something that required not only considerable muscle strength, but a great deal of skill.</p><p>Come in through the front door. You will find your way.</p><p>His certainty\u2014knowing the only thing that could\u2019ve caused it\u2014made her stomach clench, her spine go stiff. It took conscious effort to sweep aside the sensations and narrow her focus to the upcoming hunt. Contracting her wings as close to her back as possible so they wouldn\u2019t inadvertently brush against those huddled on the porch, she walked up the stairs and across aged but solid brick identical to that of the building itself.</p><p>Whispers surrounded her on every side.</p> <p>\u201cThought she was dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014vampire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know they Made angels!\u201d</p><p>Then came the secretive clicks that announced cell phone cameras in operation. Those pictures would hit the Web in minutes if not seconds, and the news media wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pounce the instant after that. \u201cWell,\u201d she muttered under her breath, \u201cat least that takes care of announcing my presence.\u201d Now all she\u2019d have to deal with was the media scrum that was sure to hit like a freaking tornado.</p><p>Whispers of iron in the air.</p><p>She jerked up her head, her senses honing in on that thread that spoke of blood and violence. Following it, she made her way down the deserted hallway carpeted in burgundy, its walls lined with class photographs spanning decades past, the students starched and pressed, and to a staircase that curved sinuously up from her left.</p><p>In spite of the fact that the building was old, its bones heavy, the corridor was filled with light. She saw the reason why when she stopped on the first step, glanced up\u2014a magnificent glass skylight, domed and gilded with gold, and caressed by a few errant strands of ivy. The leaves looked like emeralds scattered against the glass. But that wasn\u2019t what caught her attention.</p><p>Iron again, so rich and potent and thick that it sighed of only one thing.</p><p>Death.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Elena turned to find herself facing a skeletal-thin woman garbed in an elegant suit that straddled the border between pale olive and deep gray. The color appeared almost harsh against skin of a pale, papery white. \u201cI\u2019m Adrienne Liscombe, the principal,\u201d the stranger said at Elena\u2019s questioning look. \u201cI was checking to make sure all the girls got out.\u201d</p><p>Having noticed the signs on the doors that opened off the right side of the corridor, Elena said, \u201cThis is the office building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis floor,\u201d Ms. Liscombe said, her words crisp, correct. \u201cThe second floor houses the library and work spaces for the girls. Above that are a number of dorm rooms, with further facilities on the fourth floor. We function as a home to many of our students\u2014and the staff offices are set up as studies since a significant proportion of us also live in. A girl can come down from her room at any stage to talk to a member of the staff.\u201d</p><p>Elena realized that notwithstanding her clear-cut enunciation, her immaculate suit, and her precise gold jewelry, the principal was rambling. Gut-wrenchingly conscious of what might have reduced a woman who gave every indication of having an almost austere toughness of spirit to such a state, she said, \u201cThank you, Ms. Liscombe.\u201d Drowning as she was in the acrid scent of blood\u2014and of thicker, more viscous fluids\u2014it took conscious effort to make her voice gentle. \u201cI think the girls could use your guidance outside.\u201d</p><p>A sharp nod, light glinting off the sleek silver of her hair. \u201cYes, yes, I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d The question had to be asked. \u201cHow many of your pupils are unaccounted for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA full roll call hasn\u2019t yet been taken. I\u2019ll do it now.\u201d Shoulders being squared, professional calm reasserting itself in response to the concrete task. \u201cSome of the girls are away on a field trip, and we have the usual number of absences, so I\u2019ll have to cross-check the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease get it to us as soon as you\u2019re able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A pause. \u201cCelia . . . she should be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Walking up the varnished wooden stairs that spoke of another time to the muted sounds of the principal\u2019s retreating footsteps, Elena reminded herself to keep her wings raised. It wasn\u2019t quite second nature yet, but she was far more adept at it than when she\u2019d first awakened. Her original motivation had come from not wanting to have them dragging through the dust and dirt of Manhattan\u2019s streets.</p><p>Today, she needed the reminder for a far more sinister reason.</p><p>Entering the third-floor hallway, she ignored the exquisite oil paintings that spoke of money and class to follow the stench of iron and fear to the room at the very end, a room that held an archangel with eyes of pitiless blue. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>She halted, tried to breathe. The cloying richness of the smell threatened to choke her as she took in the blood-drenched sheets, the pool of dark liquid edged with red on the floor, splattered on the walls, the most unspeakable graffiti. \u201cWhere\u2019s the body?\u201d Because there would be a body. A human being couldn\u2019t lose this much blood and survive.</p><p>\u201cIn the woods,\u201d he said in a tone that made the hairs on the back of her neck rise, it was so very, very, very calm. \u201cHe dragged her there to feast on her, though he spilled most of her blood here.\u201d</p><p>Elena stiffened her spine against the flood of pity. It would do no good to Celia now\u2014and would get in the way of what Elena could do, the justice she could help attain. \u201cWhy did you ask me to come inside?\u201d If she was to track the vampire, her best bet would be to begin at his last known position.</p><p>\u201cThe body was discovered floating in a small pond. It\u2019s likely he bathed in it before he left.\u201d</p><p>Elena jerked up her head. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me he\u2019s thinking ?\u201d Because water was the sole factor that could confuse the bloodhound senses of the hunter-born. Vampires caught in the grip of bloodlust\u2014the only thing that could explain the savagery of this attack\u2014did not think. They rampaged with unstoppable violence, were most often caught while they gorged on the blood of their victims. \u201cIs it\u201d\u2014another Uram? she finished, conscious that the darkest of angelic secrets could not be spoken aloud, not here.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Raphael\u2019s voice was, if possible, even more gentle.</p><p>Cruelty wrapped in velvet, she thought. He was riding the razor\u2019s edge of rage.</p><p>\u201cFind his scent, Elena. This is the place where it will be strongest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was right. Anything she got near the pond would be diluted. Here, he\u2019d killed, perhaps shed some of his own blood if the victim had been able to claw at him as she fought for her life. Taking a deep breath, Elena shut out everything\u2014including the icy knowledge that this could have been one of her sisters\u2014and focused on the rich strokes of scent that saturated the room.</p><p>The easiest to identify was Raphael, her anchor.</p><p>Then the metallic kiss of blood. And ... a stormy scent licked with fire.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. \u201cJason was here?\u201d Her ability to track angels continued to be wildly erratic, more often off than on, but she knew that combination of notes, knew also that it was rare for the black-winged angel to make a daylight appearance.</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>Chilled by the way Raphael stared unblinking at the pool of blood, she pushed aside the question of why Raphael\u2019s spymaster had passed through here\u2014why, indeed, the Archangel of New York was on a scene that should\u2019ve been filled with cops and hunters\u2014and focused her senses once more. It was startling, what little effort it took to isolate the vampiric thread. Unlike most places in the state, this school was apparently free of vampiric employees, a humans-only zone.</p><p>No wonder Jeffrey had chosen it for his daughters.</p><p>But one vampire had invaded this sanctum, a vampire with a sickly sweet edge to his smell.</p><p>Burnt treacle . . . and slivers of glass, heavier notes of oak underneath.</p> <p>Tugging on that thread, she angled her head toward the window. \u201cThat\u2019s how he got out.\u201d But she left the room through the door, knowing she\u2019d never be able to squeeze out the same way, given her wings. She was aware of Raphael at her back as she found an exit and stepped outside, rounding ivy-covered walls until she stood below the window.</p><p>That particular section of wall was clear of the dark green vine. \u201cPlace has high ceilings.\u201d Which, since the room was on the third floor, equaled the window being a considerable distance off the ground. \u201cHow did he get up?\u201d Most vamps wouldn\u2019t have been able to jump that high. However ... She pressed her nose to the wall, drew in a breath.</p><p>Crushed glass, oak leaves.</p><p>Then she saw the streak of red by where she\u2019d placed her right hand, palm-down.</p><p>Dropping it, she looked around her feet as she spoke. \u201cHe climbed up and down like a fucking spider.\u201d There was only a subset of vampires who could pull off that particular trick. \u201cShould help narrow down his identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Ignatius,\u201d Raphael said to her surprise\u2014just as she glimpsed droplets of dark liquid on the grass. \u201cI felt his mind turn bloodred when I touched it.\u201d</p> <p>Elena wasn\u2019t sure of Raphael\u2019s range, but if he\u2019d touched Ignatius\u2019s mind, then there was something wrong here. \u201cYou weren\u2019t able to execute him.\u201d She followed the trail across the manicured green of the inner lawn, through the heavy archway carved out in the middle of the long school building at the other end, and into the woods that normally provided a serene backdrop\u2014but today seemed an ominous mass, the leaves dull beneath a sky that had shifted from azure to dirty gray in the minutes she\u2019d been inside.</p><p>Not answering her implied question, Raphael rose into the air as she tracked Ignatius through the woods, her wings catching on branches and thorny bushes. Wincing at the uncomfortable sensations, she tucked them even tighter to her body but didn\u2019t slow her progress through the trees. She hesitated at one point, certain she felt the tug of something to her right, but the trail of oak and glass was vivid straight ahead.</p><p>Shaking off the impulse to turn, explore, she continued the track. Jason\u2019s black-winged form appeared out of the looming dark of the woods less than five minutes later\u2014he stood unmoving as stone, guarding a body that lay beside the placid waters of a small pond.</p><p>The girl was still wearing her school uniform, her entire frame soaked. Her blouse should\u2019ve been white. It was a nauseating salmon pink, and shredded as Elena knew her flesh would\u2019ve been shredded. Strangling the pity that threatened to derail her, Elena didn\u2019t move toward the body\u2014her priority was to track the killer, to make certain no other girl would end up a broken doll beside a pond that should\u2019ve been a place of play, not a macabre bath flavored with death and horror.</p><p>You were right, she sent to Raphael, he washed in the pond, cut off the scent trail. But he would have had to get out at some point. So, leaving Jason to continue his silent vigil, she began walking across the moss-laden stones that rimmed the water gone murky with churned up silt ... and other, darker things.</p><p>It only took a minute to find him again. The scent trail was weaker, drenched in water until the oak alone remained, but that was all she needed. Drawing the crisp forest air into her lungs, she began to run, determined to hunt the vampire to ground. He was fast, she realized almost at once, glimpsing the tracks he\u2019d left behind in the damp patches of earth caused by last night\u2019s storm. In contrast, she was no longer as quick and agile as she\u2019d once been, unused to running with wings.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a disadvantage, not today. The vampire had slowed down maybe five hundred yards into his escape, probably figuring the water had erased his scent. It would have if he\u2019d taken a bit more care. Then again, Raphael had said the girl\u2019s body had been in the water, too. Her murderer had likely dragged her in there with him because he couldn\u2019t stop feeding.</p><p>The end result was that given the small size of the pond, the blood and death had polluted it, destroying its ability to wash the vampire clean of his sickening acts of violence. Good girl, she thought, speaking to the child who lay so motionless under wings of midnight black. You marked the bastard even in death. Elena would hunt him down using that mark.</p> <p>Half an hour into the run\u2014through twisting paths that tried to muddy the trail and confirmed the vampire was rational\u2014the sun weak and sluggish overhead, she began to feel a stitch in her side. \u201cDamn it.\u201d She didn\u2019t need Raphael\u2019s sadist of a weapons-master, Galen, to pound at her to know she wasn\u2019t in full hunting shape.</p><p>Breathing past the stabbing pain, she snapped up her head as the shadow of wings swept along the ground in front of her\u2014to see Raphael flying to a location just beyond the rise, his speed breathtaking.</p><p>Archangel, what do you see?</p><p>4</p><p>There was no answer, only the painful bite of ice in her veins.</p><p>Rage.</p><p>Pure and violent and cold, so cold.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She pushed up her pace, cursing the fact that she couldn\u2019t do a vertical takeoff for the billionth time. It could take years to master, she\u2019d been told\u2014perhaps longer seeing as she hadn\u2019t had wings since childhood. Well, fuck it, she thought. If she had to ask Galen to come to New York to torture her again every single day for the next year, she was going to learn.</p><p>Raphael dived in front of her and by the time she crested the rise, her chest heaving, he had his hand clamped around the neck of a vampire whose clothing remained damp enough to stick to his skin. The Archangel of New York was holding the panicked creature at least two feet off the ground with no visible effort. The vampire\u2019s eyes bulged, blood vessels popping as he scrabbled at the hand around his throat, his legs kicking at the air in a futile attempt to escape.</p><p>\u201cYou are not in bloodlust,\u201d she heard Raphael say in a voice so clear, it was a blade, slicing and brutalizing without mercy.</p><p>Instinct, paired with what she\u2019d learned of Raphael in the time they\u2019d been together, had a very bad feeling forming in the pit of her stomach. Scrambling down the rise without caring about the mud that streaked her jeans and wings both, she looked into the vampire\u2019s face. The male\u2019s reddened eyes were lucid . . . but for the terror in their depths. His mouth was another matter. Rimmed with dried blood that had survived his impromptu bath, it turned his face into a grotesque mask.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Elena asked, knives in hand though she had no memory of drawing them from the sheaths strapped to her forearms. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d The image of the girl\u2019s ravaged body played over and over on the screen of her mind. That could\u2019ve been Evelyn, could\u2019ve been Amethyst. Her sisters. Again. The thought echoed until it was almost all she could hear.</p><p>Raphael began to squeeze the vampire\u2019s throat. \u201cIt matters little why.\u201d Blood trickled from one of the vampire\u2019s eyes, a macabre tear.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She put her hand on the corded strength of Raphael\u2019s forearm. \u201cYour vampires don\u2019t disobey you. Not like this.\u201d They were too aware of the brutal justice of his punishments. The fact that this Ignatius had done what he had in spite of that ...</p><p>The vampire began to claw at Raphael\u2019s hand with the last of his strength, as if conscious that after crushing his throat, the Archangel of New York would almost certainly rip off his head and have his entire body burned. Raphael shook off the clawing hands as if they were less than flies, his expression so calm it was terrifying.</p><p>Raphael, she tried again, using their mental connection in the hope it would penetrate the ice that was his rage. We need to know why.</p><p>Raphael glanced at her. \u201cAll right.\u201d And before her horrified eyes, the vampire began to bleed . . . everywhere, his very pores seeming to erupt under extreme pressure. She knew what Raphael had done, knew he\u2019d shredded the killer\u2019s mind like so much confetti. That task complete, he tore off the vampire\u2019s head with a single efficient wrench and burned both pieces to ash with the vivid blue of angelfire. The pulse of raw power could kill an archangel\u2014the vampire\u2019s body didn\u2019t even survive a full second.</p><p>It all happened so fast that she was still staring at the place where the vampire had been when Raphael turned to her, a slight glow to his wings that augured nothing good. The primal part of her brain, more animal than human in its determination to survive, fired a surge of fear-laced adrenaline through her system. Run, it said, run! Because when an archangel glowed, people died.</p><p>But Raphael wasn\u2019t simply an archangel. He was hers.</p><p>She stood her ground as he stepped closer, bent to speak with his mouth brushing her ear. \u201cSomeone whispered to him that I was dead\u201d\u2014cool tone, quiet words that made her nerves skitter\u2014\u201cthat there was no longer any need for him to leash his desires.\u201d Moving back a step, he lifted a finger to tuck a flyaway strand of her hair behind her ear.</p><p>The gentleness of the act didn\u2019t reassure her\u2014not when his anger kissed a knife blade against her throat. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d It took effort to keep her voice steady\u2014yes, he was hers, but she\u2019d only scratched the surface of him. \u201cEven if he did think that, why come here, to this place?\u201d She wasn\u2019t egotistical enough to think it had anything to do with her. No, Raphael was the target, but she was the weak point in his defenses. \u201cIt\u2019s too far out of the city to be anything but a specific location.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes shone with that dangerous metallic tinge, a look to him she couldn\u2019t read. He\u2019d been alive for over a thousand years and had so many facets to his personality that she knew it would take an eternity to see them all. Right now, it was obvious that reasoning with him would be akin to banging her head against thousands of rapier-sharp blades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It would only make her bleed.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she gestured back to where she\u2019d seen Jason. \u201cI need to examine the body, make sure there wasn\u2019t anything weird about the kill.\u201d It appeared to have been a simple feeding gone feral, but after the past year and a half, she wasn\u2019t much on taking things at face value.</p><p>Raphael flared out his wings, their glow painful in the dull, cloudy light. \u201cYou can report back to me later today. Dmitri is almost here\u2014he\u2019ll deal with the school.\u201d</p><p>He was gone in a sweep of wind an instant later, leaving her staring up at him. She didn\u2019t mind the order\u2014he was her lover, but at this moment, she was acting as a hunter and he\u2019d treated her as one. Since she had no intention of giving up her position with the Guild, that worked for her.</p> <p>What worried her was the distance he\u2019d put between them, a distance that had returned her to the rooftop where they\u2019d first met, when Raphael hadn\u2019t been a man who wore her claim of amber, but only an immortal who could crush her with a single thought. An immortal who\u2019d made her close her hand over the cutting edge of steel, until her blood spilled dark and wet onto the tiles.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going back to that, Archangel,\u201d she murmured, hand clenching in sensory memory. \u201cIf you think we are, you\u2019re going to get one hell of a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Turning on her heel, she made her way back to Jason through the leaf-littered ground, the wooded area eerie in its silence. It was as if the birds themselves were mourning the loss of a young, vibrant life. Anger was a fist in her throat by the time she reached the body\u2014it didn\u2019t matter that the monster who\u2019d stolen Celia\u2019s young life had been executed, justice done. She was still dead, her dreams forever ended.</p><p>Jason stood in the same position where she\u2019d last seen him, a stone guardian, and now that Elena knew to look for it, she was able to make out the pommel of the black sword he wore strapped to his back, hidden against the sooty black of his wings. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d she said, trying to distance herself from what she had to do next.</p><p>Jason stepped back to allow her closer to the body. The move threw the tribal tattoo on the left-hand side of his face momentarily into the light before he angled his head toward the shadows he wore like a cloak once more, until even though his hair was pulled off his face in a neat queue, she could only just glean his eyes. \u201cI was meeting with the Sire when the message came through.\u201d</p> <p>Kneeling beside Celia\u2019s body, her wings pressed against pine needles and innumerable crushed leaves that scented the air in a green perfume soaked with last night\u2019s rain, Elena frowned. \u201cWhy did it come to the Tower? It should\u2019ve been directed to the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Guild Director herself called Raphael when she realized your sisters might be involved.\u201d Jason\u2019s tone was calm, so calm she\u2019d have thought him unaffected if she hadn\u2019t seen the black flames in his eyes before he used the shadows to his advantage. \u201cWe were able to get here faster than any of the hunters who might\u2019ve been called.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Sara. With that, Elena put everything else aside. Celia deserved her full attention. \u201cYou pulled her out of the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I thought I glimpsed a sign of life.\u201d</p><p>But the young girl was gone, her face holding the horror of her last moments on this earth. Her skin might\u2019ve been a vibrant caramel shade in life, but in death, it was a dull gray brown, the blood that pumped through her veins having spilled out of the ripped and torn flesh of her neck, her chest.</p><p>\u201cHas the M.E. been called?\u201d Since hunters were often the first people to find a vampire\u2019s victim or victims, they were trained in basic crime-scene protocols during their years at Guild Academy and authorized to inspect bodies\u2014but it was always a good political measure for the Guild to keep the authorities in the loop.</p> <p>\u201cThe Guild Director stated she would take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Leaning in, she examined the neck, trying to see only the pieces, not the whole. Not Celia, the girl who had been, but simply the brutalized flesh of a neck. And lower down, the ground meat of a chest that was still as flat as a boy\u2019s. \u201cHe was feeding in a frenzy,\u201d she murmured, \u201ctore through her skin, ripped it up badly enough that he exposed bone.\u201d Nothing unusual there, except that Ignatius hadn\u2019t been in bloodlust. \u201cDo you know why he\u2019d feed like this if he was lucid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost vampires are neat.\u201d Jason\u2019s wings rustled slightly as he resettled them, and the sound was a welcome reminder that the painful silence of these woods wasn\u2019t the only reality. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of pride\u2014tearing up a body not only denotes lack of control, it means a vampire loses his or her willing partners very fast. Pain isn\u2019t why most humans take a vampiric lover.\u201d</p><p>A flash of memory, Dmitri\u2019s dark head bending over the arched neck of a woman who\u2019d been all but purring for his blood kiss. And later, in the Refuge, Naasir with his eyes of silver and scent of a tiger on the hunt, a woman\u2019s shuddering moan. \u201cYeah.\u201d She sat up on her haunches, her wings spread out on the forest floor. \u201cCan you help me turn her?\u201d</p><p>Jason did so in silence.</p><p>The girl\u2019s back was unmarked from what Elena could see. \u201cThat\u2019s fine for now. I\u2019ll attend the autopsy, make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p><p>Noises came from within the woods as they turned Celia gently onto her back once again\u2014the murmur of voices, footsteps. It didn\u2019t surprise her when Jason melted into the shadows until she could only see him because she knew he was there\u2014unlike Illium, Raphael\u2019s spymaster didn\u2019t like the spotlight. Even tight-mouthed Galen had friends, a woman he appeared to love, but Elena had never seen Jason with anyone when it didn\u2019t involve his duties.</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor you were back\u201d\u2014a familiar male voice\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Elena looked up to see death-scene investigator Luca Acz\u00e9l doing a pretty good job of keeping his surprise at her wings to himself. With his silver-touched black hair, patrician features, and long pianist\u2019s fingers, she\u2019d always thought Luca would look more at home in a boardroom than surrounded by violence, but there was no question that he was brilliant at what he did. Celia would be in good hands.</p><p>\u201cLuca.\u201d Rising to her feet, she stepped aside and gave him a quick rundown of what she\u2019d seen and done since her arrival on the scene.</p><p>Luca crouched down beside the body, his skin appearing darker than its usual honey brown in this light. \u201cIs the vamp dead?\u201d There was a hardness in his eyes that would\u2019ve surprised many.</p><p>Elena had known Luca too long, seen him at too many crime scenes, understood that he\u2019d always walked a fine line when it came to separating his emotions from the often heart-rending reality of his work. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A pause. \u201cHell of a welcome back, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Elena touched her hand to Luca\u2019s shoulder as she passed, intending to check out the primary scene one more time.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ellie.\u201d When she glanced back, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back, notwithstanding the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>The words, the quiet acceptance, meant everything. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten I owe you a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two now\u2014interest\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, the light exchange felt as if it had taken place in another lifetime. A lifetime in which she wasn\u2019t standing in the middle of a room saturated with violence while the crime-scene techs worked with calm industriousness around her. It didn\u2019t matter that the killer had been caught and punished, the scene still needed to be documented for both the Guild\u2019s archives and the M.E.\u2019s.</p><p>If, one day in the future, Celia\u2019s parents demanded to know what had been done to gain justice for their little girl, there would be some answers for them. Nothing that would lessen the hurt, nothing that would bring their daughter\u2019s laughter back into their lives, but answers all the same.</p><p>Just like Elena had had a file to read after she grew old enough to request it.</p><p>Shoving aside the jagged edge of memory, she looked around the room, her eyes skimming over the blue-overalled forms of the two techs. She knew one of them, but the other was a stranger. Both had nearly swallowed their tongues when she walked in, but Wesley had lightened the mood by saying, \u201cCan I take a photo of you?\u201d A flash of white teeth against night-dark skin. \u201cThen I can sell it to the reporters as an exclusive and make enough money to pay my as yet nonexistent kids\u2019 college tuitions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to dash your hopes, but I\u2019m probably already on the air by now. The students,\u201d she\u2019d said in explanation when confusion colored those pale brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cAw, shit.\u201d</p><p>That had been the extent of their conversation. Wesley and his colleague, Dee, went about their business with an efficiency that told her they\u2019d been working as a team long enough to have developed a rhythm, while Elena stood in the center of the room, drowning in the echoes of violence. One of the bunk beds had sheets drenched with red turning to a dull brown that failed to mute the evil that had been done here, while more blood\u2014arterial from the pattern of the spray\u2014splattered the wall to its right, closest to the door.</p><p>Wesley was standing there staring at that wall. \u201cEllie, do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned in a circle, found the blood drips on the floor and wall near the window, felt her hand clench. \u201cDee, could you do me a favor for a second?\u201d</p><p>The petite blonde rose to her feet, fingerprint brush in hand. \u201cSure, what do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d stand by the door.\u201d Elena waited until she\u2019d done so. \u201cBend down a little. That\u2019s it.\u201d Heading over, she looked at the spray. \u201cThat\u2019s how tall Celia would\u2019ve been while standing.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, the tech looked behind her, her bones sharp against skin that hadn\u2019t yet thrown off the pallor of winter. \u201cBastard took her out here, sprayed the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who bled out on the bed?\u201d Having moved to the bunk, Wesley lifted up the mattress with careful hands. \u201cIt\u2019s soaked through. No way the girl had enough in her after splattering the wall that bad.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. \u201cCall your people, tell them the pond needs to be searched.\u201d A vampire of Ignatius\u2019s age\u2014he\u2019d appeared sixty at least\u2014could\u2019ve carried the slight weight of two young girls without a problem. Or ... he\u2019d discarded one in the woods where the angels hadn\u2019t spotted it from above, and Elena had bypassed because she\u2019d been focused on the murderer.</p><p>Wesley was already taking out his cell phone. \u201cYou going to check the trail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but someone needs to talk to the principal, find out\u2014\u201d A new scent curved into the room, erotic and luscious and flavored with sensual decadence. It was a lure, that scent, a trap that caught only the hunter-born in its jaws, and Dmitri knew how to use it to its greatest advantage.</p><p>5</p><p>Instinct had her stepping out to meet the leader of Raphael\u2019s Seven in the corridor. The vampire with his chocolate-dark eyes and black hair was dressed in what looked like a ten-thousand-dollar suit from some fancy store like Zegna\u2019s, the ensemble black on black with an amber-colored tie that threw the tanned color of his skin into sharp relief. Except as she knew all too well, that color wasn\u2019t a tan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI heard,\u201d he said when she reached him, and for once, his voice carried no hint of the double-edged blade of sex. He sounded as she\u2019d once imagined him\u2014a battle-hardened warrior with scimitar in hand, ancient runes carved onto the weapon\u2019s very surface. His scent, too, she realized, was being held in fierce check.</p><p>He spoke again before she could say a word. \u201cYou need to return to the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Elena scowled\u2014the day she let Dmitri give her orders was the day ice-skating became a regular activity in hell. Part of it was simple contrariness because he\u2019d made it crystal clear he considered her a weakness in Raphael\u2019s armor, but part of it was self-preservation. Because the instant Dmitri decided she wasn\u2019t only a weakness, but actually weak, he\u2019d stop fencing with her and come at her full tilt.</p><p>Raphael would kill him for it, but as Dmitri had once said to her, she\u2019d still be dead. So she folded her arms, braced her legs. \u201cThe second body could\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He sliced out a hand, cutting off her words. \u201cRaphael isn\u2019t acting right.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met in dangerous understanding. \u201cHas he gone Quiet?\u201d The terrifying emotionless state that had once turned Raphael into a monster, driven her to shoot him in violent self-defense, scared Elena even now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A single precise word. \u201cBut he is not acting himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elena agreed. Raphael was an archangel, could be merciless in his punishments, but he was also piercingly intelligent. He shouldn\u2019t have needed her to remind him that they needed to know why Ignatius had done what he had. That was something the Raphael she knew would\u2019ve considered long before it got to the point of execution\u2014but today, it was as if he\u2019d been driven by untrammeled rage. \u201cHave you seen him like this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I have known him near to a thousand years.\u201d</p> <p>Elena sucked in a breath. In spite of the fact that he was almost impossibly good at hiding the sheer power within him, she\u2019d known Dmitri was old, but even then, she hadn\u2019t come close to guessing the depth of his age. \u201cDoes this place have a balcony I can use as a launch point?\u201d She\u2019d pursue the mystery of Dmitri later. Right now, she had to go to her archangel.</p><p>\u201cA small one upstairs. If you stand on the railing, you should have just enough lift to rise.\u201d He pointed to a staircase she hadn\u2019t seen till that moment. \u201cI\u2019ll organize a search for the second body,\u201d he said as she took the first step up, \u201censure the medical examiner knows you\u2019ll need to look at the remains.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s hand clenched on the balustrade. The lives of two innocent families were about to be smashed to splinters that would never again form a complete whole. \u201cMy sisters?\u201d she asked, fighting her mind\u2019s attempt to shove her back into the horror-filled past of another family, one that had broken forever in a small suburban kitchen almost two decades in the past. \u201cThe other girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing sent home. Your father dispatched a car to pick up your sisters\u2014they left fifteen minutes ago.\u201d Still no sarcasm, no attempt to unsettle her with that scent of his.</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s restraint worried her more than anything he could\u2019ve said.</p><p>Leaving him the task of locating the second body, she made her way to what proved to be some kind of an art studio surrounded by huge windows designed to catch endless sunlight. But there was no luxuriant warmth, no shimmering gold today. The world outside was a sullen gray, the atmosphere suffocating in its heaviness.</p> <p>Shaking off the thought that nothing could fly in such leaden air, she made her way onto the attached balcony. Dmitri had told the unadulterated truth when he\u2019d termed it small. It took all of her balancing skills to get herself onto the tiny railing, and even then, the ground looked far too close.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, she flared out her wings ... and dove.</p><p>The ground rushed up at blazing speed as she beat her wings hard and fast, muscles straining to painful levels. In the end, she could\u2019ve skimmed her fingers over the grass, but she got airborne, pulling herself up until she was high enough to ride the air currents. Her shoulders ached from the unaccustomed amount and type of flying she\u2019d done today, but not enough to make her worry about falling out of the sky.</p><p>Having caught her breath on a fast current, she stroked her way even higher\u2014so that no one looking up would immediately recognize the unusual colors of her wings. The wind whipped her hair off her face, threatened to lay frost on her skin. The cold distracted her enough that she almost ignored the fleeting glimpse of black high above.</p><p>Jason.</p><p>Watching over her.</p><p>It would\u2019ve annoyed her on a normal day, but today, she was too concerned about Raphael to bother. Instead, she made a mental note to ask the other angel to teach her some tricks about blending into the sky\u2014she loved her wings with mad passion, but unlike Illium\u2019s distinctive silver-edged blue, they didn\u2019t blend into daylight skies. As with Jason, her wings were fashioned for the rich black of night, and perhaps most of all, for the hue of twilight.</p><p>Finding a thermal, she surfed it like a young fledgling, giving her muscles a break in the process. The thought conjured up images of Sam, the child angel who\u2019d been caught in the middle of a narcissistic adult\u2019s attempt to grab at power. Elena couldn\u2019t think about how she\u2019d found him\u2014his small body curled in on itself, his wings broken\u2014without feeling a chaotic mix of rage and pain. The only thing that made it bearable was that he was well on the way to being healed.</p> <p>A rush of wind had her blinking furiously. When it passed, she saw Archangel Tower rising out of Manhattan, a proud, uncompromising structure that dwarfed the tallest of skyscrapers. Even on a day like this, with the sky a menacing slate gray blanket, it pierced the skyline, a gleaming column of light. She arrowed her way toward it using the last vestiges of her strength, certain Raphael would have headed to what was effectively the place from which he ruled his territory.</p><p>The wide landing space of the Tower roof appeared moments later, seeming to float above the clouds. It was a stunning sight, but she didn\u2019t have time to appreciate it\u2014because she\u2019d miscalculated the speed of her descent, and it was too late to rein it back. \u201cNo pain, no glory,\u201d she muttered under her breath and, teeth bared in what her fellow hunter and sometimes-friend Ransom called her \u201ckamikaze smile,\u201d angled in for landing.</p><p>She remembered to flare out her wings in short, sharp beats as her feet touched the ground, having learned from excruciating experience that kamikaze ways or not, she did not like crashing to her knees. Even with her increased healing abilities, it still hurt like a bitch. The end result was that she ended up racing across the roof even after landing.</p><p>Think parachute, Ellie.</p><p>Recalling Illium\u2019s words of advice, she cupped her primaries inward, no longer riding the air but gathering it. Her body slowed. Slowed further ... until she was finally able to snap her wings to her back. \u201cWell,\u201d she said to the transparent wall half an inch from her nose, \u201cthat went well.\u201d She\u2019d ended up almost plastering herself against the glass cage that housed the elevator.</p><p>Adrenaline continuing to pump through her veins, she pulled open the door and pushed the button to bring up the elevator. Of course, she could\u2019ve attempted to land directly on the balcony outside Raphael\u2019s office and suite, but she\u2019d probably have broken more than a few bones in the process, given the limited landing area. And she\u2019d had quite enough broken bones in the past year and a half, thank you very much.</p><p>The elevator whisked her to Raphael\u2019s private level in a split second. Getting out, she looked up and down the gleaming white corridor decorated with accents of gold\u2014tiny, almost microscopic flecks in the paint, gold threads in the deep white pile of the carpet. It was the coldest elegance\u2014her feathers sleeked against the tinge of ice in the air, a chill that was already neutralizing the adrenaline as it burned through to her very bones.</p><p>Shaking off the frigid sensation, she walked into the large study that flowed through to the bedroom suite. Clouds caressed the glass that was the back wall, blocking out the rest of the world\u2014and making her feel cocooned in nothingness. It was a disorienting sensation. \u201cRaphael?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Absolute.</p><p>Endless.</p><p>No scent of the wind and the rain on the periphery of her senses. No whisper of wings. No hint of power in the air. Nothing whatsoever to tell her that Raphael was in the vicinity. Yet she knew he was.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she reached out with her mind. Raphael? She couldn\u2019t control her thoughts like he could, couldn\u2019t sense whether she\u2019d reached him until he answered.</p><p>This time, her only answer was more silence.</p><p>Uneasy, she crossed the plush carpet of the study to enter the attached suite\u2014rooms she\u2019d glimpsed briefly when they\u2019d first arrived. The suite occupied just under half the floor\u2014the other half being set up with rooms for the Seven\u2014and functioned as another home for Raphael. Stepping into the huge living area, she called out his name, but it echoed hollowly against the emptiness of a space that bore the masculine stamp of her archangel.</p><p>There was no over-the-top decorating, nothing ornate. The furniture was an elegant black, strong and with sleek, simple lines that suited Raphael. However, it wasn\u2019t a soulless place. In contrast to the relatively modern furniture, a tapestry depicting the rich hues of some ancient court adorned the living room, while when she pushed open the door to the sprawling bedroom, she glimpsed a painting on the wall to the left and\u2014</p><p>She whipped her head around.</p><p>The painting was a full-length portrait of her, knives in hand, wings spread, and feet planted in a combat-ready stance as her hair flew off her face in a playful wind. The artist had captured her with her head tilted slightly to the side, a smile of mingled challenge and desire on her face, laughter in her eyes. Behind her lay the mountainous beauty of the Refuge, and in front of her ... That wasn\u2019t in the portrait but she knew. It could only have been Raphael in front of her. She looked at no other that way.</p><p>Her fingers lifted of their own accord, touched the thick strokes of oil paint, vibrant with color. She had no idea when it had been painted, was unbearably curious about it, but that curiosity, she thought, dropping her hand, would have to wait. The strange chill pervading these rooms only intensified her need to find Raphael.</p><p>Pulling out her cell phone, she called their home over the water. \u201cMontgomery,\u201d she said when the butler answered, \u201cis Raphael there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Guild Hunter. The Sire has not returned home as of yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, can you call\u2014\u201d</p><p>Keeping tabs on me?</p><p>Shivers running up her spine, Elena closed her cell phone and turned to the bedroom doorway ... to see an archangel with eyes of liquid metal and wings outlined by the lethal stroke of power. His hair, black as the heart of midnight, was wind-tousled, his body magnificent, but it was his eyes that held her.</p><p>In those eyes, she saw age, cruelty, and pain.</p><p>So much pain.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d She closed the distance between them, ignoring the cold that raised every hair on her body. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I am an archangel.</p><p>Unsaid were the words that he found the worry of a woman who\u2019d been mortal not long ago\u2014who was still not a true immortal\u2014laughable.</p><p>She refused to let him intimidate her. They\u2019d made promises to each other, she and her archangel. She wasn\u2019t about to stumble at the first hurdle\u2014even if her pulse thudded hard and uneven in her throat, the animal part of her brain recognizing that this predator had no mercy in him.</p><p>Reaching him, she tilted back her head, met the intensity of his gaze. The metallic shade was so inhuman it hurt, her eyes tearing up in instinctive defense. Blinking, she looked away.</p> <p>You give in so easily.</p><p>The weight of the cold confidence she heard in him was daunting, but she\u2019d always known he\u2019d never be an easy man to love. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ve given in, Archangel, you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d Flicking away the tears, she stepped close enough that her breasts brushed his chest.</p><p>Electricity arced between them, a white-hot whip.</p><p>And the archangel came to life. Thrusting a hand into her hair, he tugged back her head to take her mouth in a kiss that was both a claiming and a warning. He was in no temper to play.</p><p>Neither was she.</p> <p>Twisting her arms around his neck, she kissed him back with the same raw passion, stroking her tongue against his in deliberate provocation\u2014because no matter how hot he burned, Raphael\u2019s hunger she could handle. It was when he went cold, cloaking himself in the arrogance of power beyond mortal ken, that she thought she might lose him. Even as the thought passed through her mind, she sensed a change in his kiss, a subtle but unmistakable control. Not happening, Archangel, she thought and bit down hard on his lower lip, knowing it would set him off in this mood.</p><p>His hand tightened in her hair, wrenching back her head. Do you think you are safe? He pushed his free hand up under her tank top at the same time, long, strong fingers closing over her breast in blatant possession.</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d Gasping in a breath, she ran her own fingers along the part of his right wing she could reach. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d But I\u2019ve always wanted to dance with you anyway.</p><p>He squeezed and molded her sensitive flesh. Then dance.</p><p>Her top was suddenly gone, torn off her body to leave her upper half bare. Spreading her unfettered wings, she tugged at his shirt. It disintegrated off him the next instant, and she found herself skin to skin with an archangel burning with a cold white flame.</p><p>Real fear spiked for the first time.</p> <p>She\u2019d never tangled with him when he was like this, never been so close to the deadly strength of him that she could feel the icy burn of it against her flesh. The sensation was both exhilarating and terrifying. Ignoring the fear, she moved closer ... and rubbed the softness of her belly against the hard ridge of his erection.</p><p>Raphael shifted their positions without warning, slamming her back against the wall, her wings spread out on either side of her. She sucked in a breath and then he was taking it from her in the most primal of kisses as he tore off her remaining clothes, leaving her naked and vulnerable. When he put his hands under her thighs and lifted, it was instinct to wrap her legs around his waist.</p><p>The cold, cold burn of his power kissed her in her most sensitive place.</p><p>6</p><p>Shuddering, she broke the kiss. He refused to let her go, pulling her mouth back to his with the hand he had fisted in her hair. It should\u2019ve scared her, but all it did was make her more determined to win this battle, to bring Raphael back from the abyss she could see in the wintry black of his eyes. She\u2019d seen many colors in those eyes, but never that vast, forsaken darkness.</p><p>Archangel, she whispered into his mind, trying to keep her sanity as he plucked at the taut peak of her nipple with fingers that knew her every weakness. Raphael.</p><p>No response, the icy caress of his power so strong that she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open any longer. She shoved her hands into his hair as her world became dark, squeezing her thighs around him at the same time. Something was very, very wrong, but she wasn\u2019t about to be scared away, even if fear was a tickle at the back of her throat, a jangling accent to the hunger that turned her body damp and ready.</p><p>Because lethal as he was, he was still hers, and her body knew him, knew the pleasure he could give. Today, however, that pleasure might well be spiced with a little sensual cruelty. It was tempting to surrender, to allow him to play her body with consummate skill, but instinct told her that that would be the quickest way to lose this battle. To lose him\u2014to the demons that had turned the agonizing blue of his eyes to a harsh, unforgiving midnight.</p> <p>My lovers have always been warrior women.</p><p>He\u2019d said that to her at the start.</p><p>Ripping away her lips from his with force, she turned her head to the side, gasping for air. He took a firmer grip on her hair, threatening to wrench her back. She blocked his arm with her own.</p><p>A blaze of arctic white around them, so potent and blinding it felt as if her eyes were open, not closed. \u201cRaphael,\u201d she said, fighting to breathe past the press of it, so pure, so cutting, \u201ceither turn off the power, or give me my weapons.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Why would I give you your weapons? A silken whisper in her mind.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, feeling as if her lungs were being squeezed to emptiness, \u201cyou don\u2019t get off on women who can\u2019t fight back. You like warriors, remember?\u201d</p><p>Laughter in her head, tinged with a kind of ruthlessness that made her fear turn knife-edged. There is, I find, something exquisitely pleasurable in having a warrior helpless and spread before me.</p><p>It was dread that licked through her veins now. There wasn\u2019t any hint of the lover she knew in him at this moment, nothing she could reach or touch or reason with. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a challenge, though, is it?\u201d she murmured, fighting the hunter within her, the part that told her to claw at those amazing eyes, rip at his wings, anything to get away. \u201cI walked into your arms.\u201d</p><p>Lips along her neck, the fist in her hair tugging her head farther to the side. She felt teeth ... and lower, the rigid push of his erection. That, she understood. It was real and earthy and wild. Making a snap decision, she whispered, \u201cTake me, Raphael. Take your warrior.\u201d The words were deliberate, a reminder of the bonds between them.</p><p>He froze against her. Giving in after all?</p><p>Pulling up his head with the hands she\u2019d clenched in his hair, she kissed him her way. All wet heat and wild passion . . . and a love that was becoming ever more intertwined in her heart. This power stuff is sexy, but I want you inside me, thick and hard and now.</p><p>Raphael squeezed her thigh. Elena.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Because that voice, that tone, she knew it. Raphael. I need you. He was the only man she\u2019d ever said that to in her adult life, the only man who\u2019d won that trust from her. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>A shudder in the big body that held her pinned to the wall, the frigid bite of his power turning into a molten caress that was a thousand featherlight kisses over her skin, and then the blunt tip of his erection nudging against the entrance to her body. Sucking in a breath before he reclaimed her lips, she held on tight as he pushed into her with a slow, measured intensity, not stopping until he was buried to the hilt within her.</p><p>Her body arched at the near-violent shock of pleasure. He took advantage of her position to play with her breasts, to bite and lick and suck until she rolled her hips in urgent movements, nails biting into his shoulders. \u201cStop teasing, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, and suddenly he was pure male demand, his body slick and hard and very, very physical under her hands. Opening her eyes, she looked into his ... and saw endless, relentless blue right before he ground against her with the sexual experience of a being who had lived centuries upon centuries, and he sent her hurtling to the stars.</p><p>Crying out, she gripped him with her body, claiming him, taking him with her.</p><p>She came to lying on the bed on her front, with Raphael leaning on his side beside her, his gaze focused inward. \u201cHey.\u201d She reached over to touch his thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t go away again.\u201d It came out huskier than she\u2019d intended, tangled with the fears of the child who\u2019d been abandoned long before she\u2019d been thrown out of the hollow elegance of the Big House.</p><p>His thigh flexed under her touch. \u201cDid I cause you any bodily injury?\u201d</p><p>She remembered what he\u2019d said once. About breaking her. Knew that she had the power to savage him\u2014but that wasn\u2019t who she was. Who they were. \u201cNo. You just scared me a little.\u201d</p><p>Apologies, Elena. He ran his hand over the arch of her wing. I was not . . . myself.</p><p>It was an admission she\u2019d never expected, because though they\u2019d been together this long, they were still learning each other. And the Archangel of New York had long ago learned to keep secrets\u2014his own, his race\u2019s, his Seven\u2019s.</p><p>And now, his consort\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Shifting up onto her elbow, she closed her hand over the muscle of his shoulder, needing the raw physicality of the connection. \u201cSomething is wrong, Raphael. That vampire might\u2019ve appeared sane, but he didn\u2019t act in any way rational when he attacked the school, and you should\u2019ve seen that. But you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember little of my actions during that time.\u201d A question without being a question as he nudged her down onto her back, one big hand warm on her abdomen.</p><p>Knowing the loss of control had to be a vicious beast tearing him apart, she recapped the events. \u201cDo you remember executing Ignatius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He dipped his head a fraction, and she took the invitation to stroke her fingers through his hair. \u201cWhen you speak of the events, I do recall them\u2014but there is a red haze over it all.\u201d</p><p>Thick and silky, the vivid black strands of his hair kissed a cool caress over her skin. \u201cIf I had to put a name to what I saw in your expression, I\u2019d call it rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Moving his hand over her stomach, he settled it low on her hip. \u201cBut I have lived long enough that I can handle rage. This was ... other.\u201d</p><p>She went motionless, worried by his choice of words. \u201cOutside of yourself?\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed adamantine blue beneath lowered lashes. \u201cImpossible to confirm.\u201d</p><p>Elena wasn\u2019t about to let it go at that. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d She knew what he was, understood that he held more power in his body than she would probably ever know, even if she lived ten thousand years. Equals, they weren\u2019t. Not on that playing field\u2014but when it came to the emotions that could tear a heart apart... \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>Nadiel, he said into her mind, exhibited such extreme rage.</p><p>His father had also gone inexorably insane.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, not even needing an instant to evaluate the thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not going insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo certain, Guild Hunter.\u201d Formal words, a tone that told her he considered her statement nothing but a platitude.</p><p>Lifting up her head, she nipped at his lower lip. \u201cThe taste of you is ingrained into my very cells. You\u2019re the rain and the wind and at times the clean, wild bite of the sea. I\u2019d know the instant something changed.\u201d</p><p>He rose off her, allowing her to sit up as he shifted to sit with his legs over the side of the bed, his back to her, his magnificent wings spread out. Each filament of each feather was tipped in gold, glittering even in the dull light whispering through the windows. A lethal temptation to mortals\u2014and former mortals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elena was reaching out to indulge her desire to touch when he said, \u201cYou lie to both of us.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she wrapped the sheet around herself\u2014letting it gape low at the back to accommodate her wings\u2014and scrambled off the bed to stand in front of him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, his face so very clear of emotion that the pristine beauty of it felt as if it should draw blood, it was so sharp, so pure. \u201cDid Uram\u2019s scent change?\u201d</p><p>Acid and blood and . . . sunlight.</p> <p>She shivered at the memory of the bloodlust-driven archangel, her ankle aching in sympathetic memory where Uram had crushed it\u2014simply to hear her scream. \u201cI only met him after he\u2019d already crossed the line into insanity,\u201d she said, knowing this conversation was beyond important. \u201cI have no way of knowing what he would\u2019ve been to my senses beforehand\u2014it\u2019s possible that the blood, the acid in his scent was because of what he became, not what he once was.\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t look convinced. However, neither did he dismiss her argument as he rose to his feet and pulled on his pants. \u201cIt can no longer be avoided. I must speak to Lijuan\u2014\u201d</p><p>An eerie cold in the room, a prickle of fear along the back of Elena\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if she can hear it when you speak her name.\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t tell her she was being a superstitious twit. Yes, he said instead, we have no way of knowing what Lijuan hears on the winds now. \u201cI cannot disregard the fact that my ... rage comes at a time when an Ancient appears to be stirring to wakefulness. As the oldest among us, Lijuan is the only one who may have some kind of an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d Not long ago, as Beijing trembled around her, Elena had stood face-to-face with the shambling empty-eyed shells who provided irrefutable proof of the dark heart of Lijuan\u2019s strength. The Archangel of China had bought the dead back to life\u2014whether they wished to return or not.</p> <p>They\u2019d been monsters, feasting on the flesh of those Lijuan did not favor to clothe their own emaciated forms. But they\u2019d also been victims, mute and unable to scream. Elena had heard them all the same, and everything in her rebelled at the idea of Raphael alone in the presence of the being who\u2019d created those \u201creborn.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>A brush of strong fingers against her jaw. \u201cShe does not see you yet, not truly. I would keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Elena set that jaw. \u201cMy safety isn\u2019t enough to compromise yours.\u201d Lijuan was a nightmare, and her power came from the same dark place. There was nothing remotely human in her, nothing that even hinted of a conscience.</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cShe will not kill me, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo but she wants to ...\u201d Had Lijuan been another woman, it would\u2019ve been a simple equation. But the oldest of the archangels had no desires of the flesh\u2014she didn\u2019t even eat, much less take lovers. \u201cPossess you,\u201d she completed.</p><p>A look that made her feel as if she\u2019d been stripped to the skin, laid out before him like a feast. \u201cBut I wish to possess you, hbeebti. The two desires are not compatible.\u201d</p> <p>Hbeebti.</p><p>A beautiful word from the Moroccan half of her mother\u2019s lost heritage. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you sweet-talk me.\u201d</p><p>A curve to his lips, her archangel finding dangerous humor in her stubbornness. \u201cThen let logic persuade you. She is as apt to take offense at your presence as ignore it. If I am to do this, I want to get something out of it.\u201d</p><p>Her hand scrunched the fabric of the sheet. \u201cDamn it.\u201d She knew he was right. Lijuan was unpredictable\u2014she might decide to take the presence of Raphael\u2019s \u201cpet\u201d as an insult. \u201cDo it fast. Don\u2019t let her get her hooks into you.\u201d</p><p>A nod that sent his hair sliding across his forehead in a wash of gleaming midnight. \u201cYou asked me once what you should call me.\u201d</p><p>Elena scowled. \u201cI think you said something like \u2018master,\u2019 but I\u2019ve decided I had to be hearing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to call me?\u201d</p><p>That made her pause. \u201cHusband\u201d was too human, \u201cpartner\u201d factually wrong for a being as powerful as an archangel, \u201cmate\u201d . . . perhaps. But none of it was quite right. \u201cMine,\u201d she said at last.</p> <p>He blinked, and when he raised his lashes again, the blue was liquid fire. Yes, that will do. \u201cBut for public consumption, you are my consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsort,\u201d she murmured, tasting the word, feeling its shape. \u201cYes, that fits.\u201d A consort was more than a lover, more than a wife. She was ... someone with whom an archangel could discuss the darkest of secrets, someone he could trust to speak only the truth, even if it wasn\u2019t something he wanted to hear. \u201cIf that crazy-ass bitch tries anything,\u201d she said, referring to Lijuan, \u201cand being in my mind would help anchor you, then do it.\u201d</p><p>Raphael closed his hand over her bare shoulder, stroking to curve his fingers around her nape, his thumb playing over her pulse. \u201cYou fight so hard for your independence, and yet you would give me such entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t abuse it.\u201d Not now, not when he knew how very important it was to her that her mind be her own.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for the offer, Elena.\u201d It was an oddly formal statement, almost as if he was making a vow, his expression so intent she could do nothing but wrap her arms around him. The sheet slid to the floor at the same moment that he moved his free hand down her spine to her lower back, pressing her against him, his wings rising to curve slightly around her.</p><p>\u201cThe painting,\u201d she said, stealing a moment to simply be with her archangel. \u201cWhen was it done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring the time you trained with Galen.\u201d He answered her next question before she could ask it. \u201cIt is Aodhan\u2019s work, done at my request.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the angel with his eyes of shattered glass and wings that glittered diamond bright in the sun. \u201cI never saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is adept at being unseen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost men would choose a painting of a nude for the bedroom,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou chose a hunter with knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the only woman allowed in my bedroom, Elena.\u201d</p><p>That she was loved . . . it was wonder enough. That she was loved by this man, it was beyond wonder. And it gave her the will to step back into the darkness. \u201cI need to tell you what I found at the school.\u201d</p><p>He listened in quiet. \u201cYou plan to liaise with Dmitri, confirm if they located the second body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Frustrated anger had her fisting her hand against his back. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that the vampire picked that school was it, Raphael?\u201d</p><p>His answer destroyed her final ephemeral hopes. \u201cNo. It cannot be.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Less than an hour later, Elena found herself at the city morgue, looking down at the heartbreaking evidence of why Ignatius had spilled innocent blood. The girl who lay on the slab had been named Betsy, an old-fashioned name for someone so young. But maybe she\u2019d liked it. Elena would never know. Because Betsy\u2019s throat had been torn out, coloring the bed where she\u2019d gone to lie down a violent crimson.</p><p>They\u2019d found her discarded in the woods not far from the pond, a bare few feet from where Elena had hesitated during the tracking.</p><p>\u201cShe was a day student, didn\u2019t have a bed at the school,\u201d Dmitri told her from where he stood on the other side of the body. \u201cHer teacher sent her to the infirmary after she complained of a stomachache, but Betsy\u2019s best friend had a room at the school. It looks like she snuck in there instead. In the confusion, everyone thought the nurse had sent her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvelyn,\u201d Elena said, as she took in the small heart-shaped face surrounded by hair of a brown so dark it could be mistaken for black. According to the file, Betsy\u2019s eyes had been a deep gray before death had stolen a film of dullness over them. \u201cShe looks like my youngest sister.\u201d And the bed saturated with Betsy\u2019s lifeblood had been Evelyn\u2019s.</p><p>That was why Betsy was dead.</p><p>\u201cI need to make a call.\u201d She fisted her hand against the urge to touch Betsy\u2019s pale skin in futile hope\u2014there was no longer any warmth there, no longer any life. It had been irrevocably stolen.</p><p>As she watched, Dmitri reached out to tug the sheet over Betsy\u2019s face with a tenderness that made a knot form in Elena\u2019s throat. \u201cI\u2019ll organize discreet surveillance on your sisters,\u201d he said, his tone so very even that she knew it was a mask.</p><p>Nodding, she stepped out into the cold, crisp light of the corridor, and collapsed against the wall. The shakes took time to pass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered to the girl who would never again laugh or cry or run ... and to the one who would soon be told that her best friend was dead.</p><p>Then she stiffened her spine and used her cell phone to call a number she\u2019d avoided since waking from the coma. Her father picked up on the first ring. \u201cYes?\u201d A curt demand.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jeffrey.\u201d</p><p>His silence was eloquent. He didn\u2019t like it when she used his name\u2014but he\u2019d lost the right to any familial address the day he\u2019d told her she was an \u201cabomination,\u201d a pollutant in the illustrious Deveraux family tree. \u201cElieanora,\u201d he said, his tone pure frost. \u201cMay I assume the unpleasantness at the girls\u2019 school today had something to do with you?\u201d</p><p>Guilt twisted her stomach into knots. \u201cEvelyn may have been the target.\u201d Hand pressed hard against the chipped paint of the wall, she told him the rest. \u201cHer best friend, Betsy, was murdered. You must know how alike they look . . . looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvelyn needs to be told. The names will leak to the media soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her mother speak to her.\u201d Another pause. \u201cThe girls will be tutored at home until you sort out whatever mess you\u2019ve created this time.\u201d</p><p>It was a direct hit, and she took it. Because he was right. The two youngest Deveraux girls were in the line of fire because of her. \u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else to say, how to speak to this man who had once been her father and was now a stranger who seemed to want only to hurt her.</p><p>In the days after she\u2019d woken from the coma, she\u2019d remembered forgotten pieces of her childhood, remembered the father she\u2019d loved all those years ago. Jeffrey had held her hand in the hospital after her two older sisters had been murdered in that blood-soaked kitchen, led her down to the basement in spite of bitter opposition so she could see Ari and Belle again\u2014she\u2019d needed to be certain that her sisters really did rest in peace, that the monster hadn\u2019t made them like him. He\u2019d cried that day. Her father, the man with a stone-cold heart, had cried. Because he\u2019d been a different man.</p><p>As she\u2019d been a different girl.</p><p>\u201cFrom your silence,\u201d Jeffrey said with cutting impatience, \u201cI take it the Guild Director didn\u2019t pass on my message.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey had never liked Sara, being as she was part of Elena\u2019s \u201cfilthy\u201d profession. Elena\u2019s hand tightened on the phone, until she was sure she could feel her bones crunching against one another. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to meet Sara this morning.\u201d They\u2019d been meant to have coffee, catch up. Elena had been looking forward to kissing her goddaughter, Zoe, seeing how big she\u2019d grown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course. You were at the school.\u201d Rigid and unbending as granite. \u201cI need to speak to you face-to-face. Be here tomorrow morning, or lose your right to take part in the decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat decision?\u201d Jeffrey and she hadn\u2019t had anything to say to each other for ten years before Uram invaded the city. Even now, the only words they exchanged were well-honed weapons, designed to inflict maximum damage.</p><p>\u201cAll you need to know is that it\u2019s a family matter.\u201d He hung up, and though it frustrated Elena until tears\u2014stupid, unwanted\u2014pricked at her eyes, she knew she\u2019d turn up at his office as ordered. Because the family he spoke of might be splintered, but it included not only Amethyst and Evelyn, but also Marguerite\u2019s youngest daughter, Beth.</p><p>None of the three deserved to be caught in the crossfire of the endless war that raged between Jeffrey and Elena.</p> <p>Having spent two hours in the Tower with Jason, talking through the information that had brought the black-winged angel to the city, Raphael now came in for a silent landing in the woods that separated his estate from the home Michaela used while in his territory. As he walked to take a position in front of the small pool his gardener had created in a grotto he\u2019d shaded with vines and tucked in among the solid bulk of the larger trees, Raphael wondered if Elena saw more than he did.</p><p>He knew he was arrogant. It was inevitable, given the years he\u2019d lived, the power at his command. But he\u2019d never been stupid. So he heeded his hunter\u2019s words, augmenting his mental shields with care before he stared down at the placid waters of the darkened pool and said, Lijuan, \u201cpushing\u201d the thought across the world.</p><p>There was a chance he\u2019d fail to reach her, for he had no intention of undertaking a true sending. The price demanded was too high. In the Quiet, he became monstrous, stripped down to the lethal cold of power without conscience. It was during such a state that he\u2019d terrified Elena so much she\u2019d shot him, the scar on his wing a stunning reminder to never again walk that road.</p><p>If this did not succeed, he would have to send Lijuan a handwritten message\u2014the oldest of the archangels eschewed modern conveniences like the phone. However, the water rippled an instant later, far faster than he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d known Lijuan\u2019s strength had grown exponentially, but the rapid response, coupled with the fact that he\u2019d used a minute amount of his own power, argued for a strength beyond anything the rest of the Cadre had imagined.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d She appeared of the flesh as her image formed on the water, her face as ageless as always. Only the pure white of her hair, the pearlescent glow of her pale, pale eyes betrayed what she was, what she was becoming. \u201cSo you return to me after all.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t react except to say, \u201cDo you think to make me a pet, Lijuan?\u201d</p><p>A tinkling laugh, girlish and all the more disturbing for it. \u201cWhat a thought. I think you would be a most troublesome one.\u201d</p><p>Raphael inclined his head. \u201cYou are home?\u201d Lijuan\u2019s palace lay in the heart of China, deep in mountainous territory Raphael had never traversed, though Jason had managed to work his way inside before Lijuan\u2019s \u201cevolution.\u201d Raphael\u2019s spymaster had returned from the clandestine visit with half his face torn off.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The other archangel\u2019s hair whispered back in a breeze that he was certain affected nothing else in the vicinity. \u201cI find,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat there are certain pleasures of the flesh I do still enjoy after all, and where best to partake of them than in my palace?\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking she spoke of sex. Lijuan hadn\u2019t been a sexual being for thousands of years . . . or not sexual in the accepted sense. \u201cAre your toys surviving the experience?\u201d</p><p>A finger rose up until he could see it, waved at him. \u201cSuch a question, Raphael. You would call me a monster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would take it as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh, those eerie, near-colorless eyes filling with a surge of power that turned them wholly white, without pupil or iris. \u201cAn Ancient rises to consciousness.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised she\u2019d guessed at the reason behind this contact. Despite the nightmare she\u2019d become, he\u2019d never doubted Lijuan\u2019s intelligence. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how old your mother was when she disappeared?\u201d she asked without warning.</p><p>An image of startling blue eyes, a voice that made the heavens weep, and a madness so deep and true it mimicked sanity. \u201cJust over a thousand years older than you.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s lips curved in a smile that held a strange amusement. \u201cShe was vain, was Caliane. She liked to tell people that because it made her almost the same age as her mate.\u201d</p><p>Raphael felt ice form in his chest, spread outward in jagged branches, threatening to pierce his veins. \u201cHow much older was she?\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s answer shattered the ice, turned it into shards of glass that spliced through his system, causing massive damage. \u201cFifty thousand years. Even that may have been a lie. It was whispered that she was twice that age when I was born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d he said at last, knowing he could betray none of his shock. To do so would be to tempt the predator that lived within Lijuan. \u201cNo archangel that old would have chosen to remain awake.\u201d A hundred thousand years was an impossible eternity. Yes, they had old ones in their world, but except for a few notable exceptions, most of them chose to go into the Sleep for eons at a time, awakening only for brief periods to taste the changing world.</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s smile faded, her voice echoing with a thousand ghostly whispers. \u201cThey say Caliane Slept before, more than once. But when she woke the final time, she found Nadiel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I was born.\u201d He thought of his laughing, singing mother, thought, too, of her descent into a madness that had seemed to come out of nowhere. But if she\u2019d been alive for so many millennia ... \u201cDo you lie to me, Lijuan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no need to lie. I have evolved beyond even Caliane.\u201d</p><p>On the surface, that certainly appeared true. Age had never been the arbiter of power among their kind. Raphael had become an archangel at an age unheard of among angelkind. And at just over five hundred years old, Illium was already far stronger than angels ten times his age. But that wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d contacted Lijuan. \u201cIs it my mother who wakes?\u201d he asked, holding that \u201cblind\u201d gaze.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way to know.\u201d The whispers in her voice sounded almost like screams. \u201cHowever, the magnitude of the disruption, the strength of the quakes and the storms, says that the one who wakes is the most ancient of Ancients.\u201d</p><p>Raphael wondered what it was Lijuan saw with those eyes, if it was worth the sacrifice of a city . . . of what remained of her soul. \u201cIf this Ancient wakes without sanity, will you execute him or her?\u201d Not before. Never before. To murder an angel in Sleep was to face automatic execution\u2014no one was immune to that law. Even Lijuan, invulnerable though she might be to death, would find herself shunned by the entire angelic race if she crossed that line. Not something a goddess would enjoy.</p><p>Another girlish laugh, this one a giggle that was more disturbing than her appearance. \u201cYou disappoint me, Raphael. What need do I have to execute an old one? They can do nothing to me ... and perhaps they can teach me secrets I do not yet know.\u201d</p><p>It was then Raphael realized that if one monster came to waking life, it might well strengthen another.</p><p>The conversation with Jeffrey, coming as it did on top of the painful visit to the morgue, left Elena feeling as if she\u2019d been beaten by stone fists. It was tempting, so tempting, to go home and hide, just pretend that everything would be okay when she came out again.</p><p>Except, of course, that was a child\u2019s ploy. Elena hadn\u2019t had the luxury of believing in hopeless dreams since she\u2019d been a scared ten-year-old slipping and falling in a family kitchen turned abattoir. \u201cDo you know where Jason is?\u201d she asked Dmitri when they exited the morgue.</p><p>Dmitri pressed the car remote to unlock the flame red Ferrari parked in the employees-only lot. \u201cTired of your Bluebell already?\u201d A tendril of champagne circled around her senses, cut with something far harder.</p><p>Never had she felt that harsh edge in Dmitri\u2019s scent. She pitied the woman he took to his bed today. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m building a harem.\u201d</p><p>Opening the door to the Ferrari, Dmitri braced one arm on top. For a moment, his expression turned probing, and she had the feeling he was about to say something important. But then he shook his head, his hair lifting slightly in the dull breeze, and pulled out his cell phone, checked something. \u201cHe\u2019s at the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the straight answer, she fought off the wickedness of champagne to say, \u201cCan you ask if he\u2019d mind meeting me at the house?\u201d</p><p>Dmitri made the call. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving now,\u201d he said, snapping the phone closed. \u201cNowhere for you to take off from here.\u201d</p><p>Elena looked up. \u201cHospital building is high enough. I\u2019ll head up to the roof.\u201d Suiting action to words, she made her way back into the building and up. It was an interesting journey. There were only a few hospital staff in the lower corridors, and the ones who did see her seemed to lose the ability to speak.</p><p>Deeply bothered by that reaction from the people of a city she considered home, she found her way to the elevator and pushed the button. Because the staff used it to move beds from floor to floor, the cage was plenty big enough for wings. Then the doors opened on the first floor.</p><p>Two nurses, chattering to each other, looked up. Froze.</p><p>Elena stepped back. \u201cPlenty of room.\u201d</p><p>Neither woman said a word as the doors closed on their stunned faces. Variations of the scene were repeated on the next four floors. It was funny ... except it felt wrong. This was New York. She needed to belong here\u2014though she knew she would never again fit in the same way.</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at that sound to see that the doors had opened on the fifth floor to reveal an elderly man leaning on a cane. \u201cGoing up?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped in, making no effort to hide the fact that he was staring at her wings as he used his cane to push the button for his floor. \u201cYou\u2019re a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d She stretched out her wings for him, the knots in her soul unraveling a little. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He took his time replying. \u201cWhy are you taking the elevator?\u201d</p><p>Smart man. \u201cFelt like it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as the doors opened on his floor. \u201cYou sure sound like a New Yorker!\u201d</p><p>Elena was smiling when the doors closed, something she would\u2019ve never predicted minutes ago as she stood beside Dmitri. When the doors finally opened on the last level, she got out and made her way to the roof with firm steps, no longer feeling as if she\u2019d been pummeled to screaming point.</p><p>The flight across the Hudson, assisted as she was by strong winds, went by fast. Jason was waiting for her in the front yard, his wings folded neatly back, his hair in its usual queue. It was the first time she\u2019d seen his tattoo in full light, and the detail and intricacy of it made her suck in a breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damaged by Lijuan\u2019s reborn before Elena woke from her coma, the ink had been redone with such perfection after Jason healed that no one would ever know the difference. All curves and swirling lines, it spoke of the winds of the Pacific and the soaring beauty of the skies at the same time. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d she found herself asking, not expecting an answer.</p><p>8</p><p>\u201cA small Pacific atoll that no longer exists.\u201d There was nothing in that statement. No pain, no sorrow, no anger. Nothing.</p><p>The very lack of emotion was another answer.</p> <p>Letting Jason\u2019s secrets lie, she said, \u201cI was hoping you could teach me some tricks about flying in daylight without making myself too big a target.\u201d</p><p>Jason narrowed his eyes, his attention going to her wings. \u201cThere are a few techniques you can use straight away, but for the rest, you\u2019ll need to practice until you can pull yourself high above the cloud layer in a burst of speed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have time to give me a lesson now?\u201d</p><p>A small nod.</p><p>\u201cI flew a longer distance than usual today,\u201d she admitted, \u201cso I might be off the pace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be moving slowly\u2014it\u2019s not about speed below the cloud layer, but about utilizing light and shadow to your advantage.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she fell into step beside him as he led her toward the cliffs. Evening shadows had fallen by the time he pronounced her proficient enough to continue the drills on her own. \u201cI leave Manhattan tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care, Jason.\u201d As Raphael\u2019s spymaster, he walked dangerous roads.</p><p>He looked at her straight on with those eyes as dark as the blade he carried along his spine. \u201cWhat is it like to be mortal?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she took a second to think, to consider. \u201cLife is much more immediate. When you have a time limit, every moment gains an importance that an immortal will never know.\u201d</p><p>Jason spread those amazing wings designed to blend into the night. \u201cWhat you call a time limit, some might call an escape.\u201d He was rising into the sky before she could answer; he was a shadowy silhouette against the first wash of night.</p> <p>But his weren\u2019t the only wings she spotted. Does Jason want escape so very much, Archangel?</p><p>Yes. His sole tie to the living world is through his service to me.</p><p>\u201cWas it a woman, like with Illium?\u201d she whispered as he came in to land with a rush of wind that blew the hair off her face.</p><p>\u201cNo. Jason has never loved.\u201d Closing his arms and his wings around her, he turned his head to look out over the Manhattan skyline as it flickered to glittering life. \u201cIt would be better if he had\u2014then he may have had some good memories to fight the dark.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried to hold on to that thought as she fell into sleep that night, tried to tell herself to remember the laughter and the joy. But it was a nightmare that came after her, choking her with the smell of rancid blood and the gurgling whispers of a dead child lying on a morgue slab, the sounds shaped as fine, sticky strands that were very much real. The cobwebby filaments wrapped around her until she lashed out in panic, tearing herself awake to jerk up into a sitting position.</p><p>Her hand, she realized after long moments, was clenched tight around the hilt of the knife she\u2019d hidden under the mattress on her side of the bed, the metal cold against her palm. Adrenaline pumping, she turned her head\u2014to see Raphael awake and rising from the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome, Elena.\u201d</p><p>It took conscious effort to release the knife from her white-knuckled grip. Placing it beside Destiny\u2019s Rose, the diamond sculpture that was a priceless work of art ... and a gift from her archangel, she took the hand he held out, let him tug her to a standing position. \u201cAre we going flying?\u201d Skin jittery, heart pounding double-time, she felt as if she would break apart.</p> <p>Raphael gave her wings a critical appraisal. \u201cNo. You strained them today.\u201d A glance at the wall clock. \u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>It was five a.m.; the world was still cloaked in night when Raphael led her outside. He\u2019d dressed only in a pair of flowing pants that moved like black water over his form, while she\u2019d pulled on sweatpants and a white silk shirt much too large for her frame. Raphael had said nothing when she\u2019d taken it from his closet, simply sealed the wing slots with a minute flicker of energy so they wouldn\u2019t flap around her.</p><p>It was crisp out, making her cheeks tingle. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked as Raphael led her to the woods on the opposite side to the one that separated his home from Michaela\u2019s.</p><p>Patience.</p><p>Looking around the area she hadn\u2019t yet explored, she realized two things at once. One\u2014Raphael\u2019s estate was huge. And two\u2014they were on a delicately constructed path designed to meld into its surroundings.</p><p>Curiosity fought the remnants of anger and fear. Won. \u201cHow about a clue?\u201d</p><p>Raphael brushed his wing over her own. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s black as pitch, and we\u2019re in the woods. Hmm, not sounding too good . . .\u201d She was tapping her lower lip with a finger when the path curved\u2014to bring them to within ten feet of a small greenhouse lit from within with what looked like three yellow orange heat lamps.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pleasure rolled through her. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Releasing Raphael\u2019s hand, she covered the remaining distance at a run to push through the door and into the humid embrace of a place clearly built to accommodate wings. She was aware of Raphael entering behind her, but her attention was on the luxuriant ferns that hung from the ceiling baskets, their fronds curled and fine; on the sleepy plum-colored blooms of the petunias to her right; and\u2014\u201cBegonias.\u201d Back before Uram, she\u2019d babied her own until they bloomed proud and lush. These sported brown leaves, pitiful flowers. \u201cThey need care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must do what is necessary.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a glance, her fingers itching to pick up the gardening implements she could see sitting on a small bench in the corner. \u201cYou have a gardener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not his territory\u2014he was instructed only to ensure the plants did not die in the interim. It was built for you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak, her chest too tight, too full. Instead, as the Archangel of New York watched with endless patience, she explored the gift he\u2019d given her, something infinitely more precious than the most exclusive clothes, the most expensive jewels. If he hadn\u2019t already owned her heart, she\u2019d have handed it to him right then and there.</p><p>Some time later, Montgomery appeared with a steaming carafe of coffee, buttered slices of toast, small bowls of fruit salad, and a selection of tiny pastries. The butler, dressed with his usual attention to detail, was seemingly not the least nonplused at finding one of the most powerful beings in the world holding up a branch while she trimmed the deadheads. \u201cGood morning, Sire, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Montgomery.\u201d Raphael took the coffee the butler held out, and it struck her then.</p><p>Home.</p><p>She was home.</p><p>Two hours later, her heart overflowing with a quiet, intense happiness, she was on her way to see Sara prior to her meeting with Jeffrey when her cell phone rang. Landing on the nearest flat roof, she answered it to hear her father\u2019s voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to meet tomorrow,\u201d he said at once. \u201cI have an unexpected business situation to deal with today.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve let it go, but the abandoned teenager in her struck out. \u201cFamily always takes second place, doesn\u2019t it, Jeffrey?\u201d</p><p>A sucked in breath, and for an instant, she had the disorientating sensation that she\u2019d wounded him. But when he spoke, it was to thrust the knife into her own heart. \u201cFamily is hardly your specialty, Elieanora.\u201d</p><p>No\u2014because he\u2019d made sure of it.</p><p>Snapping the phone shut, she took off again, her mood shattered. To top it off, Sara wasn\u2019t at the Guild. Frustrated and needing to do something, she decided to head to Ignatius\u2019s apartment. It was unlikely she\u2019d find anything there to explain his bizarre behavior, but\u2014</p><p>A feather of heavenly blue edged with silver tumbled down in front of her.</p><p>Delight had her shrugging off the lingering echoes of Jeffrey\u2019s taunt. Grabbing at the feather, she craned her neck to search for its owner. But on this field, he had her at a massive disadvantage, her ability to hover and turn nowhere near fast enough to catch the angel Galen had called Butterfly.</p><p>Sliding the feather into her pocket to add to the collection she planned to give Zoe, she continued on her way. She glimpsed a whisper of blue with her peripheral vision moments later. \u201cWhen did you get in?\u201d</p><p>For an answer, Illium arrowed his body, his feathers sleek against his back, and dropped toward the skyscrapers as if he was made of stone. She just barely bit back her cry and was pretty sure she was doing a good job of acting nonchalant when he missed a peaked roof by what looked like a millimeter at best and flew back up to hover in front of her, his upper body bare.</p><p>\u201cAw, Ellie.\u201d Eyes like ancient gold coins, even more startling against those incredible black lashes tipped with blue. \u201cNo screaming? You stole all my fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. A nasty ole fun stealer.\u201d But her lips wanted to quirk, her heart ridiculously soft where it concerned the only one of Raphael\u2019s Seven she considered a friend. \u201cYou get stuck with bodyguard duty already?\u201d She and Raphael were going to have to have a talk about his habit of ordering people to shadow her, but she wasn\u2019t going to refuse the protection right this second\u2014because much as it galled, she was a big fat media target at this point, if nothing else.</p><p>She\u2019d already had to detour well out of her way to lose a news chopper that had threatened to send her tumbling down into the steel forest of Manhattan. Unlike Illium, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to pull up in time to avoid massive injury. The idiot reporters didn\u2019t realize she wasn\u2019t as strong as other angels\u2014she couldn\u2019t hold her own against the disruption caused by chopper blades as they sliced through the air.</p><p>Illium, with his wings of silver-kissed blue and a face designed to seduce both males and females, not to mention his ability to do the most impossible acrobatics in the air, would provide a worthy diversion. The fact that he\u2019d decided to ditch half his clothing was just icing on the cake.</p><p>Having shifted position to fly beside her, he now said, \u201cI asked,\u201d answering her earlier question. \u201cI know I\u2019m your favorite.\u201d He brushed his wing over hers when she didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God,\u201d she muttered, fighting a laugh, \u201cif you\u2019ve dusted me with blue, I\u2019ll tie your balls in a knot and hang you up by them on the nearest sharp object I see.\u201d The last time he\u2019d glittered blue angel-dust over her wings, Raphael had\u2014eventually\u2014seen the humor in the situation. She couldn\u2019t guarantee Illium\u2019s health if it happened a second time.</p><p>Illium dipped low, stroking back up with movements that looked lazy but took considerable muscle strength. \u201cBe nice to me or I won\u2019t give you your present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d But he was her favorite of the Seven. How could he not be when he saw her human heart not as a curse, but as a gift? When he would lay down his life for the archangel who was Elena\u2019s? When he laughed with the same easy joy as the children in the Refuge? \u201cSam,\u201d she murmured, her throat thickening at the thought of the boy who\u2019d been so terribly hurt. \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s well, Ellie. We watch over him.\u201d A quiet reminder that for all his laughter and beauty, Illium, too, was a member of Raphael\u2019s Seven. And that he had no qualms over issuing the bloodiest of punishments. She would never forget the sight of him standing in that strange, blooming winter garden, skin bloody and sword flashing lightning-bright as he sliced the wings off angels who\u2019d come to do harm.</p><p>\u201cHe misses you.\u201d</p><p>A silly, happy smile erased the shadow of memory. \u201cI\u2019ve only been gone a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a solemn promise that I would tell you to call him every night. Don\u2019t make me a liar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d Elena adored little Sam, had spent hours with him when she\u2019d been confined to the Medica during her recovery after Beijing. \u201cWhat about Noel?\u201d The adult victim of the archangel Neha\u2019s daughter, Anoushka\u2019s, vicious craving for power had healed of his physical injuries weeks ago. But those weren\u2019t the deepest hurts.</p><p>\u201cHe is ...\u201d Illium paused for a long time. \u201cBroken. Inside, he is broken.\u201d</p><p>Elena knew about being broken. But she also knew about survival. \u201cThe man who survived what was done to him\u201d\u2014blood and meat, that\u2019s all he\u2019d been when they\u2019d found him\u2014\u201cwill survive that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to,\u201d Illium said. \u201cRaphael has assigned him to Nimra\u2019s court. She doesn\u2019t play overt games of power\u2014but even Nazarach does not dare step foot in her territory without invitation.\u201d</p><p>Elena frowned, making a mental note to ask Raphael why he\u2019d sent the damaged vampire into what sounded like a deadly field. Nimra had to be both brutal and cruel if she managed to hold Nazarach at bay, and Noel needed to heal, not fight for his next breath.</p> <p>A chopping-slicing sound. Distinct. Unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened at the black dot growing larger on the horizon with every slap of sound. \u201cDamn it to hell!\u201d It was the same news crew that had been hounding her the entire morning.</p><p>Illium zipped in front of her. \u201cThey dare do this?\u201d His voice was suddenly that of the man who\u2019d amputated angelic wings in cold, clear-eyed retribution. \u201cI will ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Illium.\u201d She managed to grip the muscular warmth of his upper arm. \u201cNo blood, not here. This is my home.\u201d</p><p>That incredible hair\u2014ebony dipped in crushed sapphires, startling and impossible\u2014blew back in the increasing turbulence caused by the chopper. \u201cIf you don\u2019t teach them a lesson now,\u201d he said as she tightened her hold on him to help maintain her position, \u201cthe vultures will see you as weak. You cannot be seen as weak, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Because she was Raphael\u2019s consort.</p> <p>And weakness in an archangel could be fatal.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Strengthening her hold, she screamed against the wind. \u201cHow strong are you?\u201d He was five hundred years old, had survived a deathly plunge into the Hudson, and once glowed with power to her naked eye. But she had no idea what that translated to in terms of physical might.</p><p>\u201cStrong enough to break that machine in half.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cHow about you turn it upside down and land it that way instead?\u201d She squeezed his arm, felt muscle and tendon shift under her touch as he took more of her weight. \u201cNo fatalities, Bluebell.\u201d</p><p>Illium blinked, met her gaze ... then gave a slow, wicked smile. \u201cWhere do you go?\u201d When she told him, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>She released his arm and dropped below the turbulence as fast as possible, clearing off in a direction that would take her out of the path of any activity. But she wasn\u2019t so distant that she missed the sight of Illium flying above the machine.</p><p>Her throat dried up, and if he\u2019d been close enough to hear her, she\u2019d have told him to stop. Dear God, those blades would shred his wings if he made a single error of judgment. But then Illium\u2014laughing, playful, powerful Illium, did something and the blades just . . . stopped. He let the chopper free-fall for two stomach-churning seconds before catching it from below and flipping it over.</p><p>She realized the fiend was having fun.</p> <p>Shaking her head, she carried on toward Ignatius\u2019s apartment, which ended up being very close to the Tower. Thankfully, the high-rise had a flat roof, so she didn\u2019t have to make a tight landing. Skidding across the rough surface, she took a minute to catch her breath before searching for and finding the entrance to the building. It was locked.</p><p>\u201cAsh, thank you again.\u201d The other hunter had not only taught Elena how to pick locks with the skill of a master jewel thief\u2014and didn\u2019t that just bring up all sorts of intriguing questions\u2014she\u2019d given Elena a set of slim lock-pick tools that she carried in a special pocket built into the knife sheath on her thigh.</p><p>Pulling out the pick she needed, she went to work. \u201cToo easy.\u201d She squeezed through the tiny metal door, a hiss escaping her mouth as her right wing scraped along the rusty edges.</p><p>Glancing back, she saw that while a few deep blue feathers bore flecks of metal, there was no blood. Probably the best she could\u2019ve hoped for, she thought, deciding against the elevator at the end of the service corridor\u2014who knew how tiny that would be. Instead, she took the stairs down three levels to the floor where Ignatius had had his apartment.</p><p>She scented him the moment she opened the stairwell door and stepped into the corridor\u2014the burnt treacle of his scent was imprinted in the walls, in the carpet. But not only his. There were, in fact, so many vampiric scents threaded through the air that she wondered if this wasn\u2019t an \u201coverflow\u201d building, used by vampires who weren\u2019t high enough in the hierarchy to rate a room in the Tower, but needed to be close to it.</p><p>A door opened down the hall as she stopped in front of Ignatius\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Crushed diamonds in aged brandy, decadent chocolate stroking over her breasts, fur sumptuous and thick against her most intimate flesh.</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She got the question out between gritted teeth, fighting the hotly sexual need aroused by Dmitri\u2019s insidious scent\u2014a need that was a compulsion disguised as seduction. It made her wonder just how many hunter-born had fallen prey to that snare. And what Dmitri had done to them.</p><p>\u201cI had business with another resident.\u201d The vampire strolled over, his hands in the pockets of his stone gray suit pants. He\u2019d discarded the jacket and the open collar of his white shirt exposed a triangle of skin the shade of sun gold honey.</p><p>Rich, dark eyes met hers . . . right as another wave of scent\u2014luscious and primal in its erotic promise\u2014crashed over her senses. Her knees threatened to crumple. \u201cSo,\u201d she managed to get out through a throat gone husky with driving hunger, \u201cthe truce is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to think we were friends.\u201d It was the kind of thing she was used to hearing from Dmitri, but there was a thrumming anger beneath the words today, the same anger she\u2019d sensed as they stood looking down at Betsy\u2019s desecrated body.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take it personally. She\u2019d stood over too many broken and mutilated victims, knew what it was to want to strike out, make someone pay. The desire was a quiet, unremitting fury that could destroy. If her friends in the Guild hadn\u2019t pulled her back when she\u2019d gotten too close, hadn\u2019t taught her the brutal necessity of emotional distance, she\u2019d have fallen into the abyss long ago. So yes, she understood\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean she was about to allow Dmitri to use her as his whipping boy.</p><p>He was so close now that the heat of him caressed her body in long, languid strokes, his scent twining around her like a thousand silken strands. Breathing through her mouth, she put one hand on his heavily muscled shoulder, leaned in close as if she planned to whisper in his ear ... and bit down on his earlobe.</p><p>HARD.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He wrenched away with preternatural speed.</p><p>\u201cGame over?\u201d she asked with poisonous sweetness as she struggled to catch her breath. \u201cOr do you want a matching set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d A slow, sensual smile that no longer held the raw edge of rage. \u201cAlways liked that about you.\u201d</p><p>Sliding back the dagger she\u2019d pulled the same instant that she bit him, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this with you here.\u201d Even muted as it was now, his scent blinded her to anything else in the vicinity. It was a drug, that scent, addictive and toxic. \u201cGet out or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Her flat statement made him blink, rock back on his heels. \u201cYou sound as if you really mean that.\u201d</p><p>At that instant, she did. Allowing the knowledge to seep into her expression, she met those eyes filled with a confident, potent sexuality. Slater had touched her with his scent, nearly broken the mind of the child she\u2019d been\u2014a child who didn\u2019t understand why her body liked what the monster was doing to her. Her horror of compulsion ran deep, deep enough to drive her to the most primitive savagery in a bid to survive.</p><p>Dmitri inclined his head, withdrawing all but a final taunting tendril of scent. \u201cI think you might want this.\u201d A slender metal key dangled from his finger.</p><p>She stepped aside.</p><p>To her surprise, he prowled forward and inserted the key into the lock without further jerking her chain. Her eyes were drawn to the droplets of blood on his shoulder. \u201cYou bring out the worst in me.\u201d</p><p>Nudging open the door, he turned, a faint smile on that face meant for silk-sheeted bedrooms and blood-soaked fields of battle. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come inside before I got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He leaned in the doorway while she walked through and into the living room. \u201cI hear your Bluebell is here.\u201d A pregnant pause.</p><p>Neck prickling in warning, she shifted to keep him in her line of sight. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful with Illium, Elena.\u201d A soft caution. \u201cHe\u2019s vulnerable to the humanity you carry within.\u201d He was gone the next instant.</p><p>Frozen by the impact of the unexpected words, she started when she heard the whisper of angelic wings. \u201cStay there.\u201d She kept her back to Illium as she spoke. \u201cI want to do a walk-through first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wish. My command.\u201d</p><p>His unruffled agreement cut the taut rope of tension running up her spine. Glancing over at him, she saw that he was playing a carved silver knife in and around his fingers, each flick blindingly fast. Her friend, she thought. He was her friend, just like Ransom, just like Sara, and she wouldn\u2019t damage that friendship with false worries.</p><p>He has a fascination with mortals.</p><p>Raphael had said that to her before she\u2019d woken with wings of midnight and dawn.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at me, Ellie?\u201d Illium said without taking his eyes from the blade dancing around his fingers.</p><p>The words were instinctive, something she might as easily have said to rib Ransom. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, it\u2019s difficult to resist.\u201d</p><p>A flashing grin, a hint of that aristocratic English accent in his response. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be me, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Snorting, but with her composure restored, she began to inspect the apartment. It was much as she\u2019d expected. Ignatius had been neat enough, but not obsessive about it. She could see a glass in the sink, a sweater thrown over the sofa, and the bed, though made, was done so in a way that said he was more worried about comfort than anything else. There was even a flower in a vase on the bedside table\u2014a bit exotic for her taste, but vampires tended to go for the dark and lush. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Returning to the living area, she nodded Illium inside. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weird here. No scents that shouldn\u2019t belong, no signs that he was losing his mind.\u201d Vampires in bloodlust often destroyed their homes during the first surge. \u201cSupports what we saw at the scene\u2014that he was in control of his faculties when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d Illium\u2019s voice was as lethal as the sword he wore along his spine.</p><p>Guard up, she walked to where he stood in the bedroom doorway, followed his gaze to the glossy black of the hothouse orchid that stood on the bedside table. \u201cTell me what that means.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, his gaze focused inward.</p> <p>An instant later, the wind and the rain, crisp and clean, filled her mind. Illium tells me it is a pale, scentless facsimile of the original, but it is nonetheless her symbol. Raphael\u2019s voice was so strong, she knew he had to be in the Tower. My mother is waking.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, she stared at the luxuriant black of the petals, a color so deep and rich she\u2019d never before seen its like. She was controlling Ignatius?</p><p>Perhaps. It\u2019s more likely she simply took advantage of urges he would have otherwise kept contained.</p><p>Elena blew out a breath, biting down on her lower lip. It\u2019s a little pat, don\u2019t you think, Archangel?</p><p>A pause. Wait there. I will join you.</p> <p>Turning to Illium, Elena raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow did you know about the orchid? You weren\u2019t born until hundreds of years after Caliane\u2019s disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did read some of my history books in school.\u201d A disgruntled look. \u201cJessamy used to threaten to tie me to a desk unless I did my homework.\u201d</p><p>She could just see him, a blue-winged boy with eyes of gold and a smile full of mischief. But tempting as it was to follow that thought, she focused on the death that seemed to be stalking those closest to her. While she wasn\u2019t convinced that Caliane had anything to do with this, about one thing she had no doubts whatsoever. \u201cRaphael is the ultimate target.\u201d</p><p>Everyone else was collateral damage.</p><p>Her hands fisted against the cold-blooded malice of that truth just as Raphael walked into the room. Brushing his wing over her own, he moved past her to pick up the orchid. \u201cIllium,\u201d he said, \u201cleave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p> <p>Only after Illium was gone did Elena walk over to put her hand on Raphael\u2019s arm, her eye on the flower that had seemed an innocent decoration minutes earlier. \u201cEven if your mother is waking,\u201d she said, having had time to think things through, \u201cthe turmoil around the world says that that awakening is hardly a calm, ordered thing. But going after my half sisters? That was very much a calculated act\u2014a conscious act.\u201d</p><p>Raphael dropped the orchid onto the clear glass of the bedside table. \u201cYou are forgetting my rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. That came out of nowhere, like the ice storms and other disasters. Who\u2019s to say the rest of the Cadre isn\u2019t feeling the same impact?\u201d</p><p>Raphael went motionless. \u201cYou are right, Elena. I will speak to my people, find out if any of the other archangels have acted unlike themselves of late.\u201d Lifting his hand, he stroked his fingers along the sensitive arch of her wing.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cYou ask me\u2014someone is using the disruption caused by the waking of an Ancient to his or her own advantage. Everyone knows the possibilities, knows that the one who wakes might well be your mother.\u201d And that even an archangel could be blinded by the black crush of memory. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to rattle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey harm what is mine,\u201d Raphael murmured, \u201cby harming those you love.\u201d His hand fisted in her hair. \u201cIt is a coward\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the cold condemnation in that statement, she knew the architect\u2014or architects\u2014of this vicious game would soon find themselves in the crosshairs of the Archangel of New York.</p><p>They were about to take off a few minutes later when Elena mentioned she was heading over to see if Sara had returned to the office.</p> <p>\u201cIllium will go with you.\u201d</p><p>Elena blew out a breath, ready for battle. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not have time for this, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>She went to snap back a demand that he make time, but one look at his expression and annoyance was swept aside by a deeper, far more intense emotion. \u201cRaphael, you look ...\u201d Cruel. Heartless. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>His answer was austere. \u201cA vampire thought to betray me. Now I must punish him.\u201d</p><p>Ice trailed up her spine. Closing the small distance between them, she put her hand on the tip of his wing, holding him to her. His responding glance was that of the immortal he was\u2014someone for whom mercy was a weakness. \u201cWould you stop me, Elena?\u201d A question asked without intonation as she moved to face him.</p><p>Spreading out her own wings to keep her balance on the edge of the roof, she narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m no innocent. You damn well know that.\u201d</p><p>Midnight strands of hair danced over his face as the wind stroked through them, possessive as a lover. \u201cYet you stand in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you need to control your vampires.\u201d Every hunter knew the truth\u2014that the almost-immortals were predators under the skin. Given free reign, they\u2019d drown Manhattan in crimson, turn it into an abattoir devoid of life. \u201cYou have to deal with transgressions hard and fast to ensure no repeats.\u201d</p><p>Raphael continued to watch her with that quiet, remote patience.</p><p>Frustrated, she growled low in her throat and grabbing at the white linen of his shirt, pulled him down toward her. She knew she\u2019d startled him, but his hands locked tight around her hips to keep her from overbalancing on the ledge.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said against those perfectly shaped lips that could turn cruel without warning. \u201cYou\u2019re my priority. Punish who you must, but don\u2019t do anything so terrible that it pushes you into the Quiet.\u201d She hadn\u2019t known him in that inhuman, emotionless state, was terrified of losing him to it even now. \u201cNot that. Never again, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>A shudder passed through him, his hands flexing on her hips as he tugged her to his body. \u201cYou hold me to the earth, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Able to feel the heated strength of him against her abdomen, she nipped at his lower lip with her teeth, relief a whisper of rain against her senses. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d Moving her hand down to play over the amber he wore on the ring finger of his left hand, she used those same teeth on his jaw. \u201cYou belong to me, Archangel. And I look after what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>An hour after he\u2019d watched Elena\u2019s wings sweep out toward the Guild in a play of midnight and dawn, Raphael turned his attention to the vampire who huddled in a chair in front of the black granite of his desk, a weak, whimpering creature who\u2019d sought to steal from an archangel. The stupidity of the act aside, the fact that he\u2019d even considered he might get away with it argued to a greater rot. Raphael intended to excise that rot from existence before this day was done.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m going to do with you?\u201d he asked softly from where he stood by the huge window that looked out over Manhattan. He\u2019d punished and executed many over the centuries that he had ruled, but he had not expected betrayal in the heart of his territory and that honed his anger into a gleaming blade.</p><p>\u201cSire, I didn\u2019t\u2014I\u2014\u201d Blubbering words running together in an unintelligible babble.</p><p>Raphael let him speak until he ran out of words. \u201cTell me why,\u201d he said, turning to watch for his hunter in the skies as he had a habit of doing.</p><p>A sniffle, a sucking in of air. \u201cShe said you would never know.\u201d</p><p>Raphael swiveled to face the vampire. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Compulsively rubbing together his hands, he said, \u201cOne of the head accountants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a name.\u201d How deep did this treachery run?</p><p>\u201cOleander Graves.\u201d</p><p>Raphael knew all of his senior people, and that name wasn\u2019t on the list.</p><p>\u201cShe said you\u2019d never know,\u201d the vampire blubbered again, bringing Raphael\u2019s mind back to the unpleasant task at hand. \u201cShe was so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Weak, Raphael thought in disgust. The male was so weak, he should\u2019ve never made it into the Tower, but even immortals sometimes made mistakes. Without further words, Raphael reached out with his power and crushed the vampire\u2019s rib cage into his chest, piercing his internal organs.</p><p>As blood bubbled out of the man\u2019s mouth, Raphael knew that to those outside the Tower the punishment would appear barbaric. They knew nothing of the bloodlust that lurked near the surface of so many vampiric minds, how easy it would be for the monsters to roam free. And this damage would heal in a day at most. The real punishment was yet to come. \u201cYou are to go to ground for the next decade.\u201d</p><p>Panic in those eyes, a plea that Raphael could not heed, not if he intended to keep the Hudson from running a dark ruby red. He was an archangel\u2014even if every vampire in the city surrendered to bloodlust, he\u2019d gain control within hours at most, but to do so, he\u2019d have to slaughter hundreds of the Made. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>As the vampire left, clutching broken ribs and fighting not to dribble blood on the pristine white of the carpet, Raphael turned back to the window. The sentence was just, but it would likely break a mind as weak as the one that had just scuttled out of his office. Any other punishment would\u2019ve given encouragement to others who might seek to betray me. Reaching out to speak to Elena was not a conscious decision.</p><p>Raphael?</p><p>I sentenced him to be buried alive in a coffin-sized box, he told his hunter with the heart of a mortal. He will be fed enough to be kept alive and whole, but he will remain in that box for ten years.</p><p>Shock, worry, pain, he felt the cascade of her emotions like blows.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Raphael. I\u2019m sorry he put you in a position where you had to make that choice.</p><p>In spite of her earlier words, he\u2019d expected her to be horrified by what he\u2019d done, for this was not something she could have expected. It was not a human punishment. But he\u2019d forgotten that she was a woman who\u2019d survived a monster, who understood that sometimes there were no easy choices. Come to me after your talk with Sara. I would hold you.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, there was a flicker of midnight and dawn on the horizon as his consort dropped down from the clouds not far from the Tower; Illium\u2019s distinctive wings remained in shadow. The blue-winged angel had an open affection for Raphael\u2019s hunter, and he\u2019d let it go\u2014would continue to let it go . . . so long as Illium never forgot that Elena was mate to an archangel. I have her.</p><p>Sire. The angel cut away in another direction.</p><p>Wait. I received a message for you earlier today.</p><p>A questioning silence.</p><p>The Hummingbird wishes to see her son.</p><p>Quiet, such quiet. I will go to her.</p><p>No. She is coming to New York.</p><p>He felt Illium\u2019s shock. The Hummingbird seldom left her secluded mountain home, and even then, it was only to go to the Refuge. We will watch over her, Illium. Have no fear of that.</p><p>The Hummingbird had saved Raphael from excruciating pain when she\u2019d found him on that forsaken field where Caliane had shattered his body like so much glass, and for such would\u2019ve earned his loyalty. But Illium\u2019s mother had gone beyond that\u2014she\u2019d shown a broken young boy incredible kindness at a time when his whole world was falling apart. There was little Raphael would not do for the Hummingbird. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sire, I must\u2014</p><p>Go, Raphael said, knowing the angel needed time to get his mind around the news. She arrives in a week\u2019s time. He was walking out onto his private balcony as he spoke, switching the mental connection. Come, Elena.</p><p>I can\u2019t land there. I\u2019ll brain myself.</p><p>He almost laughed, and he had not thought he could do that after the sentence he\u2019d just delivered. I will catch you.</p> <p>That she didn\u2019t question him after that, simply changed trajectory so that she flew into his arms ... it broke him. Then it reformed him anew. \u201cElena,\u201d he whispered into her hair as he crushed her to him.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, his fragile consort with her incredible will and her refusal to surrender. \u201cTell me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And he, an archangel used to keeping a thousand secrets, told her.</p><p>10</p><p>Evening shadows lay heavy on the horizon when Elena walked out across the lawn behind Raphael\u2019s\u2014their\u2014home, heading for the edge of the cliff beyond the trees. After leaving the Tower earlier that afternoon, the intimacy of those moments on the balcony a tight warmth in her chest, she\u2019d called a delighted Sam using the Web link in the library.</p> <p>\u201cEllie!\u201d His grin had stretched from ear to ear. \u201cYou didn\u2019t forget me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Laughing as he bounced in his seat, those wings that looked too big for his body rising and falling in excitement as loose black curls tumbled over his forehead, she\u2019d asked him how his day had gone.</p><p>\u201cFather took me flying again!\u201d</p><p>Since Sam had been forbidden from using his wings for another month, his father had begun to carry him up into the sky in his arms, his love for Sam a fierce thing no one could miss, in spite of the fact that he was a man of few words. \u201cWas it fun?\u201d</p><p>An enthusiastic nod. \u201cHe can go so fast.\u201d</p><p>Their conversation had lasted half an hour, with Elena exchanging a few words with Sam\u2019s mother as well. The tiny angel with hair of the same lustrous blue black and wings of dusty brown streaked with white, still touched her baby with protective care, but she smiled just as often\u2014and for the first time, Elena truly believed that the small family would be okay.</p> <p>She\u2019d spent the remaining time doing flying drills, all of them geared to build up her muscles, with an oddly subdued Illium. Having discussed it with Keir, Raphael had told her that she wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve a true vertical takeoff without wing strength of a kind she simply did not have. It was a physical impossibility.</p><p>\u201cYour immortality,\u201d he\u2019d murmured as they stood on the balcony, \u201chas not yet grown deep enough into your cells. But,\u201d he\u2019d added, \u201cgiven your hunter strength, you may well be able to learn to do a bastardized version that relies not on the power of your wings, but on sheer muscle.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d be a much harder road and each takeoff would hurt like a bitch even after she mastered it, but Elena wasn\u2019t about to be a sitting duck, not if she could do something about it. Maybe she was an immortal new-Made, she thought now, trying to see through the straggling clouds, but she would not be easy prey.</p><p>There.</p><p>The magnificent breadth of Raphael\u2019s wings came into view as he descended to join her on the clifftop, the tips flaming as they caught the last vestiges of a sun that had finally made an appearance late that afternoon. \u201cYou go to visit the Guild Director and her family?\u201d</p><p>Pushing off strands of hair that had escaped her braid, she said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>A slow blink. \u201cThey are your closest friends, Elena. They wish to have you to themselves for this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m becoming part of your world\u2014come become part of mine.\u201d She saw the surprise on his face, saw, too, that he\u2019d very much not expected the invitation.</p> <p>His body was a hard wall of muscle against her as he pulled her close, until her breasts pressed against his chest. \u201cWhat will Sara and Deacon say to that?\u201d</p><p>She ran her hands down the wings he spread for her, indulging in the ability to touch him as she pleased. \u201cNot scared of a couple of hunters are you, Archangel?\u201d</p><p>A flare of absolute blue as his lashes lifted. They may choose to sever their friendship with you rather than welcome me into their home. You cannot forget the actions I took in the Quiet.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But she also knew something else beyond any shadow of a doubt. \u201cYou have your Seven. I have my friends\u2014they\u2019d cut off their right arms before they\u2019d shove me out into the cold.\u201d</p><p>Such loyalty, Raphael thought. He wouldn\u2019t have believed mortals capable of it except that he had known Dmitri when he was human ... and he had known Elena. \u201cThe invitation is very welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI will accept it another day. Tonight, I must remain here.\u201d</p><p>Pale gray eyes sparked with intelligence. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting with Aodhan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? In New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too, am surprised.\u201d Aodhan preferred the seclusion of the Refuge. \u201cWe meet at the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Tucking back another flyaway strand of hair, his consort looked him full in the face. \u201cI want to talk to you about something else, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have of me, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a bodyguard anymore\u2014Illium\u2019s trick today with the helicopter seems to have gotten the message across to the media hounds.\u201d</p><p>You are my heart, Elena. He would not allow anything to happen to her.</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cNo chains, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>He closed his hand around her nape, refusing to permit her to distance herself. \u201cI have allowed you much freedom, but on this I will not budge.\u201d</p><p>Temper sparked off her. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to you to allow me anything. I\u2019m your consort. Treat me as one!\u201d</p><p>Yet she was so very mortal still\u2014even the Angel-born remained vulnerable for over a hundred years, and Elena had started out mortal. Immortality had barely kissed her blood, had had no real chance to intertwine with her cells. You will not win this argument, Hunter.</p><p>\u201cFine, but it\u2019s one we\u2019ll continue to have every single day till you start acting reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Until her, no one had challenged him on this level. Until her, no one had loved him with all the strength in this hunter\u2019s soul. \u201cAccording to Dmitri, the most sensible act would have been to kill you the instant we met.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cStop trying to distract me.\u201d Breaking his hold with a move he hadn\u2019t expected, she picked up the small bag he\u2019d noticed at her feet. \u201cRaphael?\u201d</p><p>Catching the suddenly somber note in her voice, he lifted his eyes to the changeable mists of her eyes. \u201cHunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t clip my wings. It\u2019ll destroy both of us.\u201d</p><p>With those disturbing words, she dove down across the Hudson. As he watched her disappear toward Manhattan, aware that Illium would trail her to the Guild Director\u2019s home\u2014where another of his Seven had stood watch for hours to ensure no unwelcome surprises\u2014he knew she was right. She would never be happy in a cage. But after the events that had almost stolen her from him not once, but twice, he wasn\u2019t sure he had the ability to set her free.</p><p>Elena shoved the argument\u2014and the reason behind it\u2014to the back of her mind as she came to a smooth landing in front of the brownstone that was Sara and Deacon\u2019s. Her best friend dragged her inside an instant later ... where Elena got a welcome surprise. \u201cYou bought the neighboring town house!\u201d They\u2019d taken out the facing walls of both homes, then closed the small gap between the two buildings by extending one of the houses.</p><p>Since Elena hadn\u2019t noticed anything from the outside, they had to have recycled the materials removed during the demolition of the walls to build a seamless exterior over the extension. Fantastic as that was, it didn\u2019t compare to the inside\u2014the entire first floor was a massive open-plan space that flowed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Sara beamed, her rich coffee-colored skin all but glowing. \u201cWith the way Deacon\u2019s business is going, we could afford it so we decided why not.\u201d A pause. \u201cMore important, I wanted my best friend to feel welcome in my home.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing the knot of emotion in her throat, Elena put down her bag to wander over the gleaming wooden floors covered with Navajo rugs that matched the warm, earth-toned color scheme of the house. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous, Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon did most of the renovation himself\u2014Zoe and I just held boards, took him the occasional nail, and generally supervised.\u201d A big grin.</p><p>\u201cI know you chose the colors.\u201d Feeling totally at ease, she spread her wings. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Ellie,\u201d Sara said on a gasp, clutching the back of the sofa. \u201cEach time you do that, I start to feel faint.\u201d</p><p>Elena was laughing at the look on her friend\u2019s face when a big, bad-ass man with deep green eyes, golden skin, and dark hair walked into the room, a little girl cradled in the crook of his arm. \u201cDeacon.\u201d Smiling, Elena moved close enough that he could tug her into a one-armed embrace.</p><p>He held her for several long seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Ellie.\u201d Quiet, powerful words.</p><p>Looking up, she met the eyes of the child who\u2019d tucked her head shyly against her father\u2019s neck. \u201cHello, Zoe,\u201d she whispered, amazed at how big Sara\u2019s baby had become in the year and a half since Elena had last seen her.</p><p>Sara came over then, picking up one tiny hand and pressing a kiss on Zoe\u2019s palm. \u201cThis is Auntie Ellie, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>That was when a massive hellhound of a dog came around the corner, heading straight for Elena. \u201cSlayer!\u201d Laughing as he jumped on her, intent on loving her to death, she looked up to see Zoe giggling.</p><p>It made her want to tug the girl into her arms and pepper that precious face with kisses, but she was a stranger to Zoe right now. A stranger with bribes. \u201cI have presents for you,\u201d she said after Deacon pulled Slayer off with one hand.</p><p>Eyes the same dark color as Sara\u2019s went wide with interest.</p><p>Giving Slayer a final scratch that had his tail wagging triple-time, Elena went to her bag and took out the handcrafted doll she\u2019d bought from one of the artisans at the Refuge. Zoe took it with careful hands, rising away from her father\u2019s shoulder to pat at the doll\u2019s thick curls.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, baby girl?\u201d Deacon prompted.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s \u201cThank you\u201d was shy.</p><p>Elena said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d and retrieved the collection of angel feathers she\u2019d been saving since she woke from the coma. Startling gold and white, blue edged with silver, midnight and dawn, shimmering gray, a sweet, beautiful brown, and an incredible crystalline white, they made Zoe hold her breath. When Elena lifted her hand, her goddaughter stared in wonder ... then closed one fist gently around the feathers. \u201cPapa. Down.\u201d</p><p>Obeying the order, Deacon bent to put her on the floor. Feathers in hand, Zoe toddled over to the coffee table and put her treasures on the glass so she could admire them one by one, the doll held close to her side. Slayer, having been banished to sit by the mantel, sidled around to stand next to his favorite human being. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sara touched her hand to Deacon\u2019s heart when he wrapped a heavily muscled arm around her shoulders. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have something for Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go grab it.\u201d Kissing his wife on the nose, the former bogeyman of the Guild prowled out of the room after ruffling Zoe\u2019s tiny curls.</p><p>\u201cI got you and Deacon gifts as well,\u201d Elena said. \u201cFrom the Refuge. Found a gorgeous collar for your monster dog, too.\u201d</p><p>Sara took her hands, squeezed. \u201cThe best gift is you, here. I missed you so much.\u201d</p> <p>Elena had to look down for a second to blink away the surge of emotion. Sara wasn\u2019t her blood, but she was her sister in every other way that mattered. \u201cI had a run-in with Jeffrey.\u201d It spilled out, the one subject she hadn\u2019t been able to talk about when they\u2019d met earlier, the wound too raw. \u201cHe\u2019s furious that the girls have been targeted because of me, and I can\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s jaw tensed. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right this time, Sara.\u201d Guilt twisted through her, a hard, abrasive rope. \u201cBut at least that\u2019s something I understand. What I don\u2019t know is why he wants to meet me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d That was when she felt a small, baby-soft hand patting at her feathers with unhidden wonder. \u201cHey, sweetheart.\u201d Looking down into that adorable face, she decided to push Jeffrey, the murders, her frustration with Raphael\u2019s protectiveness, out of her mind and just enjoy spending time with the family of a friend who\u2019d opened her heart to Elena when she\u2019d been nothing but a scared girl without home or hope.</p> <p>I\u2019ll watch over you, she promised Zoe silently, though the thought of surviving her best friend was an aching sorrow in her heart. Over you and all who come after you. Sara\u2019s blood.</p><p>Having received the message of Aodhan\u2019s arrival, Raphael swept down across the sparkling nightscape of Manhattan to land on the wide Tower balcony outside his office\u2014where the angel stood waiting. Unlike Illium, who even with his remarkable wings and eyes of gold, managed to walk among mortals, Aodhan would never fit easily into this world. He was cut in sparkling ice, his wings so bright as to almost hurt human eyes, his face and his skin seeming to be created from marble overlaid with white-gold.</p><p>Michaela, that devourer of men, had once said of Aodhan, \u201cBeautiful\u2014but so very cold, that one. Still, I would like to keep him as I would a precious gem. There is no other like Aodhan in the world.\u201d</p><p>But Michaela saw only the surface.</p><p>Raphael walked to the edge of the space that had no railing, running his eyes over his city. \u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d</p><p>Aodhan tightened his wings to avoid any contact as he came to stand on Raphael\u2019s left. \u201cI cannot understand,\u201d he said instead of answering, \u201chow you can live surrounded by so many lives.\u201d A stark curiosity underlay his every word.</p> <p>\u201cMany cannot understand your preference for solitude.\u201d He watched as a number of angels came in for landings on lower balconies, their wings silhouetted against the night sky. \u201cYou surprise me with this visit, Aodhan.\u201d The angel was one of Raphael\u2019s Seven for a reason, but he was also damaged.</p><p>\u201cIt is . . . difficult.\u201d Aodhan\u2019s expression was haunted in a way that not many would\u2019ve understood. \u201cBut your hunter ... She is so weak, and yet she fought the reborn with unflinching courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena will find it amusing that she is an inspiration.\u201d Yet she would also understand what it meant for Aodhan to take this step, his hunter with her mortal heart.</p><p>Aodhan was silent for another long moment. \u201cEast,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNaasir and I both believe the Ancient Sleeps in the Far East.\u201d</p><p>With Galen in charge at the Refuge, Raphael had set Aodhan and Naasir the task of searching for clues as to the location of the Sleeper who might well be his mother. However, he hadn\u2019t expected any kind of an answer so soon. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessamy tells me that when an Ancient awakens, it is not a process of a few days or even weeks. It can take up to a year.\u201d His crystalline eyes, fractured outward from the pupil, reflected a thousand shards of light as he spoke. \u201cYet not one of the Cadre sensed this.\u201d</p><p>Raphael understood at once. \u201cBecause the region falls in Lijuan\u2019s shadow.\u201d Any fluctuations in power in that area had been attributed to Lijuan\u2019s evolution. \u201cKeep searching.\u201d The temptation to join the hunt was strong, but after having been absent from his Tower for so long, he couldn\u2019t leave it for what might turn out to be weeks\u2014too many covetous eyes were trained on his domain.</p><p>Aodhan bent his head. \u201cSire.\u201d</p> <p>As the angel began to expand his wings in preparation for flight, Raphael stopped him with a single touch on the shoulder. Aodhan froze.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Sam.\u201d Knowing the demons that tormented the angel, Raphael broke the contact. \u201cElena gave him a dagger. Legend says the ruby in the dagger was a gift from a sleeping dragon. It may be nothing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it may denote knowledge of an Ancient.\u201d Aodhan\u2019s wings glittered in a stray shaft of moonlight as he hesitated. \u201cSire, I would come to this city again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have acted the coward for centuries. No more.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had been there when Aodhan was found, had carried the other angel in his arms the hours it took to reach the Medica and Keir. \u201cYou are no coward, Aodhan. You are one of my Seven.\u201d</p><p>Aodhan glanced back toward the office, in the direction of the wide shelves of deep ebony that lined one wall. \u201cWhy do you not display one of my feathers? My wings are as unusual as Bluebell\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised an eyebrow. \u201cIllium is a performer.\u201d While Aodhan, like Jason, preferred the shadows.</p><p>As he watched, Aodhan pulled out a perfect, glittering feather and walked inside to place it beside the heavenly blue that was Illium\u2019s. Raphael inclined his head when the angel returned. \u201cAfter this task is done, you will move here.\u201d Manhattan was still reeling from Elena\u2019s return\u2014Aodhan\u2019s presence might just bring the city to a standstill. But that was a problem for another day. \u201cIf you and Naasir are able to narrow the search area to a specific locality, call and wait for me. Do not approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is her . . . you believe she will kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is the specter in the dark, Aodhan, the nightmare that whispers in the hindbrain.\u201d And he was her son ... the son of two archangels gone insane.</p><p>11</p><p>It was after Zoe had been put to bed, and the adults had finished dinner that Elena opened the box Deacon had brought down and saw the weapon he\u2019d created for a hunter with wings.</p><p>\u201cOoooh.\u201d Delirious with pleasure, she picked up what seemed to be a modified crossbow, so small and light that\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be strapped to my leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Deacon grabbed the harness and got her to stand so he could buckle it around her thigh. \u201cI decided it would be problematic on the shoulder\u2014your wings would be too close, too easy to damage.\u201d</p><p>Nodding in agreement, Elena checked the weapon. \u201cBalance shouldn\u2019t be an issue in flight, given its weight. But what the heck is this?\u201d She pulled out a small, circular blade, its serrated edges razor-sharp and felt her eyes widen. \u201cIt shoots these things? Like the weapon you\u2019ve got?\u201d The weapon she\u2019d lusted after since the day she\u2019d first seen it, in the middle of a junkyard crawling with vampires.</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s also designed so you can use it one-handed if required.\u201d He tightened the harness. \u201cSlot it in.\u201d</p><p>Flipping the safety, Elena did so, then took a few steps. \u201cLight, portable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tested it on me,\u201d Sara said from where she was curled up on the couch, bowl of strawberry ice cream in hand. \u201cSince I\u2019m shorter and not as strong, I thought you\u2019d have no problem.\u201d</p><p>Elena stroked the weapon, felt her hunter instincts sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Deacon, come here.\u201d</p><p>When he stepped close, she reached up and smacked a kiss on his beautiful lips. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Sara said from the couch, waving a spoon in the air. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Elena shifted the harness a fraction higher as Deacon went to sit beside Sara and steal her ice cream. The moment was so normal that for an instant, she could almost believe she\u2019d never left New York, never fallen into the arms of an archangel.</p><p>Then her cell phone rang.</p><p>Having followed Illium to the location, Deacon\u2019s gift strapped to her thigh, Elena took extreme care as she angled in to land\u2014tired, she was liable to make mistakes, and this was not the time for a broken arm or leg. Below her, the green heart of Manhattan lay swathed in darkness but for the old-fashioned lamps along the pathways that meandered through the park.</p><p>\u201cOof.\u201d Coming down hard, with a power that made her knees ache, she closed the distance to where another one of Raphael\u2019s Seven stood beside an indistinct lump on the ground.</p><p>Poison, the pungent stink of bowels evacuated, viscera ... and below it, the whisper of violets dipped in ice.</p><p>Gorge rising, she nonetheless made herself look at the body. The male\u2014a vampire from his scent\u2014had been beheaded, but that had been done last if she was any judge, after his organs had been ripped out then thrust back into his body in the wrong places. As far as brutality went, it wasn\u2019t as bad as anything Uram had done, but the bloodborn archangel had made a vicious art form out of murder.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked Venom.</p><p>The male had been at death\u2019s door not long ago, but you couldn\u2019t tell that from his current appearance. Dressed in his usual black on black suit, his reptilian eyes shaded by wrap-around sunglasses even in the darkness, he looked like he\u2019d stepped out of the pages of some exclusive magazine. \u201cThe accountant Raphael sentenced to go to ground.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t need him to spell out the fact that someone was playing games here. \u201cWhere\u2019s Raphael?\u201d</p><p>Venom continued to give her straight answers for once. \u201cAt the site where this man was supposed to be buried tonight. Since this murder is unlikely to be a chance event, the killer may have staked out the other location. But this site is your best bet of catching a scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d From the pattern of blood, the churned up dirt and grass, this was where the victim had been murdered, which meant the killer\u2019s scent should be a violent stain across the entire area.</p><p>Filtering out Venom\u2019s vampiric signature, she picked up the scent of violets and crushed ice again ... but with this much carnage, there was no way to be certain it was the victim\u2019s at a distance. Girding her stomach, she went to her knees\u2014careful to avoid the splatter\u2014and bent. But she couldn\u2019t reach the body without placing her hands in blood-soaked evidence. \u201cVenom, hold me at the waist.\u201d</p><p>Strong, cool hands around her waist an instant later. She fought the instinctive urge to throw off the intimate hold and, trusting him to keep her from falling on the body\u2014and yeah, that trust came hard\u2014leaned in close enough to sniff at a patch of unravaged skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Violets. Ice. And a hereto hidden undertone of something light, fruity. Watermelon?</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s hands tightened for an instant, and she almost hoped he\u2019d attempt to drop her. But he behaved, and she was on her feet moments later. \u201cI have his scent,\u201d she said, gesturing to the body, \u201cand I\u2019ve weeded out yours. Anyone else been on the scene?\u201d</p><p>He pointed up. \u201cJust Illium and he hasn\u2019t landed.\u201d</p> <p>Good, she thought, that meant the caress of poison had to belong to the killer. Focusing on that element, she began to pull apart the notes to create a more detailed profile.</p><p>Oleanders, rich and sweet, with a thread of darkest resin humming a discordant note, and below that a touch of juicy red berries bursting open. But the scent of oleanders in full bloom overwhelmed, it was so very, very intoxicating.</p><p>She was following the trail even as the thought passed through her head, barely aware of Venom remaining beside the body while Illium flew overhead. The scent meandered through Central Park, as if the killer had taken a stroll. Given his confidence, she more than half expected to lose him as soon as she hit the pond, but surprisingly, he hadn\u2019t gone into the water.</p><p>Instead, she found herself following him to the edge of Fifth Avenue. Where the sensual whisper of oleanders snapped off with such suddenness that she knew he\u2019d gotten into a cab. Blowing out a breath, she waved Illium down. \u201cTrail\u2019s cold,\u201d she said when he landed. \u201cMight as well lead me to the other site just in case he did scope that out.\u201d</p><p>It was only as they were flying over the Hudson that she realized they were heading toward Raphael\u2019s estate. Figuring the burial site had to be somewhere beyond, she found herself deeply shaken when Illium dove down to land on the edge of the wood that separated the mansion from Michaela\u2019s U.S. home. He stayed in position as she walked in. Archangel?</p> <p>Slightly to your right, about fifty meters ahead.</p><p>Raphael held out a hand when she reached him, but she didn\u2019t take it, staring at the rectangular coffin-sized hole in the earth. \u201cWhen exactly,\u201d she said, \u201cwere you going to tell me he was going to be buried on the grounds of our home?\u201d She understood that he had to control his vampires in ways that might seem cruel to her, but this ...</p><p>A chrome blue gaze met hers, vivid even in the night shadows. \u201cI needed him close enough that I could maintain a mental watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others?\u201d she whispered, feeling sick to her stomach. She\u2019d walked these woods before, might well have stepped over them.</p><p>\u201cNone, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The ice in his voice should\u2019ve scared her, but she was too furious. \u201cYou know this is wrong, Raphael, keeping this from me. Yet you did it intentionally.\u201d His expression didn\u2019t change, but she knew without a doubt that she was right. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you have a mortal heart.\u201d A pitiless statement.</p><p>She shook under the verbal blow. \u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not a matter of right or wrong\u201d\u2014metallic blue, so very, very inhuman\u2014\u201cbut of fact. This would have disturbed you to an extent that would\u2019ve made it impossible for you to live here.\u201d</p><p>It was the absolute truth, made no less so by the fact that he\u2019d seen it with such cold clarity. Anger battled with other, deeper emotions, and it took her almost half a minute to find the control to say, \u201cI want to ask you for something, Archangel.\u201d He\u2019d given her his heart, given her power over him, but until now, she\u2019d never gambled anything on that power.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have, Guild Hunter?\u201d So formal, so distant.</p><p>The part of her that was still the child abandoned by mother and father both was terrified of pushing him too far, until he left her, too. It was a nauseating sensation\u2014but this was a stand she had to take. \u201cStrike this punishment from the books. Surely there are other ways?\u201d</p><p>Raphael was as unmoving as stone in front of her for a long, long moment. \u201cIs it a boon you ask, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with slow deliberation. \u201cI ask this as your consort. This . . . it\u2019s not worth tainting the relationship between us.\u201d</p> <p>The Archangel of New York closed his fingers gently around her throat\u2014not a threat, but a mark of possession. \u201cIs our relationship so weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She would fight to the death for it ... for him. \u201cIt\u2019s something extraordinary\u2014and it deserves to be protected against all the crap the world is going to throw at us.\u201d</p><p>The metal receded as she watched, replaced by a penetrating, piercing shade akin to the mountain sky at noon. \u201cAh, Elena. So eloquent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d Her stomach was so tight, a thousand knots within.</p><p>\u201cI will have Dmitri think of another suitable punishment.\u201d</p><p>Air rushed into her lungs as she took a true breath. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have no problems.\u201d Dmitri was one of the oldest vampires she\u2019d ever met\u2014and he had a thing for pain. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, scentwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t truly expect it. He was meant to be transported here later tonight, after having had time to put his affairs in order.\u201d Raphael stroked his thumb over his consort\u2019s pulse. \u201cWhat is it I sense in you, Elena?\u201d Fear, an insidious intruder, one that would steal her from him.</p><p>She gave a slight shake of her head. \u201cNot you.\u201d A pause. \u201cMe. I\u2019m a little messed up. Sometimes it all just roars back to the surface.\u201d</p><p>Stroking his hand along the back of her neck, he tugged her close, took her lips in a slow, deep caress that reminded her the nightmares had no claim on her now\u2014she belonged to an archangel.</p><p>His hunter lifted her fingers to her kiss-wet lips when they parted, eyes huge in the darkness. \u201cShokran, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome, Guild Hunter.\u201d Wings brushing over his consort\u2019s, he turned to walk back to the house with her. \u201cThis murder is a message. It can be nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is who\u2014\u201d Elena froze. \u201cThe killer\u2019s scent was heady with oleander. It\u2019s a flower, but it\u2019s also a toxic poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha.\u201d</p><p>Leaving an exhausted Elena to her bath\u2014though the idea of joining her was a much more pleasurable thought\u2014Raphael walked down to the library and put through a call to Neha. The Archangel of India took her time answering, and her visage, when it appeared on the screen, was pure arctic chill. \u201cRaphael.\u201d With her hair pulled off her face into a tight bun and her features free of artifice, she had a pure, unadorned beauty.</p><p>The impression was furthered by the folds of the white silk sari set neatly over her shoulder, the stark shade bearing only the thinnest border of small faceted beads. Around her throat lay a necklace shaped to mimic a slender black serpent, its hissing mouth open. But of course, Raphael knew that was no necklace.</p><p>\u201cNeha,\u201d he said, watching as she allowed a cobra to twine its way around her arm. \u201cYou know why we\u2019re having this conversation.\u201d Vampires, Elena had told him as she sank into the bath, had strange, unexpected scents, so the potency of poison could mean nothing. However, as evidenced by Venom, Neha had a way of marking those she Made.</p><p>Now the Queen of Snakes, of Poisons, curved her lips into a smile that held an amusement as cold as that of the blood that flowed through her favored creatures. \u201cIt is but a game, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>A mortal may have attempted to appeal to her conscience, tried to make her feel guilt for the senseless death\u2014most likely deaths\u2014she\u2019d engineered, but he spoke to her pride. \u201cIt is beneath you, Neha, to act through such pathetic fools.\u201d</p><p>Titus would\u2019ve exploded at the insult, Michaela would\u2019ve hissed in anger, but Neha ... Neha sighed and reached up to pinch closed the mouth of the snake at her neck, holding it shut until the creature started to struggle before releasing it. And still it stayed curled around her throat. \u201cYou are right,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut you helped take something I love from me, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you would take what I love from me?\u201d So smart, so vicious, he thought, so like the snakes she kept as pets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your hunter is none too pleased to discover that by becoming yours, she has placed everyone she loves in mortal danger.\u201d Stroking her fingers along the cobra\u2019s gleaming skin as she confirmed her part in the murders at the school, she met his gaze with eyes of darkest brown, eyes that were very much sane. \u201cAs for the other ... betrayal is always a hard pill to swallow. He was weak, ridiculously easy to break and control.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had already set Dmitri and Venom the task of ensuring Neha had planted no more snakes in their midst. \u201cWhy kill him?\u201d</p><p>Neha lifted a shoulder in an elegant shrug. \u201cHe may have known something, though the point is moot now. As a tool, he wasn\u2019t the most useful one\u2014and I\u2019m sure he considered it a mercy. He would\u2019ve never survived his punishment with his mind intact.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps. But Raphael was quite certain the man would not have chosen to die by having his internal organs ripped from his living flesh. \u201cYou know what Anoushka did was anathema.\u201d Neha\u2019s daughter had been party to the brutalization of a child. It was one of the greatest taboos of their race.</p><p>\u201cI am a mother, Raphael.\u201d A pause, an instant of piercing sorrow. \u201cI was a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you would make other mothers feel the same pain?\u201d Neha was one of the few in the Cadre who had always treated mortal children as precious.</p><p>A slow blink, cold and dark, as she stared at him with a gaze that had been known to ensnare lesser angels. \u201cI think you will soon have far bigger problems to worry about than my modest games.\u201d</p><p>Raphael said nothing.</p><p>Smiling, Neha reached out of the shot, and when her hand returned, those elegant fingers held a black orchid. \u201cI thought this was a nice touch on my part.\u201d She ran the ebony petals over the cobra\u2019s skin. \u201cIt\u2019ll amuse me to watch you when she rises. She left you to die broken on a field far from civilization, did she not?\u201d</p><p>Having expected the taunt, he didn\u2019t react. \u201cNeha,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will, if not forgive, not retaliate against these trespasses because you lost a child\u2014but do not play games in my territory again.\u201d</p><p>Neha laughed, a bitter hiss of sound. \u201cWhat would you do to me, Raphael? I have lost that which matters most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie,\u201d he murmured, waiting until her laughter died to deliver his coup de grace. \u201cYou would not like to lose your power.\u201d</p><p>Neha\u2019s expression went flat, hard. \u201cYou are arrogant enough to think you have the strength to affect my rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever forget that I was the one who executed Uram when it needed to be done.\u201d It had taken something from him to end the life of another archangel, but Uram had turned monster and could not be allowed to savage the world. \u201cNever forget what and who I am, Neha.\u201d</p><p>The Archangel of India held his gaze for a long, long moment. \u201cPerhaps your mortal has not changed you after all.\u201d</p><p>Raphael said nothing to that, ending the call, but as he turned to walk up to join his hunter, he knew Neha was wrong. Elena had changed something fundamental in him. Do you wait for me, hbeebti? he asked, touching her mind, finding her awake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bed\u2019s cold without you.</p><p>As he opened the bedroom door, he knew he would never again be able to return to the life he\u2019d led before her\u2014where hardness of the heart was nurtured and love termed a weakness. \u201cAre you tired, Elena?\u201d</p><p>Rising up into a sitting position, his hunter allowed the sheet to slide down to pool at her waist.</p><p>12</p> <p>Elena\u2019s throat went dry under the unwavering focus of Raphael\u2019s gaze, the skin over her breasts suddenly too tight. Her need for him was a deep, aching hunger fueled by a day that had stirred hidden fears, painful secrets. She wanted his mouth on her, his hands on her\u2014but there was a dangerous look to him tonight. Nothing akin to the rage that had made him burn so cold after the events at the girls\u2019 school, nothing that scared her ... except in the most sensual of ways.</p><p>\u201cPlanning to come over here, Archangel?\u201d she asked when he continued to caress her only with those eyes of inhuman blue, the ache inside her transforming into something darker, hotter.</p><p>He leaned against the closed door to the bedroom. \u201cFirst, I intend to savor the view.\u201d</p><p>She was a hunter, had never been a prude, but he made her skin flush, her nipples bead to urgent points. \u201cAt least take off your shirt,\u201d she said, rubbing her feet against the sheets. \u201cMake it fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I wish to do that when I have a naked hunter in my bed, ready to submit to my every whim?\u201d</p> <p>Her toes curled, because right now, that look in his eyes\u2014it was that of a conqueror, a man used to surrender. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing she saw on his face. The faintest of smiles tugged at those lips that knew her every hidden pleasure point; his shoulders were relaxed in a way that told her he was playing with her. Oh, not all of it. A large part of him was, in all probability, experiencing the same arrogant satisfaction as any conqueror faced with a woman clothed only in her skin, a woman who had no intention of denying him anything . . . but this particular one had given her the right to make her own demands.</p><p>Eyes on him, she ran her hands down her rib cage, then back up to palm her breasts. Liquid heat in that gaze, but he didn\u2019t move from the doorway. \u201cMore, Elena.\u201d It was a command, given in the tone she only ever heard in bed, sexual and demanding and, sometimes, without mercy.</p><p>\u201cAlways with the orders,\u201d she whispered, rolling and tugging at nipples that begged for a harder, bolder touch, yet so unbearably sensitive that she thought she might shatter if he so much as put those strong hands on her. \u201cMaybe I want to be the one giving orders in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat order would you give?\u201d An intimate question, his gaze lingering on her lips with unhidden intent before dropping to the hand she slid provocatively under the sheet.</p><p>Breasts flushing under the sexual kiss of those eyes, she took in the hard power of the magnificent body braced against the door. \u201cI\u2019d say come here\u201d\u2014stroking her fingers between her legs in sinful emphasis\u2014\u201cso I can show you how very ready and willing I am.\u201d The physical connection ... they both needed it on the deepest level tonight\u2014to burn away the cold, dark places in the soul, to lock them together in an earthy glide of flesh.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Raphael said, \u201cdo like it when you do wicked things to me,\u201d and it was an echo of something she\u2019d said to him once.</p> <p>The memories of the velvet heat of his cock against her tongue made her thighs clench around the intrusion of her hand. \u201cThen why,\u201d she asked, fisting her free hand on the sheets, \u201caren\u2019t you moving?\u201d He hadn\u2019t touched her, and she was liquid-soft with welcome.</p><p>\u201cBecause tonight, Guild Hunter, I have wicked things of my own in mind.\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing. When he skimmed his eyes down to linger where the sheets pooled at her waist, the command might as well have been spoken, it was so very direct, so very male. Taking a jerky breath, she used one hand to push the sheet to the top of her thighs, where the bunched material continued to hide her from his view ... and stopped.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe shirt has to go.\u201d When dancing with an archangel, a girl had to play dirty.</p><p>Pushing off the door, he raised his fingers to the buttons of the black shirt, undoing them with a quick efficiency that made her mouth water. Those fingers, they knew her body so well, had touched her both with exquisite tenderness and in dark possession. It was clear what she\u2019d be getting tonight, she thought as he shrugged off the shirt to the floor and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>God but he was beautiful, his shoulders and chest heavy with muscle, his skin a gold that invited her mouth, her touch. But that wasn\u2019t the bargain they\u2019d made. Removing her fingers from her desire-slick flesh, she brought her knees to her chest before sliding the sheet up and over her thighs to gather at her feet. \u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>The archangel folded his arms. \u201cLegs down.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, she focused on the proud push of his erection against pants the same shade as his shirt. Tiny internal muscles clenched. \u201cI want something in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She went to protest the flat refusal, but he\u2019d already crossed the room to close his hand around her nape. His mouth, that lethal, knowing mouth, was on hers a fraction of a second later. Raising her hands to grab at his waist as he leaned above her, she gasped when he moved his other hand down to cover her breast with a confidence that said she was his and he knew it. The squeeze was proprietary, his skin just rough enough to tantalize her nipples.</p><p>That was when she realized she\u2019d dropped her knees. \u201cI guess you think you\u2019ve won.\u201d A husky whisper as he lifted his head and pushed her back onto the bed with a hand splayed on her breastbone. Maybe she should\u2019ve resisted, but she wanted him on top of her, inside her, his cock parting her wet, passion-swollen tissues in hard demand.</p><p>\u201cThis round, yes.\u201d Raphael simply stood there for long seconds, indulging in the sight of his consort. She had the body of a warrior. Strong, sleek with muscle. Pleasing to his every sense.</p><p>The eyes that watched him were hazy with desire, her lips curved in the slight smile of a woman who knew her lover would satisfy her, one leg cocked up at the knee as she lay languorous and warm and aroused in their bed. When she turned over onto her front, her extraordinary wings spreading out on either side, he didn\u2019t stop her. Instead, climbing onto the mattress, he straddled her on his knees before sweeping the silken threads of her hair off her back, to run his finger down the line of her spine.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cArchangel.\u201d</p><p>He liked the way she said that, the sound a throaty pleasure on its own. Leaning to place his hands palms down on either side of her head, he kissed the back of her neck, felt her lower body rise toward him. As he continued to lave kisses along her spine, stroking his fingers along the sensitive inner edges of her wings at the same time, her breathing got choppier, the small shifts of her body more and more insistent ... the earthy scent of her arousal infusing the air.</p><p>His cock jerked, but he wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><p>Caressing the base of her spine with a swirl of his tongue, he lifted himself up again and said, \u201cIt is time for the first wicked thing, Elena.\u201d He slid his hands under her hips and pushed upward.</p><p>\u201cNot from where I\u2019m lying.\u201d Her voice was breathless but she heeded his silent request to bring herself up onto her knees and elbows, spread her thighs.</p><p>Unable to resist, he moved both hands down the sensitive insides of her thighs, heard her make a quintessentially feminine sound of pleasure. In this position, she was open to him\u2014luscious and flushed, her plump folds pure erotic invitation. Not giving her any warning, he put his mouth on her. She would\u2019ve jerked away in sensual shock except that he had a firm grip on her thighs.</p><p>A shudder rippled over her as he took his first taste. He needed this, needed her. The day had taken a brutal toll, but here there was only his consort who had not shied at witnessing the ruthless reality of what it took to keep the Hudson from running bloodred, who had come into his arms though her anger at him had been a harsh whip.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, please.\u201d A sensual plea.</p><p>Lifting his mouth from her, he reached down to tease a single finger through her damp heat. It caused her hand to clench on the sheets, her heartbeat to accelerate . . . but she was a hunter, a warrior. Making an unexpected move, she pulled away and onto her back with a grace that had one of her wings shimmering above him for a single second. The first thing she did was clear away the tangle of her hair. The second was to rise up onto her knees and claim his mouth in a kiss that tasted of a feminine possession he had no intention of denying.</p><p>Using the opportunity to caress the lush weight of her breasts, the sensitive peaks of her nipples, he halted her when she went to push him to his back. \u201cNo, Guild Hunter. Not tonight.\u201d He had never been loved with such fierceness as his hunter lavished on him. But the instant she put her hands, her mouth on him, he would be undone\u2014and tonight, he wanted something else. I would pleasure you.</p><p>\u201cTorture me you mean.\u201d In spite of the soft complaint, she lay back, let him come over her, stroke her from shoulder to breast to hip. He plucked at her nipple, rubbed his thumb over her collarbone, ran his lips over the curve of her hip. Started again. Her mouth was a kiss-wet enticement, the pulse in her neck an inducement to suck, to mark, the leg she curled over his hip sleek temptation.</p><p>When she rose up toward him, he rocked his clothed lower body against her.</p><p>Oh. The friction of Raphael\u2019s pants, the press of the zipper . . . It had Elena digging her nails into his shoulders. \u201cI ache for you,\u201d she whispered, her need a wide-open gash in her heart.</p><p>Raphael stopped his languid strokes to reach up and push back the sweat-damp strands of hair off her forehead, cup the side of her face. \u201cYou have me, Elena. Always.\u201d His kiss was a dark claiming that had her gasping for breath, the taste of him in her every cell.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shifting to slide his fingers between her legs, he pressed down on her clitoris, making her cry out. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, gliding his fingers through her quivering flesh to the slick entrance of her body, \u201cif I move too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, hands clenching on his shoulders as he pushed two of his fingers inside her with blunt deliberation, \u201care a tease.\u201d</p><p>Firmly embedded in her, he began to spread his fingers, causing her inner muscles to spasm ... but he stopped just before she would\u2019ve gone over, keeping her balanced on that finest of edges. \u201cNot a tease\u201d\u2014his fingers coming together, spreading again\u2014\u201cbut there is something to be said for patience.\u201d A single hard, fast withdrawal and thrust.</p><p>Raphael. Gripping at his biceps, she rolled her hips in an attempt to urge him to finish it, but he returned to the tormenting indolence of his movements even as he dipped his head to suck one of her nipples into his mouth, tasting her with that same leisurely pleasure.</p><p>Her entire body hovered on the brink. \u201cYou\u2019re in a devil of a mood.\u201d</p><p>A smile against her breast as he released her nipple with a wet sound to kiss the skin around it. \u201cI wish to enjoy my consort. You will allow it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thrusting her hand into his hair, she pulled up his head. \u201cThis consort has a knife under the mattress that she won\u2019t hesitate to use if you don\u2019t give her an orgasm soon.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. A brilliant, blinding thing. So rare were smiles such as these from her archangel that her heart stopped for a second. Mine, she thought, you are mine.</p><p>That smile grew wider. Yes.</p><p>It was only then that she realized she\u2019d sent the thought to him. That he hadn\u2019t hesitated for an instant . . . it vanquished the ugliness that had awoken in her earlier, the painful echo of rejection and loneliness. She knew it would rise again\u2014the scar was too deep, too vicious not to\u2014but this man, her archangel, he kept hold of his own; his possessive will was her shield.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d Her own lips curving, she stole a kiss.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have my warrior in bed, so tight\u201d\u2014two teasing pumps with his fingers\u2014\u201chot\u201d\u2014teeth on her jaw\u2014\u201cand wet.\u201d Dipping his head, he lavished her neglected nipple with attention. The long, deep tugs pulled at things low in her abdomen, making her squirm, squeeze down on his fingers. Reaching up with his thumb in response, he circled around . . . then finally rubbed at the pulsing nub of her clitoris with the firm touch that he knew drove her crazy.</p><p>So close. So close.</p><p>He lifted his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI am never going down on you again,\u201d she threatened, chest heaving.</p> <p>Laughter against her skin. What if I ask very nicely? With that, he began to move those knowing fingers in a rapid rhythm, bending his head to suck hard at her nipple at the same time ... before biting down with his teeth.</p><p>The orgasm rocked her so hard, she didn\u2019t only see stars, she saw whole constellations exploding in a flash of white-gold. It was glorious, leaving her a wreck. When she was able to lift her heavy eyelids at last, she found Raphael rising to strip off the rest of his clothes. The beauty of him struck her anew. That body\u2014powerful and dangerous, his cock a heavy thickness. Eyes of a blue as vivid as the mountain sky at noon. Wings that could take him above the clouds in an unrivaled burst of speed; the breadth of those wings was exceptional.</p><p>As she watched, he reached down, fisted his cock. Pumped once. Twice.</p><p>The embers in her body flared to smoldering life. This time, when she raised her arms in silent invitation, he came. No more teasing, no more words. Her archangel pushed her thighs apart and took her with a hard, hot thrust that was an exquisite burn through flesh already swollen from the force of her first orgasm.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth,\u201d he said, and then he was taking that mouth as he moved his cock in and out of her in a demanding rhythm that had a rich, dark heat rolling up over her body. This pleasure, it was primal and thick and visceral. It curled her toes, made her breasts swell, and the delicate flesh between her legs flush anew with a rush of blood.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt so possessed, so indulged. The orgasm built slower, lasted longer, hit harder. But this time, she felt the scalding rush of Raphael\u2019s own pleasure, heard her archangel\u2019s powerful wings snap wide above her as the muscles in his back flexed and bunched.</p> <p>Her thoughts splintered.</p><p>13</p><p>There was only pleasure, no assault of nightmare that night, but Elena was still in no mood to speak to Jeffrey the next morning. \u201cWhen am I ever in the mood?\u201d she muttered as she landed in front of the tony town house guarded by metal gates on the eastern side of Central Park. She\u2019d expected the meeting to be at his office at Deveraux Enterprises but had received a message an hour earlier moving things to this location.</p><p>It was a lovely home, as genteel and elegant as the woman who was Jeffrey\u2019s second wife. The small area of greenery around it\u2014an incredible luxury in the middle of Manhattan\u2014was landscaped with a graceful perfection that somehow didn\u2019t cross the line into severity. Elena couldn\u2019t fault Gwendolyn\u2019s taste, for all that some small part of her resented the woman for taking Marguerite\u2019s place at Jeffrey\u2019s side. But then, Marguerite wouldn\u2019t have recognized the man her husband had become, so it was just as well.</p><p>Walking up three shallow marble steps with that hollow realization ringing in her skull, she pressed the doorbell to her father\u2019s home, a home she\u2019d never been invited to, never been welcome in, until this moment. The bell echoed inside, as if the house was empty. A minute, then two, passed without footsteps. Fully capable of believing Jeffrey had decided to leave her standing on the doorstep, she\u2019d turned to head back down when the door was pulled open.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, a cutting retort ready on her lips. It died the instant she met the composed blue eyes of the society beauty twenty years his junior whom her father had married one fall while Elena had been at boarding school. \u201cGwendolyn,\u201d she said with a politeness Marguerite had drummed into her. She\u2019d run into her father\u2019s second wife once or twice over the years, but neither of them had made the effort to strengthen the relationship beyond a cool formality.</p><p>\u201cElena. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Glad that Gwendolyn at least didn\u2019t seem to insist on using her full name, Elena walked in, conscious of the fact the other woman was studiously not staring at her wings. \u201cI expected a maid,\u201d she said, looking down the long foyer lined with small, softly lighted cubbies that held what were no doubt priceless objects d\u2019art.</p> <p>\u201cThis is family business,\u201d Gwendolyn said, tugging at the sleeve of her jewel green silk shirt.</p><p>Elena frowned, not at the words, but at the restless movement\u2014Gwendolyn was one of the most \u201ctogether\u201d people Elena had ever come across. But now that she was paying attention, she saw that the other woman\u2019s eyes were shadowed, smudges of purple marring the rich cream of her skin. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, suddenly realizing this might not be about Jeffrey playing power games after all.</p><p>Gwendolyn glanced down the corridor, stepped closer. \u201cI know you don\u2019t think of them as your sisters,\u201d she said in a low, intense tone, \u201cbut I need you to stand up for my baby.\u201d</p><p>Elena went to ask what the hell was going on when a door opened down the hall. Jeffrey\u2019s tall form appeared a moment later. Dressed in charcoal pants bearing a faint navy pinstripe paired with a white shirt, the buttons undone at the collar, he was as casual as she\u2019d seen him in the years of her adulthood.</p><p>Before ... She remembered the dreams, remembered the laughing paint-covered man who\u2019d thrown her into the air and caught her on a sunny day flavored with the mingled scents of freshly cut grass, ice cream, and burgers. Long before the blood, before the death. Before the silence . . . and the shadow on the wall.</p><p>Steeling her spine against the devastating impact of the memories, she met his gaze, shielded as always by the clear glass of his metal-rimmed spectacles. \u201cWhy am I here, Jeffrey?\u201d She knew Gwendolyn would say nothing now. Having seen them in public, she understood very well who held the reins.</p><p>It was nothing like the marriage Jeffrey had had with Elena\u2019s mother\u2014a woman who\u2019d teased her husband as often as she\u2019d kissed him. A woman whose body might have survived, but whose spirit had broken under the hands of the serial killer drawn to their small family home because of Elena. That was a guilt that threatened to turn her feet to lead, leave her defenseless in the face of what was almost certainly going to be a knock-down, drag-out confrontation\u2014her meetings with her father never ended any other way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you have some sense of family obligation,\u201d Jeffrey said in that razor blade of a voice. \u201cI suppose you have had more important people to visit in the days since your return to the city.\u201d</p><p>Anger, wild and hurting, slammed through the guilt. \u201cThey cared when you threw me out onto the street,\u201d she said, glad to see him flinch. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand that kind of loyalty.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected\u2014that her father would be taken aback by her wings to the extent of dropping that glacial mask? That he\u2019d look at her with wonder and awe? If she had, she was a fool.</p><p>\u201cJeffrey.\u201d Gwendolyn\u2019s mellifluous voice.</p><p>Jeffrey\u2019s jaw was tight, his eyes glittering behind those thin metal frames, but he gave a jerky nod, said, \u201cCome into the study. The girls?\u201d The latter words were directed at his wife.</p><p>\u201cIn Amy\u2019s room, with strict instructions not to come out.\u201d</p><p>The tendons along Jeffrey\u2019s neck went white with strain, but he said nothing as he walked into the study. Elena followed at a slower pace, wondering at the undercurrents she could sense. Maybe she\u2019d been wrong about Gwendolyn. It certainly seemed like the other woman was flexing her claws.</p><p>Chewing on that, she found herself in a large room with mahogany bookshelves lined with leather-bound tomes, a solid desk of the same wood taking center stage. That still left plenty of room for the deep armchairs set to one side, near the French doors. It wasn\u2019t only a masculine room, it was devoid of even the slightest feminine touch.</p><p>Snick.</p><p>The sound of the lock clicking into place as Gwendolyn closed the door was loud in the silence. Needing space, Elena walked to the French doors and swung them open, shifting to lean against the doorjamb, one of her wings exposed to the crisp spring air, the other to the emotional chill inside the library.</p><p>Jeffrey stood on the other side of the room, against a bookshelf, his arms folded. \u201cSo, you\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid asking me to whore myself for you isn\u2019t going to work any better this time than it did the last,\u201d Elena snapped out, her calm disappearing in the face of that judgmental gaze.</p><p>White lines bracketed Jeffrey\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter. I shouldn\u2019t have had to go through your Guild to find out if you were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Elena gave a bitter laugh. \u201cWhen have you cared whether I lived or died?\u201d Not once in the ten years of their estrangement had he bothered to check up on her, even when she\u2019d been badly injured in a hunt, hospitalized for weeks. \u201cJust tell me why I\u2019m here so I can get back to my life.\u201d</p><p>It was Gwendolyn who spoke from her position by the door, her body held in a way Elena would\u2019ve never expected from Jeffrey\u2019s perfect society wife. \u201cIt\u2019s Evelyn,\u201d she said in a quiet, determined tone. \u201cShe\u2019s like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The single word was gritted out by Jeffrey.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Gwendolyn turned on her husband. \u201cDenying it won\u2019t make it any less true!\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey\u2019s response was lost in the buzz of noise inside Elena\u2019s head as she tried to make sense of the curveball Gwendolyn had just thrown her. \u201cLike me? How?\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to make any assumptions, not here.</p><p>Gwendolyn\u2019s lips pursed tight, her hands fisted at her sides as she stared at her husband. When Jeffrey didn\u2019t speak, the black-haired woman turned to Elena. \u201cHunter-born,\u201d she said. \u201cMy baby is hunter-born.\u201d</p><p>If Elena hadn\u2019t been braced against the doorjamb, she\u2019d have collapsed\u2014her body felt as if it had taken a tremendous blow. Disbelief had her saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Hunter-born were rare, very rare, being birthed with the ability to scent-track vampires. However, it did run in families\u2014Elena had always believed her ability came from her mother\u2019s unknown bloodline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve run tests,\u201d Jeffrey snapped out. \u201cUsing Harrison and some of his friends. She can track them.\u201d</p><p>Harrison was a vampire, and Elena\u2019s brother-in-law, married to Marguerite\u2019s only other surviving daughter\u2014Beth. The fact that Evelyn could track him ... \u201cYou,\u201d Elena whispered, staring at Jeffrey. \u201cIt comes from you.\u201d He\u2019d known, she thought, glimpsing the flash of some unnamable emotion in his eyes. All this time, when he\u2019d been rejecting her for her \u201cbase, inhuman\u201d occupation, he\u2019d known it was his blood that had given it to her.</p><p>A muscle pulsed along Jeffrey\u2019s temple, his skin pulled taut over that aristocratic bone structure. \u201cThat has no place in this conversation.\u201d</p><p>Elena laughed. Harsh, jagged. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou hypocrite.\u201d</p> <p>His head snapped toward her. \u201cBe quiet, Elieanora. I\u2019m still your father.\u201d</p><p>The hell of it was that part of her was still the little girl who\u2019d once adored him, and that part wanted to obey. Fighting the urge, she was about to retort when she glimpsed Gwendolyn\u2019s face. The other woman looked shattered, and all at once, Elena\u2019s anger with her father, his fury at her, wasn\u2019t the most important thing. It would keep. It had kept for over a decade.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need training,\u201d she said, speaking to Gwendolyn. \u201cWithout it, she\u2019ll find it difficult to focus and concentrate.\u201d The cacophony of scents in the air, especially in a city as full of vampires as New York, could severely impact one of the hunter-born. Elena had taught herself to filter out the endless \u201cnoise\u201d in the years before she grew old enough to join the Guild without parental permission, but it had been a painful, lonely road. One Evelyn didn\u2019t have to take. \u201cYou need to register her at Guild Academ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jeffrey\u2019s voice was rigid with withheld rage. \u201cI will not have another daughter of mine tainted by that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a school,\u201d Elena said, keeping a white-knuckled grip on a temper that pulled aggressively at the reins. \u201cIt has specialized teachers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe will not be a hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already is, you bastard!\u201d Elena yelled, the reasoned adult falling apart under the echoes of childhood. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll lose her the same way you lost me!\u201d</p><p>The blow hit. She saw it.</p><p>For herself, she wouldn\u2019t have fought. But for Evelyn, she pushed forward, using the advantage. \u201cBeing hunter-born isn\u2019t a choice. It\u2019s part of our very makeup. If you ask her to make a choice, she\u2019ll probably choose you.\u201d Before Jeffrey could pounce on that, she added, \u201cAnd she\u2019ll go mad if not in the next few years, then in the next decade.\u201d The urge to hunt was a pulse in the blood, a hunger that could consume if caged.</p><p>Gwendolyn gave a short, choked cry. \u201cJeffrey, I won\u2019t lose my daughter. You might be able to walk away from your child, but I won\u2019t.\u201d Turning to Elena, she said, \u201cCan you send me the information about the Academy? Perhaps ... would you speak to Eve?\u201d</p><p>Shaken by the maternal love that had turned cool, composed Gwendolyn into a lioness, Elena nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the garden if you want to bring her down.\u201d Suiting action to words, she stepped out into the small backyard and breathed in deep lungfuls of the open air. This close to Central Park, it held hints of fir and water and horses, but below that was the constant hum of the city, a touch of smoke and metal, the active press of humanity.</p> <p>Rubbing at her eyes with one of her hands, she froze when she felt Jeffrey in the doorway at her back. \u201cIs it possible the vampire who murdered the girls at the school was drawn to Evelyn?\u201d</p><p>The question threw ice water across her senses. Because it meant he knew. Jeffrey knew Slater Patalis had been drawn to their small family home because of Elena. Part of her, the part that held the lost, hurt girl she\u2019d once been, had hoped he didn\u2019t, that there might yet be hope for a relationship between them, but if he knew ... \u201cNo,\u201d she said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cWe caught the vampire who murdered Celia and Betsy. He wasn\u2019t like Slater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mention that name, Elieanora.\u201d Words so steady, they were steel. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Elena turned this time. \u201cYes.\u201d If he wanted to forget the monster, she couldn\u2019t blame him. What she could blame him for was that he\u2019d forgotten his daughters, his wife, as well. \u201cEvelyn needs to be trained as fast as possible. Her skills will provide a defense against attack.\u201d Pausing, she went to thrust a hand through her hair before remembering she\u2019d braided it. \u201cAmy should also be tutored in basic self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve made them targets.\u201d</p><p>She flinched, but didn\u2019t back down. \u201cThey\u2019re your daughters, Jeffrey,\u201d she whispered, hitting back because that was what she did with Jeffrey. That was their endless cycle of pain and recrimination. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve turned over a new leaf, there\u2019s more than one competitor out there who\u2019d love to get his hands on your child.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey opened his mouth, closed it without speaking. A moment later, Evelyn squeezed past her father. She didn\u2019t get far before Jeffrey\u2019s hand came down on her shoulder. \u201cEvelyn.\u201d</p><p>The ten-year-old, her eyes an echo of the man who towered above her, lifted up her face. \u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember who you are. A Deveraux.\u201d A stern reminder.</p><p>Elena wanted to say that there was no question about the fact that Eve damn well was a true Deveraux\u2014since hunting seemed to run in the blood\u2014but restrained herself in the face of the anxiety the girl was trying so hard to mask. \u201cCome on, Eve,\u201d she said instead. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met Jason in the skies above Staten Island, the cloud layer a thick white foam below them. \u201cI thought you\u2019d left the country.\u201d His spymaster was meant to be on the way to Europe.</p><p>\u201cI had an unexpected meeting come up.\u201d Jason didn\u2019t explain further, and Raphael didn\u2019t ask. Jason would have been no good to him as a spymaster if he didn\u2019t think for himself\u2014like the others in the Seven, the male served Raphael not out of obligation, but out of choice.</p><p>\u201cI returned to the Tower before dawn this morning to pick up something,\u201d Jason continued. \u201cIt is as well\u2014I can confirm the name of the one who murdered your man last night. She calls herself Belladonna, though she has also used the name Oleander Graves.\u201d</p><p>That name was no surprise. Neither was the gender of the killer\u2014female vampires bore the same bloodlust as males\u2014but the speed with which Jason had tracked her down was. \u201cHow did you find her?\u201d</p><p>Jason braced his wings against the push of the wind. \u201cElena will be able to verify from the scent, but Neha\u2019s assassin is not as clever as she believes. She said some indiscreet things to the dancers at Erotique that made it child\u2019s play to tie the murder to her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised an eyebrow. \u201cI did not know you patronized Erotique, Jason.\u201d The club of choice for the more high-ranked vampires, its dancers and hostesses were considered to be both accomplished and sophisticated.</p><p>\u201cIllium,\u201d Jason said in short explanation. \u201cHe spent some time there after helping Venom take care of the scene. When he saw me come in this morning, he asked if I could corroborate his suspicions using my contacts\u2014I was also able to pinpoint her current residence.\u201d He named the apartment building and number.</p><p>Making a mental note of it, Raphael put aside the matter of Neha\u2019s pet vampire for the present. The assassin would be uncomplicated enough to dispatch now that she\u2019d been located. \u201cTell me about Illium.\u201d The visit to Erotique could\u2019ve been nothing, a diversion to take his mind off the upcoming visit by the Hummingbird, but given the blue-winged angel\u2019s fascination with mortals, it could augur something far more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need for concern,\u201d Jason said at once. \u201cGalen would\u2019ve warned us if there was.\u201d</p><p>Raphael agreed on that point. The two angels were fast friends and had been for centuries. \u201cAnd you, Jason? Who will warn me about you?\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>His spymaster turned so that his tattoo fell in direct sunlight, striking and speaking of a dedication beyond pain. \u201cI will, Sire. Then you will execute me as you promised when I became one of your Seven.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met Jason\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe promise was made and will be kept if necessary, but I prefer you alive. You\u2019re the best spymaster in the Cadre.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s lips curved in the faintest of smiles, a rare sight. \u201cThey\u2019ve all tried to recruit me\u2014Charisemnon and Favashi in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would expect nothing else.\u201d But he knew Jason would not betray him. The black-winged angel had sworn allegiance to Raphael on a field carpeted with a wash of blood. None of it had been Jason\u2019s. But his blade had run slick with it. The next target would\u2019ve been his own body if Raphael hadn\u2019t stepped in.</p><p>Bonds forged in such black fire didn\u2019t easily break.</p><p>Turning back to the matter at hand, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Elena about the scent.\u201d His instinct was to protect her from the harsher aspects of his world, but she was hunter-born.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare stop me from being what I am. Don\u2019t you dare.</p><p>She\u2019d been weak, unable to fly when she\u2019d said that, but he\u2019d never forget the look in her eyes. If he crossed that line, if he denied that part of her, he would shatter her. He knew he was capable of such cruelty, but he also knew he\u2019d break if Elena broke.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Jason said, cutting into his thoughts, \u201cthere is another reason why I returned to the city. You asked me to keep my ears open for any reports of disquieting behavior by the other archangels.\u201d</p><p>Raphael flashed back to the red haze that had clouded his vision, the rage that had all but stolen his will. \u201cWho?</p><p>\u201cAstaad.\u201d Jason named the Archangel of the Pacific Isles as a gust shoved at them from the left. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get spies into his inner circle. In their own way, his people are as loyal to him as the Seven are to you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael adjusted his wings without thought, holding his position above the clouds. \u201cHe rules with an alternately beneficent and bloody hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also treats his women as precious.\u201d</p><p>Astaad\u2019s harem was composed of the most exquisitely beautiful vampires in the world, women he cosseted and protected. It was a well-known aspect of his character, but for Jason to remark on it ... \u201cHe has done something to his women.\u201d</p><p>A nod that made Jason\u2019s hair gleam blue black in the light. \u201cThe operative I managed to get into his court is a low-class servant, but she\u2019s been listening to the women who tend to the harem and word is that Astaad beat one of his favorite concubines almost to a pulp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstaad would consider such an act a stain on his honor.\u201d Raphael thought again of the way he\u2019d executed Ignatius, knew that if Astaad had been in the grip of the same fury, then the concubine was lucky to be alive. \u201cContinue to keep an eye on the situation. Send word as soon as you have any further information.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaving Jason, Raphael made his way back toward Manhattan, flying low enough to see other angels going about their tasks above the gleaming steel and glass of the high-rises. The sun was bright today, and his city glittered like a faceted gem beneath the dazzling light\u2014it was no wonder others in the Cadre watched it with covetous eyes. What they did not understand was that to hold this city, you could not hold humanity in contempt.</p><p>Archangel.</p><p>Angling his head at the brush of that voice kissed by spring and steel, he saw the distinctive shine of Elena\u2019s hair sweeping around the side of the Tower. He watched his consort fly to him with slow, deep sweeps of her wings\u2014she had been awake only months, and already, she flew with such grace and strength. Come, Guild Hunter.</p><p>She changed direction to follow the path he took over the high-rises and the rush of the East River to the roof of a small apartment building. Landing beside the translucent blue waters of the pool in the center, he turned to watch her as she backwinged to a smooth landing not far from where he stood, the tips of her wings a shimmering dawn-edged gold. \u201cYou have been practicing your landings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIllium wouldn\u2019t let me break yesterday afternoon until I got it right nine attempts out of ten. And Montgomery had brought out fresh peach pie.\u201d The attempt at humor couldn\u2019t quite hide the hurt in her eyes.</p><p>Anger twisted through his veins, a cold, remorseless thing that saw nothing wrong with pain, with death. \u201cWhat did your father say to you?\u201d</p><p>Pushing a hand through her hair, she strode past the large planters and to the edge of the pool, hunkering down to dip her fingers desultorily in the water. \u201cNothing. Just . . . the usual crap.\u201d Then she told him about her youngest half sister, her voice hot with naked anger. \u201cIt fucking destroys his moral high ground, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father doesn\u2019t strike me as the kind of man who would ever admit to being at fault.\u201d No, Jeffrey Deveraux was far too determined to win at any cost.</p><p>Rising, she flicked off the water. \u201cYeah.\u201d Then she did something he would\u2019ve never expected. Stepping forward, she buried her face in his chest.</p> <p>Trust, he thought, as he enclosed her within the protection of his arms, his wings; there was such trust in what she had done. \u201cI have a task for you, Guild Hunter,\u201d he said, weaving the fingers of one hand through the pale silk of her hair, unraveling her braid.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A rough statement.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire who spilled blood last night may be in this building. You must hunt.\u201d</p><p>A hum of energy in the body under his hands and then she was pulling away to head for the rooftop entrance to the building. \u201cThe scent was rich, distinctive, the notes unusual. I should be able to narrow it down very fast if he is\u2014or was\u2014anywhere in the vicinity.\u201d</p><p>She, Elena, he corrected, remembering the way he\u2019d once tested her with two barely-Made vampires. She\u2019d been shocked by their skittering, animalistic appearance but had not faltered in her task. Neha\u2019s assassin is a woman.</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d Opening the door, she hesitated. \u201cThis place is too narrow for wings. Not a good tactical move to be trapped in there\u2014and not necessary. The scent of oleanders in bloom ... I can almost touch it. Too strong for her not to be inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be difficult to draw her out,\u201d he said once she returned to his side. However, when he flew down to the window that looked into the vampire\u2019s room, what he saw had him calling off the hunt. She\u2019s dead. There is a noose wrapped around her throat\u2014I\u2019m fairly certain it will turn out to be a snake.</p><p>Elena dropped down beside him. Neha decided to clean up her mess.</p><p>So it would seem. Dmitri will organize the body retrieval.</p><p>Once it\u2019s out of there, I want a chance to double-check the scent. Just in case. Flying down below him and then back up with an awkward grace that did nothing to hide the potential of what she would one day become, Elena brushed silky strands of hair out of her eyes. Do you have time to come spar with me?</p><p>Missing Galen?</p><p>A dark word. Bastard was good. But you\u2019re meaner when you\u2019re in the mood.</p><p>Raphael wasn\u2019t sure he liked that. I would never hurt you, Elena.</p><p>Of course not. She waved at a young blond angel sitting with his legs hanging off one of the high balconies of the Tower as they passed. The male beamed, waved back. But you also don\u2019t have to worry about an archangel zapping you if you put a bruise on me. We can go at it full tilt, and I really need some no-holds-barred sessions.</p> <p>Only she could speak to him thus. Only she could make him feel young in a way he had not felt for over a thousand years. We\u2019ll train at the house. Bypassing a group of angels coming in to land on the Tower roof, he took them toward the Hudson. Afterward, he said as they hit the airspace above the water, you may thank your trainer in the most age-old of ways.</p><p>Warmth uncurling in her abdomen at the sensual order, Elena went to tease Raphael when a roaring wind came out of nowhere, crumpling her wings and threatening to send her slamming into the suddenly raging waters below. Raphael! The mental cry was instinctive, tearing out of her even as a strange, exotic scent wrapped a suffocating blanket around her senses.</p><p>The rain and the wind in her mind, a drenching storm that shoved away all other impressions. My apologies, Elena. He took control, overwhelming her will with his own as he twisted her body in a way she would\u2019ve never done herself, allowing her to spread out her wings and find stability moments before she would\u2019ve hit the water.</p><p>Her mind was her own again a split second afterward.</p><p>The whole thing had happened so fast she hadn\u2019t had time to feel much beyond the adrenaline pumping through her body, but now, as she winged herself to a balanced position, she blew out a breath. Once, when they\u2019d first met, Raphael had said something to her.</p><p>I could make you crawl, Elena. Do you really want me to force you onto your hands and knees?</p><p>\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d she whispered out loud, knowing he remained connected to her. \u201cI thought I had shields now.\u201d</p><p>You do, but you must focus to hold them. Panic throws you wide open.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d She knew he was right. She had panicked. Flight was still new to her\u2014and the terror of falling was one so visceral, it was hard to hold on to logical thought in the face of it.</p><p>Dropping down to join her at the lower altitude she was just managing to maintain, her muscles taut with shock, Raphael flew by her side as she pushed herself home. It felt like it took forever, but she came to a staggering stop on the grounds below their bedroom at last. Raphael swept down in front of her an instant later, catching her shaky form with a hold on her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, bracing herself with her palms on her thighs when he released her. \u201cNot just for now.\u201d She looked up. \u201cFor before.\u201d</p><p>His eyes pulsed with surprise. \u201cI expected your anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. Stubborn, but not stupid.\u201d Rising to her full height, she blew out a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m still so vulnerable to you, but fact is, that isn\u2019t going to change overnight.\u201d She\u2019d taken an archangel as a lover knowing the disparity of strength between them.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019d fight you to my last breath if you attempted to coerce me in a normal situation. What happened over the water\u201d\u2014her heart raced in remembered shock\u2014\u201cwas in no way a normal situation.\u201d A blast of wind crashed into them right then, ripping the last words from her lips, clawing at her wings as if it would tear them off.</p><p>Raphael tugged her into the protection of his body, spreading his wings over them as the wind punched again and again. Do you sense it?</p><p>She went motionless at his question. The wind ... it carried a scent. Faint. So, so faint. And so unusual that she couldn\u2019t pinpoint it\u2014except she knew it was the same thing she\u2019d scented the instant her wings crumpled. What is that?</p><p>A rare black orchid found in a rain forest deep in the Amazon.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cIt truly is her?\u201d</p><p>So it would seem.</p><p>When the rage of wind finally died away with a last cutting whip, she looked up and brushed midnight strands of hair off Raphael\u2019s face, revealing the incredible masculine beauty that had the power to make mortals weep. \u201cShe isn\u2019t that strong yet.\u201d The entire thing had only lasted a minute at most.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But it appears she has noticed my consort.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m slow today.\u201d That blast of wind on the Hudson hadn\u2019t been a chance gust. It had been an arrow meant to shatter her bones when she hit the water at high velocity. \u201cSo she\u2019s conscious?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve had Jessamy doing some research,\u201d he said, mentioning the woman who was the repository of angelic knowledge, the keeper of their histories . . . and one of the kindest angels Elena had ever met. \u201cCome, we will speak of it inside.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the house, turning in the direction of the library, a room that sang to the curious heart of her nature. The first time she\u2019d entered it, she\u2019d noticed only the books arranged on the wall-to-wall shelves on the ground level, the fireplace to the left, the gorgeous wooden table and chairs set below the window.</p><p>But like all angelic rooms, this one had a soaring ceiling\u2014and that ceiling was a work of art, the wooden beams carved with painstaking attention to detail and inlaid with darker pieces that were perfectly contoured to fit. \u201cAodhan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said, following her gaze. \u201cThat was done by a human, a master at his craft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d She wondered at the pride the man must\u2019ve felt to build such a room for an archangel.</p><p>Raphael stroked his hand down her hair, his touch oddly tender.</p><p>\u201cArchangel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m far more powerful than when Caliane disappeared.\u201d His words held a haunting sense of pain, of memory. \u201cBut I am still her son, Elena. Thousands upon thousands of years younger.\u201d</p><p>Elena shook her head. \u201cYou were younger than Uram, too. Yet you won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is beyond Uram, beyond Lijuan.\u201d Raphael\u2019s words sent a chill down Elena\u2019s spine. \u201cShe lived as an archangel for tens of thousands of years. There is no knowing what she has become.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of what Lijuan had done to Beijing, the stench of smoke and death that was said to linger over the empty crater than had once been a vibrant, living city, Elena felt fear attempt to take a clawhold on her heart. She refused to allow it, her love for this archangel far stronger than any imagined foe. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019ve become either, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Her archangel\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but she knew he\u2019d heard her. \u201cJessamy,\u201d he said, \u201ctells me that Caliane is likely in a half-dream state at present. She has some semblance of consciousness but may have no real knowledge of the acts she\u2019s committing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could think this is all a dream?\u201d</p><p>Closing his hand around the back of her neck, he tugged her closer. \u201cYes.\u201d His kiss was more than a little dangerous. But we did not come here to talk about Caliane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pressed her lips to the hard angle of his jaw, anticipation burning away the last vestiges of the fear she\u2019d felt as she fell. \u201cLet\u2019s get sweaty.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>An hour later, Elena was a hell of a lot more than sweaty. Raphael had given her the no-holds-barred combat she\u2019d asked for\u2014and more. \u201cYou know what makes me really mad?\u201d she said, hands on her knees on the other side of the rough practice circle they\u2019d set out on the lawn.</p><p>Raphael, shirtless chest gleaming with the lightest film of perspiration, pushed back his hair. \u201cEnough talking,\u201d he ordered. \u201cUp.\u201d</p> <p>She bared her teeth at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re not even breathing hard while I feel like I got done over by a pack of vamps.\u201d But she rose to her full height, because if she could learn to hold her own against Raphael for so much as a second, she\u2019d be unbeatable against most vampires and humans.</p><p>He came at her without warning, a blur of speed. She wrenched out of the way and went down hard. Galen\u2019s earlier training kept her from landing awkwardly on her wings, but they got crushed into the grass nonetheless as Raphael swept down to pin her. \u201cGalen didn\u2019t teach me that,\u201d she said, chest heaving underneath him as he pinioned her hands above her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Heat blazed off him, his eyes glittering in a way she usually only ever saw in bed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. Arching up, she kissed him, flicking out her tongue to taste the aggressive maleness pumping through his body. \u201cThe thing you do with your wings.\u201d Instead of answering, he kicked her legs wider and suddenly the position was a hell of a lot more intimate. \u201cRaphael\u201d\u2014a husky censure\u2014\u201cMontgomery is probably keeping an eye on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never be so ill-bred.\u201d A hot wet kiss against her neck. \u201cThe wings?\u201d</p> <p>She forced her brain into gear. \u201cYou use them. Galen taught me to keep them out of the way, so I wouldn\u2019t nick them with knives or the short sword, but you use your wings for balance, and you even go slightly airborne to avoid blows.\u201d She\u2019d never seen anyone move with that kind of lethal grace. Galen was a different kind of a fighter\u2014more brutal, harsher in his movements.</p><p>Another kiss, the feel of teeth. She hissed, went to hook her leg over him when he rose off her, extending a hand to help her up. \u201cGalen taught you what was necessary for survival,\u201d he said once she was back on her feet. \u201cHe had to focus on tactics he knew you could master in the timeframe we had before Lijuan\u2019s ball.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up to redo her ponytail, Elena nodded. \u201cI figured. I\u2019m guessing using wings like you do will take me considerably longer to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this stage,\u201d Raphael said, walking over to pick up two short swords from where she\u2019d left them on the edge of the practice circle, \u201cyour wings are more of a liability in combat.\u201d</p><p>She caught the swords by the hilts and watched him pick up a set of much smaller knives. \u201cGiving me the advantage?\u201d</p><p>A smile with more than a hint of arrogance. \u201cYou are but a babe in arms yet, Elena.\u201d Knives held to either side, gaze focused on her. \u201cIt would hardly be fair to take you down again so soon.\u201d</p> <p>She settled into a crouch, wings pinned tightly to her back. \u201cCome on then, angel boy.\u201d She kept her eyes on the muscles in his shoulders, saw the instant one tensed.</p><p>A split second later, they were moving in a wicked, dangerous dance of steel and bodies. She\u2019d never really had a chance to spar with Raphael like this, and damn if it wasn\u2019t the most fun she\u2019d ever had. The archangel was good. Better than good. Not that that should\u2019ve come as a surprise, she thought, blocking his blades and striking out with her own as she spun away. None of the Seven would have given their allegiance over to an archangel they didn\u2019t respect on the battlefield.</p><p>A lick of iron in the air.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d She dropped her hands, glancing at the fine hairline scratch on her left arm. \u201cWould that have cost me my arm in real combat?\u201d</p><p>Raphael saw the disgusted look on Elena\u2019s face and had to bite back a smile of pride. Hair pulled off her face with warrior-like practicality and sweat sheening her body, her musculature fluid and graceful, this was his consort. \u201cThat was a tactical error,\u201d he said, knowing she had the ability to become unbeatable with those blades. All she needed was a little more time to grow into her immortality\u2014and further skilled instruction.</p><p>\u201cYou took a chance,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cand dropped your guard on the left because you thought I couldn\u2019t turn that fast, but don\u2019t ever judge another angel\u2019s\u2014or even an older vampire\u2019s\u2014agility by your own.\u201d She\u2019d only been angel-Made for less than half a year. The fact that she was already blindingly good, her hunter instincts coming to the fore, was no reason to go easy on her. If anything, she needed to be pushed harder.</p><p>She raised her blades. \u201cOnce more through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>The clash of steel, the sweaty, slippery slide of bodies, the wild life of it all exhilarated Raphael. He sparred with his Seven once in a while, but it had always been a practical exercise to keep his physical skills sharp. Elena fought like it was part of her very self, and her joy in it infected him until it was a pulse beneath his skin.</p><p>Then she will kill you. She will make you mortal.</p><p>Lijuan knew nothing, he thought as he dodged the blade of one short sword and flicked his knife under the strap of Elena\u2019s tank top, cutting it in a single swipe. He might heal slower, might injure easier, but he was alive in a way Lijuan had never been and never would be\u2014because she had killed the human who had once, long ago, threatened to make her mortal.</p><p>Ignoring the strap he\u2019d cut, Elena swung back and . . . threw both blades. Taken by surprise, he bent backward, crushing his wings into the grass\u2014one blade passed a bare inch from his face. The other nicked his cheek as it thunked into the earth behind him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Raphael!\u201d Elena was cupping his face in her hands before he could remind her it was never a good idea to throw away her weapons. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to get injured. That\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re using real blades.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in forever, he was stunned to silence. Not by her words, but by the tenderness in her hands, the worry in her eyes. He was an archangel. He\u2019d been wounded far, far worse and shrugged it off. But then, there had been no woman with skin kissed by the sunset and eyes of storm gray to tear into him for daring to get himself hurt.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me? I could\u2019ve hurt you!\u201d Again.</p><p>He shook off his stunned bemusement to answer her assertion, hearing the unspoken word. \u201cI could\u2019ve deflected the blades using my power. But that would not make this in any way a fair fight.\u201d It is nothing similar to when you shot me, Elena. I was dangerous to you that night.</p><p>In answer, she angled his face to the light, stood on tip-toe to examine the cut. \u201cIt\u2019s much deeper than the insect bites you\u2019ve given me when I make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Moving his knives to one hand, he cupped her cheek. \u201cThis is less than an insect bite to me. Do not worry that you will have to seek another consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that.\u201d But she relaxed, her hands falling to rest on her hips. \u201cSo how did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threw away your weapons. Galen taught you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were about to get me. It was meant to distract you so I could go for my knives\u2014or in a real fight, for my gun.\u201d Her gaze dipped to his left wing, making it clear she was referring to the weapon designed to disable angelic wings.</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t like the fact that he\u2019d forced her to defend herself with such violence that night, but he did not regret the starburst pattern of golden feathers that was the scar he wore on his wing. As far as he was concerned, it was as much a mark of Elena\u2019s claim on him as the amber ring he wore on his finger. \u201cIt may be a good strategy in certain situations,\u201d he said, looking at things from her point of view. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>When she moved as if to pick up the swords, he shook his head. \u201cNot today. You\u2019re starting to lag.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll cool down, shower, then I have an errand to run.\u201d The slightest pause that he only caught because he was looking right at her. \u201cI might ask Illium for some low-key flying lessons later\u2014the vertical takeoff thing is kicking my ass, but I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing until they\u2019d stowed their weapons and were stripping for the shower. \u201cWhat is this errand that puts such sorrow in your eyes, Elena?\u201d</p><p>Her naked back tensed, then shuddered. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you something,\u201d she said in a rush of words as he curved his fingers around her nape, stroking his thumb gently across her skin. \u201cRemember the first time you sent Illium to watch over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was after a meeting with your father\u2014you went to a bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a safety deposit box there for me. Jeffrey ... I don\u2019t know why, but he kept . . .\u201d It was hard to speak, to think about her father\u2019s baffling actions. He\u2019d thrown her out of his home, called her an abomination, and couldn\u2019t speak to her without bitter anger flowing between them like so much spilled wine. But . . .</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s things,\u201d she whispered, turning to face Raphael. \u201cHe kept my mother\u2019s things. They\u2019re in a storage unit out in Brooklyn.\u201d She\u2019d flown over the facility early that morning but hadn\u2019t been able to make herself land. \u201cI\u2019m so scared to go there. Because when I do ... I have to admit all over again that she left me, that she didn\u2019t love me enough to stay.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned at the backs of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall\u2014she\u2019d cried so much for her mom, but then she\u2019d gotten angry. \u201cSometimes, I hate her.\u201d That was her biggest secret and biggest sin.</p><p>Raphael leaned across to touch his forehead to hers. What I feel for Caliane is beyond hate at times\u2014for what she did, the atrocities she committed. And yet ...</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She buried her face in his neck. \u201cAnd yet . . .\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, she didn\u2019t have to tear the scab off that particular wound that day. Her cell phone was beeping with a message when she came out of the shower. Grabbing it, she frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s from the Guild.\u201d Guilty relief curled down her spine when she called back and was told to suit up for a hunt. \u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Raphael finished buttoning his shirt, the slots for his wings flowing with smooth perfection over his back. \u201cWhat does the Guild need from you?\u201d</p><p>She began to dress. \u201cThere\u2019s a bloodlust-ridden vampire in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senior angel in that territory should have sent me a report.\u201d Walking over, he picked up his own cell phone, found a message. \u201cTwo people are already dead.\u201d</p><p>Boots on, Elena began strapping on her weapons, including Deacon\u2019s gift to her. She had no control-chip-embedded weapons, but since Ransom\u2014already close to Boston\u2014would\u2019ve been issued one, that wasn\u2019t a problem. The control chips effectively knocked out a vampire\u2019s will for a short period, giving a hunter the chance to restrain the target\u2014because under normal circumstances, the Guild\u2019s people did not kill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Execution was an angel\u2019s job.</p><p>However, since bloodlust was involved in this case, they\u2019d been given the go-ahead to execute if retrieval proved too dangerous. \u201cRansom\u2019s almost there but he\u2019s got no backup.\u201d She called the other hunter her \u201calmost friend\u201d because they had a tendency to irritate each other as often as they made one another laugh, but she\u2019d spill blood for him in a heartbeat. As he would for her.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Elena set her jaw at that cool statement and finished strapping the miniature flamethrower to her other thigh. \u201cI let it go before, but I can\u2019t anymore.\u201d Walking to the vanity, she began to plait her damp hair with practiced quickness so that it would stay out of her way. The fine, silky stuff had a tendency to escape even the tightest braid, but the damp should help keep it contained. \u201cYou took a hunter as your consort, Raphael.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is no longer the only factor.\u201d An answer made in the tone of an immortal used to getting what he wanted. \u201cMore than one archangel would like your head as a trophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it life if you live it in a cage?\u201d A taut question as, braid done, she began to strap on her knife sheaths over her forearms. \u201cI won\u2019t live like that.\u201d</p><p>Twisting her braid around his hand as he came to stand behind her, Raphael pressed his mouth to the exposed skin of her nape. \u201cTake the chopper. You don\u2019t have the endurance to fly that far.\u201d</p><p>Emotionally vulnerable to him in a way that scared her at times like this, she pulled away, turned. \u201cWho\u2019ll be piloting the chopper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your final offer?\u201d</p><p>When the archangel merely looked at her with those eyes of pitiless blue, she had her answer. \u201cFine.\u201d Frustration turned her muscles rigid. \u201cBut make sure he keeps out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Elena made a call to Sara once they were in the air, stiffly conscious of the vampire at the chopper controls beside her. God, she was so mad at Raphael. She\u2019d known this fight was coming, but that made it no easier to handle\u2014especially when Raphael simply refused to give ground.</p><p>No negotiation. Nothing but an archangel\u2019s expectation of obedience.</p><p>If he thought that was the end of\u2014</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d Sara\u2019s voice sounded as if it was coming from the moon. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApproximately halfway to Boston,\u201d she said, then got straight to the reason why she\u2019d called. \u201cWhy did you pull me in?\u201d Not that she wasn\u2019t happy to be back in the field, but the Guild had any number of hunters at its disposal.</p><p>Sara\u2019s voice dropped out for a second, came back. \u201c... all over the place. We need everyone we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elena pressed on the headphones. \u201cRepeat that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires breaking their Contracts all over the place,\u201d Sara said. \u201cIt\u2019s like some weird\u2014\u201d A crackle of noise and the call dropped completely. But Elena had heard enough\u2014chaos on this scale could only be connected to one thing . . . only one being.</p><p>Caliane.</p><p>16</p><p>Ransom was waiting near the deserted concrete pier in Boston where he\u2019d asked her and Venom to land when she\u2019d made contact as they came into the city. Lifting her off her feet as soon as she reached him, he planted a smacking kiss on her laughing lips. \u201cEllie, those wings sure are sexy.\u201d</p><p>God, it was good to see him. \u201cPut me down, gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArchangel the jealous type?\u201d He continued to hold her, which argued to his strength\u2014her muscle mass was high to begin with and her wings only added to that.</p><p>Pushing at his shoulders, she freed herself. \u201cI thought we had a vampire to catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on.\u201d His face\u2014a stunning mix of Native American skin and bone structure, and eyes of Irish green\u2014was suddenly all business. \u201cThe trail leads to a particular section of warehouses about five minutes away on foot. That\u2019s why I asked you to land here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so close,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy did you wait for me?\u201d Pretty as he was, Ransom was also one of the Guild\u2019s top hunters, someone she\u2019d have at her back anytime.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just one, Ellie.\u201d He began to lead her past a huge boathouse and toward a number of warehouses she could see in the distance. \u201cAnd they\u2019re helping each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d It was rare, very rare, for vampires to hunt together\u2014but when they did ... \u201cWhat\u2019s the body count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two, last I heard.\u201d Ransom\u2019s long hair, a sleek tail down his back, shifted in the breeze as he gave her the update. \u201cBut that was half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be feeding if they\u2019re moving that fast.\u201d Which meant they were killing for the hell of it, and that made them a plague. \u201cYou said they\u2019re helping each other\u2014are they acting like they\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on a complex level, but someone\u2019s definitely home upstairs. Weird, huh?\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of Ignatius, wondered if Neha hadn\u2019t gotten the message after all.</p><p>Iron in the air, thick, fresh.</p><p>Ransom brought up a hand at the same instant that she caught the scent.</p><p>Raising her wings and tucking them tight to her body\u2014something she\u2019d finally learned to do on command\u2014she took a long, quiet breath.</p><p>Motor oil and fish.</p><p>Blood, rancid fat, effluent.</p><p>Blueberries bursting open, their juices staining the earth.</p><p>Any and all of them could be vampiric scents, but Ransom didn\u2019t need her nose today. He needed good old-fashioned backup. Pulling out the weapon Deacon had designed for her, the one she\u2019d taken to calling her \u201cblade-bow,\u201d she fell in behind him as the other hunter led her and Venom through the labyrinthine passageways between the warehouses.</p><p>The day had turned dull about an hour ago, clouds racing to cover the sun, and now, a fat pellet of rain hit Elena\u2019s cheek. She bit back a curse. If the vampires decided to run, the rain would be their willing accomplice in washing away the trail. Which meant they had to neutralize the targets here\u2014retrieval was simply not on the table, not if the vampires were hunting in a pack.</p><p>Her wing brushed against something sharp, snagged. She bit down on her lower lip to quiet her gasp and stopped just long enough to unhook her wing from the rusty nail. Blood darkened the midnight blue feathers near the center of her right wing, but she was more worried about tetanus. An instant later, she remembered she was no longer vulnerable to disease\u2014she still wasn\u2019t going to be punching corroded nails into her body anytime soon.</p><p>Continuing to hug one side of the thin alleyway as Ransom took the other, she glanced back at Venom. The vampire was sticking to her but keeping enough of a distance that he wouldn\u2019t be a liability in a fight\u2014in fact, given what she\u2019d seen of his skills, he\u2019d be an asset.</p><p>Blueberries, ripe, ripe blueberries.</p><p>She hissed under her breath at Ransom. When he turned, she motioned toward a warehouse about three down from where they currently stood. She saw him nod just before the skies opened and rain sleeted down like some great faucet had been turned on in the heavens.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she muttered, and abandoning all ideas of subtlety, ran toward the back of the warehouse as Ransom circled around to the front. She was only two feet from the wooden door when she caught a hint of sharp, astringent mint in the air, and then she was being slammed down onto the wet asphalt. Skin tore off her cheek, and her right hand landed awkwardly enough that she might have broken her wrist if she hadn\u2019t begun to half roll at the instant of contact. As it was, one of her wings crumpled under her with a searing pain that she hoped like hell didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d broken one of the fine bones within.</p><p>The weight on her back was gone the next moment, and she didn\u2019t have to look to know that Venom was dealing with the vampire who\u2019d attacked. She took one glance to make sure he had the upper hand\u2014oh, yeah\u2014before leaving him to it and closing the distance to the door. She could hear the hard, thudding sounds of fighting now, as well as a wave of eerie laughter from within, which meant they\u2019d ambushed Ransom as well.</p><p>Her hand tightened on the blade-bow.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Venom\u2019s breath at her ear, his hand on her arm. \u201cGo up, come in through the roof\u2014from the state of this place, it\u2019s probably half rotten anyway.\u201d</p><p>That would be a huge advantage but\u2014\u201cCan\u2019t do a vertical takeoff.\u201d</p><p>Venom went down on one knee, his eyes preternaturally vivid in the rain, his sunglasses having been lost in the fight. When he cupped his hands, she realized what he intended and slung the blade-bow over her shoulder. \u201cReady?\u201d She put one foot in his cupped hands, rested her hands on his muscled shoulders. At his nod, she said, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his hands and then he pushed. Vampires were fast and strong, but she\u2019d never have expected the power he put behind his assist. Twisting in midair, she managed to grip the lip of the roof, feeling the metal cut into her palms deep enough that blood gushed warm and thick. But that mattered nothing while Ransom was down there alone.</p><p>Using the muscle that made her hunter-born, she managed to get herself over and onto the roof\u2014and though one of her wings complained a little, it didn\u2019t appear broken. It was obvious Venom had been right about the condition of the roof. Knowing Ransom didn\u2019t have much time, she retrieved her bow, then ran across the cracked and rotting structure until she came to a part that caved in, taking her with it.</p><p>She allowed herself to fall, spreading out her wings to slow her momentum as she hit the warmer air inside the warehouse. Startled bloodstained faces lifted up to hers, male and female both, red swirling in those eyes. Bloodlust. That confirmed, she didn\u2019t give them any warning, just started firing. The little spinning blades cut through necks, sliced through brains, blew through hearts ... Jesus, she thought. Deacon was good.</p><p>Feet hitting the floor with a jarring thump, she yelled, \u201cRansom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dead yet!\u201d came the response from within a tangle of vampires.</p><p>That was when she saw the eyes in the walls, the vampires crouching up on ledges, ready to pounce. She turned just in time to take out two behind her. Christ, how many of them were there? Then there was no more time to think\u2014her wings made her so vulnerable on the ground that she couldn\u2019t afford to let them get close. Using the blade-bow one-handedly, she began firing the miniature flamethrower with the other. Not so useful a weapon when in flight, but it did a hell of a job in close combat.</p><p>Screams, high and shrill, filled the warehouse as flesh sizzled and charred, the smell nauseatingly akin to a backyard barbeque. And it wasn\u2019t only her and Ransom doing the damage. She glimpsed Venom with the wicked curved knives he liked\u2014where in the blazes had he pulled those from?\u2014slicing off vampiric heads with that reptilian speed that both repelled and fascinated her. Blood fountained as he executed a stacked blonde vampire about to claw at his face, spraying his cinnamon skin with ruby red droplets.</p><p>\u201cRansom, look out!\u201d she yelled as she saw one of the crouchers go for her friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ransom lifted a gun, shot, even as she drilled one of her blades into the vampire\u2019s skull. The male fell, his body twitching as if he was fighting to rise in spite of the fact his brains were leaking down his temples. But, he was damaged enough that they didn\u2019t have to worry about him for a while.</p><p>Fingers, slick and cold on the tip of her wing.</p><p>No. Her wings were highly sensitive and she hated having them touched by evil. The urge to spin, to act without thought was almost blinding, but she fought it and instead turned Deacon\u2019s blade-bow backward, calculating the location of the vamp from the scent of honey and marigolds so thick in her nose.</p><p>A gurgling sound, fingers spasming then slipping away told her she\u2019d hit her mark. Firing the flamethrower at a vamp who was running toward her in a fucking four-legged lope, she fried the petite brunette midjump before swiveling on her heel to turn the flames on the vampire who\u2019d touched her wing ... and who was trying to clamp his bloodstained teeth onto her feathers.</p> <p>When he met her eyes, he smiled. \u201cShe wakes.\u201d It was a near-sibilant whisper, his throat almost destroyed by her blade\u2014and still his eyes, they gleamed with an unholy joy. \u201cShe wakes.\u201d</p><p>Shaking off the shiver crawling up her spine, Elena said, \u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s goodnight for you.\u201d With that, she turned the flamethrower on the sucker.</p><p>When she swiveled back around, it was to a scene of carnage . . . with only two other people left upright. Ransom held two smoking big-ass guns, one on either side of his body, his legs spread as he stood checking to see if any of the vamps near him still breathed. His face was bloody with claw marks, his black T-shirt almost shredded off him, and his hair, having come loose in the struggle, ran a silky black rain down his back.</p><p>By the door near where she\u2019d been attacked stood Venom, blades swiveling in his hands, his suit jacket and tie gone, his white shirt splattered with blood. His hair, for once, wasn\u2019t GQ-perfect. Instead, it tumbled over his forehead, and paired with his feral smile, it turned him shockingly attractive in a very disturbing way.</p><p>His eyes, slitted and inhuman, met hers at that moment. \u201cI can\u2019t hear any pulses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check one by one to be sure,\u201d she said, chest rising and falling in short, sharp breaths like the two men. \u201cThis group was far too organized\u2014we don\u2019t want any of them waking up.\u201d</p><p>Silently, they did exactly that, covering every inch of the warehouse. \u201cI count fifteen,\u201d Ransom said, when they met in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I got,\u201d Venom added. \u201cThere\u2019s one outside, too, so sixteen in total.\u201d</p><p>Ransom really looked at the other man for the first time, shook his head, stared again. \u201cHoly hell, your eyes are like a fucking viper\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Venom raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou have hair prettier than one of Astaad\u2019s concubines.\u201d</p><p>Ransom gave the vampire the finger. Venom grinned.</p> <p>Certain that all was now well in the male world, Elena reached into her pocket and pulled out a spare hair tie, throwing it to Ransom. \u201cI\u2019d say this was impossible if I wasn\u2019t standing in the middle of it. We have what, maybe three rogue vamps in the state in a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogues, yes,\u201d Ransom pointed out, pulling his hair back in that rough way men had of doing. \u201cBloodlust? We\u2019d get maybe one that was totally whackjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sire keeps a tight control on his vampires,\u201d Venom said, going down on his haunches to wipe off his bloody blades using the shirt of a fallen vamp. \u201cThis simply shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>Remembering what that last vampire had said, Elena knew there was a high chance Caliane was behind this, but she kept her mouth shut. Much as it pained her to keep a secret from Ransom and the Guild, she\u2019d agreed to be Raphael\u2019s consort. He had her first loyalty. She wouldn\u2019t betray that trust\u2014more, she wouldn\u2019t share the shreds of information she had when nothing could be done about it.</p><p>\u201cWe need to ID the vampires,\u201d she said, bending to strap the blade-bow to one thigh and the miniature flamethrower to the other, \u201cnotify the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the authorities,\u201d Ransom said, pulling out his cell. \u201cThey know I was on this track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know at least two of the vampires from sight,\u201d Venom said, disappearing his blades into the crisscrossing black sheaths on his back that she could see now that he wasn\u2019t wearing his jacket. \u201cGive me a few minutes to see how many others I can ID.\u201d</p><p>As Venom did that, Elena went around checking for wallets where they hadn\u2019t been fried by her flames or otherwise destroyed. She ended up finding seven pieces. Venom ID\u2019ed four others from sight, which left them with five unknowns, most of them either charred beyond recognition or missing a face courtesy of Ransom\u2019s gun.</p> <p>\u201cThe angel in charge of this region is on his way with the authorities,\u201d Ransom told them, closing his cell phone. \u201cHe\u2019ll take care of the rest of the IDs. Looks like he\u2019s going to need to break out the DNA kit for a few.\u201d</p><p>Elena looked toward the hole in the roof where she\u2019d entered the warehouse and found rain still pouring in. \u201cI think we all need a shower.\u201d</p><p>The men didn\u2019t say anything as they followed her out of the warehouse and into the torrential downpour. The water around them turned to rust, then a pale orange, then sepia, until finally, it ran clear. Blinking the rain from her eyes, she walked back to the door.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d Ransom\u2019s voice. \u201cOur job is done. We just hold the scene until the cops arrive.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cI know, but I want to check their scents. This kind of a mass outbreak . . . for all we know, it could be a mutant virus.\u201d</p><p>Of course both men fell into step beside her, though they\u2019d already verified that every single one of the vampires was well and truly dead. Vampires weren\u2019t true immortals. They could be killed not only by other vampires and angels, but also by humans\u2014beheading and fire were the best methods, though removal of the heart also worked if you then cut or, in Ransom\u2019s case, blew off the head to make certain.</p><p>Leaving the two men to talk in quiet tones near the doorway, she went from body to body, searching, searching . . .</p><p>Dark, lyrical, lush.</p><p>There it was again, that haunting, intricate scent beneath the more brash smells of the fallen vampires. She was almost certain she\u2019d scented the same thing when the wind threatened to crash her into the Hudson . . . except something niggled at her, some \u201coff\u201d note she couldn\u2019t quite identify. \u201cDamn.\u201d She knew for certain she\u2019d be tracking down the essence of this particular black orchid as soon as she got back to the city.</p><p>Deep in the heart of Manhattan, Raphael snapped the neck of a bloodlust-ridden vampire after blazing through his mind to take what he needed to know. That information proved both sickening and . . . sad. Some would have said the Archangel of New York had no mercy in him, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the waste of life. Most of these vampires had gone mad beyond any hope of recovery.</p><p>An insane vampire could not be allowed to continue to live, because driven by the urge to consume blood far beyond that which was necessary for life, that vampire would kill hundreds of innocents. \u201cUnder five decades old,\u201d he said to Dmitri as the leader of his Seven came to stand beside him after dispatching his own prey. Around them, the city lay wrapped in a cloak of fear and danger, the lights in the high-rises fragile bulwarks against the dark that had fallen an hour earlier.</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Dmitri replied, the edge of his long black coat lifting slightly in the breeze. \u201cVenom just sent me a message\u2014all the ones he recognized in Boston were young. No one over six decades old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not yet conscious in truth, her strength weak,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cYet she can do this.\u201d Cause carnage on a scale unseen for centuries, turning formerly sane vampires into killing machines.</p><p>\u201cSire . . . Aodhan and Naasir, how close are they to finding her?\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked up at the sliver of moon visible in the cloud-heavy sky. \u201cMy mother,\u201d he said to one of the very few men he trusted, \u201cwas intelligent even in her final madness. She has not been found for over a thousand revolutions of the earth around the sun. Even if we do manage that, it will be no easy task to contain her.\u201d But he must attempt it.</p><p>For she lived because he had failed.</p><p>\u201cShh, my darling, shh.\u201d</p><p>The final words she\u2019d spoken to him as she walked away, her delicate feet getting ever smaller as she almost danced over the dew-laden grass. Dew glimmering with droplets of crimson, a sudden burst of color that had sprayed the meadow when he fell from so high; his wings crumpled, his body hitting the earth at a velocity that had torn off parts, left his mouth overflowing with blood, his ribs crushed into his heart and lungs, the leg that had remained attached to his body smashed into at least fifteen different fragments.</p><p>As he\u2019d lain there, vulnerable in a way he hadn\u2019t been since childhood, she\u2019d crouched down beside him, her fingers gentle and maternal as she pushed back blood-soaked strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, my poor darling. My poor Raphael. It hurts now, but it had to be done.\u201d Her blue, blue eyes awash in tenderness. \u201cYou will not die, Raphael. You cannot die. You are immortal.\u201d A kiss on his broken cheekbone, light as a butterfly. \u201cYou are the son of two archangels.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, couldn\u2019t speak, his throat crushed. But she understood what was in his eyes\u2014immortals could die. He\u2019d watched his father die. At his mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHe had to die, my love. If he had not, hell would have reigned on earth.\u201d A slow smile when he continued to stare up at her, saying a thousand things even in his silence. \u201cAnd so must I\u2014that is why you came to kill me, is it not?\u201d Laughter, soft and full of a mother\u2019s delight in her son. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, my sweet Raphael. Only another of the Cadre of Ten can destroy an archangel. And they will never find me.\u201d</p><p>Her feet moving light and graceful across the grass, the soles of her feet tinged with the red of his lifeblood. Angel-dust trailing from her wings, sparkling and glittering with a purity that mocked.</p><p>\u201cCome, Dmitri,\u201d he said, shoving the memories back into the shadows where they had remained for most of his adult life. \u201cWe must continue.\u201d Not since he\u2019d first taken the city as his own had he had to help run such a patrol\u2014he was an archangel, his focus on larger matters.</p><p>But today, as evening turned to night, he needed to fly, to sweep across his city and clear it of the evil that Caliane had unleashed. His mother would not take his territory. And he would not fail again\u2014even if it meant killing the woman who had once cradled him in her arms with such infinite love that the echo of it haunted him even now.</p><p>17</p><p>Elena and Venom helped Ransom sweep the rain-slick streets of Boston after the authorities cleared them to leave the warehouse site. They found only one other vampire\u2014but he was so deep in bloodlust he didn\u2019t even look up from nuzzling his victim\u2019s mutilated neck when Ransom walked up behind him. His head rolled off his neck an instant later, spraying Ransom with blood once again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered tiredly as the drizzle soaked the blood farther into his clothing, no longer strong enough to wash him clean. \u201cCall the cops.\u201d He threw her his phone, and she redialed the number he\u2019d used earlier.</p><p>That done, she sat down on the steps of one of the gracious old homes that lined this quiet stretch. All of them were now locked, lights blazing through every window. The word had apparently gone out in the media about a surge of bloodlust-ridden vamps, and anyone with a brain had hunkered down to wait out the violence.</p><p>To her surprise, Venom sat down beside her, leaving enough of a gap between them that he wouldn\u2019t brush her wings by accident. She was sure it wasn\u2019t a courtesy directed at her, but habit, given how much time he spent around angels. Still, she was grateful.</p><p>From Ransom, she\u2019d accept that kind of contact. But Venom? They might work together, and he\u2019d proven he had a heart behind those disturbing eyes when he\u2019d put his life on the line to protect the children in the Medica not long ago, but when it came to her, he held far less charitable views. \u201cPity about your suit,\u201d she said, glancing at the rolled-up sleeves of his bloodstained white shirt.</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of my favorites.\u201d Slitted green eyes looking directly at her.</p><p>But she\u2019d learned her lesson. She shifted her gaze forward to Ransom. Venom\u2019s laugh was soft, taunting, but she didn\u2019t fall for the bait. If he entranced her, she\u2019d be easy prey\u2014and she wasn\u2019t sure the creature that lived in Venom would be able to resist taking advantage. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask.\u201d He leaned back with his elbows on the step behind him as they watched Ransom check the victim and her killer for ID.</p><p>\u201cThose eyes,\u201d she said, \u201chow long did they take to develop after you were Made?\u201d Every vampire had once been human, even Venom.</p><p>A rippling shrug that made her aware of the fluid, muscular grace that lurked beneath those fancy suits he liked to wear. \u201cJury\u2019s out on that. Neha says it began the moment of my Making, that she glimpsed the pupils start to change shape.\u201d</p> <p>Every hair on Elena\u2019s body stood up straight at the sound of that name. The Archangel of India had never been Miss Con-geniality, but as the murders of Celia and Betsy evidenced, she was now one scary nightmare intent only on vengeance for the death of her daughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree?\u201d she asked, shaking off the reaction.</p><p>Venom looked up at the cloudy night sky, fine droplets of rain shimmering on his lashes. \u201cI noticed a change perhaps a year after my Making. It was slight, but I could see that my irises were no longer true brown at the edges but were shifting to a dark, dark green.\u201d</p><p>Elena wondered how that had affected the young male Venom must\u2019ve been\u2014she wanted to ask if he\u2019d been scared, but knew he wouldn\u2019t answer that. \u201cHow many years did the entire process take?\u201d she asked instead, figuring he\u2019d be far more liable to answer that question.</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d he said, continuing to stare up at the sky, the rain having all but ceased. \u201cI remain the only one of Neha\u2019s Making to show such an extreme change\u2014I think she was disappointed it stopped with the eyes.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the way he\u2019d moved the one and only time they\u2019d sparred with each other, she shook her head. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t, did it?\u201d</p><p>A lazy smile that she caught out of the corner of her eye.</p> <p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Ransom said at that moment, coming to lean against the decorative metal railing that ran alongside the steps. \u201cYou need a place to stay tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Venom\u2019s going to fly us back to New York.\u201d To her archangel. Argument or not, she couldn\u2019t deny that she missed him. For the first time in her life, she had someone who was hers, and somewhat to her surprise, she was discovering she was possessive as hell.</p><p>Ransom\u2019s face lit up with wicked glee. \u201cLiving the high life, Ellie. You\u2019ll be forgetting your friends soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already crossed you off my party invite list.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, throwing back his head. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you as the hostess with the mostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be waiting an eternity.\u201d The idea of being a hostess of any kind gave her hives.</p><p>\u201cYou are consort to an archangel,\u201d Venom said, rising to his feet with a sensual grace that came from the same place as his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to learn at least the rudiments of civilized behavior.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the wet iron of the railing, she pulled herself up just as two cop cars turned the corner. \u201cYeah? Being a dick doesn\u2019t seem to have stopped you from working for Raphael.\u201d</p> <p>Venom grinned, flashing those canines she\u2019d seen weep poison. \u201cI can be charming. Didn\u2019t seem worth the effort with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s just asking for an ass-kicking,\u201d Ransom drawled. \u201cToo bad the bloodbath\u2019s going to have to wait.\u201d Turning, he headed toward the police officers, with Elena and Venom following.</p><p>It took only fifteen minutes to get the formalities sorted\u2014the cops were ready to give them medals after the night the city had had\u2014and then they were away. Ransom had left his bike near where they\u2019d landed the chopper, and she hugged him as they reached it. \u201cHow\u2019s your librarian?\u201d she whispered in his ear.</p><p>His lips curved against the skin of her neck. \u201cShe makes my brain melt.\u201d</p><p>Continuing to be amazed by the fact that Ransom was in a stable relationship, she pulled back. \u201cWhen do I get to meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare her off just yet.\u201d Joking words, but they held a grain of truth\u2014hunters often had trouble holding on to the men and women they loved for the same reason as cops. The endless fear of picking up the phone or opening the door to the worst kind of news wore away at emotional ties until they were burned through.</p><p>Elena hugged him again. \u201cIf she\u2019s stuck this long, I think the foundation is set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I like to think so.\u201d Ransom squeezed her tight. \u201cBut I\u2019m not taking us, or Nyree, for granted.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never heard him sound so serious about a woman. Hoping like hell this Nyree didn\u2019t break his heart, she left him straddling the bike and headed over to the chopper, Venom at her side. It startled her to realize that not only had she and Venom had a fairly reasonable conversation tonight, they hadn\u2019t threatened to kill each other once. Huh. Probably a side effect of the adrenaline, the camaraderie that came from being in a bloody bat\u2014</p><p>The earth moved beneath her feet.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>She clamped her wings tight to her back as the movement threw her sideways onto the concrete ... on the same side where she\u2019d gone down in front of the warehouse. More skin peeled off her face, her palms suffering further damage as well.</p><p>Hands clamping around her ankles.</p><p>Looking down, she saw that Venom had her in a powerful grip, his own feet braced against the base of the chopper. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Following the direction of his gaze, she felt the air whoosh out of her lungs. The other side of the concrete pier was just . . . gone, a gaping hole in the earth with jagged insides that would tear apart her wings\u2014and she was a bare two inches from the edge. Nodding at Venom, she let him pull her toward him as the earth continued to roll.</p><p>In any other situation, it would\u2019ve felt disturbingly intimate to have his hands on her calves, her thighs, her hips as he pulled her down until she could brace her own feet against their transport, her wings spread over them both. \u201cThe chopper might tip!\u201d she said in his ear, fighting to be heard over the roar of the quake.</p><p>His hair whipped off his face. \u201cI\u2019ve been in other quakes! This one feels like it should be over soon!\u201d Under her wing, his hand dug into her hip as another wave struck.</p><p>With it came a whisper of scent that was darkly familiar.</p><p>Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the quake was over, taking the scent with it before she could even begin to break it down. But she knew she\u2019d sensed it above the Hudson.</p><p>Scrambling away as fast as she could\u2014her wings were screaming with sensation\u2014she got to her feet.</p><p>Venom flowed to a standing position with that strange reptilian grace an instant later, not commenting on her jerky escape. \u201cWe need to get away before another tremor strikes.\u201d He was already reaching for the cockpit door.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Her blood turning cold, she was running even as she yelled out instructions over her shoulder. \u201cStart the engine! I need to find Ransom!\u201d</p><p>Venom was by her side before she finished speaking. She didn\u2019t bother to curse. Following Ransom\u2019s familiar scent, which though not as clear to her as a vampiric trail, was more so than it would\u2019ve been to the majority of humans, she sprinted down the narrow lane he\u2019d taken to get out onto the main road. \u201cThere!\u201d</p><p>The bike lay smashed on the retaining wall opposite the lane, Ransom\u2019s body unmoving in the street. Going down beside him, she checked for a pulse. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Ransom groaned. \u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you move?\u201d she asked, running her hands over his body. \u201cAny broken bones, problems with your back?\u201d</p><p>Fisting his hands he pushed himself up into a kneeling position. \u201cI\u2019m okay, just stunned. Wasn\u2019t going very fast when the quake hit.\u201d His eyes were dilated, huge in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us,\u201d she said, pulling him to his feet, his arm slung over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy bike.\u201d Still dazed, he glanced back at his pride and joy.</p><p>Venom took Ransom\u2019s other side. \u201cI\u2019ll call one of the local vampires once we\u2019re in the air. He\u2019ll store it for you.\u201d</p><p>There were no more words as they half ran, half dragged Ransom back to the chopper. They\u2019d barely gotten inside when the earth began to pitch and roll again. Not bothering to put on his headphones, Venom just said, \u201cHold on!\u201d and lifted the bird.</p><p>They shook precariously under an insufficient amount of rotor action, but jaw locked and hands steady, Venom managed to get them airborne. Elena looked down as they rose. \u201cMy God.\u201d The city was literally bucking under them, parts of the road rising up in a rolling wave, buildings crumbling into newly created canyons. The only good news was that instead of shaking Boston as a whole, the quake seemed oddly localized\u2014to an approximately fifty-meter radius around the spot where they\u2019d parked the chopper.</p><p>Hardly a natural phenomenon.</p><p>She is waking.</p><p>If this was what she could do while asleep ...</p><p>Having bullied Ransom into getting himself checked out at the hospital, Elena refused to leave until his librarian arrived. Nyree was a surprise\u2014because Elena had had no idea what to expect. The woman couldn\u2019t have cleared five feet two inches, and had curves so lethal the prim blue cardigan she wore buttoned up to her neck was probably an attempt at camouflage. It didn\u2019t work, even paired with a full skirt straight out of the 1950s and simple flats, both in plain black.</p><p>As Nyree neared Ransom\u2019s cubicle, Elena saw that her skin was a light brown, her features so unusual it was difficult to pinpoint ethnicity\u2014but it was her eyes that stole the show. Huge and chocolate-dark, and overflowing with worry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t even see Elena standing to the side of the cubicle, she was so focused on her man. \u201cRansom!\u201d Stroking Ransom\u2019s hair off his face where he sat on the bed, she checked his wounds with delicate, tender touches. \u201cBaby, you\u2019re so hurt.\u201d</p><p>To Elena\u2019s surprise, tough as nails Ransom didn\u2019t shake off his lover\u2019s hands, but instead leaned into the touch. It was the first time in Elena\u2019s life that she\u2019d seen him allow anyone to tend to him\u2014and it made her deeply curious about the woman who\u2019d captured his heart. That curiosity, however, would have to wait until another day. Keeping to the shadows, she slipped out while they were wrapped up in each other.</p><p>By the time she jumped off the chopper onto the wet green of the grass outside the house, it was well after midnight. \u201cYou bunking here tonight?\u201d she asked Venom.</p><p>Shaking his head, he pulled the door shut in her face.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she muttered, \u201cgoodnight to you, too.\u201d Wings dragging like that of an exhausted angelic child, she walked straight into the arms of the archangel who waited for her. Those arms clamped around her as he shifted a few degrees to shield her from the wind generated by the rising machine.</p><p>Drawing the rain-laced scent of him into her lungs, she released a breath, then repeated the action until she felt something inside her sigh and lay down its weapons. \u201cHow was your night, Archangel? Mine was interesting.\u201d</p><p>You carry marks on your skin, Elena. It was a demand for an explanation.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, she\u2019d probably have bristled at that. Now ... it was kind of nice coming home to someone who bothered to notice that she\u2019d gotten a little banged up on the job. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you feed me and let me use that decadent bath of yours.\u201d The bath where they\u2019d first touched each other in a hungry passion that still made her breath catch each time she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling a frisson of awareness at the sexual edge in that command, she slipped her hand into his as he drew her inside the house and toward their room. That was when she saw the blood on his shirt. \u201cHey!\u201d She stopped. Or tried to.</p><p>When he kept going, she decided to beard him in the bedroom.</p><p>Soon as the door closed, she broke away and put her hands on her hips, the cuts on her palms no longer tender, though they didn\u2019t look pretty. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, he pulled the shirt over the top of his head, the wing slots sliding over the glory of his wings with a soft hush of sound. A second later, he dropped the shirt to the side, his expression moody in a way that made her want to push him to the bed and ride him until both their brains were scrambled. Fighting the temptation, she circled around to his back. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt!\u201d</p><p>Three massive gouges marked his skin.</p><p>Blinking, she looked closer, felt her mouth fall open. \u201cThey\u2019re healing right before my eyes.\u201d Which either meant the injury was recent, or the damage had been worse before. She glanced at his shirt, measured the blood, decided the injury had been worse.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an archangel, Elena. It is but a scratch.\u201d Turning, he slammed her body to his. \u201cTake off your top.\u201d</p><p>It was suddenly difficult to think, but she sucked in a breath, found the will. \u201cHow did you get so badly hurt?\u201d</p><p>Placing his hand on the shoulder of her long-sleeved black top, he gripped ... and tore. Her top was in shreds around her a second later, her breasts bare to his gaze since the bra had been built in. Abdomen taut with need, chest rising and falling in an uneven rhythm, she licked her lips. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>His answer was to dip his head, bend her over his arm, and suck one tight little nipple into his mouth.</p><p>Shuddering, she thrust her hands into his hair and pulled. He used his teeth on her. She hissed out a breath. \u201cRaphael.\u201d It was meant to be an admonishment but it turned into a moan as he covered her other breast with his hand, squeezing and caressing with a confidence that turned her knees to butter.</p><p>That was when she thought, \u201cHell with it,\u201d and arched her body into the voracious hunger of his mouth. It didn\u2019t surprise her in the least when he moved the hand on her breast down to the front of her jeans . . . and tore them off. Her panties were next. A second later, she was being thrown onto the massive sea of a bed, her wings spreading out on the cool softness of the comforter even as Raphael gripped her legs at the knees and pushed up and out, baring her to him.</p><p>Searing blue met her eyes when she looked up. Then his wings began to glow. She hadn\u2019t seen him get rid of his pants and cried out as his erection began to part her most delicate flesh. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>A kiss that demanded, his body all golden muscle and heat above her own.</p> <p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she ordered, and when he continued to thrust into her slow and deep, she wrapped her legs around him, using her own strength to tumble him onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cElena!\u201d He caught himself before he would\u2019ve crushed her even as she screamed at the shock of sensation as his cock drove in all the way.</p><p>For an instant, they both lay unmoving, connected to each other with an intimacy Elena had never experienced before him.</p><p>Did I hurt you?</p><p>Never. Stroking her hands down the skin of his back, making sure to rub her knuckles along the sensitive undersides of his wings, she said, \u201cKiss me, Archangel.\u201d At the same instant, she squeezed her muscles around the steely part of him that was lodged so deep inside of her.</p><p>Fisting his hand in her hair, he took her mouth as he moved his other hand to pin down her hip. The first stroke made her body arch, a scream pouring into his mouth. The second had her clenching convulsively around him as pleasure broke her into a thousand iridescent pieces.</p><p>18</p><p>His consort, Raphael thought as Elena lay quivering below him, his mate. Again, Hunter. Gritting his teeth against the urge to thrust, he flexed his cock within her, had the pleasure of hearing her gasp.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t surrender. Eyes hazy, she kissed his jaw, his neck, before pushing at his chest. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>He let her reverse their positions so that he lay on his back, his wings covering the bed on either side. Palms pressed to his chest, she rose up on him, a vision of breasts flushed a silky rose with passion; pale, winter-light hair tousled from the play of his hands; wings a stunning midnight arching above her shoulders; and sleekly muscular thighs. The rest of her legs remained covered\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted to wait long enough to pull off what remained of her jeans. As for her feet . . .</p><p>Boots. She still wore her boots.</p><p>His consort, he thought again. Magnificent and wild, and his.</p><p>When she bent down to kiss him, the act lushly intimate within the cage created by the silken fall of her hair, he surrendered, let her take him. Her body moved in rhythmic counterpoint to the teasing strokes of her tongue, and he knew his hunter was about to push him over the edge.</p><p>Not without you.</p><p>Trying something he\u2019d never before attempted in their lovemaking, he dropped his shields. She was a young immortal, didn\u2019t know the rules, didn\u2019t know how to keep her own shields up at such a time. He\u2019d never invaded her\u2014that was an intimacy to be given, not taken. But he allowed her mind to sweep out, to invade his.</p><p>Her body jerked above him, her beautiful eyes turning a pleasure-washed silver as she cried out and came in a clenching burst of damp heat. That was all it took. He fell, throwing up his shields only because the impact of that much sensation could hurt her\u2014and even in this extremity of passion, he would not hurt her, this hunter with a mortal heart who held his own in her hands.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t say a word when Raphael scooped her up in those powerful arms\u2014after she\u2019d kicked off her boots and socks, the remainder of her jeans\u2014and took her through to the bath, the water set at a bone-melting temperature. Sinking into it with a sigh, she felt her butt connect with one of the small ledges and figuring that was enough, let her head fall back, reasonably certain her eyes were still rolled up inside her head.</p><p>A wash of water against her skin, her archangel getting in with her.</p><p>Temptation rose, and she opened her eyes, ran her gaze over the muscular strength of his legs, the ridged plane of his abdomen. It was a very private pleasure, and one she intended to indulge in as often as possible. \u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealed.\u201d He sank down into the water, bracing his arms on the rim of the bath. \u201cA miscalculation on my part\u2014I flew too close to the steel girders of a construction project in progress.\u201d</p><p>Forcing her body to move, she floated over to sit next to him, placing her head on one of his shoulders, her palm over his heart. It was a position she\u2019d never have taken with another man\u2014but Raphael, in spite of the frustration he was causing her with the constant bodyguards, understood who she was, understood that a small surrender didn\u2019t equal a larger one. \u201cYou don\u2019t make miscalculations like that.\u201d</p><p>He curled his arm around her, fingers painting lazy patterns on her skin. \u201cWe had a windstorm hit perhaps an hour after the earthquake shook part of Boston. I was able to compensate for the shove of wind, but not fast enough.\u201d</p><p>That made more sense. \u201cThat quake was really weird, Raphael. It was so localized.\u201d Reaching up, she ran her fingers along the arch of his wing with delicate precision.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>Smiling at the warning, she tilted up her head and brushed her lips over his jaw. \u201cThe earthquake?\u201d</p><p>The endless blue of the deepest part of the ocean held her gaze before she dipped her head to kiss the line of his throat. His fingers clenched in her hair, but that big, powerful body remained relaxed, an archangel at rest in his consort\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou say the vampires appeared to be drawn to that same general area?\u201d His chest rose and fell in an easy rhythm underneath her touch, his heartbeat strong and certain.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, using her teeth on the tendons she\u2019d just kissed. \u201cEven the one we found later seemed to have been heading in that direction.\u201d Only to be overcome by a lust for blood that would allow no other thought. \u201cBut the thing is, the focus of the quake seemed to be the chopper.\u201d</p><p>Not the chopper, you.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI was trying to avoid that conclusion.\u201d</p><p>A tug from the hand fisted in her hair, her head being tipped back\u2014but this time, there was no kiss. \u201cYour face is severely bruised.\u201d Raising his free hand, he gripped her chin and tilted her face to the side so he could assess the damage. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost more than the upper layer of skin alone.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t protest. After all, she\u2019d ordered him to strip so she could examine his injuries. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that bad.\u201d In fact, she had the sense the skin was already beginning to regenerate\u2014way faster than it would\u2019ve on a human.</p><p>A kick to the heart, that reminder, that knowledge that she was no longer mortal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take at least two days to heal on its own,\u201d he said, releasing her chin. \u201cThere are bruises on your ribs and hips, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you have time to notice?\u201d Rising to straddle him, she put her arms around his neck and nuzzled a kiss to his pulse, feeling affectionate in a way she\u2019d never been comfortable enough to express with anyone else. \u201cSeemed to me like you were far more interested in other parts of my anatomy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strong, wet hands on her waist. \u201cHow much does it hurt?\u201d Sensual lips, eyes full of a dark male promise, but his expression made it clear they\u2019d be doing nothing interesting until she came clean.</p><p>Blowing out a breath, she pointed to a rib. \u201cThat one hurts but not so much that it bothered me while we were engaging in gymnastics in the bedroom.\u201d The near-painful hunger to touch, to take and be taken had wiped out every other sensation, every other need. \u201cMy left wing is tender\u2014I might\u2019ve strained something.\u201d She held up her palms. \u201cThe cuts seem to be healing.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised his hand, blue fire licking over his palm. Her stomach went taut at the reminder of the sheer power he carried within. But this flame, it was nothing that would harm. When he placed his hand against her ribs, all she felt was a warmth so deep it infiltrated her very bones.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The soft cry escaped her lips as the sensation spread in a burst of electric heat, arrowing to the places where she hurt the most\u2014but a hint of it pulsed in every vein and artery ... and there was a whisper of sex to it that had nothing to do with healing. \u201cArchangel, if you make everyone feel like this when you heal,\u201d she said in a husky tone, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a problem with it.\u201d</p> <p>His lips didn\u2019t curve, and yet there was a sinful amusement in the voice that came into her mind. It is a special blend, Elena. For you.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d said that to her, he\u2019d covered her in angel-dust. Erotic, exotic, and designed to kiss every inch of her skin with shimmering arousal. \u201cGood,\u201d she replied, leaning forward to nip at his lower lip. \u201cThen you may heal others.\u201d</p><p>I appreciate the permission.</p><p>Her lips kicked up at the solemn statement paired with the wicked sensuality she glimpsed in his gaze. That look ... it was still new. Raphael didn\u2019t often allow the young angel he\u2019d once been\u2014reckless and wild and cocky\u2014to rise to the surface. But when he did . . . \u201cAre you done?\u201d she murmured against his mouth.</p><p>His answer was to slide his hands to her hips and tug her forward, over the steely hunger of his body. \u201cCome, hunter,\u201d he said, using his teeth on the sensitive curve where her neck flowed into her shoulder, \u201ctake me.\u201d</p> <p>And she did.</p><p>Elena wandered into the dining room the next morning to find it set with a delicious array from which to choose. Grabbing two croissants and a large cup of black coffee, she walked out into the crisp air, following her instincts until she found Raphael standing on the very edge of the cliff that plunged down into the Hudson. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, passing over a croissant. \u201cEat or Montgomery\u2019s feelings will be hurt.\u201d</p><p>He took the offering but didn\u2019t put it to his lips. \u201cLook at the water, Elena. What do you see?\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at the river that had been, in one way or another, a part of her life since she was born, she saw churned up silt, sullen waves. \u201cIt\u2019s in a bad mood today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stole her coffee, took a sip. \u201cIt appears water is in a bad mood across the world. A massive tsunami just hit the east coast of Africa, with no apparent link to an earthquake.\u201d</p><p>Stealing back her coffee, she bit into her croissant, savored the buttery texture before swallowing. \u201cAny definite word yet on where she might be Sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. However, Lijuan may have something\u2014we will see.\u201d Finishing off the croissant she\u2019d given him, he took the coffee. \u201cYou visit your father again today.\u201d</p><p>The food she\u2019d eaten curdled in her stomach. \u201cNo, not him. I visit my sister, Eve. She needs me.\u201d She would not allow Jeffrey to treat Evelyn as he\u2019d treated Elena\u2014as something ugly, something worthless. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he lied to me for so long about the hunting bloodline.\u201d It had been a lie of omission, but that made it no less terrible.</p><p>\u201cYour father has never been a man who values honesty.\u201d A cutting denunciation before he turned to her. \u201cFive days hence, your presence is required here. Tell the Guild you will be unavailable.\u201d</p><p>Spine stiffening at what was unquestionably an order, she grabbed her coffee from him, not amused to find it all gone. \u201cDo I get to know the reason for the royal summons?\u201d</p><p>A raised eyebrow, her archangel\u2019s night black hair whipping off his face in the breeze coming off the churning waters of the Hudson. \u201cThe Hummingbird has asked to meet my consort.\u201d</p><p>All her snippiness disappeared under a surge of near-painful emotion. After Beijing, when she\u2019d been forced to rest so her body could recover, she\u2019d often curled up in an armchair in Raphael\u2019s office at the Refuge. But instead of reading the history books Jessamy had assigned her, she\u2019d ended up speaking to him about so many things.</p><p>Sometime during that period, he\u2019d told her pieces of what Illium\u2019s mother had done for him when he\u2019d been at his most vulnerable. As a result, Elena felt a deep sense of allegiance toward the angel she\u2019d never met. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered\u2014is that why you took Illium into your service?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause he was hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, yes.\u201d He closed his fingers over the back of her neck, tugging her to him. \u201cThe Hummingbird has my loyalty, and it was a small thing to accept her son into the ranks of my people when he came of age.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of everything he\u2019d shared, Elena had always had the feeling that she was missing a vital detail when Raphael spoke of the Hummingbird, and today was no different. There was something in his tone, a hidden shadow she couldn\u2019t quite discern\u2014added to Illium\u2019s subdued presence the day before yesterday, it made her wonder ... but some secrets, she\u2019d learned, belonged to others.</p><p>\u201cHowever, Illium soon proved himself,\u201d Raphael continued. \u201cNow, my bond with the Hummingbird is a separate thing.\u201d</p><p>Having seen Illium in action, Elena could well believe that. \u201cI\u2019ll be home. Do I need to dress up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The Hummingbird is an angel of old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew my mother. She knew Caliane.\u201d</p><p>The waves at their feet rose up, crashing in savage fury, as if Caliane was attempting once more to claim her son.</p><p>Half an hour later, Elena found herself watching Raphael fly out over the Hudson to Archangel Tower to begin what was surely going to be one hell of a complicated day.</p><p>\u201cThe angels across my territory have been ordered to send in reports of all recent disturbances and losses,\u201d he\u2019d told her before he rose into the sky. \u201cBoston was neither the first, nor the only casualty, simply the biggest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, but I have a feeling we\u2019ll need your skills again before long.\u201d</p><p>It was an ominous prediction, but since worrying would get her nowhere, and this was the first real lull\u2014for her at least\u2014since her arrival in New York, Elena decided to use some of the time to settle in. The first place she headed to was the greenhouse, the glass sparkling under the blade-sharp sunlight today.</p><p>Waterfalls of color and fragrance filled the glass enclosure, so many things to explore, but she headed to the corner occupied by her favorite begonias. A twinge of sadness pinched her as she touched her finger to one perfect red gold blossom, thinking of the plants at her former apartment, all of which had no doubt perished after she fell broken and bloody into an archangel\u2019s embrace. \u201cBut plants grow again,\u201d she murmured, focusing on the verdant beauty around her. \u201cThey put down new roots, create room for themselves in foreign soil.\u201d</p><p>And so would she.</p><p>Feeling good about making a conscious choice, she picked out the smallest, weakest begonia plant, took her time repotting it in richer soil, then cradled the pot carefully in her hands as she walked back to the house. Montgomery gave her a smile when she entered through the front door. \u201cThe solar on the third floor gets the best sunlight,\u201d he said.</p><p>They had a solar? \u201cThanks.\u201d Walking up the stairs, she wandered around the second floor until she found the neatly concealed flight to the third, and began climbing.</p><p>Her breath escaped in a hush of sound the instant she entered the room at the end of the corridor. Light poured in through two glass walls and a huge skylight to drench the room in sunshine. One of those walls, she realized, seeing the window seat, was actually latched. \u201cOf course.\u201d An angel wouldn\u2019t worry about the danger of falling from such a height. And, the hunter in her murmured, it would also act as another exit, ensuring she\u2019d never be trapped.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much in the room in terms of furnishings. A rug in a rich cream patterned with tiny golden leaves; a delicate little wooden table, its legs carved in graceful commas; a number of jewel-toned silk cushions on the window seat, that was it. Placing her plant on the ledge above the seat, she made her way down to the second floor. \u201cMontgomery,\u201d she called out over the railing when she spotted him below.</p><p>The butler glanced up, doing his best not to appear scandalized by the fact that she was acting in a most uncivilized fashion. \u201cGuild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the solar belong to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you have just claimed it.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she blew him a kiss and was almost sure he blushed. She was about to head back upstairs when she frowned, catching the unexpected caress of fur and chocolate and all things a little bit bad. \u201cWhy is Dmitri here?\u201d</p><p>The vampire materialized out of the woodwork at the mention of his name, dressed in a black suit paired with a deep emerald green shirt, a sheaf of papers in hand. \u201cNo time to play today, Elena.\u201d Yet a tendril of smoke and champagne wrapped around her. \u201cI have to get back to the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that Montgomery had left, Elena fought the urge to bury a dagger in the wall by Dmitri\u2019s head, quite certain he was provoking her on purpose. \u201cDon\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out.\u201d</p><p>That tendril of smoke whispered into places it had no business going. \u201cIf you want to confirm the scent of Neha\u2019s assassin,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re holding the body as is in the morgue till eleven.\u201d</p><p>The kiss of musk on her senses, thick and drugging.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d The scent snapped off as Dmitri stared at the thin, silver knife that quivered in the wooden wall a bare centimeter from that sensual face with its Slavic cheekbones. Then, unexpectedly, he began to laugh, and it was perhaps the first time she\u2019d heard the genuine thing from him.</p><p>It was potent. More sexy than any of his scent tricks.</p><p>Looking up, he gave her a strangely old-world bow, laughter still creasing his cheeks. \u201cI go now, Guild Hunter.\u201d But he stopped at the door, his expression turning solemn. \u201cI left a copy of the latest report on Holly Chang in the library.\u201d</p><p>Elena clenched her hand on the railing at the mention of the only one of Uram\u2019s victims to have survived. The woman\u2014girl really\u2014had been tainted by the dead archangel\u2019s toxic blood ... an innocent, who in the ultimate insult, might turn monstrous. \u201cHow is she?\u201d The last time Elena had seen Holly, the girl had been naked and covered in the blood of Uram\u2019s other victims, her mind broken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dmitri\u2019s answer was a long time coming. \u201cShe appears to be in a stable relationship, but she is ... different. I may yet have to execute her.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s chilling words continued to circle in Elena\u2019s head as she dropped by the morgue to ensure the dead woman had indeed been the one who\u2019d murdered the vampire in the park. All it took was a single deep breath\u2014the sweet poison of oleander was embedded in the assassin\u2019s skin. That done, Elena snuck into the Tower to take a quick shower. It felt wrong to meet Evelyn straight after having come from the house of the dead.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d she said twenty minutes later as she led her sister through the solid steel doors of Guild Academy, conscious of the tension in that small, sturdy body. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to join as a full member, and no one expects you to live here, but you\u2019ll be set a schedule of after-school classes to help you hone and control your abilities.\u201d</p> <p>Evelyn glanced over her shoulder, to where Amethyst walked stiff-backed beside Gwendolyn. \u201cAmy can come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if you want.\u201d Unexpectedly, though it was Eve who was hunter-born, it was Amy with her fiercely nurtured anger and keen distrust who reminded Elena most of herself. Eve, she thought, was still young enough to see the world as she wanted to see it. Amy had had the rose-colored lenses ripped off long ago, likely understood the painful truth of the relationship that seemed to exist between Gwendolyn and Jeffrey.</p><p>The ghost of Marguerite haunted them both.</p><p>Shaking off that thought as they reached the glass door to the waiting area, Elena pushed through. To her surprise, the man who met them inside was in a high-tech wheelchair. That wasn\u2019t the surprise, however. \u201cVivek!\u201d Closing the distance between them, she cupped his face, kissed him on both cheeks, having not realized how much she\u2019d missed him until this moment.</p><p>He blushed but didn\u2019t shove back his wheelchair. \u201cWow, look at those wings. I thought everyone was pulling my leg even after I saw the news reports.\u201d Moving his chair using a pressure control, he ignored Evelyn, Amethyst, and Gwendolyn as he peered at her feathers. \u201cWould you be willing to let me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d she said, putting her hand gently between Eve\u2019s shoulder blades, compelled by a sense of responsibility to get this right, to make sure her youngest sister would never ever think herself cursed rather than gifted. \u201cI\u2019ve brought the Guild a new student.\u201d</p><p>Vivek\u2019s attention shifted at once, his brown eyes hard, incisive. \u201cHunter-born,\u201d he said with curt assurance. \u201cNowhere near as strong as you, but strong enough to get herself in trouble if she\u2019s not careful.\u201d</p><p>Evelyn shifted closer to Elena at that harsh, almost cold summation. Elena tugged on her ponytail. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. Vivek talks to computers most of the time\u2014humans are too much trouble as far as he\u2019s concerned.\u201d It was highly atypical to see him away from the subterranean tunnels that were his usual milieu.</p><p>Now, grumbling, the Guild\u2019s resident computer genius nodded toward the busy office area beyond. \u201cGo over there; they\u2019ll do the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Elena went in with Evelyn, but when it became clear that Gwendolyn was capable and ready to shepherd her daughter through the process, she stepped out to talk to Vivek. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, V.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get that gun I sent with Sara?\u201d he asked, eyes touched with a trace of envy when they landed on her wings.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t begrudge him that. He was hunter-born, too, but had been paralyzed in an accident as a child, losing all feeling below the shoulders. His wheelchair, built for wireless capability, was a cutting-edge piece of technology from which he ruled his domain\u2014the Cellars.</p><p>She\u2019d always understood why he preferred to stay in the secret hideaway and information clearinghouse beneath the Guild\u2019s main building\u2014it had to be a sensory nightmare for him to be up in the world when he had no outlet for his hunting instincts. That he had managed not only to retain his sanity in the face of that pressure, but to become an invaluable part of the Guild, was a testament to his incredible will.</p><p>\u201cYou mean this gun?\u201d She retrieved it from an inner thigh holster, then put it back before she got told off for flashing a weapon.</p><p>Vivek smiled, and it turned his face striking. He was too thin, his bones too sharp against skin a shade darker than Venom\u2019s, but he was a handsome man. Yet he never made anything of it\u2014as long as she\u2019d known him, he\u2019d been asexual. Intentionally so, she thought. \u201cSo what do you want to do with my wings?\u201d</p><p>Lines on his forehead. \u201cI was going to ask you to come in for a scan so we could get a better idea of their internal structure, but . . . that might make you vulnerable.\u201d Moving his wheelchair with a minute shift of his head, he rolled away from the office and out to the porch that ran the length of the front of the building.</p><p>Following, she leaned against the railing. \u201cYeah.\u201d She folded her arms, thought about loyalties. \u201cHe holds my heart, V. I\u2019d never do anything to betray him.\u201d</p><p>Vivek stared at her for a long time. \u201cI always wondered who\u2019d break through that armor\u2014figures it\u2019d be a scary-ass archangel.\u201d Crooked smile creasing his face, he angled his head toward the office. \u201cSo ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Vivek knew more about her tangled relationship with her family than anyone else aside from Sara. Having been rejected by his own family after his accident, perhaps he understood even better.</p> <p>Now, he looked out over the paved drive and to the massive iron gates that guarded the entrance to Guild Academy. \u201cI was watching the surveillance monitor before you landed. Your father drove your sisters here. He\u2019s outside, sitting in his Mercedes.\u201d</p><p>Elena felt her shoulders lock, and it was an instinctive response, one she couldn\u2019t fight. She understood without being told that Gwendolyn was the reason Jeffrey had come. Somehow, the beautiful woman who had always seemed nothing but a decorative fixture had found the will to force her intractable husband into supporting her children.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not strong enough. Forgive me, my babies.\u201d</p><p>The memory of her own mother\u2019s voice, so taut with pain, so lost, tangled through her mind, making her hand fist. Unlike Gwendolyn, Marguerite hadn\u2019t been there to stand for her daughters against a Jeffrey who\u2019d slowly turned into a stranger. But then Gwendolyn hadn\u2019t been forced to listen to two of her daughters being tortured to death, hadn\u2019t had her arms and legs broken so she couldn\u2019t go to them, hadn\u2019t suffered such degradation that she\u2019d screamed for days afterward.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d</p><p>Blinking at Vivek\u2019s sharp tone, she straightened and glanced back toward the office. \u201cWill you watch over her, Vivek?\u201d Paralyzed or not, he had eyes everywhere. \u201cWhile she\u2019s here at the Academy, will you watch over her\u2014over them both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d His gaze was liquid-dark with pain when she met it again. \u201cDoes it ever go away? The hurt?\u201d</p><p>Her immediate answer was to say no, but she hesitated, thought about it. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally replied, gripping his shoulder with her hand. \u201cBut it can be . . . muted by the strength of other emotions.\u201d Like the blinding fury that tied a hunter to an archangel.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever afraid? That it\u2019ll all be taken way?\u201d Again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted, because he\u2019d had the courage to ask the question. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a helpless child anymore. If for some reason Raphael wants to leave me, I\u2019ll fight for him to my last breath.\u201d Because he was hers now.</p><p>Vivek\u2019s smile was small, solemn. \u201cI hope you make it, Ellie. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>Her phone rang in the silence that followed the quiet, heart-felt wish. Checking the display, she said, \u201cSara,\u201d to Vivek before answering. \u201cHey, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a request for assistance from the police.\u201d Sara\u2019s tone was crisp, what Ransom liked to call \u201cdirectorial.\u201d Only once had he used the word \u201cdictatorial\u201d\u2014and been assigned a hunt in the wilds of some boondock town where the locals took one look at his hair and leather jacket and termed him a \u201cfancy boy.\u201d</p><p>Lips twitching at the memory of how he\u2019d had to make a run for it after the hunt ended\u2014to avoid the local beauties and their shotgun-toting daddies\u2014she said, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you had a tough day yesterday, but you\u2019re the only one not on assignment today, so haul ass.\u201d</p><p>Elena was more than happy to get back into the rhythm of work, but\u2014\u201cAm I really the only one you\u2019ve got?\u201d Sara had access to a large network of hunters across the five boroughs.</p><p>\u201cI want to rest Ransom up after the spill he took,\u201d Sara replied, as Vivek whispered that he was off. \u201cSeveral others suffered similar injuries in the chaos yesterday. Ashwini\u2019s around, but she dragged herself down to the Cellars at five this morning, so she\u2019s out like a light.\u201d</p><p>Hunters slept in the Cellars for any number of reasons, but one of the biggest was that they needed a place to hide. \u201cDo I need to ask?\u201d She waved at Vivek as he headed down the ramp to his transport.</p><p>\u201cIt involves Janvier, a handwritten sign, and large quantities of honey. That\u2019s all I\u2019m permitted to say.\u201d</p><p>Snickering at the images that sprang into her mind at the mention of the Cajun vamp Ashwini seemed to spend half her life hunting, Elena said, \u201cSo, where do you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelancey Street, right under the Williamsburg Bridge. DB, might\u2019ve been vampire-bit multiple times, but cops say there\u2019s so much damage they can\u2019t really tell. Should be a simple assignment.\u201d</p><p>Her spine turned into a steel rod. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be coddled, Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me lip.\u201d Snapped-out words. \u201cYou\u2019re not back to full hunting strength, and if I\u2019d had anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t have sent you into Boston yesterday. Use the downtime you have to get back into shape, or I\u2019ll be putting you on penny-ante assignments involving idiots who think they can break their Contracts after a measly year or two.\u201d</p><p>Elena winced. \u201cMean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I earn the big bucks.\u201d</p><p>Glancing into the office area, Elena saw that Gwendolyn and the girls seemed to be finishing up. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be about twenty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops\u2019ll hold the scene.\u201d</p><p>The cops had not only held the scene, they\u2019d quarantined it behind so much yellow crime-scene tape it might as well have been a fence.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d The uniform closest to Elena shoved back his cap and stared as she landed on the lush green of the parklike area beneath the bridge. \u201cThey real?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cNah, costume-shop rejects.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, stared some more before a big-shouldered plainclothes detective came between him and Elena. \u201cWelcome back, Ms. Deveraux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to be back, Detective Santiago.\u201d Shooting the veteran cop a genuine smile, she nodded at the crime-scene tape. \u201cSlight overkill don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Santiago rubbed his jaw, solid as a boxer\u2019s and bristly with salt-and-pepper stubble that was even more apparent against skin the color of dry tobacco leaves. \u201cRookie.\u201d He lifted up a section that had enough leeway that she could duck under even with her wings. \u201cHe freaked\u2014first DB. It\u2019s not as bad as some I\u2019ve seen though.\u201d</p><p>Elena had to fight not to let the detective\u2019s words kick her into a past that refused to stay buried. She\u2019d freaked at her first dead body, too. The only difference was, she\u2019d been ten years old, and the body had been that of her sister Mirabelle. Long-legged Belle, who\u2019d played ball and danced with the same athletic grace. Belle, whose legs Slater had shattered into so many pieces that she\u2019d never have been able to do either again even if she\u2019d lived.</p><p>\u201cCould be a human psycho\u201d\u2014Santiago\u2019s deep voice jerked her back into the present\u2014\u201cbut after the things I\u2019ve seen in my career, I\u2019ve learned to check.\u201d</p><p>Walking carefully down the slight slope, Elena followed the scent of blood almost to the water\u2019s edge. She\u2019d half expected the victim to be wet or semisubmerged, but the teenage girl lay dry in the long grasses in a shadowy corner beneath the bridge. Dry except for the blood. It coated her from head to toe, leaving bare glimpses of skin of such a pale hue, it appeared made of tissue.</p> <p>Santiago, having navigated the slope with a little less grace, his black loafers slipping on the grass, blew out a breath. \u201cJust a kid.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried not to let the girl\u2019s youth matter, tried not to see her sisters Belle and Ariel in the victim\u2019s coltish form. It was hard. With her thick, dark hair and summer dress patterned with forget-me-nots, she looked like a pagan sacrifice lying there caressed by the waving strands of grass. Then the wind shifted, bringing with it the scent of death, and the illusion shattered. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to do your bloodhound thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Finding her footing in work, she took a deep breath. Frowned. \u201cUnusual number of vampiric scents in the area.\u201d The entire section was drenched in notes as diverse as cotton-wood and lime, to bitter black tea with sprinkles of sea salt, and sticky strands of taffy. Those weren\u2019t the only things she caught in the air. Oh. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say this was a make out spot.\u201d</p><p>Santiago raised his head. \u201cHey, Brent! You owe me ten bucks!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, shit.\u201d</p><p>Elena felt her lips quirk. Guilt threatened. How dare she smile while a girl lay dead at her feet? Elena fought that voice\u2014fact was, you had to distance yourself somehow at these scenes or they\u2019d eat away at you until there was nothing left. \u201cYou betting on me now?\u201d</p><p>Santiago winked. \u201cAnother rookie. Like taking candy from a baby.\u201d Putting his hands on his hips, he pushed back his jacket in that way men had of doing, and said, \u201cLot of the young vamps hang out here, along with their human partners. We keep an eye on things, but they\u2019re harmless for the most part\u2014like to party a bit and, yeah, make out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Elena realized she hadn\u2019t been around any vampires that young since she woke from the coma. \u201cWell, that\u2019s going to cause a problem unless the perpetrator\u2014if he was a vampire\u2014left enough of a trace behind on her that I can conclusively separate out his scent.\u201d</p><p>Pulling on the latex gloves she\u2019d grabbed from a kit at Guild Academy\u2014because while she might be immune to disease, she didn\u2019t much enjoy dipping her fingers in blood and other bodily fluids\u2014she hunkered down beside the body. Not a young girl who liked forget-me-nots and wore a pretty summer dress in spite of the nip in the air. Not someone with the long legs of a dancer. Just a body. \u201cCan I touch?\u201d she asked, fighting to maintain the emotional distance.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I cleared it with the crime-scene folks.\u201d</p> <p>The grass prickling the underside of her wings, she placed one hand beside the dead girl\u2019s head to brace herself, and bent down to sniff at her ravaged neck.</p><p>Iron. Old. Dry.</p><p>Soap.</p><p>Synthetic perfume.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Lush, lyrical, sensual, a scent so extraordinary it was beyond unique. \u201cBlack orchids,\u201d she whispered under her breath, but there was something ... She was sure she\u2019d caught hints of a subtle underlying note when the wind smashed into her and Raphael outside the house, but this scent was pure, so, so pure. However, given the erratic nature of her angel-sensing abilities, that wasn\u2019t conclusive of anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Santiago came down beside her. \u201cYou think it might\u2019ve been a pack of vamps?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing against the near-certain knowledge that this was much, much worse, Elena held up a finger, then\u2014going to her knees\u2014bent close enough to the body that she could examine some of the wounds that weren\u2019t crusted over with blood. \u201cNot bite marks,\u201d she said in surprise. \u201cSlices. Tiny, tiny slices.\u201d All over the victim\u2019s body. Done by someone holding a blade, but the real question was, what or who had driven that hand?</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Tortured.\u201d The big detective rose to his feet with a groan. \u201cGuild case or us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuild.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite the truth. \u201cNo human did this.\u201d Stripping off her gloves and holding them in one hand, she took the one Santiago held out to pull herself to her feet. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Biohazard bin\u2019s up there.\u201d He jerked his thumb over his shoulder.</p><p>Walking back with him, she got rid of the gloves, then used her cell phone to call Raphael. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>Raphael took one look at the body and went very, very still. \u201cIt has been called the death of a thousand cuts.\u201d</p><p>Even as Elena\u2019s rational mind considered the implications of that, her eye kept going to those pretty forget-me-nots, to the old-fashioned friendship bracelet on the girl\u2019s slender wrist. It seemed obscene to talk of ancient methods of torture while she lay so strangely innocent in the grass\u2014but that, of course, was a mirage. \u201cDidn\u2019t that involve dismemberment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when Caliane performed it.\u201d</p><p>A chill kiss on the back of her neck, that confirmation. \u201cI can\u2019t be certain about the origin of the scent,\u201d she said, having told him of the presence of black orchids. \u201cI\u2019ve only brushed up against your mother\u2019s scent a couple of times, and never in a situation where I had the opportunity to tease out the notes.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s response wasn\u2019t anything she might have expected. \u201cI was speaking with Michaela when you called me.\u201d</p><p>Elena fisted her hand at the mention of the female archangel. Beautiful in the most sensual of ways, Michaela had taken an instant dislike to Elena. The feeling was mutual. Except . . . it was no longer so easy to treat Michaela as the \u201cBitch Queen\u201d and nothing more, not now that Elena knew the archangel had once lost a child. Elena would never forget the heartbreak she\u2019d witnessed that terrible night at Michaela\u2019s gracious home in the Refuge. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear compassion in your voice, Elena.\u201d Raphael\u2019s eyes were dark with warning when they met hers. \u201cYou must never make the mistake of weakening when it comes to Michaela. She chose the path she walks, and it is a path that may well have led to the death of another archangel.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said that to her before, and despite the fact that her human heart wanted to see something better in Michaela, she knew he was right. \u201cI won\u2019t ever lower my guard around her, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Seemingly satisfied with her promise, he returned his attention to the body. \u201cAnother kill such as this was found in her territory last night.\u201d</p><p>And if there were two . . . \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer was caught in that case, raving with madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems to be the pattern.\u201d She looked up at the sound of the forensic investigators, waved them down. \u201cBody\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>As they came nearer, trying not to stare at Raphael while doing exactly that, the Archangel of New York moved a small distance from the body, choosing to stand right on the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pinpoint the scent of the killer here.\u201d Frustration churned through her as she followed him. \u201cThe area\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not signify,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cDmitri spoke to me earlier today of a vampire who, from the evidence, appears to have set himself alight last night then stood in place as he burned. That is not the act of a sane man.\u201d</p><p>Elena blew out a breath. \u201cYeah, good chance it was him. If Dmitri has a name, I can check his apartment, get the scent there, see if he was in this area at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdentification may take weeks, depending on whether anyone reports him missing\u2014the fire turned the body to ash.\u201d He flared out his wings and beyond them, the cops went motionless.</p><p>Elena could well understand their fascination. She\u2019d touched those wings, felt that powerful body hot and demanding above her own, and still her chest went tight.</p><p>\u201cI will speak to Jason,\u201d Raphael said, not noticing the reaction of the humans, \u201chave him check with his informants about other murders that may be connected.\u201d Wings spread to their breathtaking widest, he rose into the sky. Contact me the instant you sense any hint of her presence\u2014she would crush you, Elena, and think nothing of it.</p><p>I know. With that, she let him go. Some nightmares, she knew all too well, couldn\u2019t be cured in a day or even a year.</p><p>Given the viciousness of the girl\u2019s murder, the grisly suicide of her probable killer, and the other outbreaks of violence that had been her welcome to the city, Elena was almost surprised four days later to discover that they\u2019d passed in peace\u2014though it was a peace strung taut as a bow as everyone waited for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>Deciding not to look a gift horse in the mouth, she\u2019d spent a few hours one day placing several more plants in the solar, along with a selection of her other treasures\u2014the delicately carved mask from Indonesia went on the wall beside the door, the tiny glass candy ornaments from Murano in a crystal bowl atop the small writing desk, and the swathe of hand-embroidered silk from Kashmir she hung up on the other wall like a tapestry. Midnight blue shot with gold, it glowed in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cSetting up a nest, Guild Hunter?\u201d Raphael had asked only last night as he stood leaning against the doorjamb.</p><p>She\u2019d looked up from where she was arranging her favorite books in a gorgeous little bookshelf made of reclaimed lumber that Montgomery had found for her, caught by how very male Raphael was\u2014especially here, in a place she\u2019d turned exquisitely feminine. \u201cIt\u2019s what hunters do.\u201d She had a feeling that deep-rooted sense of home would be even more crucial in this new life. \u201cBut,\u201d she\u2019d added, \u201cyou\u2019ve already created the nest.\u201d This house, for all its size, was nothing like the cold elegance of the Tower. Here was warmth and beauty, a place where she could collapse in bed and snuggle into the blankets.</p><p>\u201cThen what is this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m marking out a piece of the house as my own territory.\u201d</p><p>A cool pause. \u201cI will not allow you to put distance between us, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen that one coming, was more than ready to handle it. \u201cI need a place where I can slam the door in your face when I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m pretty sure both of us would prefer that place be here and not elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will I be invited into this part of the nest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d The tease had gotten her a less than amused look. Smiling, she\u2019d reached for a small box about the size of a memo cube that she\u2019d kept to the side. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>As with the last time she\u2019d given him a present\u2014the ring that burned with amber fire\u2014he\u2019d appeared both surprised and delighted. \u201cWhat do you give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your suite at the Tower.\u201d Hoping he\u2019d understand, she\u2019d handed over the box.</p><p>He\u2019d opened it to remove a chunk of black rock glittering with what looked like deposits of gold. \u201cPyrite,\u201d he\u2019d murmured, identifying the mineral as it flashed fire in the sunlight. \u201cShokran, Elena.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stolen her heart all over again with the way he handled the gift with such care. \u201cThere\u2019s a second part,\u201d she\u2019d added. \u201cTonight, I\u2019ll tell you about the strange, haunted mine where I picked up that hunk of rock. There might be a former voodoo priest turned vampire involved.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s expression had shifted, the intimacy in those eyes stealing her breath. You give me a memory, Consort mine. I am honored. A bow of that dark head, the rock being placed carefully back into the box.</p><p>Of course then, she\u2019d had to go into his arms, this man who treated her memories as if they were precious jewels. She hadn\u2019t realized until much later, as she fell asleep covered by the heavy warmth of his wing, that Raphael had never challenged her right to claim partial ownership over a home he had to have lived in for centuries. It had made something in her settle, dig another root into this new life, this new existence.</p><p>But fussing with her solar was something she did in her spare time\u2014usually, when her muscles felt like jelly. Because most of the past four days she\u2019d spent either in the gym she\u2019d discovered in the sprawling basement under the house, up in the air with a number of angelic instructors, or out on the makeshift practice circle, sparring against Raphael and, occasionally, Dmitri.</p><p>Today, her opponent was neither her archangel nor his second.</p><p>\u201cLast time we fought, you ended up unconscious.\u201d Slitted green eyes watched her without blinking.</p><p>Elena bared her teeth. \u201cI also almost took your balls off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve grown back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure didn\u2019t seem keen to lose them at the time.\u201d Raising her short sword, she said, \u201cShall we play?\u201d</p><p>A small nod, Venom\u2019s upper body gleamed a warm, inviting brown in the sun, his legs covered by those flowing black pants most of the males seemed to prefer to work out in. \u201cSince you ask with such sweetness.\u201d</p><p>As they stabbed and darted out at each other, Venom attempting to go for her wings, while she tried to take him to the ground, she ensured her gaze never met his full on. She\u2019d learned her lesson the last time, when he\u2019d almost entranced her. That lesson had saved her life in Beijing, but she hadn\u2019t much liked the learning of it and had no intention of repeating the experience. Her short sword hit hard against the curved blade he used, and she felt the vibration all the way up her arm and in her teeth.</p><p>He brought up his second blade to block the knife she\u2019d been about to put to his abdomen. \u201cStalemate.\u201d A viper\u2019s eyes tried to catch her gaze as his muscles locked in place.</p><p>Elena wasn\u2019t stupid. Venom was somewhere around the three-hundred-year-old mark by her guess. That meant that physically, he had a massive advantage. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back.\u201d It was a gritted-out command as she broke the deadlock and danced out of reach.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d he said, circling those blades as if they weighed nothing, the sun glancing off them in a pattern that could quickly turn hypnotic. \u201cFace it, Ellie, you can\u2019t win if it comes down to brute strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Ellie.\u201d That was reserved for her friends.</p> <p>He hissed at her, spitting poison.</p><p>Elena dived and rolled, kicking his feet out from under him before he could shift position in one of those reptilian bursts of speed.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Illium\u2019s voice as he strode into the circle. She\u2019d been surprised to see him this morning, as the Hummingbird was meant to have arrived last night. However, according to Illium, his mother had been delayed by a storm and wouldn\u2019t be landing for a few hours. \u201cBoth of you, up.\u201d</p><p>Rising to a standing position, Elena watched as Venom flowed up, just itching to kick him flat again. \u201cYou could\u2019ve blinded me.\u201d</p><p>A liquid shrug. \u201cYou would\u2019ve recovered, but it would\u2019ve hurt like a bitch. And next time, you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>Elena closed her eyes and counted to ten. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, raising her lids.</p><p>Venom blinked, those slitted eyes contracting when he lifted his lashes back up. \u201cYou leave me at a loss for words.\u201d But not for actions it seemed, because he bent to give her the most elegant of bows before rising to blow her a kiss. \u201cAnother round?\u201d</p><p>Illium, his expression subdued as it had been for too many days, turned to her. \u201cMind if I have a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick his ass.\u201d</p><p>Stripping off his shirt and boots, Illium held out his hand for one of Venom\u2019s blades. Lips curving, Venom passed it over. \u201cSure you can handle me, pretty, pretty Bluebell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you about my snakeskin boots?\u201d A savage grin, and she knew Venom was about to bear the brunt of whatever haunted the blue-winged angel.</p><p>Venom swirled his blade in hand. \u201cI do think I need some new feathers for my pillow.\u201d</p><p>Illium shifted into a combat stance. \u201cCall the winner, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out to the side of the circle, where she\u2019d placed a bottle of water, she put down her weapons and took a seat on the grass. \u201cReady? Go!\u201d</p><p>Her heart was in her throat within ten seconds, the water forgotten. Because neither Venom nor Illium was holding back now, and they moved at the speed of death. The tip of a blade a bare millimeter from an eye, a foot about to snap a spine, an edge about to sever a head. It was like watching a fight in fast-forward, Illium\u2019s wings brilliant splashes of blue, his hair a wild sweep of black dipped in sapphires, Venom\u2019s skin shimmering golden brown as sweat glimmered and caught the light.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she kept her eyes glued on them, trying to catch moves, figure out vulnerabilities. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>They broke apart to glance at her, chests heaving\u2014two half-naked males covered in sweat and holding wicked-sharp blades by their sides. Illium was beautiful, Venom so other as to be strangely compelling. Together, she thought with one part of her mind, they created a damn nice view. Sara would call them eminently lickable.</p><p>\u201cVenom took it,\u201d she said.</p><p>That slight English accent of Illium\u2019s was very apparent as he said, \u201cHell he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had his teeth on your jugular.\u201d She knew enough to know that while Venom\u2019s poison wasn\u2019t lethal to angels, it would\u2019ve hurt like hell, breaking Illium\u2019s concentration.</p><p>Venom rocked back on the balls of his feet, a slow taunting smile on his face that had Illium threatening him with dismemberment. That only made the vampire\u2019s grin widen and then they were at it again, moving with a fluidity and grace that turned them into living pieces of art.</p><p>It was tempting to simply watch, but she began to note down moves and countermoves she thought she could utilize\u2014because one way or another, she was getting her name back on the Guild roster as a fully functioning hunter.</p><p>Raphael stood on the very edge of the Tower roof, looking out over Manhattan. The city bore few scars from the destruction caused during his battle with Uram. It had stood firm and proud against the quakes and the storm winds that hit a week ago, and now sparkled bright beneath the sun\u2019s rays.</p><p>\u201cShh, my darling, shh.\u201d</p><p>Images of the young girl\u2019s bloodied body surrounded by long, green grass intertwined with his mother\u2019s voice, but the memories didn\u2019t suck him under. Not today. This was his city. He had built it, and he would hold it, no matter if his mother thought to wrench it from him. \u201cBoston?\u201d he asked Dmitri. \u201cAny further problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the vampire answered from beside him. \u201cThe calm has held since the earthquake.\u201d</p><p>No calm, this, Raphael thought. It was more akin to the unnatural quiet that settled over an area before all hell broke loose. \u201cI\u2014\u201d He halted as his senses picked up something so unexpected as to seem impossible. \u201cDmitri, we\u2019ll have to continue this later.\u201d</p><p>Most others, even in his Seven, would have retreated, but Dmitri looked up to the sheet blue clarity of the sky. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLijuan.\u201d</p><p>The Archangel of China . . . and of Death.</p><p>21</p><p>Dmitri hissed out a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll put the Tower on alert.\u201d</p><p>Spreading his wings, Raphael rose into the air above this chaotic, beautiful city of steel and glass and humanity that had been the center from which he\u2019d claimed all the territory he now held. Lijuan was waiting for him in the high reaches, where the air was thin enough to kill a mortal\u2014backlit by the cutting intensity of the sun, she was as eerily inhuman as ever, with those strange pearlescent eyes and hair of purest white.</p><p>He came to a stop across from her, noting that she wore flesh today. \u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d After the destruction of Beijing and Lijuan\u2019s \u201cevolution,\u201d no one had seen her except in the pools of water she seemed to enjoy utilizing for contact.</p><p>\u201cOf course I would come to you,\u201d she murmured in that voice that screamed the truth of her descent. \u201cNone of the others are of any interest.\u201d</p><p>Elena, where are you?</p><p>On my way to Guild Academy to see Eve. Do you need me?</p><p>Stay away from the house until I say otherwise. I don\u2019t want you in Lijuan\u2019s line of sight.</p><p>A pause, but she didn\u2019t argue\u2014though he knew very well she didn\u2019t like him anywhere near the Archangel of China. Be careful, Archangel.</p><p>Having handled the conversation at the same time that he exchanged meaningless pleasantries with Lijuan, he angled his body toward the serene waters of the Hudson, light refracting off its surface in a thousand broken shards. \u201cCome, we will speak at my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo very civilized of you, Raphael.\u201d She laughed, the sound incongruously sweet for a woman who had made the dead rise, whose power was tinged with a putrid darkness. \u201cIs it any surprise I prefer you above the others?\u201d</p><p>Raphael said nothing, and neither did she, not until Montgomery closed the library doors behind himself after serving the tea. Lijuan had chosen one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace, and Raphael sat opposite, acting the host\u2014with Lijuan, the small courtesies must always be observed. If they were, she would follow her own peculiar code. There would be no bloodshed, not while she was a guest in his home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sipping her tea, Lijuan let out a sigh. \u201cThere is something to be said for the physical form.\u201d</p><p>When they had last met in Beijing, she\u2019d told him she no longer needed food for sustenance. \u201cHave your needs changed?\u201d</p><p>A soft smile that appeared innocent ... if you did not see the twisted shadows that lingered beneath. \u201cNot my needs. My wants.\u201d Another sip. \u201cSome things power alone cannot duplicate.\u201d Holding the teacup in an elegant hand, she met his gaze. \u201cHow do you stand it, Raphael?\u201d</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, he waited.</p> <p>\u201cThese mortals.\u201d She flicked a hand in the direction of Manhattan. \u201cAll around you, everywhere you go. Like ants.\u201d</p><p>Where Aodhan had asked a smiliar question with a deep, hungry curiosity in his tone, there was only contempt in the voice of the Archangel of China. \u201cI have always lived in the world, Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>A sigh. \u201cI forget. You have not yet seen the millennia I have. I, too, once lived among mortals.\u201d</p><p>He thought of the stories Jason had uncovered about Lijuan\u2019s past, the horrors the other archangel had perpetuated. \u201cYou were a goddess always.\u201d</p><p>A regal nod. \u201cWill you kill her?\u201d</p> <p>The question didn\u2019t throw him. He\u2019d known the reason for Lijuan\u2019s appearance the instant he saw her. \u201cIf my mother remains mad, she must be stopped.\u201d Given the reports he\u2019d received from Nazarach, Andreas, and Nimra this morning, telling of young vampires going murderously insane and killing in a way that bore Caliane\u2019s stamp, that madness seemed a more and more a certain truth.</p><p>\u201cWould it not be better to kill her where she Sleeps?\u201d Lijuan put down her teacup with a sigh of pleasure. \u201cShe is not yet at her full strength. Once awake, she may well be unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>The idea of Caliane raining pain and fire upon the world was a nightmare. But . . . \u201cThat is not our way.\u201d Angelkind had very few laws. The only one that mattered most of the time was the absolute prohibition against harming angelic children. Neha\u2019s daughter, Anoushka, had lost her life for breaking that law.</p><p>But there was a second, even more ancient law. To kill an angel in Sleep was considered an act of murder so heinous that the penalty was instantaneous and total death. Because even an archangel could die\u2014but only at the hand of another archangel. \u201cI will not be a coward and strike her while she is helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother is hardly helpless,\u201d Lijuan argued. \u201cYou see the effects of her power all around\u2014death drenches the landscape and even now, the molten core begins to boil with rage.\u201d</p><p>Raphael thought of the bloodrage that had gripped him as Caliane\u2019s power rippled around the world, of Astaad beating his concubine and\u2014according to Jason\u2019s most recent report\u2014Titus executing the innocent. \u201cYes.\u201d His mother had never been helpless.</p> <p>\u201cThen you agree. She must be killed before she wakes and terrorizes the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she must be woken.\u201d Perhaps there remained within him a piece of the child he\u2019d once been, but his decision was that of an archangel\u2014this law could not be defiled, no matter the target. For once done, it could not be taken back. The slope would turn ever more slippery, as all those who Slept became fair game. \u201cIf we can rouse her before she is ready, she will rise weak. It\u2019ll give us the advantage as we seek to learn whether or not she is sane.\u201d Whether or not she would have to die.</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s expression remained serene, but a ring of black appeared around her irises, a thick, oily color Raphael had never before glimpsed. Something in it whispered of the reborn, the corpses Lijuan had animated to mute, hungry life. \u201cShe escaped all those years ago,\u201d the Archangel of China pointed out, the black ring shifting with an almost living awareness, \u201cbecause the combined power of the Cadre wasn\u2019t enough to keep her contained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did not have you.\u201d Raphael deliberately played to Lijuan\u2019s vanity.</p><p>The other archangel\u2019s gaze turned distant. \u201cYes. Caliane did not evolve as I have.\u201d A small, satisfied smile. \u201cYou will walk me to the door, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your pet, Lijuan\u201d\u2014a soft reminder\u2014\u201cand never will be.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s hair flew back in that eerie breeze that seemed to affect only her. \u201cPets are so easily disposable, Raphael. I have something far more permanent in mind for you.\u201d A whisper of power licking around his face. \u201cYou could rule the world.\u201d</p><p>All he\u2019d have to do, he thought as he watched her take flight into the blue skies above his city, was give up his soul.</p> <p>Rain drenched the city again that night, coming down so hard and fast that Elena wrapped her arms around herself as she stood by the flames of the fireplace in Raphael\u2019s private study, staring out at the bleak landscape beyond. \u201cIllium\u2019s mother arrived safely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We dine with her tomorrow eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured she\u2019d want to rest tonight.\u201d She shivered as a particularly brutal burst of rain hit the windows, but wasn\u2019t sure it had anything to do with the rainstorm. Her skin had been creeping ever since Raphael told her of his meeting with Lijuan. \u201cCould you fly in this?\u201d</p><p>The archangel who stood looking at papers at a solid desk set in the center of the room, his wings sheened with amber light, nodded. \u201cYou could do it, too, but only for a short period. Your feathers are designed so as not to become waterlogged, but the pressure of the rain and wind would mean you\u2019d have to push harder with every wingbeat to keep yourself aloft.\u201d</p><p>Before, when she\u2019d watched angels taking flight from the high balconies that ringed the Tower, she\u2019d been filled with a quiet awe. Not the sickening and worshipful adoration that gripped the angelstruck, but a simple, deep appreciation for their otherworldly beauty and grace. \u201cI never considered the mechanics behind flight until I grew wings.\u201d Wings that gave her a freedom beyond anything so many people would ever know.</p><p>The Archangel of New York watched her as she walked to stand beside him in front of the desk, his eyes a crystalline blue licked with the yellow orange of the flames in the fireplace. \u201cWhat is on your mind, Elena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes vampirism cure paralysis?\u201d Blinded by the entitled idiots she hunted on the job, she\u2019d never been able to figure out why anyone would want to sign up for a hundred years of slavery just to live longer. But Venom\u2019s flip remark about his balls growing back had gotten the wheels turning enough that she\u2019d done a bit of research at the Academy library. \u201cI know the process heals a lot of other illnesses, but what about spinal damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not an instantaneous process,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cDepending on the severity of the injury, it can take up to five years for the vampirism to advance far enough in the cells to repair the damage. Not many angels are willing to wait that long.\u201d</p><p>Elena bit her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get his blood.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known he wouldn\u2019t say no, but still ... her heart clenched. \u201cI\u2019ll have to steal it. I won\u2019t give him the option unless he qualifies as a Candidate.\u201d Vivek had been hurt quite enough. \u201cGive me a while to figure out how to do it.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hair caught the firelight as he nodded. \u201cI heard you talking to Sam earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a chatterbox.\u201d The kid had a way of getting to her. \u201cHe said Jessamy made him write an extra essay because he did something naughty, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was.\u201d It had delighted her to hear him sounding so very much like himself. His memories of the trauma he\u2019d suffered, she\u2019d been told, would resurface slowly, giving him time to adapt.</p><p>\u201cHave his parents begun speaking to him of it yet?\u201d Raphael asked, following the train of her thoughts with piercing accuracy.</p><p>She leaned into the muscular warmth of his body. \u201cHe asks me the odd question at times, but mostly he\u2019s interested in how everyone in the Refuge was looking for him. He thinks that\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever of his mother and father,\u201d Raphael murmured, his wings heavy against her own as he spread them out. \u201cEven when the memories do rise, that search, the fact that he is so loved, is what will remain at the forefront, not the pain and terror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At that moment, her eye caught on the papers on his desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d She picked up what appeared to be some kind of an expensive invitation, the paper heavy, embossed with an E and an H intertwined.</p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Conscious of him watching with an enigmatic expression on his face, she lifted the flap and removed a card\u2014to read words written in the most delicate calligraphy, the rich silver-black ink flowing faultlessly across the page.</p><p>We invite you and your consort to our home, Raphael. It will be a delight to have a meal with another couple who understand that love is not a weakness. Do come.</p><p>It was signed with a graceful signature, the H in the name curlicued with great care until it was a work of art. Elena smiled in delight when she found herself tracing the sinuous from of a mythical serpent. \u201cHannah,\u201d she murmured, bringing the page closer to her eye so she could see the fine detail hidden within the single letter. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah is an artist.\u201d And the consort of the Archangel Elijah.</p><p>Elena looked up at him, her eyes shimmering dawn in this light. \u201cAre there any other long-term couples in the Cadre I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEris is Neha\u2019s husband, but not consort.\u201d Raphael had not seen him for three hundred years, and even before that, Eris had never been anything but Neha\u2019s creature.</p><p>Elena placed the invitation back in the envelope and set it down. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah is the one archangel,\u201d he said, sliding the papers on his desk aside and putting his hands on her waist to lift her onto the solid surface, \u201cwho I might one day trust.\u201d Making a space for himself between her thighs, he placed his hands on either side of her hips on the desk. \u201cBut I will not take you into the heart of his territory. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>His hunter\u2019s expression shifted, became contemplative. \u201cNo,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019d make you too vulnerable. But I assume Hannah is powerful enough by now that Elijah doesn\u2019t mind bringing her into your territory?\u201d</p><p>Raphael closed one hand over the sleek muscle of her thigh. \u201cI have never asked.\u201d As the only archangelic consort before Elena, Hannah had always been considered off-limits, protected. It was a courtesy that hadn\u2019t been extended to Elena, not just because she\u2019d once been mortal\u2014but because she was hunter-born . . . warrior-born.</p><p>Elena wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cSend the invitation. I want to talk to her\u2014there\u2019s so much I could learn from her.\u201d</p><p>Settling his free hand on her rib cage, just below the curve of her breast, he spoke against her parted lips. \u201cI cannot ask, Elena. The invitation was sent by Elijah\u2019s consort, and must be responded to by mine. It is protocol.\u201d</p><p>Elena scowled, brows pulling together. \u201cHow can it be protocol when there are only two consorts around?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you call me a liar?\u201d He\u2019d never enjoyed teasing anyone before he met his hunter.</p><p>Stroking her fingers through the hair at his nape, she used her teeth on his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do all that fancy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my consort.\u201d A kiss placed on her cheekbone. \u201cYou may do things any way you wish.\u201d</p><p>Gray eyes rimmed with a very, very thin circle of purest silver met his as her fingers pressed on the back of his head. \u201cYeah? In that case, I think I\u2019d like to distract you.\u201d</p> <p>He allowed her to bring them closer, angling his head so he could take that stubborn mouth, those soft lips. She tasted of wildness barely contained, a brilliant, blinding mortal fire. Ready for the blaze, he was startled to feel her hands move to cup his face, her hold tender in a way that leveled his defenses as she whispered, \u201cLet me love you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Enchained, he made no protest when she slid off the desk, switched off the lights, and turned to tug him to the warm glow of the fireplace. As he watched, she undid the straps that held her black top snug to her body and dropped it to the rug\u2014to reveal lush breasts he\u2019d marked with his kiss more than once. Tonight, it was the fire that marked her, flickering over her skin and burnishing her in red gold, creating sultry shadows he wanted to explore with his mouth, his body.</p><p>She sighed in pleasure when he slid his hand over the curve of her waist, but her fingers were on the buttons of his shirt. He shrugged it to the floor the instant it was open, wanting her hands on him. She gave him exactly that. Palms flat on his chest, she stroked over his pectorals, his rib cage, his abdomen. \u201cI could do this,\u201d she mumured, exploring the ridges and dips of his body with a slow intensity that made his cock throb, \u201cfor hours.\u201d</p><p>Palming the erotic weight of her breasts, he bent to press a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your consort does not have such patience.\u201d He used his thumbs to tease her nipples as she twined her fingers through his hair, as she tugged him up, as she seduced his mouth with her own.</p><p>When she drew back to kiss her way down his neck to his chest and lower, he permitted it. The night was yet young and he\u2019d discovered he had a weakness for being loved by Elena. What wicked things are you planning to do tonight, Guild Hunter?</p> <p>Kneeling in front of him, her wings spread behind her in an extraordinary display\u2014gleaming midnight shading to indigo, to a deep, haunting blue before whispering into dawn and a shimmering white gold kissed by the firelight\u2014she tilted up her head to give him a provocative smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d Reaching up, she undid the fastenings on his pants, brushing the rigid push of his cock with her fingertips as she did so. He had no compunction in helping her strip off the remainder of his clothing, in standing naked and aroused before her.</p><p>So proud, Elena thought, so beautiful. Fisting him with her hand, she stroked once, tight and smooth. His hand clenched in her hair, and when she looked up, she saw he\u2019d thrown back his head, the cords of his neck standing out so strong and taut that she wanted to rise up, bite down on them. Then there were his wings, magnificent in their power.</p><p>He was pure addiction. And he was hers. To take. To pleasure.</p><p>Placing the palm of her free hand flat on the thick muscle of his thigh, she leaned in to lick at the head of his cock.</p><p>Elena. A warning not to tease.</p><p>Another night, she might have done just that, but tonight, she wanted to love him hot and sweet. Sliding her grip to the base of his arousal, she closed her mouth over the head. His shout was gritted out, those muscular thighs unyielding as rock as his hand pulled at her hair. And the taste of him ... Moaning around the rigid length covered by velvet-soft skin, she took an inch more. Sucked wet and deep.</p> <p>A harder tug on her hair. Now, Elena.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had her fill, nowhere near close, but there were other ways to satiate her hunger. Releasing him after laving her tongue over the thick vein that ran along his arousal, she rose up and nudged him backward until his knees hit the back of one of the chairs not far from the fire. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>A raised eyebrow, pure masculine arrogance.</p><p>Lips curving even as things low in her body pulsed with the darkest of sexual cravings, she stepped back to pull off her jeans and panties. This time, when she pushed at the muscled silk of his chest, he went down into a sitting position, his hands sliding over her rib cage to settle on her hips. Instead of tugging her forward as she\u2019d expected, he leaned down to press a kiss to the dip of her navel. Hunter mine.</p><p>Heart aching under the rush of emotion, she weaved her fingers through his hair. \u201cI love you, Archangel.\u201d Her body trembled at the intimacy of his breath against her skin, the rough caress of his jaw. When he lifted his head, she didn\u2019t wait, couldn\u2019t wait. Shifting to straddle him, she fitted him to the ultrasensitive entrance to her body, sliding down that hard heat oh-so-slowly, his hands possessive brands on her hips.</p><p>A shudder rippled through her as she succeeded in sheathing him. Holding him within her, caressing him with intimate muscles until he whispered promises of retribution, she put her own hands on his shoulders, squeezed. \u201cBrace me, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>Would you ride tonight, hbeebti? Strong hands moving down over her thighs to grip her just below the knees as he sucked on her lower lip before inciting a languorous tangling of their mouths.</p><p>Oh, yes. Then, as the storm continued to rage outside, she took her archangel, slow and deep, and again, until the crashing wildness of pleasure swept them both under.</p> <p>22</p><p>The next day, having received a message early that morning, Elena found herself flying down to land in front of a gated home in the Palisades area. Set back from the street and shaded with perfectly manicured greenery, it shrieked of money. Even the architecture\u2014old, elegant, timeless\u2014told her she was looking at something that had cost in the millions.</p><p>I could afford this.</p><p>It was a startling thought. She kept forgetting that she was rich now, that the Cadre\u2014through Raphael\u2014had paid her the fee they\u2019d agreed on when she had \u201caccepted\u201d the Uram mission. Snorting at the memory of exactly how she\u2019d been dragged into the whole bloody mess, she folded back her wings and stared at the glossy black door of the home only a few feet away.</p><p>Narrow. Too narrow for angelic wings.</p><p>It was stupid to feel rejected. Her sister Beth had lived here with her husband, Harrison, since the day they had married\u2014both had been human at the time. Then Harrison had applied to be Made a vampire, been accepted . . . and broken the century-long contract of service he\u2019d signed on for as a condition of being Made. Elena was the hunter who\u2019d brought him back to face his punishment. Harrison didn\u2019t understand that he couldn\u2019t hide for eternity, that the longer it took for his angel to track him down, the worse the price he\u2019d have had to pay.</p><p>As a result of Harrison\u2019s antipathy, Elena had never been invited inside Beth\u2019s home. She didn\u2019t begrudge her sister for standing by her husband, had done her best to make sure Beth knew that. However, by the same token, she refused to disappear from Beth\u2019s life. No matter what, her sister knew she could pick up the phone and Elena would come.</p><p>The door flew open at that instant, revealing a gorgeous strawberry blonde dressed in what appeared to be a cashmere sweater in cream paired with a polka-dotted knee-length skirt, the shape full and feminine. \u201cEllie!\u201d Her sister ran. \u201cEllie!\u201d</p><p>As she caught Beth\u2019s smaller, softer body, Elena felt time unravel, scrolling backward until they were children again. Beth had always been the baby, and she\u2019d toddled around after Elena as Elena had in her turn toddled around after Ari and Belle. Now, of the four children Marguerite had borne, only two remained\u2014and Elena had become the big sister. \u201cHey, Bethie.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s arms remained locked around Elena, her face damp against Elena\u2019s neck. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come see me first. You\u2019re supposed to come see me first!\u201d</p><p>Another bittersweet reminder of childhood, Beth\u2019s insistence that she come first in Elena\u2019s life. \u201cI thought you just got back today? Weren\u2019t you in the Caymans?\u201d</p><p>A sniffle. \u201cYou have wings. You could\u2019ve flown to me.\u201d Pulling away at last, Beth reached out and touched the upper curve of Elena\u2019s wing.</p><p>It was a sensitive spot, a place she allowed Raphael alone to caress. \u201cLower, Beth,\u201d she said with conscious gentleness.</p><p>Beth shifted her hold at once\u2014forever the younger sister, used to taking orders. \u201cThey\u2019re so pretty, Ellie.\u201d Sweet words, shining eyes of a translucent turquoise that had come from Marguerite, a single moment uncolored by the choices they\u2019d both made. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have wings. You always wanted to fly.\u201d</p><p>A flash of memory, Elena in her homemade cape, \u201cflying\u201d after a giggling Beth. It was impossible not to smile. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>A shrug, her hand falling away. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Worried by the muted response from a sister who\u2019d always been vibrant, if not a little high-strung, Elena brushed Beth\u2019s hair away from her face. \u201cYou know you can talk to me. Have I ever let you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned my husband in to his angel.\u201d Open petulance.</p><p>\u201cBeth.\u201d Harry had chosen his fate when he asked to be Made\u2014and unlike Vivek, he\u2019d been healthy as a human, could well have lived the full span of a mortal life. If the servitude he\u2019d signed on for now grated, he had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>Beth\u2019s sullen expression broke, her face seeming to collapse in on itself as she began to cry in great, gulping sobs. Shattered by her sister\u2019s pain, Elena took Beth into her arms and rocked her. \u201cTalk to me, Bethie. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d So I can fix it.</p><p>It was what she did, a self-imposed duty.</p><p>Even after Jeffrey had thrown her out of the Big House, Elena had checked in every week with Beth, made sure her sister was okay. Beth, too, had stuck by Elena in her own way. When Jeffrey had dumped Elena\u2019s things out on the street, it had been sweet, compliant Beth who\u2019d gone out and saved Elena\u2019s most important treasures from the elements. She\u2019d done it in secret, but she had done it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as strong as you, Ellie.\u201d Whispered words as they stood hidden in the shadow of the Big House. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart.\u201d Taking her sister into her arms, holding her tight. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m strong enough for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Now, Elena pressed her lips to her sister\u2019s temple. \u201cBeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ellie.\u201d Beth pulled away with a hiccup. Using a handkerchief to dab at her face, she managed to look beautiful even with eyes rimmed in red and a nose that had gone raw at the tip. \u201cThey won\u2019t Make me, Ellie. That was always the plan, that Harry and I, we\u2019d both become immortal and then we\u2019d be together forever, but they said they won\u2019t Make me.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s blood ran cold. She\u2019d asked Raphael about Beth, been told that her sister wasn\u2019t biologically compatible. If they tried to infuse her with the toxin that turned human to vampire, she\u2019d either die or go incurably insane. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel now, Ellie.\u201d Beth gripped her upper arms, hope a shining beacon in her eyes. \u201cYou can Make me. Or you can ask your archangel to. Please, Ellie. Please.\u201d</p><p>Feeling bruised and battered after the argument that had resulted when she told Beth there was nothing she could do, Elena was in no frame of mind to undertake the next task on her list. But\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve been a coward long enough.\u201d She put the key into the heavy yellow lock and twisted. The first time she\u2019d seen that key, she\u2019d assumed Jeffrey had hired a small locker to store the pieces of her childhood . . . of her mother\u2014but this was the size of an entire room, complete with a metal rolling door.</p><p>Sara, leaning against the neighboring storage unit, arms crossed over the rich plum of her trim suit, shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being a coward, Ellie. You know that. This has to hurt like hell.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it hurt. So bad.</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, my babies.\u201d</p><p>Anger and sadness and love mixed in a caustic brew inside of her. It was a familiar feeling\u2014her emotions toward Marguerite would never be simple. \u201cThanks for coming with me. I know how busy you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank me again, and I\u2019ll have to kick your ass.\u201d Sara reached down to fix the thin strap that arched over the top of her three-inch heels. \u201cThough I\u2019m surprised tall, omnipotent, and dangerous isn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed you.\u201d The woman who\u2019d become more family to her than the people with whom she shared blood. \u201cRaphael understands friendship, even if he doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d He\u2019d forged bonds of steel with his Seven, Dmitri in particular.</p><p>Lock undone, she held it in one hand as she reached down to push up the door. Light hit the floor within, and then the box nearest the door.</p> <p>A frayed orange blanket hung over the edge.</p><p>Heart in her throat, she tried to continue pushing up the door, but she couldn\u2019t. Her entire body just froze. \u201cSara.\u201d</p><p>Her best friend put her hand on the door. \u201cWhich way, Ellie? Up or down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, b\u00e9b\u00e9.\u201d Laughing words in that husky voice with its pretty accent. \u201cClimb on board.\u201d</p><p>Struggling onto the big bed, her blanket around her shoulders, she squirmed between Ari and her mom.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Ari\u2019s protesting voice before she peppered Elena\u2019s giggling face with kisses. \u201cLittle grease monkey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllie.\u201d</p><p>Jerking herself back into the present, Elena pushed down the door, relocking it with fingers that trembled. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d Her heart was thunder in her throat, her palms damp. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t.\u201d She collapsed onto the ground, back to the door.</p><p>Sara sank down beside her, uncaring of the damage to her hose. \u201cIt\u2019s waited all this time. It\u2019ll wait a while longer.\u201d Putting her hand on Elena\u2019s arm, she squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a hell of a lot to process over the past year and a half. Nothing says you have to rush this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s affecting me like this. There are good memories in there.\u201d Except sometimes, she suddenly realized, even the best memories could cut like knives. \u201cSara,\u201d she said, the words tumbling out, \u201cI need to tell you something about my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>At that simple statement of support, Elena took a deep breath ... and finally told her best friend about the monster who had broken Ari and Belle until they were macabre dolls in a blood-soaked kitchen; until her mother was a woman who screamed and screamed and screamed; until her father was a stranger who hated his eldest surviving daughter. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you before,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even bring myself to think about it.\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked Sara\u2019s face. \u201cThis is why you used to wake up screaming.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been roommates at Guild Academy, and after they graduated. \u201cYes.\u201d Some part of her hadn\u2019t stopped screaming since that murderous day almost two decades in the past.</p> <p>In spite of Sara\u2019s rock-solid friendship, in spite of the physical release of the intense flying drills she did later that day, Elena couldn\u2019t shake the melancholy that draped her in emotional black. As she stood in the shower prior to getting dressed for dinner, the events of the day came crashing down on her, an unforgiving rain. Even worse than her effective breakdown at the storage unit was the memory of the look of betrayal on Beth\u2019s face as her sister turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die, Ellie. I\u2019ll die and you\u2019ll still be alive.\u201d</p><p>She tried to wash away the pain that twisted through her heart, but it refused to leave. When her eyes smarted, she told herself she\u2019d gotten some shampoo into them and turned her face into the spray. She couldn\u2019t so easily ignore the knowledge that as the years passed, she\u2019d have to watch wrinkles mark a face that had always been younger, and one day, she\u2019d stand over Beth\u2019s grave.</p><p>Unable to bear the thought, she wrenched off the water and stepped out . . . into the arms of an archangel. \u201cI\u2019m wet.\u201d The words were snapped out.</p><p>He tugged her water-slick body even closer to his. I feel the echo of your pain, Elena.</p><p>Distressed as she was, she knew he could\u2019ve taken the reason for that pain from her mind without her being aware of it, was likely battling the compulsion to do exactly that. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, the hurt too raw to share. \u201cNothing new.\u201d</p><p>A wave of rain and wind inside her mind, the fury of a leashed storm. Your father again?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That was all she could say without breaking into a thousand splintered pieces. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it yet, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>A pause, heavy with power.</p><p>It was an unintended reminder that the man she called her lover, her consort, was nothing even close to human. Still, she didn\u2019t move away, didn\u2019t raise her guard. That, too, was hard ... but Raphael had held her when she fell, prepared to give up his immortal life for her, a hunter, an unwanted daughter . . . and right now, a hated sister.</p><p>The stroke of a big, warm hand on her lower back. \u201cThen we will talk at another time. But we will be talking.\u201d</p><p>Feeling her instincts shake off the pain that had gutted her, she raised her head. \u201cI thought we discussed the whole you-giving-me-orders thing?\u201d</p><p>Endless, relentless blue. \u201cDid we?\u201d Plush softness around her as he wrapped her in a towel, wings and all. \u201cI had a visitor today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d And he looked so very un-apologetic doing it that she knew she was about to let herself get suckered.</p><p>A slow smile. \u201cLijuan.\u201d</p><p>Steel-edged worry wiped away every other emotion. \u201cAgain?\u201d Ice crawled up her spine at the memory of the devotion and pain she\u2019d seen on the face of one of the reborn who had loved his mistress, thought, too, of how he\u2019d torn a man apart with his bare hands, until the viscera steamed in the open air.</p><p>\u201cI knew she remained in my territory,\u201d Raphael said, \u201cbut it was still an unexpected visit.\u201d</p><p>Letting him rub at her hair with a second towel while she gripped the first between her breasts, she touched her fingers to the warmth of his chest. \u201cSo? What did she want this time?\u201d</p><p>Raphael dropped the other towel to the floor and ran his fingers through the damp strands of her hair, his gaze turning a deep, impenetrable cobalt. \u201cThe same\u2014to convince me to murder my mother.\u201d</p><p>Still blinking in shock half an hour later as she finished drying her hair and turned to pick up the dress that had appeared on the bed, she stared at Raphael. \u201cWe have to find your mother before she does, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wearing nothing but black dress pants, he leaned against the wall, arms folded, his eyes taking a leisurely tour of her body. \u201cYou do not ask the obvious question, Elena. You did not ask after Lijuan\u2019s previous visit, either.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d shrugged off her robe in preparation for putting on the dress\u2014in a brilliant shade of blue, of course\u2014and was wearing only a pair of gossamer panties in mint green, a small white silk flower sitting below one hip. It was clear what her archangel thought of her current state of undress. \u201cI think,\u201d she murmured, \u201cyou need to turn up the air-conditioning.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile laced with pure seduction. \u201cCome here, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she picked up the dress and stepped into it. Unlike the gown she\u2019d worn for Lijuan\u2019s ball, this one wasn\u2019t ankle-length but came to a few inches above the knee, the material fitting snugly over her hips before flaring out in a playful skirt. The pretty halter neck not only provided adequate support for her breasts\u2014always a consideration for a hunter\u2014but closed with a glittering crystal button.</p><p>She\u2019d never, in a million years, have chosen the dress for herself, but had to admit it looked both elegant and sexy. \u201cWhat obvious question?\u201d she asked after slipping the button into its hole.</p><p>\u201cWhether it would not be better to join with Lijuan to find Caliane, execute her in her Sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother, Raphael. Of course you can\u2019t destroy her without knowing if she has healed, become sane.\u201d Turning to the vanity, she raised her hair off her neck and twisted it up into a sleek knot Sara had taught her. \u201cYour laws exist for a reason\u2014other angels must\u2019ve come out of the Sleep in better condition than when they went in.\u201d</p><p>Looking down to grab a hairpin, she wasn\u2019t ready for the burn of an archangel\u2019s kiss on her nape, the heavy weight of his hands on her hips. \u201cMost of me is convinced she\u2019ll rise as viciously insane as when she went to ground. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is your mother.\u201d Elena, more than anyone, understood the opposing emotions that had to be tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Teeth scraped over her skin, making her shiver. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>Stroking up with his hands, he cupped her breasts. Squeezed. Another kiss on that sensitive spot along the curve of her neck before he drew back. \u201cYou are right to remind me, Elena. I owe the Hummingbird my respect.\u201d</p><p>Hair done, she put on some lipstick, then turned to watch Raphael as he picked up his shirt. A pure white, the fabric on either side of the wing slots embroidered with curling designs in black that echoed the pattern of his wings, it threw the harsh purity of his masculine beauty into cutting focus.</p><p>\u201cI know the Hummingbird was the one who eventually found you,\u201d she said, heart twisting at the thought of him lying hurt and broken on that desolate field where his mother had left him. \u201cBut the ties between you ... there\u2019s more to it, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>The evening sunlight turned his wings to amber as he answered. \u201cShe didn\u2019t only save me, she mothered me as much as I would allow.\u201d</p><p>Elena walked over to finish buttoning his shirt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t allow her much did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The earth trembled at that instant, just enough to make her close her hand over his shoulder to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cA minor quake,\u201d Raphael said when it passed. \u201cReports indicate weather is calming across the world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fell into the wild blue of his eyes when he lifted his head from his unhidden visual exploration of her skin, her body. \u201cIs that good news or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means she is almost awake.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>Elena took one look at the Hummingbird as the angel stepped into the living room on Illium\u2019s arm and stopped breathing.</p> <p>Michaela was beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful woman who had ever lived, but this woman was . . . radiant. It was the only word Elena could come up with to describe her. Eyes of sparkling champagne, hair of purest black tipped with gold, skin stroked by the sun . . . and wings of a wild, unexpected indigo, each feather bearing streaks of shimmering gold so pale as to be sunlight.</p><p>When she smiled, her lashes came down for a second and Elena saw that they were black tipped with gold. \u201cHello,\u201d the angel said. \u201cThey call me the Hummingbird, but you may call me Sharine.\u201d</p><p>Elena took the hands Sharine held out, unable to refuse. They were small, delicate, in perfect proportion to the Hummingbird\u2019s bare five feet of height. \u201cI\u2019m Elena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know.\u201d A laugh that was pure diamond sparkles glittering in the air. \u201cMy baby\u2019s told me all about you.\u201d</p><p>Looking up at Illium, she expected to see a playful scowl, but the blue-winged angel watched his mother with a mute sadness that made Elena\u2019s own laughter fade. \u201cYour baby,\u201d she said at last, \u201cis very beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I have to have a care\u2014the girls will be after him once he grows up a little more.\u201d Her gaze shifted to behind Elena. \u201cRaphael.\u201d Smiling with such love that it made Elena\u2019s heart hurt, the Hummingbird walked into Raphael\u2019s arms. \u201cHow\u2019s my other boy? Never my baby, not you. But still my son.\u201d</p><p>Elena watched in fascination as Raphael dipped his head and let Sharine straighten first his hair, then his shirt. She\u2019d never seen him bow his head before any other being, male or female, but he treated the Hummingbird with the greatest respect ... and care. Such care that it spoke of handling something broken.</p><p>When Elena glanced at Illium again, she couldn\u2019t stand what she saw on that face that was a dream of beauty. Closing the distance between them, she curled her hand around one muscled arm\u2014as in the Refuge, his upper body was bare. Except tonight, his chest bore a painting of a huge bird in flight. \u201cThat\u2019s stunning.\u201d It didn\u2019t take more than a cursory study to realize the bird was a stylized version of Illium.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, his voice more solemn than she\u2019d ever heard it, \u201cis the one who taught Aodhan to draw, to sculpt. To act as her canvas is considered a great honor among angelkind.\u201d</p><p>As Elena watched, Sharine put her hand on Raphael\u2019s chest, smoothing out a nonexistent wrinkle. \u201cWe have not met for many days,\u201d she said. \u201cFive or six at least.\u201d</p><p>Elena frowned. She knew Raphael hadn\u2019t had physical contact with the Hummingbird for over a year, and yet Sharine\u2019s words held nothing of humor, nothing that said she was gently chiding him for the time that had passed. Suddenly her earlier words, calling Illium her \u201cbaby,\u201d cast a far more somber shadow.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Raphael said with a slow smile. \u201cI knew you would come see me before the seventh.\u201d</p><p>Sharine laughed then, and it felt like warm raindrops against Elena\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Illium\u2019s muscles tightened under her hold. \u201cEllie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d She leaned into him, allowing her wing to brush over his. \u201cShe loves you, loves Raphael. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Smiling at his mother when the Hummingbird turned and held out a hand, he went to help her get seated.</p><p>The dinner was magical. Elena had heard Raphael use his voice in that way\u2014until it felt like a tactile caress, but Sharine had honed it into an art form. Listening to her was like being surrounded by a thousand streamers of sensation, all of them sparkling with brilliance.</p><p>And the stories she told\u2014of Raphael\u2019s and Illium\u2019s youth, such wonderful stories of bravery and folly, all told with a mother\u2019s pride in her sons. Sharine had not borne Raphael, Elena thought as she stood on their private balcony later that night, watching the Hummingbird take flight with Illium by her side, but she had cared for him just the same. \u201cShe reminds me of some gorgeous hothouse flower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne that\u2019s been crumpled,\u201d Raphael said, his hands on her shoulders as he pulled her back against his chest, one arm sliding around to hold her pressed to him. \u201cFor the rest, you must ask Illium.\u201d</p><p>Placing her hand over his forearm, she shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not when I see how much it hurts him.\u201d She\u2019d believed she knew the greatest tragedy of the blue-winged angel\u2019s life. He\u2019d loved a mortal, lost her to angelic law and her human life span. But the pain she\u2019d seen tonight, it was older, deeper ... raw and aged and angry. \u201cHow long is she staying in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will leave within the hour\u2014she finds it difficult to linger far from home.\u201d</p><p>As they stood there in silence, there was a spark of fire in the sky. Then another, and another.</p><p>The stars were falling.</p><p>There was no magic the next day. Even the spring sunshine promised by a stunning dawn was subsumed by bone-chilling horror as the calm broke in the most decisive of ways.</p><p>Flying down, then up toward the bottom of Manhattan Bridge, Elena hooked her fingers in the massive metal structure and stared at the five bodies that hung from its belly. They\u2019d been spotted at daybreak by one of the craft that used this section of the East River\u2014the witness was apparently still puking his guts out.</p><p>Elena swallowed her own gorge as the bodies swung from the ropes.</p><p>Swinging so gently. One foot bare, one clad in a shiny highheeled shoe.</p><p>\u201cNo shadows,\u201d she said, fighting the nightmare. \u201cThere are no shadows.\u201d It was too early in the day, and for that mercy, she could only be grateful. \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d Her fingers refused to release their grip.</p><p>Another river-borne wind. The bodies swayed.</p><p>Her stomach bucked, bile burning the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, you see anything useful?\u201d Santiago\u2019s distinctive voice came from the wireless device tucked over her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, forcing the word out through gritted teeth. \u201cLet me get closer.\u201d And do my job. She would not let the past steal her future from her.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she let go of the bridge finger by finger, then dropped low enough that she could spiral over the water before beating her way to a closer position. As she rose up over the choppy waves, she kept her eyes resolutely on the spot underneath the bridge where she intended to hook her arms in an effort to brace herself. \u201cThis would be easier if I was human,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She jerked, having forgotten Santiago could hear everything. \u201cHarness would be useful,\u201d she said. \u201cImpossible to get wings into one though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get a special set made for you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing in his tone said he was joking.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d For accepting her wings in as straightforward a fashion as he\u2019d accept a new coat.</p><p>There.</p><p>Grabbing the metal in a secure grip, she held on with one arm as she hooked her leg over the beam. Only when she was in a stable position did she look down at the rope, thick and brown, where it had been tied to the beam. Her eyes skimmed forward\u2014each of the five bodies hung from the bridge the same way, the ropes the same length.</p><p>\u201cSomeone took their time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the broken necks alone that had killed them\u2014most vampires over a decade old could survive that unless the break was close to decapitation, and hunter instincts whispered that these men were all over fifty, though not by too much. No, it was the fact that it looked like their hearts had been removed, too, their shirts plastered to their fronts by stains that could\u2019ve come from only one thing. At this age, the dual shock would\u2019ve been enough even without total separation of the head from the body.</p><p>\u201cHad to be fucking what\u2019s-his-name? The guy in the red and blue suit with the spider thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a movie buff, Santiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. I watch football and hockey as I should.\u201d</p><p>Even as she responded to his dry humor, Elena thought of the vampires she\u2019d seen skittering over walls with the strength and speed of arachnids, and knew the answer had to be both more prosaic than a comic-book superhero\u2014and possibly more terrifying, if the hint of scent Elena could taste in the air was to be believed.</p><p>Lush. Sensual. Exotic. Whispers of a rain-dark forest, a hidden glade.</p><p>Keeping her wings tight to her back in an effort to avoid the rusted metal all around, she shifted along her perch until she was directly above the first vampire. It wasn\u2019t so bad from that position, she realized, because she\u2019d never been on the mezzanine when her mother had chosen to\u2014</p><p>Slamming the door shut on that memory, she took a deep, steady breath, drawing in the scents. Salt, the sea, it was a constant, so she took that out of the equation straight away. She also put aside the puzzlingly pristine fragrance of Caliane\u2019s signature black orchids.</p><p>Sweetgrass, cut on a summer\u2019s day.</p><p>It was one of the most delicate scents she\u2019d ever sensed on a vampire, and it belonged to the one who hung on this rope. Which meant the killer\u2019s scent was either much more faint or not present. Knowing she had to get closer to the victim, she twisted, managing to drop down into a hanging position with both arms hooked over the metal beam for support, her wings spread wide for balance.</p><p>The body was only inches away ... but too far down.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she shifted her hold until she was gripping the metal with her fingers. Still not close enough. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do here,\u201d she said at last, frustration gnawing at her temper. \u201cI\u2019ll have to do the final scent track when the bodies are\u2014Fuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena! Talk to me!\u201d</p><p>Heart thudding triple-time, she reached out and managed to just graze the vampire\u2019s forehead with her fingertips. Plasticky, frigid from the air. Except... \u201cOh God.\u201d She\u2019d definitely seen it this time\u2014the flicker of an eyelid, as if he was struggling to raise it. \u201cHe\u2019s alive! Get Rescue down here now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>Santiago was efficient but she knew it would take time. If this vampire\u2014Jesus, maybe all the vamps\u2014were in any way conscious, then what they were suffering right now had to be torture. Dropping and sweeping out from under the bridge, she rose into the air, twisting her head in every direction.</p><p>\u201cLooking for someone, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she fell several feet before getting her momentum under control. Illium came to hover beside her when she rose back up and caught the edge of the bridge once again, holding herself in place so she could talk to him. \u201cAt least one of them is alive. Can you get them down?\u201d He was the single angel she knew who might have a hope of maneuvering in the cramped conditions.</p><p>He held out a hand. \u201cDagger.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Glad he no longer looked as tormented as he had the previous evening, she slapped one of her knives in his hand and watched as he flew in, somehow executing the tightest of turns before reaching over and cutting the rope. The vampire dropped. But Illium was faster. He scooped the male up before the vampire\u2019s dead weight of a body could touch the water. Elena followed him up onto the bridge itself\u2014which the cops had cordoned off at both ends, making themselves real popular with commuters\u2014and landed.</p><p>Soon as Illium placed the male on the road and dove off to get the rest of the victims, she took out another knife and began to cut through the vampire\u2019s shirt, pulling away the matted fabric and wincing at the chunks of skin that came with it. But she had to see the damage. Santiago, having come down on his haunches beside her, watched in silence as she succeeded in revealing the ruin of the vampire\u2019s chest.</p><p>It sure as hell looked like he\u2019d suffered major damage to the region around his heart, but there was so much dried blood tangled up in thick curls of black chest hair that she couldn\u2019t tell for sure. Unhooking the wireless device over her ear, she gave it to Santiago before reaching into one of the pockets of the fleece-lined vest she\u2019d put on as protection against the wind, and pulling out a pair of latex gloves.</p><p>Santiago took the chance to lean forward and hold the screen of his cell phone a scant inch from the vampire\u2019s mouth. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered when the screen began to mist with steam. \u201cFor a minute, I thought you\u2019d lost it down there. But shit.\u201d He glanced over her shoulder to where Illium was landing a second time.</p> <p>Elena was ninety-nine-percent certain she might actually have lost it if she hadn\u2019t been so fucking shocked out of her mind. \u201cI need something with which to wash off the blood.\u201d The irony of the fact that the East River churned below wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Santiago returned moments later with two water bottles as well as a pack of tissues. \u201cFrom the squad cars. Medics are on their way.\u201d</p><p>Vampires didn\u2019t need medics to heal, but during the regeneration process, their bodies hurt the same as a mortal\u2019s. The paramedics could at least give them drugs, knock them out for a while. \u201cGood.\u201d Dampening a wad of tissue, she cleaned the male\u2019s chest with quick, careful motions as Santiago went to check the other bodies.</p><p>Great gouges marked the vampire\u2019s flesh beneath the clotted black of his blood, as if someone had tried to dig through his skin.</p><p>A flash of memory, Raphael\u2019s hand punching through a vampire\u2019s sternum to remove his still-beating heart.</p> <p>\u201cBut that,\u201d she muttered, trying to keep things practical, logical, \u201cwas a single strike.\u201d Quick, brutal, efficient. This, by contrast, had been done by someone who didn\u2019t have Raphael\u2019s strength\u2014because while the male\u2019s chest looked as if it had been through the shredder, his heart beat safe behind his rib cage.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all alive.\u201d Santiago sounded shaken. \u201cChrist, it\u2019s like someone fucking clawed this guy.\u201d</p><p>That was what Elena was thinking. \u201cThe question is, who?\u201d</p><p>A strange silence.</p><p>Following the detective\u2019s gaze as he came down on his haunches again, the wind flipping his tie over his shoulder, she watched as he put a gloved hand under the victim\u2019s. The vampire\u2019s fingers and nails were encrusted with blood and what might well have been bits of flesh. \u201cHe did it to himself.\u201d A cold far deeper than the winds that buffeted the bridge slid through her veins.</p><p>Santiago glanced at the row of bodies Illium had laid out. \u201cThey all did.\u201d</p> <p>Elena knew from her lessons at the Refuge that very, very few angels had the power to compel a man to savage himself. To kill, yes. But to mutilate and torture? No, that power was reserved for the Cadre ... and the Sleepers who had once been Cadre.</p><p>24</p><p>Having been away from the city when he received Elena\u2019s call, Raphael now landed beside the Central Park pond where she stood watching the ducks. \u201cWe have been here before.\u201d She\u2019d been mortal then, a hunter he intended to bend to his will.</p><p>No smile on that expressive face; the rustle of the leaves were secret whispers in the air. \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you found.\u201d</p><p>Elena glanced around the quiet but not deserted area. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>Taking her into his arms, he rose up into the sky. The flight across the Hudson took only minutes, and then he was landing near the house of glass his consort so loved, his gaze on her as she flared out her wings to descend. Your control is improving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nowhere near the level I need to be if I\u2019m going to be effective in a hunt.\u201d Tucking her hair behind her ears, she walked into the warm humidity of the greenhouse. \u201cI sensed black orchids. It\u2019s such a unique scent, it\u2019s impossible to mistake.\u201d Touching her fingers to a blush pink bloom, she shook her head. \u201cThe purity of it bothers me for some reason\u2014my perfumes contact is trying to get me a sample so I can figure out why.\u201d Gray eyes solemn with concern met his as he closed the door behind them.</p> <p>Instinct and experience told him to reject her worry, her care. An archangel did not survive by being weak. He survived by being more lethal than any other. Come here, Elena.</p><p>When she shifted to stand bare inches from him, he curved his hand around the back of her neck, rubbing his thumb over her pulse. \u201cNot many know of this particular punishment.\u201d But he did. He\u2019d been there, a young child who\u2019d understood even then that justice had to be served. \u201cMy mother did not wish to be a goddess like Lijuan or Neha. Neither did she wish to rule empires like my father.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s hair fell in a silken waterfall over his arm as she raised her head so she could watch him as he spoke. She didn\u2019t ask questions, but every part of her stood with him, unflinching against the darkness coming inexorably closer.</p><p>\u201cBut she was treated as a goddess, and she did rule,\u201d he murmured, \u201cas I rule.\u201d He had learned about ruling from his mother, learned that there was a way to do it that would inspire both respect and awe without the debilitating fear that surrounded so many archangels. \u201cShe ruled Sumeria, but there was one particular city she treated as home. It was called Amanat.\u201d</p><p>His hunter\u2019s hand came to rest on his waist as lines formed on her brow. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about it. On a TV special about lost cities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanat and its people disappeared when Caliane vanished.\u201d Some say she took her people into Sleep with her, so that they would be there to welcome her when she woke. Most believe she murdered them all before she took her own life, for she loved them too well to leave them under another\u2019s rule, and that Amanat is her grave.</p><p>Elena brushed the fingers of her free hand over the edge of one of his wings. He spread them wider, giving her easier access. A drop of water from a disturbed cluster of tiny white blossoms trickled along his feathers as, taking the invitation, she touched him with a firmer stroke. \u201cWhich do you believe?\u201d</p><p>He settled her into the vee of his thighs, bracing her so both her hands would be free. \u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, \u201cloved things of beauty. Do you recall the ruby on the shelf in my Tower office?\u201d The priceless gemstone was flawless in its faceted splendor. \u201cShe gave it to me for my tenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had impeccable taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanat,\u201d Raphael continued, \u201cwas her jewel of jewels. She loved that city, truly loved it. I spent many of the happiest years of my childhood running wild above its paved streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels are so protective of their young,\u201d Elena murmured, continuing to caress the insides of his wings with those hands that bore calluses from weapons training\u2014a warrior\u2019s hands. He wanted none other on him.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d he began, speaking of the dawn of his existence, \u201ctrusted the people of Amanat in a way an archangel seldom trusts anyone.\u201d Memories of hot summer days spent flying above ancient buildings carved out of rock; of playing with mortal friends and being petted and adored by adults. \u201cAnd they loved her. It was not the kind of worship Lijuan or even Neha inspires. It was ... untainted in a way I cannot describe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did,\u201d Elena murmured. \u201cLove. What they felt was love.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head a fraction, bringing one hand up to play with the curling tendrils of hair that licked at her temple. \u201cShe was a good ruler. Before the madness, she was what an archangel should be.\u201d</p><p>His consort\u2019s eyes softened to a warm, liquid mercury. \u201cThe histories Jessamy gave me to read, they said the same. That she was the most beloved of the archangels, that even the rest of the Cadre gave her their respect.\u201d</p><p>He widened his stance, tucking her close enough that she nuzzled her face into his neck, one hand closing around his nape, the other continuing to caress the sensitive arch of his left wing. \u201cThe reason the people of Amanat loved her so\u201d\u2014he breathed in the spring and steel scent of his hunter\u2014\u201cwas that she loved them in turn.\u201d</p><p>Faded echoes of his mother laughing with the maidens who served in her temple, the sunshine of her smile as she gifted a maid about to marry with a dowry of gold and precious silks. \u201cSo when a group of vampires from outside came in and hurt two of Amanat\u2019s women, she did not look the other way because the women were mortal and the vampires over four hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s body turned rigid, her breath warm against the hollow of his neck.</p><p>He tightened his hold against the nightmare memories that stalked her. Elena.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Archangel. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>He had never spoken of these events, but they had shaped him as much as Caliane\u2019s disappearance. \u201cThe vampires kept the women for three days. Three days in the span of a mortal lifetime can feel like three decades.\u201d His mother\u2019s words. \u201cSince the women were returned alive, she decided not to execute the vampires. Instead, she sentenced them to the same kind of terror they\u2019d inflicted.\u201d</p><p>Elena sucked in a breath. \u201cShe hung them, in a way calculated to ensure they wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elena. She did not hang them. She made them hang themselves.\u201d</p><p>Elena flexed her hand on his nape, the bite of her nails tiny kisses. \u201cThat explains why I couldn\u2019t pick up any other scents on the rope or on the bodies on the bridge. They were compelled to do what they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose vampires in Amanat, the three days must\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Guild Hunter. Remember ... three days of terror in a mortal lifetime can feel like three decades.\u201d He spoke with his lips against her skin, the warmth of her, the life of her, shoving away the cold that had been inside him for so long. \u201cVampires live far beyond a human lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree decades?\u201d A disbelieving whisper. \u201cHow did they stay alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were fed enough to ensure they lived, and left hanging from a specially constructed gallows in a field where crows liked to rest.\u201d</p><p>Elena shuddered at the image that bloomed fully formed in her mind. \u201cThe birds would\u2019ve plucked out the eyes, other soft flesh,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe parts would have grown back, and the crows would\u2019ve come again.\u201d An endless cycle. \u201cHow long did they survive?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe entire three decades. My mother made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was a scary-ass woman,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if those men did what I\u2019m guessing they did, then the sentence was just.\u201d Three days would\u2019ve meant nothing to a four-hundred-year-old vampire. Sure, it would\u2019ve hurt at the time but it would\u2019ve been soon forgotten. Those women would\u2019ve been scarred forever.</p><p>\u201cYes. They became as they\u2019d left their victims.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled at him, realizing they were completely intertwined, her arms around his neck, his legs on either side of hers, one of his hands in her hair, the other on her lower back, his mouth against her temple, his chest hard and solid and real against hers. She\u2019d never felt more centered, more safe, though they were speaking of a cold, deadly horror. \u201cI understand justice. The vampires on the bridge today\u2014do you know anything about them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDmitri tells me they are young, less than seventy. Not one has done anything that would merit such a punishment\u2014two are steady family men, one is a writer who prefers his own company when not in service as part of his Contract, while two work in the lowest level of Tower business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder a hundred\u2014weak, easy to control.\u201d Especially for an archangel rising from a millennia of Sleep. She didn\u2019t say that last aloud, couldn\u2019t hurt him in that way.</p><p>It is all right, Elena. If my mother did this, and there is every reason to believe that she did, she has lost all that made her the once beloved ruler of Amanat.</p><p>A bleak silence.</p><p>Elena held him to her, close enough that their heartbeats melded. It was the only thing she knew to do, the only thing she could give him. If he had to draw his mother\u2019s blood, she\u2019d stand with him, no matter if he ordered her to keep her distance. Because they were linked, she and her archangel, two parts slowly become a whole.</p> <p>The rest of the day passed by without incident, with Elena spending a good chunk of time with Evelyn. Her sister\u2019s innocent enthusiasm, her growing confidence in her skills, was a welcome respite against the darkness on the horizon. She was feeling pretty good about things\u2014until an out of the blue run-in with Santiago back at the house.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d the cop asked her. \u201cThat, on the bridge this morning?\u201d</p><p>Gut going tight, Elena folded her arms. \u201cYou already know I can\u2019t tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>Eyes shrewd, Santiago echoed her stance, leaning back against the squad car that had brought him over the bridge and into the Angel Enclave. \u201cSo you\u2019re not one of us now, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a low blow.\u201d She\u2019d known it would come, just hadn\u2019t expected it so soon and from him. Never from Santiago. \u201cBut yeah, if you want to draw a line in the sand\u2014I\u2019m not simply a hunter anymore. I\u2019m an archangel\u2019s consort.\u201d It felt strange to hear the words fall from her lips, but she\u2019d made her choices, would stand by them.</p><p>Straightening from his slouched position, the detective dropped his arms. \u201cGuess that puts me in my place.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to shake him. \u201cWhy are you being so unreasonable? You\u2019ve always been happy to let the Guild handle vampiric incidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about this smells.\u201d A stubborn line to his jaw, that salt-and-pepper stubble catching the light. \u201cI don\u2019t want the city to become a battleground like it did last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not human anymore, Ellie. I don\u2019t know your priorities.\u201d</p><p>It hurt worse not just because they\u2019d been friends for years, but because he\u2019d been so accepting of her since her return. Clenching her fists, she gave him a deliberately expressionless face. \u201cI guess that makes us even\u2014I don\u2019t know who you are anymore either.\u201d</p><p>She thought he flinched and was almost certain he was about to say something, but then he got in the squad car, slamming the door shut. Only after he\u2019d driven off did she double over, feeling as if she\u2019d taken a punch to the gut. Breathing past it, she rose back to her full height and walked into the house to call Venom. She needed to pound her aggression out on someone, and the vampire had a way of provoking her past all reason\u2014it was exactly what she needed today.</p><p>Venom wasn\u2019t only free, he was in a hell of a temper. As a result, she fell into bed that night bruised and battered and exhausted. Raphael raised an eyebrow at her condition when he came to join her. \u201cWhy was the mortal here?\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew. \u201cHe wanted to talk about the case.\u201d</p> <p>An ominous silence that spoke louder than words.</p><p>Thumping her fist into the pillow, she turned onto her side. \u201cIt\u2019s not important, not with everything else that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always ask the mortal.\u201d</p><p>She scowled and turned to stare down at him where he lay on his back on the bed. \u201cBlackmail doesn\u2019t work well with me.\u201d</p><p>Arms folded behind his head, he looked at her with blue eyes gone dangerously quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not making a threat.\u201d</p><p>Her hands curled into tight, bloodless fists. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing!\u201d</p><p>An unblinking gaze.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Slamming down on her back, she stared at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... hard being torn between two worlds.\u201d With the words out, her anger disappeared, to be replaced by a far more hurtful emotion\u2014tight and hot and abrasive in her chest.</p><p>Raphael rose up to lean on his elbow beside her, his hair falling over his forehead. It was impossible to resist the temptation to lift her hand, run her fingers through the midnight silk of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you before,\u201d she said, the words wanting out, \u201cbut Beth, she said something to me. That she\u2019d die and I\u2019d still be alive.\u201d Emotion burned at the backs of her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to outlive my baby sister, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A solemn answer. \u201cBut would you change this? Would you change us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never.\u201d An absolute truth. \u201cIt still hurts to know that I\u2019ll stand over her grave one day.\u201d A single tear escaped her control to trickle down the side of her face.</p><p>Raphael leaned down until their lips brushed. \u201cYour mortal heart causes you much pain, Elena\u2014but it makes you who you are.\u201d A kiss that stole her breath. \u201cIt will give you the strength to bear the costs of immortality.\u201d</p><p>He had touched her in so many ways, but that night, he touched her with a tenderness that broke her heart. He kissed the salt of her tears away, his lips so firm, so gentle on her cheek, her jaw, her mouth. And his hands, those powerful, dangerous hands ...</p><p>Never had she been handled with such exquisite care. Never had she felt so cherished.</p><p>Yet, at the end, he called her, \u201cWarrior mine,\u201d this archangel who had seen her at her weakest. Those were the words she took into a deep, dreamless sleep, Raphael\u2019s heartbeat strong and steady beneath her palm.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>Elena jerked awake at the whisper, glancing over to see her archangel asleep on his front, his magnificent wings spread out until they covered her, too. He had a habit of doing that in bed, she thought, heart aching at the memory of his tenderness earlier. But even as she stroked the white-gold of his feathers with one hand, she retrieved the dagger she\u2019d secreted down the side of the bed with the other.</p><p>If that was Lijuan whispering into the inky dark of the bedroom, then a dagger wouldn\u2019t do much good, but Elena felt better with the kiss of steel against her skin. Pushing tangled hair off her face with her free hand, she searched the room with her gaze. There were no intruders, nothing that shouldn\u2019t be there. But her heart continued to pound, as if\u2014</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>Ice in her bloodstream, her eyes arrowed toward a rippling pocket of air at the bottom of the bed. Almost a mirage, but not quite. It was as if the fabric of the world itself was being twisted as something tried to take shape and failed. Throat dry, she reached out without taking her eyes off that thing and shook Raphael\u2019s muscular shoulder. It amazed her that he\u2019d slept through this\u2014he tended to wake the instant she did, because the fact was, he didn\u2019t need to sleep.</p><p>Solid muscle under her hand. But Raphael didn\u2019t wake.</p><p>Archangel, she said into his mind, wake up. There\u2019s something in the room.</p><p>Silence. Emptiness.</p><p>Her entire body went stiff, hand clenching on his shoulder. Nothing, but nothing, had ever stopped Raphael from responding to a mental plea from her. He\u2019d found her in the middle of New York when Uram had held her captive in a charnel house of a room. He\u2019d tracked her across the Refuge when Michaela went nuclear at the Medica. He\u2019d broken a meeting of the Cadre itself to save her life in Beijing. There was no way he\u2019d sleep through a call from her when she was sitting right next to him.</p><p>Staring at the strange near mirage, she set her jaw and lifted the steel in her hand. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d A soft whisper as she threw.</p><p>25</p><p>The knife sliced through the air to dig home in the opposite wall, the hilt quivering at the impact. The mirage, though it didn\u2019t disappear . . . sort of fractured. That was when she caught the whisper of a scent that shouldn\u2019t have been there.</p><p>Lush, sensual, exotic.</p><p>Black orchids, but it was somehow different from what she\u2019d sensed on the murdered girl\u2019s body, on the men hanging from the bridge.</p><p>But there was no time for her to process the notes, because a split second after the fracture, a wing was rising under her touch. Moving so fast she couldn\u2019t track him with her eyes, Raphael was up and standing beside the bed, the white-hot glow of him so vivid as to erase the lines of his form, to turn him into a blazing torch. Stunned, Elena threw a hand over her eyes and ducked her head in preparation for crawling out of bed so she could retrieve the weapons she\u2019d hidden underneath, do what she could to assist.</p><p>But one blink and the blinding heat of his power was gone.</p><p>Looking up, hand itching for a weapon, she saw that the thing in the center of the room had disappeared, no hint of black orchids in the air. But she didn\u2019t drop her guard until Raphael said, \u201cMy mother is no longer here, Elena.\u201d There was a remoteness to his voice she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>Pushing off the blankets, she began to slide out.</p><p>Raphael was already pulling on a pair of pants over that magnificent body. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before dawn. She will not return tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pause at the balcony doors, pushing them wide open. She managed to cover the distance just in time to see him disappear into the starry night sky, flying so far and fast that she lost track of him in the space of a few piercing seconds. Anger stabbed through her, hot and determined. Damn if he was going to do this\u2014especially after the intimacy of the moments they\u2019d shared not only tonight, but since she\u2019d woken from the coma, after the bonds they\u2019d forged.</p><p>Stalking back into the bedroom, she pulled on her own pants, slapped on one of the supportive tank tops that had been designed to fit around her wings using straps, then slid on the warm, lined sleeves that fit snugly over her upper arms and left her hands free. She was back on the balcony bare minutes after he\u2019d taken off, very conscious of the tendrils of dark chocolate and fur curling beneath the bedroom door as the male behind the scents got ever closer\u2014Dmitri had come over for a late meeting with Raphael, opted to stay the night in one of the rooms reserved for the Seven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, it was clear Raphael had told him to watch over Elena.</p><p>That, too, she thought with teeth-gritting focus, was going to stop.</p><p>Looking down, she realized she had no hope of making a flight from her current position, not with her concentration shot to smithereens. So instead, she jumped over the balcony, using her wings to slow her descent. Then she ran through the trees at the edge of the cliff to dive out over the Hudson, beating her wings\u2014stronger, more resilient\u2014hard and fast to sweep herself up off the choppy water and into the clear beauty of the night sky, the stars sparkling ice on black velvet.</p><p>The wind was cool against her skin, liquid soft over her wings. Below her, Manhattan was a midnight sea scattered with glittering jewels. New York. It could be a hard place, a hard city. Just like the archangel who ruled it.</p> <p>But it was home.</p><p>As the archangel was hers.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>She made the effort to arrow the thought only to him, having worked with him over the past few days to fine-tune what mental abilities she already seemed to have. According to Raphael, she\u2019d gain other abilities with time, and she was happy with that\u2014she had more than enough on her plate right now without having to deal with some unexpected superpower.</p><p>No response, but some tug in her soul made her turn, head roughly in the direction of Camden, New Jersey. Raphael had bonded to her on some level deeper than the heart. The hunter she\u2019d once been would\u2019ve scoffed at such thoughts, but that was before she\u2019d tasted the golden pleasure of ambrosia as Raphael fed it into her mouth, as he kissed immortal life into her dying body.</p> <p>Who was to say that such an act wouldn\u2019t have even deeper consequences?</p><p>Go home, Elena.</p><p>Startled, she dipped and glanced over her shoulder to see Raphael in the sky high above her. We\u2019ll be going home together.</p><p>You can\u2019t hope to keep up with me. Such arrogance in those words, but that made them no less true.</p><p>Instead of answering, she continued to fly, riding the night winds to give herself a break when she could. Some time later, they left the last edges of the cityscape behind, the streetlights below them speaking of quiet neighborhoods locked up in the arms of sleep.</p><p>A sweep of air against her face as her archangel shot down in front of her before rising with heart-stopping speed. He\u2019d shown off for her before. But this wasn\u2019t play. This was an archangel pointing out how very puny she was in the scheme of things. Newsflash, Archangel. I already know I\u2019m as weak as a baby compared to you. Hasn\u2019t stopped me from dancing with you anytime yet.</p> <p>As the words left her mouth, she remembered something else, a sensual promise he\u2019d made to her at the Refuge. You said you would show me how angels dance.</p><p>I am in no mood to be gentle, Guild Hunter.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. Consort.</p><p>You\u2019re tiring. I can see your wings beginning to falter.</p><p>Cursing under her breath because he was right, she looked for a place to land. When her eyes lit on a thick branch high above the ground, the tree situated in what looked like a deserted local park, she dropped without hesitation. Maybe she\u2019d break some bones, but hell, she was training so freaking hard for a reason\u2014playing it safe wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>At the last minute, right when she knew she was assuredly going to break some bones, Raphael slipped into her mind and corrected her angle of descent so that she was able to grab the branch and pull herself up to straddle it without damage. She glared in his direction. Stop taking over whenever you feel like it.</p><p>A dangerous pause. Would you have preferred to spend the next few weeks in a cast?</p><p>I\u2019d prefer to learn to do this myself.</p> <p>Yet you attempt to pierce the clouds when you can barely fly in a straight line.</p><p>Anger bubbled through her bloodstream. Come down here and say that to my face.</p><p>Her hair whipped back in a gust of wind an instant later, and then Raphael was hovering next to her branch, the angles of his face starkly masculine, his eyes blazing that metallic chrome that never augured anything good. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be flying such long distances, much less hunting,\u201d he said with the arrogance of an immortal who had lived well over a thousand years. \u201cYou need to spend another few years at the Refuge at the very least.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAngels spend that time at the Refuge because they\u2019re literally babies. I\u2019m very much an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d A cold question. \u201cAttempting to break bones making a landing you couldn\u2019t hope to realize sounds like something a five-year-old would do.\u201d</p><p>Changing position so that she sat with both legs hanging over the branch, her wings spread out behind her for balance, she curled her fingers around the living wood in an effort to calm herself. \u201cYou know something, Raphael?\u201d she said, fingernails digging into the bark, \u201cI think you\u2019re spoiling for a fight.\u201d</p><p>No words from the immortal in front of her, his face so austere she could almost believe they\u2019d never loved, never laughed together.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, leaning forward, \u201cam I.\u201d</p><p>A glow around his wings, something she\u2019d learned to expect when he was pissed. She held her ground. Because this was who he was, and she either took all of him or she walked away. The latter was not an option.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home. I\u2019ll call Illium to guide you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more babysitters,\u201d she said, her anger a honed blade. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it. Neither am I about to toddle off home like a good little girl.\u201d</p><p>You will do as I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019s that working for you so far?\u201d</p><p>Shifting forward, he braced his hands on the branch on either side of her, his big body pushing between her thighs. You obey very sweetly.</p><p>Oooh, she thought, he didn\u2019t only want a fight, he wanted a fight. \u201cI am,\u201d she said, trying to remain rational, \u201cone of the strongest hunters in the Guild. Not only that, I survived an archangel and a psycho-would-be-archangel. I\u2019ve earned my stripes.\u201d</p><p>Anoushka almost killed you.</p><p>She thought of the poison Neha\u2019s daughter had pumped into her body, of the panic that had made her heart stutter, her blood run cold. \u201cDo you know how many people have \u2018almost\u2019 killed me over the years?\u201d When his eyes iced over with a blue so pure it was unlike any color seen on this earth, she realized that might not have been the best thing to bring up. Then again ... \u201cI take you as you are,\u201d she said, unwilling\u2014unable\u2014to back down. \u201cI do that.\u201d</p><p>The fierce intensity of that statement cut through the storm of fury riding Raphael, and he heard her, heard, too, the words she didn\u2019t say.</p><p>I take you as you are. Take me as I am.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you as anything but a warrior.\u201d Even when she came into his arms, he never forgot that it was a very conscious surrender on her part, a choice she made to let herself be vulnerable.</p><p>Her lips tightened, and she shook her head, the fine strands of her hair sliding wild over her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, Raphael. Just the words aren\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>In the Refuge, she\u2019d asked him to stop shadowing her mind. That had been a difficult choice for an archangel to make when keeping a mental watch on her was the best way he had to ensure her safety. \u201cI have given you unparalleled freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you comparing us with, Archangel?\u201d she asked, watching him with those pale eyes that glimmered witch-bright in the darkness.</p><p>A sign of her growing immortality, he realized, wondering if she\u2019d noticed an improvement in her night-vision yet. That would be a trait a hunter would value\u2014for the kiss of immortality could only build on the bones of what was already present.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making our own rules,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is no template for us to follow.\u201d</p><p>His mind flashed to her broken in his arms, her life bleeding out of her a drop at a time. Then had come the silence. Endless, merciless silence as she slept. \u201cElijah and Hannah have been together hundreds of years,\u201d he said. \u201cShe follows his lead.\u201d</p><p>A shaky smile from his hunter with her mortal heart. \u201cIs that what you truly want?\u201d It was a husky whisper.</p><p>He knew then that he could hurt her terribly at this moment. Like her father, he could tell her that she wasn\u2019t what she should be, that who and what she was, was a cause for shame. In doing so, he\u2019d hit at her biggest vulnerability and win this war between them.</p><p>He was an archangel. He\u2019d made ruthless decision after ruthless decision.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, for she was exactly who she should be. His mate, his consort. \u201cBut it would be easier if you were like Hannah.\u201d</p><p>A laugh that sounded wet. \u201cAnd it would be easier if you followed my every command.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other for a long, long moment ... then Raphael reached forward, cupped her cheek. \u201cI will give you your freedom,\u201d he said, fighting every instinct he had, \u201con one condition.\u201d</p><p>Lines formed between her brows. \u201cWhat condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not trust me, hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bit, not when you\u2019re trying to get your own way.\u201d But she leaned her cheek into his touch, stroking her own fingers through his hair.</p><p>He shifted his grip to her jaw, firmed his hold. \u201cYou will call me. No hesitations, no thinking, no waiting until the last possible moment. If you\u2019re in danger, you will call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason,\u201d she bargained. \u201cA vamp hopped up on bloodlust coming after me is a different case from a power-crazed angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to negotiating.\u201d Most people gave him everything he demanded.</p><p>A slow, slow smile that melted away the lingering tendrils of the cold rage within him. \u201cI guess the next several hundred years are going to be an education then, huh?\u201d</p><p>He could not help it. He kissed her, took that warmth, that laughter inside of him, where it could warm him, too. You tease an archangel at your peril.</p><p>Strong arms around his neck, fingers playing over the arches of his wings. I dunno, I kinda like what it gets me.</p><p>Her lips parted beneath his, and he surged in, claiming her with a hunger that no longer startled him. It was as if the bond between them grew ever deeper with every hour that passed. You will call me.</p><p>Within reason.</p><p>He considered it, smiled in satisfaction. Very well. But you will explain each and every injury each time you do not call me.</p><p>Breaking the openmouthed intimacy of the kiss, she glared at him. \u201cThat is a ridiculous stipulation for a hunter!\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around her and pulled her off the branch, using his power and strength to take them high up into the star-studded skies.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she said when he released her far above the night clouds, \u201cI\u2019m serious. You can\u2019t expect me to, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shifted direction. \u201cAnswer to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said, changing her angle of flight to follow.</p><p>\u201cAnd am I not answerable to my consort?\u201d</p><p>The words Elena had been about to say died in her throat. \u201cWell,\u201d she murmured, letting him catch her around the waist, \u201cif you put it like that, I can\u2019t exactly argue, can I?\u201d It was an unexpected, breath-stealing gift, his open acceptance of her claim. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blue fire licked in his eyes, his mouth brushing over hers in tiny, teasing bites. Then, will you dance with me, Elena?</p><p>She felt her eyes widen, her stomach fill with butterflies. \u201cNow? Here?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hands played over her ribs, his thumbs brushing the lower curves of her breasts. Now. Here.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d The air left her throat as he bit at her lower lip at the same time that he rolled one of her nipples through the fabric of her tank. Wait. Wait. She had to ask him something before her brain turned to mush.</p> <p>Rain and wind around her, fresh and wild and open, the archangel\u2019s hand closing with open possession over her breast. I do not wish to wait.</p><p>26</p><p>God, she was sunk, putty in his hands. Only her discomfort at the question circling in her mind gave her the will to break the kiss, to suck in a breath . . . while the angel dipped his head to close his teeth over the frantically beating pulse in her neck.</p><p>\u201cSurveillance!\u201d she blurted out. \u201cThere are satellites everywhere! Won\u2019t someone see?\u201d She was too private, too possessive, to share this moment with anyone.</p><p>One hand stroking down over her back, to her bottom. I am an archangel, Elena. I have enough power to blow out every satellite in the world.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d She cried out as he bit down on her pulse then licked the small sensual hurt, her hands fisting in the thick silk of his hair.</p><p>No one will see us. A kiss that took over her mouth. I used my power to shield us from view as soon as we flew out of Manhattan.</p><p>She bit down on his lip this time. \u201cThanks for telling me.\u201d</p><p>One strong hand clenched on her hip. \u201cBiting is not nice, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear God. When he started teasing . . . Forget about the putty. She was melting into a big old pile of goo. Pushing away in self-defense, she tried valiantly to hover and failed. But she managed to turn her drop into a sweep that drew up into a vertical climb. Show me how angels dance, Raphael.</p><p>A second later, he was there with her, his body spiraling around her own as she climbed, his speed and agility so stunning that everything female in her resonated in response. Mine, she thought, this magnificent creature with his wings of gold and eyes of relentless blue is mine.</p> <p>A shimmer in her peripheral vision and then ... sex. Pure sex and temptation and passion on her tongue. Dusting me again, Archangel? Licking the delicious, decadent taste of Raphael\u2019s special blend of angel-dust off her lips, she flew through the fine, fine particles, feeling the wicked caress of it cover every exposed inch of her body\u2014including her wings.</p><p>Next time, I will do it when you are clothed in nothing but skin.</p><p>She clenched her thighs at the sensual impact of that image. It would drive her mad, she thought, that level of sensation. But she\u2019d always known that loving an archangel would be no easy matter. Smiling, she dropped without warning, simply folding her wings and plummeting to the earth.</p><p>She flared them out again at the midpoint, sweeping away in a different direction. Raphael was nowhere to be seen. Feeling smug at having evaded him, she was startled to see angel-dust raining down around her, streaking the night sky in shimmers of brilliant gold. Pushing back her hair, she glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Her archangel was flying perfectly above her, his wings bigger, a midnight shadow over her body. Not fair, she complained. You\u2019ve had a millennium and a half to learn these tricks. She tugged at the neck of her tank top, suddenly far too hot as the angel-dust worked its way through the material and into her pores to her bloodstream, the erotic kiss of it concentrated on the pulse between her thighs.</p><p>A light touch at her neck and the tank, then the sleeves, literally fell apart in her hands. \u201cRaphael!\u201d I can\u2019t go about having my clothes scattered all over the state!</p><p>Even as she spoke, she saw tiny flickers of blue light up the night and realized he\u2019d destroyed the fragments of her clothing. But that wasn\u2019t at the forefront of her mind. It was the fact that she was nude above the waist. It made her feel painfully vulnerable.</p><p>No one can see, Elena. I promise you this.</p> <p>Only Raphael could\u2019ve made her believe that, made her trust. Taking a deep breath, she dropped the arms she\u2019d crossed over her chest and looked around. She had no idea where they were, but it was pitch-dark below, so dark that it had to be\u2014\u201cThe sea.\u201d While they\u2019d been flying above the clouds, Raphael had taken them out into the Atlantic, so far out that no matter which direction she turned, she couldn\u2019t see any sign of light, of human civilization.</p><p>Exhilaration burst through her bloodstream, and she thought, what the hell. Do your magic, Archangel. She kicked off her shoes, somehow managed to get off her pants and underwear\u2014though her flight path probably looked like that of a drunken bumblebee. Her clothing disappeared in flashes of blue, her skin sighing at the release. Flaring out her wings to their greatest width, she gave in to the hunger inside of her and rode the air currents with an untamed, open joy.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt as carefree.</p><p>Raphael winged over her, slow and easy, almost lazily, and she got the feeling he was letting her play. It made her lips kick upward ... and then she tasted the angel-dust glittering in the air. Pure sex. The damn sneaky archangel had flown circles around her, until there was nowhere she could go to escape the exotic, aphrodisiac stuff. You realize this is war? she said, licking the dust off her lips, vividly conscious of it caressing every secret corner of her body.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Her instincts kicked in.</p><p>Utilizing her recent flight training, she did a hard turn to her left and went up. Raphael shot by a bare millisecond later, missing her by a fraction of a feather. As he caught himself and turned to head back up, she swept right ... diving just when he\u2019d come too far to stop. But this was an archangel she played with. He managed to run his fingers over her wings in teasing promise as she plummeted.</p><p>Strong, warm hands closing on the naked skin of her waist. Too fast, hunter. A kiss pressed to the side of her neck as he rose up before releasing her. But when she would\u2019ve turned to fly in another direction, he gripped her again, holding her naked body flush against his semiclothed one.</p><p>Every tiny inch of her skin crawling with sensation, she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her breasts to the muscled plane of his chest as he propelled them ever higher. \u201cKiss me, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>Later.</p><p>Too hungry to listen to the order, she nipped at his throat, sucked and kissed until the hands on her waist squeezed, his erection a pulsing brand between them. Not yet, Elena. There was a hoarse quality to his mental tone, the glow coming off his wings sparking electric blue.</p><p>The sight threw a switch inside her\u2014she wrapped her legs around Raphael\u2019s waist, her wings tight to her back as she trusted him to hold her up. Then she concentrated on getting him to lower his head.</p><p>Bites along his jaw, nips over his throat, suckling kisses on his pulse. When that didn\u2019t work, she ran a hand down to circle one flat male nipple. He gripped her hand, his hold shifting to her lower back, and for a moment, she thought she had him. Then his jaw firmed.</p><p>And he flew higher.</p><p>Higher.</p><p>Until they were well above the cloud layer, at an altitude where it should\u2019ve been freezing cold. Except that the blaze coming off Raphael seemed to have created a cocoon around her\u2014not that she needed the heat, not with angel-dust in every pore and every cell. She could feel herself lushly damp against his abdomen, wanted only to ride him until he begged for surrender.</p><p>\u201cRaphael. Now.\u201d It was a demand fueled by near-painful need.</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>High, high, high above the earth. Then, his mouth was on her own, stealing her breath. Ready?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Clamping his arms tight around her, he angled them so they faced down toward the water, and then he . . . dropped.</p><p>She screamed into the kiss even as she felt an electric burn of heat against her and then the warm muscle of his suddenly unclothed body. He tumbled them over and over as they fell, and she would\u2019ve been lost at the first tumble, but he held her in unyielding arms until there was no fear ... only the feel of him\u2014hard and demanding sliding into the melting heat of her body.</p><p>Tiny shocks of pleasure radiated out from that most intimate of joinings.</p><p>Breaking the kiss to gasp in a breath, she saw the water coming at them at overwhelming speed. \u201cRaphael!\u201d A single pulse of fear before he executed a turn so sharp it thrust him soul-deep inside of her.</p><p>An overload of sensation. Crackling electricity across her skin.</p><p>Not fighting the agonizing bite of pleasure, she reclaimed his lips as he pushed them both through the clouds again, his body shifting with each wingbeat to caress her with excruciating intimacy. Clenching her fingers in his hair, she rubbed herself against the solid heat of his chest, needing, wanting, hungering.</p><p>Dance with me, Elena.</p><p>He bit at her lips when she squeezed her inner muscles in a sexual caress, kissing his way across her cheek and down her neck before he took her mouth again.</p><p>Then they fell once more.</p><p>She came apart on a scream halfway through the dive, every nerve in her body igniting with pleasure, with sensation, with the wild exhilaration of dancing with an archangel. Lights exploded behind her eyes, blue and gold and filled with the wicked, wicked glimmer of angel-dust. And all around her, she felt sleek, warm muscle, until she didn\u2019t know where she ended and he began. With me, Archangel. A demand saturated in pleasure.</p><p>But I am not finished with you, Hunter.</p><p>He rose again, skimming so close to the water that she felt the spray cool and wet against her overheated skin.</p><p>Thigh muscles quivering like jelly, she locked her ankles at his lower back, resting her head in the curve of his neck. Too bad. I think I\u2019m dead.</p><p>A laugh, husky and male in a way that shouted sex. It did something to her, that sound, blew air onto the embers of a passion so recently satisfied. Her skin stretched taut in anticipation, and she found herself kissing his neck again, caressing him every way she could. With her mouth, with her fingers, with the most secret parts of her body.</p><p>Elena. His hold tightened. Once more.</p><p>\u201cOnce more.\u201d With that, she locked her mouth to his as they plummeted in a dizzying spiral awash in the erotic gold of angel-dust.</p><p>She was so focused on the male who owned her heart, her soul, that she didn\u2019t see the sea rushing up at them until it was too late. Raphael! she screamed as they hit ... except there was no pain, and she was tumbling, tumbling down with her archangel, the water held at bay by a shield of shimmering light streaked with blue.</p><p>Heart thudding triple-time, she gripped his face. \u201cScaring me out of my wits is not good foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Reaching between them as they came to a lazy stop, he touched the hot, slick bundle of nerves at the apex of her thighs . . . and she threatened to fracture. Clenching her inner muscles, she met those eyes so much bluer than the Atlantic. Move.</p><p>One hand under her butt, the other on her back, the archangel decided to obey an order for once.</p><p>Then there was no more thought.</p><p>Raphael leaned on his forearm the next morning as he lay watching his consort sleep. Exhaustion had her limp, her arms curled around her pillow as she lay on her front. He smiled, running a single finger down the centerline of her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a sound, but it wasn\u2019t a complaint, so he continued to explore.</p><p>Last night ...

He hadn\u2019t meant for her introduction to that most intimate of dances to be so sensually rough, but when she\u2019d ridden every wave with him without flinching, he\u2019d given in to temptation and taken her in a way he\u2019d never have chanced with another woman.</p><p>Because immortal or not, they would\u2019ve been terrified.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A sleepy grumble as she shifted closer to him, until his knee brushed against her body, her wings spreading till one lay across his hip and thighs.</p> <p>He ran a hand over the sleek indigo of her primary covert feathers with proprietary pleasure. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Her hand came to rest on his thigh below the sheets, perilously close to the part of him that had the most unquenchable hunger for her. \u201cCareful, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>A drowsy curve of her lips, but her eyes were very much alert. \u201cSo, you going to tell me what happened last night?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known she\u2019d push. That was who she was. As he\u2019d said, it would have been easier were she malleable\u2014but he\u2019d never have taken her for his consort then. \u201cI told you my mother and I always shared a strong mental bond.\u201d He fought the pull of memory, of a time when Caliane had been exactly that\u2014his mother. \u201cIt seems that bond did survive. She can reach me even through the vestiges of Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Elena stroked her hand over his thigh, anchoring him to the earth, to the present. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe past and the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d A whisper so quiet it was almost not sound. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>A prick of consciousness, of awareness. \u201cMother?\u201d Eyes opening, he found himself standing on a verdant green field, the sky above him the brilliant shade of a blue jay\u2019s wings, the air perfumed with a thousand unnamed flowers.</p><p>He frowned. This place, it was hauntingly familiar . . . right down to the droplets of dew that sparkled like gemstones against the jade green stalks of grass. But his mind, it was playing games with him, refusing to divulge the name of the field where he stood.</p><p>Crouching down, he broke off one of the stalks, touched his finger to the dew.</p><p>A sigh on the wind ... and her fine, delicate feet walking across the grass, the edge of a long white gown flirting with her ankles.</p> <p>His heart stopped beating as he watched her come toward him, an archangel of such piercing beauty that she\u2019d spawned legends and caused empires to fall. Her hair was a waterfall of ebony down her back, thick and wild with silken curls his father had loved to fist in his hands as he kissed her, her eyes a piercing hue that he saw in the mirror every single day of his life.</p><p>Caliane had given him her eyes, her power . . . perhaps her madness.</p><p>But his height he\u2019d gained from his father.</p><p>Rising to his feet, he saw her smile as she came to a halt before him, a woman who barely reached his breastbone. \u201cMy Raphael,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy darling boy. How you\u2019ve grown.\u201d</p><p>He towered above her, but even now, he felt the child. When she put her fingers on his chest, he couldn\u2019t move away, his heart aching with a sense of loss that had followed him through time. \u201cYou broke me on this field.\u201d He\u2019d remembered at last, remembered the blood and the agony. Remembered the sight of her walking away.</p><p>Sorrow in her gaze, the blue turning to midnight. \u201cI was mad, Raphael.\u201d Said with a clarity that reminded him of the stunning power of a song that had once held the world in thrall. \u201cBut I fought for you.\u201d</p><p>He thought of his shattered bones, his body crushed and broken into so many pieces that it had taken a long, long time for him to become whole again. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Raising her hand, she touched her fingers to his jaw in a maternal caress that threatened to send him back to his youth. \u201cThe madness whispered that I should kill you, that you carried within you the potential to transcend my power.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael knew his own strength, but he also knew that the archangel in front of him was millennia older, her abilities unparalleled. \u201cYou are an Ancient, mother. I am yet young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe youngest angel to ever become an archangel.\u201d There was a pride in her tone that cut him to the quick. \u201cI watched over you even as I Slept, my darling boy. And I see a future in which you will fly far higher than either I or Nadiel ever dared to dream.\u201d</p><p>He was her son. He\u2019d mourned who she\u2019d once been even as he\u2019d tried to execute her. It was impossible for him not to step forward and take her slender body into his arms, to bury his face in her hair and inhale the sweet woodsmoke of home. \u201cYou are Sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am Waking.\u201d Damp against his cheek, a mother\u2019s tears as she stroked her hand over his hair. \u201cI sense a vein of mortality in you, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, pulled away, shook his head. Elena. He\u2019d forgotten Elena. How was that possible when she was the most important element of his life? \u201cWhat are you doing to me, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blazed the color at the heart of the sun, so pure it burned. \u201cReminding you of who you are. The son of two archangels. The most powerful child ever born.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he met that brilliant, blinding gaze. \u201cI have made myself. I will never be your creature.\u201d</p><p>The fire flickered with searing blue. \u201cI will not permit you to be hers, either. You are far too magnificent to belong to an immortal with a weak mortal heart.\u201d</p><p>He knew then that Caliane would kill Elena if she could.</p><p>27</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t pretend every hair on her body wasn\u2019t standing up on end by the time Raphael finished, but she had other priorities right now. \u201cYou broke her hold,\u201d she said, knowing he needed to hear it said aloud. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t keep you in that dream or vision or whatever it was.\u201d</p><p>Midnight shadows crossed his face. \u201cIt was difficult\u2014perhaps would\u2019ve been impossible if I hadn\u2019t had you to draw me back. She is my mother, and as such, has known me since I was born. She understands how to circumvent my every shield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did once,\u201d Elena rose to her knees, shoving her hair impatiently off her face, \u201cbut she\u2019s been asleep for over a thousand years. She might\u2019ve known the boy you were, but she doesn\u2019t know the man you\u2019ve become. And she has no concept of the bonds that tie us together.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s expression shifted again, and she knew he was calculating matters with that inhuman logic he sometimes displayed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThat may be her only weakness.\u201d</p><p>Elena had to fight her instinctive negative response to his expression, his words. He\u2019d never be human and to expect it of him was to lie to herself. \u201cDo you need to know her weakness?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe threatened you, Elena.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to say anything else. She knew very well what Raphael would do to protect her\u2014and if her hunter instincts scowled at the idea of being protected, the heart of her understood that to love this male was to accept his need to hold her safe.</p><p>\u201cA lot of women have trouble with their mothers-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s look was priceless. \u201cMy mother is an insane archangel.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed\u2014or perhaps that was hysteria rising to the surface. \u201cShe was. Maybe these bursts of violence were a result of her being in a half-dream state. It may still be that Sleep has cured her\u2014from what you\u2019ve told me, she acted normal in the dream, or as normal as someone of her power and age can be.\u201d</p><p>You do not know how much I wish that to be true.</p><p>\u201cI know it down to the last heartbreaking glimmer of hope,\u201d she whispered, swallowing the knot of emotion in her throat. \u201cEvery day, I wish I could\u2019ve somehow reached through my own mother\u2019s sorrow and convinced her that life was worth living. Every day.\u201d</p><p>Raphael tugged her down into his arms. \u201cYou speak rarely of those events, and yet you call out to her in your nightmares.\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, Elena thought, they were always in the kitchen in the dreams. She was fooled into hope every single time\u2014and then the blood would begin to seep down the walls, across the floor. Her mother always remained trapped in the room, no matter how much Elena begged her to run.</p><p>\u201cI found her,\u201d she said, speaking of a nightmare that continued to leave her trembling in panic in the coldest depths of the night. \u201cI got home from school, and I walked inside the house.\u201d That was when she\u2019d seen it, that single high-heeled shoe lying on its side on the gleaming shine of the checkerboard tiles.</p><p>She should\u2019ve walked back out that same instant, but she\u2019d been happy. Mama hadn\u2019t worn high heels for a long time\u2014the child in her had thought that maybe it meant Marguerite was better now, that maybe she\u2019d have her mother back. The illusion had lasted a few precious seconds.</p><p>\u201cThe shadow,\u201d she said, her breath coming in short, shallow gasps. \u201cOn the wall. I could see it swinging so gently. I didn\u2019t want to look up, didn\u2019t want to see.\u201d Even now, terror pulsed in her blood. \u201cI could feel my heart freeze into a small, hard ball, and then I looked up and it just . . . shattered.\u201d Sharp, vicious shards, they had cut into her, made her bleed. \u201cI kept looking up at her, at the way she ...\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t come, wouldn\u2019t be formed. \u201cThe shadow,\u201d she said instead, \u201cit just kept swinging. The whole time my heart was bleeding out below her, the shadow just kept swinging.\u201d</p><p>Raphael could feel his hunter breaking all over again in his arms, and it was unbearable. \u201cHers was a selfish act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lost two daughters,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cShe was tortured. But so were you. You saw your sisters murdered before your eyes, saw your mother suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because you were a child.\u201d He crushed her to him, wishing he could turn back time, shake Marguerite Deveraux until she came out of the fog of her grief and saw the treasures she was about to throw away. \u201cIt is permissible to be angry with her, Elena. It does not make you disloyal.\u201d</p><p>A ragged sob, so harsh that it sounded torn out of her, before a clenched fist pounded on his chest. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she love us as much as she loved Ari and Belle?\u201d A child\u2019s question. \u201cWhy did she leave us when she saw how Jeffrey was becoming? Why?\u201d Wet against his chest, that fist halting as she whispered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Later, she asked him to spar with her, and he did, letting her work out her anguish, her pain, through hard physical combat. But she was distracted, not fighting at her best. Instead of letting up, he gave no quarter.</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t accept the protection I assign you,\u201d he said when he put her on her back for the second time in as many minutes, \u201cthen you must be better than the best.\u201d</p><p>A snarl that he far preferred over the haunted pain that had crumpled her spirit. \u201cBeating me into the ground isn\u2019t helping matters.\u201d She flowed back to her feet.</p><p>He slammed at her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time, she came at him like a fury, sorrow shifting into the most lethal anger.</p><p>Dancing with her, their blades moving like streaks of white fire, he couldn\u2019t stop the smile of pride from spreading across his face. \u201cMagnificent,\u201d he said as she almost grazed his wing with those short swords of hers.</p><p>Hissing out something under her breath, she sliced out her arm in a move he hadn\u2019t taught her\u2014he had to lunge out of the way or he\u2019d have been nursing an impressive cut in his side. That is more like it. A kiss pressed to her cheek as he disarmed her left hand and moved out of range of her right.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, she used her foot to kick up her lost sword. Then she circled him, much like Venom had a way of doing. She learned, he thought, very, very fast. Now, she made a move he only avoided because he\u2019d sparred with the vampire more than once. Even then, her blade passed a bare quarter of an inch from his nose.</p> <p>But she\u2019d left herself open. He was behind her, his knife held to her throat the next instant. \u201cThat was foolish,\u201d he snapped, furious that she\u2019d let anger drive her into making a move that left her exposed and vulnerable. \u201cYou\u2019re now dead.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, she gripped his wrist. \u201cYou made me angry on purpose.\u201d</p><p>He drew back. \u201cBut you fell into it too far.\u201d</p><p>Elena turned, chest heaving. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d She rubbed her face with one hand. \u201cI won\u2019t make the same mistake again.\u201d</p><p>Raphael gave a short nod. \u201cWe will finish this later. I\u2019m needed at the Tower.\u201d</p> <p>As they walked side by side, their wings brushing, she drew in a long, steadying breath. \u201cAny further intel on where your mother might be?\u201d Picking up her cell phone from where she\u2019d placed it while they were sparring, she saw that she had a text message.</p><p>\u201cNot as yet.\u201d Tense words. \u201cIf we do not rouse her before she is ready, she\u2019ll wake on her own and at full strength.\u201d</p><p>There was no need to spell out what would happen if she awakened as insane as when she lay down to Sleep.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me more about her?\u201d Caliane\u2019s disappearance had marked him as surely as she\u2019d been marked by her own mother\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cThe memories are old, will surface in their own time.\u201d He ran the back of his hand over her cheek. \u201cWhat do you do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to visit the perfumer I mentioned to you earlier.\u201d She had no intention of letting her archangel handle those memories alone when they did rise, but they\u2019d both had a tough morning already, so she let it go for now. \u201cDo you know how difficult it is to track down that particular black orchid? I asked him right after I got back from Boston, but he only just received it.\u201d She held up her cell phone.</p> <p>\u201cAh. You seek the essence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know all the notes, make sure I\u2019m not missing anything,\u201d she said as they cleaned and stowed their weapons in a locker at the back of the house. \u201cArchangel?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were a clear, crystalline blue when he turned to her. \u201cWhat would you have of me, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good-bye kiss.\u201d</p><p>An hour and a half later, Elena walked out of the outwardly disreputable shop that housed the best perfumer in the city\u2014the tiny vial of essence wrapped in multiple layers of cushioning material and packed into a small box\u2014to find that half of New York suddenly had something to do in the Bronx. No one approached her as she walked down the street, but she could hear the whispers gathering like a shock wave behind her.</p><p>This was, she realized all at once, the first instance where she\u2019d spent any extended amount of time on the streets. No wonder everyone was staring. The scrutiny discomfited her, but it was understandable\u2014people needed time to get used to her, and she had to be visible for that to happen. As long as they kept their distance, she wasn\u2019t too fussed.</p><p>However, she hadn\u2019t factored one simple thing into the equation\u2014the awe that kept most individuals from approaching an angel was muted almost to nonexistence in her case. She\u2019d once been mortal, once been just like them. So they followed her, a growing press of humanity. \u201cDamn,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>You will call me. No hesitations, no thinking, no waiting until the last possible moment. If you\u2019re in danger, you will call me.</p> <p>She assessed the situation with her peripheral vision, saw the wonder on those shining faces, and knew no one meant her harm. But there were too many of them. If one tried to touch her wings, so would another and another and another. They\u2019d stampede her to death in their eagerness. Archangel, she said, hoping Raphael would be able to hear her. I need you.</p><p>The wind and the rain against her senses. Where are you, Elena? When she gave him the location, he said, I\u2019m only minutes from you.</p><p>An edgy mix of relief and frustration churned in her abdomen. I\u2019m probably overreacting. This was her home, these were her people\u2014she hated the realization that they both might be lost to her now. Even as that horrible, painful thought passed through her mind, she dropped a knife into her free hand and began to play it over and through her fingers in an apparently absentminded motion.</p><p>The crowd hesitated, fell back a step as light glinted off the steel.</p><p>Good, she thought. They needed to remember that she wasn\u2019t simply a woman with wings. She was hunter-born, could handle vampires twice her size without blinking. The crowd might overpower her, but not before she took down a significant percentage of their number.</p><p>Noting that the walls of humanity had blocked all other traffic on both ends of the street, she walked to stand in the middle . . . and looked up at the sky. And there he was, his wingspan creating a massive shadow as he swept down to land in front of her. \u201cAre you well, Consort?\u201d</p><p>Silence held their audience in thrall, their awe now licked with dread.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only curious.\u201d She saw the danger in his eyes, knew he had the capacity to execute every human on the street. \u201cI should\u2019ve considered it. I just ... forgot that nothing\u2019s the same anymore.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hair lifted in the wind as he put his hands on her hips. Sliding away her knife, she placed one hand on his shoulder, holding the box in her other arm. She expected him to rise, but instead he turned his head to run his gaze over the assembled crowd. From the whimpers and the rapid urge everyone had to disperse, she had a good idea of what they\u2019d glimpsed.</p><p>When Raphael and Elena did lift, it was with a slow, powerful grace meant to stun.</p><p>Only when they were high in the air did she say, \u201cThis is going to sound so ungrateful\u2014but I hate that you had to rescue me.\u201d Her sense of loss was acid in her gut, harsh and corrosive. \u201cI\u2019m not a woman who needs rescue. That\u2019s not who I am.\u201d Not who he\u2019d taken as his consort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Illium\u2014your vertical takeoff training must take priority over all else.\u201d Pragmatic words, his hands warm on her. \u201cOnce you master that, it will be impossible to trap you in such a way.\u201d</p><p>A painful burst of sensation inside her chest. Unable to say anything, she let him see her heart in her eyes. Thank you. Not just for giving her city, her home, back to her . . . but for stilling her hidden terror that he wouldn\u2019t want her anymore.</p><p>The tender ferocity of Elena\u2019s parting kiss imprinted in his skin, Raphael was on his way to the Tower when Dmitri\u2019s mind touched his. Sire, Favashi wishes to speak to you. It was a toneless statement.</p><p>I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.</p><p>The Persian archangel\u2019s face was on the view-screen when he entered, and for the first time, he glimpsed a crack in the serenity of her countenance. \u201cFavashi. Does this concern Neha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She appears busy within her own territory at present.\u201d Favashi\u2019s tone was distracted, her attention clearly on another topic. \u201cWe have a problem, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Unlike some of the others on the Cadre, he\u2019d never underestimated the Archangel of Persia. Though she ruled with a velvet glove, there was still a steel hand within it. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah. His behavior has turned erratic.\u201d</p><p>That was a development he\u2019d never expected. \u201cHow erratic?\u201d Elijah was one of the most stable members of the Cadre.</p><p>\u201cReports are, he\u2019s become violent. That would be no surprise with Charisemnon or Titus, but Elijah?\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned. \u201cHas he harmed Hannah?\u201d Elijah hurting Hannah was as impossible a thought as Raphael laying a hand on Elena. If the archangel had crossed that line, then Caliane had to be even closer to waking than anyone believed\u2014her power, too, was stretching awake. The impact on the rest of the Cadre could be an unintended consequence, her immense abilities not yet under conscious control . . . or it could be an insane archangel\u2019s vicious game.</p><p>\u201cThere are no reports of him touching Hannah,\u201d Favashi said, her elegant voice breaking into his thoughts. \u201cBut all I have are rumors and innuendo. Your sources are better than mine.\u201d</p><p>It was an implied request. \u201cJockeying for power, Favashi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty, Raphael, I enjoy being queen of my territory. It\u2019s large and I am treated as a goddess.\u201d A thick fringe of lashes came down over her soft brown eyes as she shook her head. \u201cMore land would, at present, cause me nothing but problems.\u201d</p><p>Raphael wasn\u2019t certain he believed her, but he gave a small nod. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I hear anything of note about Elijah.\u201d Ending the call, he turned to the vampire who\u2019d stood out of sight in the corner. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she is sweet poison.\u201d Dmitri stepped closer, his face set in brutal lines. \u201cPower is what she is and what she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are hardly an impartial judge when it comes to Favashi.\u201d</p><p>A tic beat in Dmitri\u2019s jaw. \u201cI was a young fool and she played me. But you can\u2019t say I don\u2019t learn my lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman. And apparently you are a great lover.\u201d</p><p>The vampire shot him a dark glance. \u201cI believe your hunter is rubbing off on you. It is not a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Raphael felt his lips curve. \u201cFind out if any of Jason\u2019s people know what\u2019s happening with Elijah.\u201d Raphael intended to talk to the other archangel himself, but honorable as he seemed, Elijah was Cadre, well tutored in the art of deception.</p><p>Dmitri was already pulling out his cell phone. \u201cFavashi . . . I once saw her rip a vampire\u2019s still-beating heart out of his chest and hold it in front of him until he died because the male dared disobey an order. She\u2019s no vulnerable princess, for all she likes to use that image to her advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire challenged her power, Dmitri. You know as well as I that she could not let it go.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s phone rang at that moment, and he brought it to his ear. Like all men, the leader of his Seven had a past. Even Raphael did not know everything of what had passed between Favashi and the vampire just over five hundred years ago, centuries before Favashi became Cadre.</p><p>What he did know was that Dmitri had come to him with a request that he be released from Raphael\u2019s service. Raphael, a new archangel himself, hadn\u2019t been able to afford to lose him at that stage and had asked the male to wait another year. He had not decreed it so\u2014Dmitri had earned what he asked for\u2014but the vampire had been agreeable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFavashi,\u201d he\u2019d said with a smile that had been rare before he met the Persian angel, \u201cis too sweet to cast curses on your name, but I\u2019ve been told that the instant the year is over, I am hers.\u201d</p><p>Yet when that time came, Dmitri\u2019s smile had long disappeared and aside from a single discussion where Raphael had asked Dmitri if he wished to leave, and Dmitri had replied with a curt \u201cno,\u201d they\u2019d never spoken of it again.</p><p>Now, the vampire finished his conversation and closed the cell phone. \u201cWe may have a situation\u2014Elijah was spotted flying into your territory. He is currently over Georgia.\u201d</p><p>28</p> <p>Coming on the heels of Favashi\u2019s words, there could be only one response. Raphael contacted Nazarach and asked him to intercept the other archangel, invite Elijah to his home in Atlanta. \u201cI will join you.\u201d While he could and had flown such distances with ease, he decided to conserve his power in case Elijah had more than conversation in mind. \u201cTell Venom to prepare the plane,\u201d he said to Dmitri after hanging up.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDmitri.\u201d He waited until the vampire turned, to say, \u201cYou will watch over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a vow. I won\u2019t break it.\u201d But Dmitri\u2019s expression said he still wasn\u2019t convinced\u2014not when it had become clear after Beijing that Raphael\u2019s bond with Elena had somehow made him weaker. He healed slower, was easier to wound. Such a flaw could be deadly for an archangel.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Raphael said to his second, \u201can archangel needs a weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Dmitri shook his head. \u201cNot if he is to survive the Cadre.\u201d</p><p>Sara was chatting with another hunter when Elena, the box containing the essence held to her side, poked her head around the open door of the Guild Director\u2019s office. \u201cAsh!\u201d</p><p>The dark-eyed hunter looked up, a smile lighting up that face that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place on the silver screen. \u201cHey, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s safe for you to venture out of the Cellars?\u201d</p><p>Long jean-clad legs sprawled out in front of her, Ashwini buffed her nails on her white T-shirt. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>Across the desk, Sara made an inelegant sound. \u201cThey\u2019re flirting.\u201d</p> <p>Elena\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cNo.\u201d She turned to Ashwini. \u201cYou and Janvier? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanvier, who?\u201d An angelic look that was so fake Elena burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cDid you really do what I think you did to him?\u201d she asked, any remaining shreds of her earlier frustrated distress drifting away. Because this place, these people, they were hers, too.</p><p>Ashwini\u2019s lips curved into a feral grin. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is that damn vamp will think twice about messing with me now.\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s phone rang at that moment. As she took the call, Ashwini lowered her voice and said, \u201cThose wings are wicked awesome.\u201d She wiggled her fingers. \u201cCan I touch, or is that too weird?\u201d</p><p>Elena knew Ashwini wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said no\u2014the other hunter had her own gifts, carried her own nightmares. \u201cQuick touch of the primaries is okay.\u201d</p><p>Ashwini ran a gentle finger over the large feathers of white-gold at the edges of her wings. \u201cWow. They\u2019re alive\u2014warm. I guess I never really thought about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how much I have to learn,\u201d Elena said as Sara hung up.</p> <p>\u201cAsh,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI have a job for you.\u201d A slow smile.</p><p>Ashwini\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNo effing way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d Sara\u2019s eyes were dancing. \u201cSeems like Janvier\u2019s got himself in trouble again. Florida\u2014somewhere in the Everglades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are swamps there.\u201d Ashwini gritted her teeth. \u201cI hate swamps. He knows I hate swamps. That\u2019s it\u2014I\u2019m going to kill him this time. I don\u2019t care if I lose my bonus.\u201d Snatching the piece of paper Sara was holding out, she stalked out of the room.</p><p>Elena grinned. \u201cYou know that\u2019s just what I needed after the morning I\u2019ve had.\u201d She told Sara what had happened in the Bronx.</p><p>Her best friend flapped a hand. \u201cThe fascination won\u2019t last, Ellie. You\u2019re not pretty enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, not my fault you hang around with gorgeous man-flesh.\u201d A more solemn expression. \u201cNo matter what, you\u2019ve got every hunter in the Guild behind you. Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Raphael was her rock, but Sara and the Guild, Elena thought, were the foundation on which she\u2019d built her adult life, found her footing. \u201cHow did you get to be so wise and all-knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope Zoe thinks the same when she\u2019s fifteen and wants to date some moronic senior.\u201d Sara raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou want to talk about something else, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have Vivek\u2019s blood stored?\u201d The Guild did that for its hunters, for use in a medical emergency\u2014however, Vivek wasn\u2019t an active hunter.</p><p>Sara gave her a penetrating look. \u201cNo, but he\u2019s up for his yearly physical next month.\u201d A pause. \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get it.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, having successfully navigated the obstacle course of the subterranean Cellars below the Guild\u2014and Vivek\u2019s snippiness that she hadn\u2019t visited earlier\u2014Elena walked into the scent chamber.</p><p>Empty of furniture, the room was painted a stark white. It was also about the size of a shoebox. Gritting her teeth against the edge of claustrophobia, she drew in a breath to establish that the room was free of outside scents\u2014other than those on Elena herself\u2014before unstopping the bottle of liquid night that had cost her a considerable chunk of change.</p><p>Lush, sensual, rich . . . addictive.</p><p>She blinked, took a mental step back, tried again.</p><p>Dark, hidden notes of sunlight . . . of a very feminine compulsion. Not dangerous to a woman.</p><p>An intricate scent, Elena thought, fitting for an archangel.</p><p>But, while she was now certain she\u2019d detected this exact combination of notes on the swinging bodies on the bridge and on the girl with the forget-me-not dress, it wasn\u2019t quite what had hit her above the Hudson, or what she\u2019d sensed in the bedroom when Caliane had whispered her son\u2019s name.</p><p>Her brow furrowed.</p><p>It was highly possible, she admitted, that her memory was at fault, given that her adrenaline had been through the roof on both of those latter occasions. The other fact was that both the girl\u2019s mutilated form and the vampires on the bridge had been exposed to the elements\u2014a more subtle note could\u2019ve been lost long before Elena arrived on the scene.</p><p>Still ...</p><p>Elijah was standing by the river that ran behind the plantation house from where Nazarach controlled Atlanta when Raphael arrived. Landing a short distance away, he moved through the shade of the leafy trees that lined the bank, and to the edge of the quiet current. The fingers of a weeping willow touched the clarity of it on the other side, and he could hear the calls of the birds hidden in the foliage.</p><p>It was a beautiful place, and it spoke to none of the violence that Nazarach had done. Each angel had his own way of ruling. Nazarach used fear. But it wasn\u2019t the amber-winged angel Raphael had come to see. \u201cWhy are you in my territory, Elijah?\u201d</p><p>The archangel who ruled South America looked up, his golden brown eyes haunted, his hair disordered as if he\u2019d been thrusting his hands through it. \u201cI come to ask you for sanctuary, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for you.\u201d Elijah was older than Raphael, powerful in his own right.</p><p>The other male looked unseeing into the water, his wings trailing on the mossy earth. \u201cFor Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you will harm her?\u201d Raphael had faced the same fear after he\u2019d executed Ignatius, taken Elena so roughly.</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt her,\u201d Elijah said in a hollow voice, \u201cbut I am not always myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rage, red across your vision?\u201d</p><p>Elijah jerked up his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve felt it?\u201d</p><p>Raphael considered his answer as the heavy-limbed trees above them, around them, sighed into the silence. This could well be an act, Elijah probing for a weakness. But the South American archangel was also the one who had always stood behind Raphael in the Cadre, the one who had told him he had the potential to lead. \u201cYes, but not in the past week.\u201d He examined Elijah\u2019s tortured face. \u201cHas it touched you in that time?\u201d</p><p>A quick negative shake of that golden head that had inspired sculptors and played muse to poets. \u201cBut once was enough. I do not trust myself\u2014I acted with a cruelty that will haunt me for centuries to come. The vampires in question survived only because of Hannah\u2019s intervention.\u201d Elijah fisted his hands. \u201cI could\u2019ve hurt her with the same violence.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had learned to spot and exploit the chinks in an opponent\u2019s armor long ago. He\u2019d had to, to survive the Cadre. But he\u2019d also known Dmitri for almost a thousand years, understood something of friendship. \u201cYet you did not, Elijah. That is the line. You did not cross it.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was silent for a long time, the water passing with serene patience over pebble and rock as they stood unmoving on the riverbank. Across from them, the fronds of the weeping willow swayed in a gentle motion, pulled by the tug of the water. But the birds had gone silent, and suddenly the world was a much darker place.</p><p>\u201cIf she can do this to us in her Sleep, Raphael,\u201d Elijah said at last, \u201cwhat will she do when she wakes?\u201d</p><p>Having showered and changed after training with Illium\u2014 every one of the drills geared to give her the strength to achieve a vertical takeoff\u2014Elena walked into the library where Montgomery had laid out an informal dinner, and came to a complete halt. \u201cAodhan.\u201d He stood next to the window, looking out over the storm lashing Manhattan once more. The dark beyond threw the piercing brilliance of him into cutting focus.</p><p>The fact was, Aodhan would never, ever blend in, not among angelkind and certainly not in the mortal world. His eyes were shattered from the pupil outward in shards of vivid green and translucent blue, his wings fractured light, his hair glittering strands encrusted with diamonds. The whole of it should\u2019ve made him appear a cold being of marble and ice, but his skin held an undertone of gold, warm and inviting.</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d He inclined his head in a slight bow, his voice still unfamiliar, she\u2019d heard it so infrequently.</p><p>\u201cRaphael should be here soon.\u201d Walking to the table, she poured herself a steaming cup of coffee\u2014wine would put her to sleep after the workout she\u2019d had. \u201cHe returned from Atlanta ten minutes ago.\u201d From the territory of an angel who would\u2019ve given Elena the creeps even if Ashwini hadn\u2019t warned her before she ever met him. Screams, Ash had said of Nazarach\u2019s home, the walls are full of screams.</p><p>Aodhan said nothing, simply turned to look at the rain-drenched dark once more, a remoteness to him that she knew was deliberate. The angel fascinated her. He was akin to some great work of art, something you admired without understanding in truth. Except . . . there was far more to him. Pain, suffering, and a hurt that had made him withdraw into himself like the most wounded of animals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elena didn\u2019t know the details of what had been done to him, but she knew how it felt to hurt that bad. Putting down her coffee, she poured a glass of wine. \u201cAodhan.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them to take the wineglass, his wings tight to his back. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Ensuring she didn\u2019t touch him, she grabbed a seat at the table and began to slap together a sandwich. Montgomery would surely be horrified at the use to which she was putting the dishes on the table, but a good, hearty sandwich sounded perfect at that moment. She made one for Raphael, too, just to see the look on his face.</p><p>After almost a minute of silence, Aodhan moved to take the chair across from hers, his wings draping gracefully over the back designed for angels. He didn\u2019t eat but drank the wine, and when she looked up, she found those strange, beautiful eyes on her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an artist,\u201d she said, wondering what he saw. \u201cDid you notice my vase in the front hall?\u201d</p><p>A spark of interest. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing the bite she\u2019d taken, Elena said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d with a straight face. \u201cMontgomery would only steal it back.\u201d</p><p>Aodhan tilted his head a few degrees to the side, as if he was trying to understand her. But he didn\u2019t say anything, and she decided not to tease him anymore. He wasn\u2019t Illium, who\u2019d fire back something wicked. Aodhan needed more careful handling\u2014which wasn\u2019t to say he wasn\u2019t as lethal. She\u2019d seen him fight, knew he could be as dangerous as the two blades he wore in parallel sheaths on his back\u2014there was a reason he was part of Raphael\u2019s Seven. But he was broken, too, on the deepest of levels.</p><p>A rustle of wings at her back, the scent of the sea lapping against her senses. \u201cHello, Archangel.\u201d That was a quick shower.</p> <p>There was no temptation to linger. A firm touch along the upper curve of her wing, making her entire body tingle. In front of her, Aodhan rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have for me, Aodhan?\u201d Nodding at the other angel to sit, Raphael took his own place. Lips kicking up at the corners when he saw what she\u2019d put on his plate, he said, \u201cI do not think this is what Montgomery had in mind for the bread rolls.\u201d But he took a bite.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made with love,\u201d she quipped, saw Aodhan\u2019s eyes flicker with . . . surprise?</p><p>His voice, however, betrayed nothing. \u201cAs you know, the entire world has been wracked by rain and wind and snow. The Far East suffered considerable damage from floods, typhoons, and quakes. Japan, too, was hit ... except for one region that has remained untouched by even a quake that shook the rest of the island.\u201d</p><p>Hairs rising on her nape, Elena put down her empty coffee cup as Raphael abandoned his meal and stood. \u201cNo disturbances at all?\u201d he said, moving to stand by the unlit fireplace.</p> <p>\u201cNone.\u201d Aodhan rose, too, those wings of light and shattered glass unfolding a little, as if he\u2019d grown comfortable enough to trust that they wouldn\u2019t make any attempts to touch him.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA specific area within a mountainous prefecture called Kagoshima.\u201d</p><p>Getting up herself, Elena moved to lean against one of the bookshelves, so she could more easily talk to both men, though her next words were directed at Raphael. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to head there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d Face expressionless, he glanced toward the storm-dark window. \u201cNow that we may have narrowed the search to such a specific locale, I may be able to sense her place of Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Elena made her next question private. What will you do when you find her?</p><p>What I must.</p><p>Her chest grew tight at the ice in those words\u2014because she knew what lay beneath. She\u2019d felt the power of his heart, knew how much he\u2019d bleed if it turned out Caliane was still mad. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p> <p>Midnight blue pierced her. \u201cYou have responsibilities here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour people are watching over my family, and as for any possible repeat of Boston\u2014better to go to the source of the problem and sort it out.\u201d She couldn\u2019t take the task from him, didn\u2019t have the power to kill an archangel, but she could, would, stand by him.</p><p>\u201cShe is worse than Uram, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Her gut went taut, her heart seizing into a hard, fast rhythm. The bloodborn archangel, his body riddled with poison, had killed hundreds, would\u2019ve slaughtered thousands more if they hadn\u2019t halted his rampage. \u201cWe stopped him,\u201d she said, speaking to herself as well as to him, \u201cand we\u2019re stronger than we were then.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps. He turned to Aodhan before she could question him on that ambivalent assessment. \u201cSpeak to Dmitri. Organize the transport. We\u2019ll fly out with the first break in the storm.\u201d</p><p>Waiting only until Aodhan had left the library, Elena closed the distance between them. \u201cRaphael,\u201d she said, stomach twisted into painful knots, \u201cyour strength ... are you still more susceptible to injury, less quick to recover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Guilt clamped steel claws around her. It was her. Somehow, she\u2019d done this to him. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ability to heal others continues to grow, Guild Hunter. It is not a bad trade.\u201d</p><p>Not in the Cadre. Not if he was going to survive. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>A small curve to his lips, an immortal\u2019s dangerous amusement. \u201cIt matters little, Elena. Even were I at the peak of my strength, my mother would be a lethal adversary. She may well be a hundred times more powerful than Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>Frigid cold in her veins. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here, Elena. This is no hunt for an immortal barely-Made.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. But she also knew something else. \u201cLogic doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this, Archangel. To ask me to sit in safety while you walk into a nightmare. No.\u201d A shake of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not the way I\u2019m built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave you behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer.\u201d She would simply follow.</p><p>Brushing back her hair with one hand, he curved his lips in the faintest of smiles. \u201cAre you sure you do not wish to be more like Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask nicely, I might be up for learning some calligraphy.\u201d But the laughter faded all too soon. \u201cWill the others in the Cadre help you against her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah and Favashi, yes, but as to the others\u2014uncertain. Astaad\u2019s behavior has remained erratic, Michaela is no longer answering anyone, and I\u2019ve just had word that Titus and Charisemnon are both showing violent outbursts of temper. Favashi says Neha is stable, but the Queen of Poisons has the ability to strike without warning.\u201d His next words were in her mind. My mother is the monster that scares other monsters.</p><p>29</p><p>The storm continued to be a wild squall the next morning but was forecast to pass within two hours. \u201cI need to go speak to Evelyn,\u201d Elena said as they landed on the Tower roof, the rain driving their clothing into their skin. Raphael could\u2019ve protected them using his abilities, but she\u2019d argued for him to conserve as much of his strength as possible for the battle that might well await.</p><p>\u201cYour sister lives at the family home,\u201d he said, raising his wings to shelter her from the needlelike stabs of rain. \u201cIt is inevitable you\u2019ll meet your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, pitching her voice so it would carry above the pounding sound of the water hitting the metal and concrete of Manhattan.</p><p>\u201cYou will not go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to.\u201d Her father would try to crush and demoralize her, and she didn\u2019t want her archangel to see her hurt and broken.</p><p>Raphael caught the pain in his consort\u2019s eyes before she could hide it, felt his anger turn into an unsheathed blade. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Elena pressed her hand against his chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt him when he hurts me,\u201d she said with blunt honesty, blinking the rain from her lashes. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to stop yourself. And no matter everything else, he\u2019s still my father.\u201d</p><p>Raphael closed his hand around the side of her head, tangling his fingers in the wet silk of her hair. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve your protection.\u201d Jeffrey deserved nothing from his oldest living daughter but her contempt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Elena acknowledged, leaning into his touch. \u201cBut he\u2019s also Beth, Evelyn, and Amethyst\u2019s father\u2014and they seem to love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask the impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I ask for what I need.\u201d She held her ground where even other angels would\u2019ve backed down. \u201cWhat I need, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>He had allowed her freedom beyond anything he might\u2019ve imagined, but this he would not do. \u201cI will come with you.\u201d He gripped her chin when she would\u2019ve argued. \u201cI will not land. That is the only concession I\u2019m willing to make.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms, her eyes silver in the storm-light. \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a concession, but we don\u2019t have time to argue.\u201d</p><p>He spoke into her mind as they flew out into the tempest of wind and rain once more. Hear this, Elena\u2014if he crosses the line, I will break him. I do not have that much patience.</p><p>Less than fifteen minutes later, and very aware of Raphael sweeping across the sky above, Elena turned and walked up the steps to her father\u2019s house. Again, it wasn\u2019t a maid who opened the door. \u201cGwendolyn,\u201d she said, shaking off the rain from her wings. \u201cI just came to have a chat with Eve before I head out of the city.\u201d She didn\u2019t want her youngest sister to believe she\u2019d been forgotten. It was a hurt she\u2019d never inflict on anyone of her own.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Gwendolyn said, concern on that discreetly made-up face. \u201cYou must be so cold.\u201d</p><p>Elena stood dripping in the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment.\u201d Gwendolyn disappeared and returned with a towel, handing it to her.</p><p>Elena wiped off her face and did the best she could to squeeze the water out of her ponytail. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in the hallway\u2014don\u2019t want to ruin your carpet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in the midst of patting down the parts of her wings she could reach, Elena became aware that Gwendolyn was staring at her. \u201cI must look a sight,\u201d she said with a laugh, expecting a polite response.</p><p>What she got was nothing she could\u2019ve predicted.</p><p>\u201cI always wondered,\u201d the other woman said in a husky voice, \u201cwhat was so wonderful about her that he couldn\u2019t let go, that he had to keep a mistress who reminded him of her.\u201d</p><p>Elena felt the ground open up beneath her feet. She did not want to be having this conversation with her father\u2019s second wife. \u201cGw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it now,\u201d Gwendolyn continued, deep white grooves around her mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s something in you, something she must\u2019ve given you\u2014and it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never have. That\u2019s why he married me.\u201d</p><p>Acutely uncomfortable, Elena nonetheless couldn\u2019t just stand by in the face of such raw pain. \u201cYou know how he reacted when I wanted to attend Guild Academy.\u201d It was her enrolling at the Academy without his permission, permission he\u2019d never have given, that had led to the fight in which he\u2019d called her an \u201cabomination\u201d before throwning her out of his life. \u201cYet he allows Eve to go. That\u2019s because of you\u2014he listens to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gwendolyn hugged herself, tiny lines flaring out at the corners of her eyes. \u201cThe worst thing is\u2014I love him. I always have.\u201d Turning, she began to walk down the hallway. \u201cHe\u2019s in the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I just want to talk to Eve.\u201d</p><p>The slender woman tucked a wing of raven hair behind her ear as she glanced back. \u201cI\u2019ll bring her down, but you can\u2019t avoid speaking to him, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Maybe not, but she could delay it as long as possible. So she waited for Eve to come down and spent a good half an hour with her sister, answering the questions on hunting that Eve had built up since their last meeting\u2014and letting her know she could call Elena anytime.</p> <p>Afterward, they spoke of other, more painful things.</p><p>\u201cI miss Betsy,\u201d Evelyn whispered, her hand a rigid little fist. \u201cShe was my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s eyes shone wet as she threw herself into Elena\u2019s arms, seeming far younger than her years, the acknowledged baby of the family. \u201cMom thinks I don\u2019t know, but I do. We looked the same. Everyone said so.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t know what to say, how to heal that hurt, so she just held Evelyn tight and rocked her until the tears passed. \u201cShh, sweetheart. I don\u2019t think Betsy would\u2019ve wanted you to make yourself sick like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was so nice, Ellie.\u201d A gulping sob. \u201cI miss her every day.\u201d</p><p>Elena understood to the deepest core of her soul. She missed Ari and Belle and Marguerite every second of every day. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about her?\u201d</p><p>It took a while for Evelyn to find the words past her tears, but when she did, it was a dam breaking open. She spoke not only about Betsy, but about Celia, too, the girl who had \u201cplayed the clarinet the best out of everyone\u201d and who hadn\u2019t laughed when Eve made a mistake during class.</p><p>Elena sat still and listened, coming to the sobering realization that Eve hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone else about this, damming up her pain. She could understand why when it came to Jeffrey, but Gwendolyn\u2019s love for her daughters was palpable. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk to your mom about Betsy and Celia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sad all the time anyway.\u201d Wise words from a child with solemn gray eyes. \u201cDo you mind if I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p> <p>A direct look, clear of tears now. \u201cI used to think you must be mean, and that\u2019s why Father didn\u2019t ever invite you to stay with us.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s heart stabbed with pain. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re nice.\u201d A fierce hug from those solid little arms. \u201cYou can come stay at my house when I have one.\u201d It was whispered in her ear.</p><p>Elena held the unexpected emotional gift to her heart a few minutes later as she pushed through the door to her father\u2019s study without knocking. She found him standing at the open French doors, staring out into the rain. Not knowing why she didn\u2019t turn around and leave, she closed the door behind herself and crossed the room to stand against the opposite doorjamb, three feet of space between them.</p><p>Outside, the rain fell down in silver sheets, blotting out the world. She didn\u2019t know if it was the conversation she\u2019d had with Gwendolyn or something else, but she found her lips parting. \u201cMama loved the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, ch\u00e9rie, dance with your mama.\u201d</p><p>The damp, squishy feel of earth between her feet, her chest bursting with giggles as she ran outside with Beth by her side. \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Laughter, sweet and carefree as Marguerite twirled in the rain, her skirts flying out around her in an unruliness of color.</p> <p>\u201cMama. Pretty.\u201d Beth\u2019s soft voice, her hand curling into Elena\u2019s as they jumped in the puddles around their mother\u2019s spinning figure.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was clipped. \u201cShe was happy in the rain, but she couldn\u2019t survive the storm.\u201d</p><p>Stunned that Jeffrey had actually replied, she didn\u2019t know what to do, what to say. She found herself rubbing a fisted hand over her chest, as if she could brush away the years-old hurt. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t strong. Not like you.\u201d Marguerite had been the light and the laughter, the wildfire in their life.</p><p>A bitter laugh. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have needed to be if I\u2019d been there that day.\u201d</p><p>This conversation wasn\u2019t going as she\u2019d predicted, and she felt scared, lost, a child again. Gripping at the doorjamb, she thought back to that fateful day when everything had fractured, remembered that her daddy had been missing. \u201cYou went to pick Beth up from her sleepover.\u201d She\u2019d always been grateful for the kindness of fate that meant her sister had been spared the butcher\u2019s attention.</p><p>A cold gray glance from behind those clear spectacles. \u201cI had a fight with Marguerite, went off to clear my head, picked your sister up later than I should have.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s whole world began to spin.</p><p>\u201cWe fought because I thought she was too flighty. I wanted her to be a businessman\u2019s wife ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she was a butterfly,\u201d Elena whispered, knowing that in spite of his harsh words, her father had loved his first wife, loved her in a way that he\u2019d never again loved anyone else.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, this cake looks delicious.\u201d</p><p>Marguerite laughing and tugging on Jeffrey\u2019s sedate tie to pull him down for a passionate kiss. \u201cThe cake looks atrocious and you know it, mon mari.\u201d</p><p>A smile that turned her father into the most handsome man in the world. \u201cAh, but the cook is definitely delicious.\u201d</p><p>Even as the fragment of memory tumbled unbidden into her mind from some secret hiding place, Jeffrey straightened, thrusting his hands into the pockets of his suit pants. She knew the moment was gone before he spoke. \u201cHave you come to tell me that more of your new friends will be coming to harm your sisters?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cThey\u2019re under constant protection.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure word gets out that you\u2019re not a welcome member of this family.\u201d</p><p>It was a good precaution, but it also burned like a poker searing through her heart. \u201cAll right.\u201d Her voice caught, but she didn\u2019t let it break, refusing to crumble in front of this man who couldn\u2019t be the same one who\u2019d held her hand in that hospital morgue almost two decades in the past. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure any meetings I have with Eve are at the Guild from now on. No reason for anyone to question my presence there.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey said nothing.</p><p>Turning, Elena went to leave.</p><p>\u201cElieanora.\u201d</p><p>She froze with her hand on the doorknob. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all my children, you have always been the most like me.\u201d</p><p>Repudiating the thought with every part of her, she walked out of the house without looking back. Raphael was there to pull her up into the sky until she\u2019d gained enough altitude to fly. And fly they did, as she tried to bury her father\u2019s words deep under a mountain of truth.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>I\u2019m nothing like him! I would never do to my child what he did to his.</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t immediately agree, and his words, when they came, were not what she wanted to hear. You are both survivors, Elena. You chose different methods to do it, but you both did it.</p><p>Her lower lip quivered, and she was so frustrated at the sign of weakness that she bit down hard enough to draw blood. He survived by destroying all memory of our family. I hold them here. She slammed a fist to her heart, blinking the rain out of her eyes.</p><p>I am not your father\u2019s champion. I would kill him if you would only not hate me afterward, but the fact of his mistress, it argues against your belief.</p><p>Dashing away more of the rain . . . and realizing the salty droplets weren\u2019t falling from the sky after all, Elena thought of the poor woman Uram had brutalized in his rampage through New York. That light blond hair and golden skin, it had been a pale imitation of her mother\u2019s butterfly beauty ... but an imitation nonetheless. I can\u2019t, she said, a painful lump in the center of her chest, I can\u2019t see him that way.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the Tower, and Raphael waited to speak until they\u2019d landed. Taking her into his arms, wings raised to protect her from the driving rain once more, he spoke against her ear. \u201cYou may be Jeffrey\u2019s daughter, but you are also Marguerite\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Elena clutched at his back, her fingers digging into him as she buried her face against his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d she whispered, almost hoping he wouldn\u2019t hear her above the storm. \u201cI hate him for what he is . . . but at least he stuck around.\u201d</p><p>A lonely red high-heeled shoe on the cold black-and-white tile. A thin shadow swinging against the wall of the Big House. Those were her last memories of her mother. \u201cAt least he didn\u2019t give up when it got too fucking hard. It was hard for all of us! But she left; she chose to leave!\u201d</p><p>Her archangel said nothing, simply enfolded her in the circle of his arms and the protection of his wings as the storm raged with relentless fury around them.</p><p>Raphael knew his hunter needed time, but he couldn\u2019t give it to her, not today. We must go, Elena, he said too soon. The sky is beginning to clear.</p><p>A nod against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Archangel. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>No, he thought, she wasn\u2019t. But she would survive, as she\u2019d survived the losses of her childhood, Uram\u2019s evil, the staggering change from mortal to immortal. Come.</p><p>The flight over the Hudson was relatively quick, the wind no longer against them. Once there and in dry clothes, Elena said, \u201cI\u2019ll see if my hunter friends in Japan were able to dig up any more intel.\u201d</p><p>While she did that, Raphael spoke to the leader of his Seven in the library. \u201cDo you foresee any problems in my absence?\u201d Lijuan wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d noticed that he\u2019d become more vulnerable to injury\u2014it might well be the incentive another angel needed to attempt conquest.</p><p>Dmitri shook his head. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m here will deter anyone who might have ideas. They know I\u2019m no new-Made vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is an attack, go for the kill.\u201d Only the most ruthless will would keep the city safe. \u201cI\u2019m leaving Venom with you, with Jason ready to fly in if necessary, while Galen holds the Refuge territory. Illium comes with me, and Naasir is already in Tokyo.\u201d The vampire would meet them in Kagoshima.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aodhan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending him back to the Refuge.\u201d The angel had already pinpointed Caliane\u2019s possible location on a satellite map. \u201cI don\u2019t want Galen alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t trust the others in the Cadre not to strike at him through eliminating one of his Seven.</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve been my choice as well,\u201d Dmitri said. \u201cOther than Galen, Aodhan is the one most used to handling your affairs in the Refuge.\u201d The vampire turned a fraction as Elena walked into the room, and Raphael knew he\u2019d likely curled out a tendril of scent in an effort to get a rise from her. About to tell Dmitri that today was not the time, he saw Elena\u2019s lips curve.</p><p>\u201cThat hard up for a date, Dmitri darling?\u201d she purred. \u201cI have a number you can call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dmitri\u2019s eyes narrowed, and at that instant, there was nothing of the sophisticated male who was Raphael\u2019s second. Instead, it was the warrior honed in fire who spoke. \u201cYou look weak.\u201d It was a condemnation. \u201cYou\u2019re in no shape to go into battle beside Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri, take care. A soft warning\u2014Raphael allowed Dmitri to push Elena, because the inescapable fact was, Elena needed to be able to hold her own against vampires and angels alike. Dmitri was the perfect testing ground. But there were some lines he would not allow even Dmitri to cross. It is my consort to whom you speak.</p><p>Jaw set, Dmitri parted his lips to reply, but Elena beat him to it. \u201cI might look like shit, but I\u2019m feeling plenty blood-thirsty.\u201d Her voice was a razor. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to demonstrate if you\u2019d like to step outside for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not damage the Sire\u2019s consort.\u201d Arctic politeness.</p> <p>Elena put fisted hands on her hips, cheeks filling with color. \u201cRaphael, tell him you won\u2019t do anything to him if I get \u2018damaged.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a lie, Elena. I would tear out his throat.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s smile was loaded with provocation. \u201cToo bad, I guess. You\u2019ll have to wait for my touch another day.\u201d</p><p>Elena glared at both of them. \u201cNo wonder the two of you get along. I\u2019m going to go finish my calls\u2014I just wanted to let you know that a hunter who was in that part of Kagoshima a week ago said he got the creeps the entire time he was there. As if something was telling him to leave or else.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met the gaze of the leader of his Seven after Elena left. \u201cYou will go too far one day.\u201d Dmitri had proven his loyalty, but Elena was Raphael\u2019s heart. There was no contest.</p> <p>The vampire shrugged. \u201cShe fights better when she\u2019s angry than when she\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>The fact that you enjoy baiting her had nothing to do with it?</p><p>\u201cSide benefit.\u201d Dmitri\u2019s smile faded the next second. \u201cSire, if your mother wakes, what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Raphael understood what his second was asking. \u201cIf she wakes and she is as before, there will be nothing anyone can do.\u201d</p><p>30</p><p>The last time Elena had set foot in Japan, it had been on the trail of an investment executive\u2014a vampire who\u2019d decided that having served ten years of his hundred-year Contract, he\u2019d now live a life of leisure using the money he\u2019d siphoned from the accounts of his more trusting vampiric clients.</p> <p>The angel who held the Contract had been \u201cseverely angered\u201d by the fact that not only had the vampire broken the agreement, but that he\u2019d used his position in the angel\u2019s employ to swindle others. Elena had been given a \u201ckill if unable to retrieve\u201d order, but she\u2019d brought the idiot back to his angel alive if petrified.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Guild Hunter,\u201d the angel had said in a calm tone that held pure death when she delivered the package. \u201cI will take care of the punishment.\u201d</p><p>Elena had pitied the vampire, but the man had dug his own grave when he\u2019d stolen that money. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead, you know,\u201d she said to Illium\u2014who stood by her shoulder, listening to the story of the hunt. The fourth member of their party, Naasir, had stayed behind at a small settlement about an hour\u2019s flight from here, hoping to mine further information from the locals. \u201cHis angel preferred to punish him in other ways.\u201d</p><p>Illium\u2019s face was clean and beautiful in the breeze that swept across the mountaintop where they stood, the blue-tipped black strands of his hair silken against his skin. \u201cSometimes, death is too merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I felt sorry for him anyway. It was a white-collar crime.\u201d</p><p>Illium gave her an odd look. \u201cIn the human world, such crimes are lightly punished, though they harm hundreds, leading some to choose death out of despair, while the man who beats a single person is considered the worse criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She stared out at the endless spread of mountain and forest in front of her. \u201cI never thought of it that way.\u201d Frowning, she realized the dark green of the forest wasn\u2019t totally uninhabited\u2014she could just glimpse the distinctively tiled roof of what might have been a temple.</p><p>Raphael? She tried to keep the worry out of her mental question. Raphael had landed with her and Illium, told them to wait while he did a preliminary survey, then disappeared into the clouds. That had been over fifteen minutes ago, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t sense the familiar rain of his scent. Archangel?</p> <p>A glint of gold in the clear blue sky. Shading her eyes, she looked up and felt her heart sigh. Hey, what\u2019s with the silent treatment?</p><p>Still no response. Deciding to hold her peace, she watched with aching wonder as he made his way down toward the canopy\u2014his movements powerful, precise, making the act of flying appear effortless. \u201cHe\u2019s the most magnificent male I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The words just spilled out.</p><p>\u201cYou wound me, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved, but she didn\u2019t take her eyes off Raphael as he circled around the temple before turning to head back to them. \u201cAh, but you are surely the prettiest.\u201d All eyes of gold and wings of blue, Illium should have been too beautiful, and sometimes she thought he was. What woman would dare walk beside him?</p><p>\u201cPrettier than Ransom?\u201d His wing brushed hers as he shifted to nudge at her shoulder with his own.</p><p>\u201cWell now, depends if a woman likes eyes the color of ancient Venetian coins, or hair that\u2019s a sheet of ebony silk.\u201d She razzed Ransom about his hair, but it really was gorgeous.</p><p>A wash of wind against her face as Raphael backwinged to a landing in front of her. \u201cYou prefer the crashing hue of the sea, do you not, Elena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard that, did you?\u201d But she wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you reply when I was talking to you?\u201d She tapped her head to make sure he understood.</p><p>His expression grew watchful. \u201cI heard nothing.\u201d Glancing at Illium, he said, \u201cDid you attempt contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, Sire. I thought you preoccupied when you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d Illium\u2019s face was suddenly that of the man Elena had seen amputate the wings of his foes with pitiless efficiency. \u201cSomething in this place attempts to break you away from us.\u201d</p><p>Elena stared down at the mountainous terrain. \u201cShe can try, but she won\u2019t succeed.\u201d It was a challenge, and when lightning shattered the sheet blue of the sky, she knew the challenge had been heard.</p><p>Raphael touched the back of her neck. \u201cStay close, Elena. You are the easiest to hurt. And this entire region . . . sings to me. She is here, somewhere.\u201d</p><p>In response, Elena pulled down his head and took his mouth with fierce, possessive hunger. \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone take you from me, not that creepy Lijuan and not her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s bones stood out sharply against his skin, that skin holding a faint glow as he spoke against her mouth. \u201cCome, warrior mine. Let us find her wherever she may Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Diving off the mountain with him, Illium on her other side, she kept her senses wide open as they flew to the old tiled roof she\u2019d seen from a distance. As they came close enough to look down at it, she glimpsed the remains of what could well have been the curving arch of a torii guarding the entrance, confirming her supposition that it had been a temple. Or perhaps shrine was the correct word. Now, it stood abandoned.</p><p>The forest had encroached over and through it to the extent that vines crawled into windows that had long lost their coverings, while fallen leaves and other debris lay at least a foot deep in the doorway. Most of the roof, too, was covered by vines and mossy growth, while below, the roots of an ancient sakura tree appeared to have slipped under and buckled what might\u2019ve once been a small courtyard.</p><p>\u201cElena, collapse your wings.\u201d Raphael dropped just below her and went vertical, as Illium did the same on her other side.</p><p>Realizing what they intended to do, she snapped back her wings. One strong masculine hand closed on each of her upper arms at the same instant\u2014as they came in for a tight landing in the courtyard where people might once have waited to enter the shrine. Or maybe ... Bending down when Illium and Raphael released her, she brushed away the leaves and dirt to uncover traces of a gritty white substance. \u201cI think this might\u2019ve been a sand garden.\u201d</p><p>Neither of the men spoke, moving away toward the building. Looking up, she glanced around. Given the size of the shrine, it was possible that the sand garden may have been part of a larger garden\u2014complete with velvet green grass and trees planted after the utmost thought and care alongside a small bubbling stream, perhaps a tiny Japanese maple or two with leaves that would turn a brilliant orange red come autumn.</p><p>So quickly nature takes over, she thought, rising to her feet and dusting off her hands. Now, though enough light came in through the canopy that they could see what they were doing, it was soft and shaded by the time it hit the ground, and the roots of several forest giants had not only overwhelmed the sand garden, they appeared to have gone under then cracked upward through the floors of the shrine itself.</p><p>Walking to one huge root, she put her hands on the wood and vaulted over, her wings trailing across the knotted surface as she did so. \u201cFind anything?\u201d she called out to Raphael, unable to see Illium.</p><p>He glanced over at her from where he stood by the entrance. She took a startled step back. His eyes . . . \u201cRaphael, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>That unearthly glow continued to shine unabated as he held out his hand. \u201cCome here, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Walking carefully over the twisted and broken remains of two low steps, she reached out to take his hand, let him pull her up beside him. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>That inhuman gaze focused on something in the forest. \u201cI see nothing, but I hear her.\u201d</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>Elena shivered. \u201cI heard that, too.\u201d Looking down at their clasped hands, she realized the glow from his skin was traveling over hers in a glittering wave. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head, silken strands of midnight black hair sliding across his forehead. \u201cI do not know. But I know that my mind is clearer when you stand beside me.\u201d His eyes continued to smolder with that preternatural fire, as if he was burning huge amounts of power ... to keep Caliane at bay, she realized.</p><p>She dropped one of the knives from her arm sheath down into the palm of her free hand. \u201cDo you still want to look inside the shrine? The debris in front of the door isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d What little she knew about Japanese shrines said this was unlikely to have been the main entrance\u2014but from what she\u2019d seen in the air, the front was inaccessible.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He returned his attention to the ruins. \u201cMy mother was Cadre. She is adept at games, may well be trying to lure me away from here because it is her resting place.\u201d</p><p>Glancing around, Elena frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Illium? Inside already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot hear him.\u201d Raphael\u2019s tone was sharp.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Elena said, hand tightening on the hilt of her dagger. \u201cNot here, with the static.\u201d But her heart thudded double-time. Not Illium, she thought, not the angel who\u2019d become one of her closest friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Raphael held her back when she would\u2019ve headed down to where she\u2019d last seen the blue-winged angel. \u201cI will go first\u2014there are things here you have no hope of defeating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She wasn\u2019t stupid, no matter that worry for Illium had her frantic. The angel had become one of her people, someone she\u2019d fight to the death to save. \u201cBe careful Archangel.\u201d Because if she loved Illium, what she felt for Raphael was beyond words, beyond her ability to describe. A huge, powerful, near-painful emotion, it simply was.</p><p>\u201cDeath holds no allure for me, Elena.\u201d The power of him cut against his skin, a cold white fire. \u201cNot when I have yet to sate my hunger for you.\u201d Turning, he walked not to where she\u2019d last glimpsed Illium, but into the bowels of the shrine. \u201cHe came in here.\u201d</p><p>Following, her entire body on alert, she paused by a long, pitted column that bore flecks of what appeared to be rust-colored pigment and checked in the shadows around its side. Seeing nothing, she continued on, the rustle of her and Raphael\u2019s wings the only\u2014\u201cWait.\u201d Gripping Raphael\u2019s arm, she stopped him when he would\u2019ve gone farther into the depths of the building.</p> <p>When he glanced back at her, she leaned forward to brush the dirt off a cracked but still-standing column using her fingers. \u201cDo you see?\u201d It was a whisper.</p><p>Raphael reached out to trace the shape of the dragon carved into the eroded surface. \u201cThis should not be part of this shrine. Everything about it is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Or perhaps she is simply remembered as legend in these parts.\u201d Turning again, he walked a few steps into what had been the main room\u2014the roof of which was now almost entirely gone, the sky covered with a filigree of green\u2014and stopped three feet in. \u201cIllium.\u201d Bending, he picked up one startling blue feather edged in silver.</p><p>There was a drop of crimson on the very tip.</p> <p>Half an hour later, they\u2019d combed every single inch of the shrine and the surrounding area and found no further sign of Illium. \u201cYou said your mother liked beautiful things,\u201d she said to Raphael as they stood beside the gnarled old root she\u2019d vaulted over not long ago.</p><p>Raphael gave a slow nod. \u201cAnd Illium is very much a man many have desired to collect over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not helpless despite the fact that he appears decorative, so that\u2019ll be a surprise.\u201d Folding her arms, she turned toward the being for whom she would walk into hell itself. \u201cYou\u2019re also far stronger than you were when she last saw you\u2014you can reach Illium.\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked at her for a long, long moment before raising his hand to touch her cheek. \u201cSuch faith in me, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She closed her fingers over his wrist, his pulse strong and steady under her touch. \u201cI know your heart, Archangel. It gives you more power than you believe.\u201d</p><p>Raphael felt a tug of urgency at Elena\u2019s words, a flare of understanding that he couldn\u2019t quite grasp. It was tempting to chase, but experience told him that would only send the whisper of thought further into hiding. Allowing it to fade away for the moment, he focused on the facts at hand. \u201cShe took Illium for a reason.\u201d</p> <p>Elena\u2019s eyes glittered with intelligence, that thin ring of silver luminous in the muted forest light. \u201cA warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be.\u201d However, his mother wasn\u2019t like other mothers. \u201cOr it may be that she grows impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to find her?\u201d Elena frowned and parted her lips ... but the words never came, blades gleaming in her hands even as Raphael sensed the intruder at his back and turned.</p><p>A shift in the air, as if something was trying to take shape. For a fraction of a second, he thought it was Caliane, but then the formless being turned into an angel with hair of ice and irises of a strange pearlescent shade that almost melded into the whites of her eyes, giving her the look of an eerie blindness. Her wings were the last part of her body to appear, a silken dove gray that was as exquisite as Lijuan was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d Her voice held the same faint echo he\u2019d sensed before, as if there were other voices within her, ghosts trying to reach out. Trying to scream.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Lijuan?\u201d</p><p>The Archangel of China smiled, and it was nothing even remotely of the world. What Lijuan had become, what she\u2019d \u201cevolved\u201d into, was a nightmare even the Cadre couldn\u2019t quite comprehend. But Raphael understood. Because he\u2019d looked into the face of madness as a child, felt it touch him with featherlight fingers . . . and knew it might one day crash over him in an overwhelming wave.</p><p>Elena\u2019s wing brushed his in a silent caress, as if she\u2019d read his thoughts. As if she was reminding him of her promise.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s eyes flickered over Elena\u2019s wings, and there was a faint avarice in her gaze. The most ancient of archangels had a fondness for the exotic and unusual\u2014unfortunately, she liked to pin them up as trophies on her walls. \u201cYour hunter\u2019s wings are exceptional. Unique. Did you know that, Raphael? In all my millennia of existence, I\u2019ve never seen wings like hers . . . or like the young one\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cyoung one\u201d was Illium\u2014and Lijuan\u2019s fascination with him was such that Raphael made sure Illium was rarely in her vicinity, and never, ever alone. \u201cYou did not come here to talk of wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sense.\u201d Settling her own wings, Lijuan looked around with those eyes that appeared blind. \u201cI remember this place. It was an ancient shrine known only to its disciples. Legend said they worshipped a sleeping dragon.\u201d A shake of her head, her hair blowing back in a wind that touched nothing else. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay it much mind.\u201d</p><p>Because a goddess, Raphael thought, had little to fear from small mortal gods. But now, he thought, looking at that ageless visage, she did know fear. Lijuan had evolved ... but Caliane had been millennia upon millennia older than her when she lay down to Sleep. Who was to say that his mother could not vanquish the nightmare that was the Archangel of China?</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s eyes settled on Raphael once more. \u201cYou always loved your mother,\u201d she said in a sweetness of words that did nothing to hide the death that clung to her like a putrid shade. \u201cSo it is unfair of us to expect you to find and eliminate the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are here to kill my mother.\u201d It was no surprise, but he wondered at her speaking to him of it again.</p><p>\u201cI am here to kill a monster.\u201d</p><p>31</p><p>Elena had been certain where she stood on the whole Caliane situation the instant the archangel took Illium, but now, looking at Lijuan, she reassessed. Did your mother ever reanimate the dead?</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t betray even by the barest flicker of an eye-lash that he\u2019d heard her, but his response was instant. No.</p><p>An absolute answer, but she heard the things Raphael didn\u2019t say, felt the tendrils of an ancient darkness curl around her heart. Because whatever form Caliane\u2019s madness had taken, it had turned her own son against her. What did she do? It was the one thing she\u2019d never asked, for she understood that mothers could be hated and loved at the same time.</p><p>She sang thousands upon thousands into slavery, until they saw nothing but her, until they would have slit their own children\u2019s throats and walked over their bruised and battered bodies if she asked.</p><p>Elena swallowed, watching Lijuan as she turned to walk across the remnants of the sand garden, her wings so flawless in color and formation that it was impossible not to admire them even knowing that their purity was a lie, hiding the truth of Lijuan\u2019s nature. Did she give that order?</p><p>No. My mother was once the Guardian of the Innocent and some part of her remembered that responsibility. But she gave other orders.</p><p>For a moment, she thought that was all he was going to say on the subject, but then the sea slammed against her senses. She almost staggered under the force of it, only then realizing how rigidly he was holding on to his control.</p><p>She sang the adult populations of two thriving cities into walking into the Mediterranean until they drowned, because they were about to go to war. In her mind, it was a better option than the death and devastation war would\u2019ve caused.</p><p>I have never heard such quiet as I heard in those cities. The children were shocked and mute, and in spite of the care we gave them, many died of inexplicable sicknesses over the next year. Keir has always maintained that they died of such heartsorrow as immortals would never know.</p><p>Lijuan finished her exploring at that instant and turned to face them again. \u201cShe does not Sleep here.\u201d It was a definitive statement.</p><p>\u201cYou will forgive me if I do not take your word for that.\u201d Raphael\u2019s response held the same chill Elena had sensed in his mental voice.</p><p>Lijuan smiled that damn creepy smile that made spidery fingers crawl up Elena\u2019s back. \u201cYou think I covet your mother\u2019s power, but you are wrong. Caliane\u2019s\u201d\u2014a massive gust of wind that pushed Elena\u2019s hair off her face\u2014\u201cpower drove her mad. I enjoy my sanity.\u201d</p><p>Whether Lijuan was sane was a question of interpretation, but one thing was clear. \u201cShe can hear us.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s eyes shifted to Elena. \u201cMichaela doesn\u2019t understand what you see in your hunter, Raphael.\u201d She drifted closer, too close for Elena\u2019s comfort. \u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>Elena held her ground. Lijuan was batshit crazy as far as she was concerned, but according to Raphael, the oldest of the archangels also had a weird code of honor. She wouldn\u2019t kill Elena for speaking as other archangels might\u2014but she\u2019d strike out if she thought Elena wasn\u2019t treating her with the respect demanded by her status. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure half the time myself,\u201d she said, keeping her voice steady, though her every instinct screamed at her to get the fuck away from the creature in front of her.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>Hush, let me talk to the crazy lady.</p><p>A flicker of his wing and she wondered if she\u2019d almost surprised her archangel into a smile.</p><p>\u201cLife,\u201d Lijuan whispered, reaching out a hand as if to touch Elena\u2019s face.</p><p>Elena took a step back just as Raphael moved to stand slightly in front of her.</p><p>Laughing, Lijuan dropped her hand. \u201cAs I said, life. There is a flame within you, hunter, one that is rare. So he keeps you close, though you weaken him more with every day that passes.\u201d</p><p>Elena felt the heart-blow slice home, piercing her through and through. She knew Raphael thought it a fair trade, but she didn\u2019t think so. If he was hurt because of her, she\u2019d never forgive herself. Even the possibility terrified her. But there was no room for self-pity here, in front of an archangel who\u2019d let her reborn feast on the flesh of the newly dead. \u201cDo you know where she\u2019s taken Illium?\u201d she asked, stepping up to stand beside Raphael once again. I\u2019m your consort, remember? she said when he shot her a hard glance.</p><p>I would never forget, Guild Hunter. Cool words, but they were as good as a caress to her.</p><p>\u201cI sense a hum of power here,\u201d Lijuan said, \u201cbut Caliane is strong. Her tentacles pervade this entire region.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The leaves on the ground rose up in miniature tornadoes as Lijuan spread out her wings. \u201cI search for her, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I, Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will call me.\u201d It was an order as the oldest of the Cadre twisted into a pillar of dark smoke that spiraled up into the sky and disappeared.</p><p>Turning her face away from the rush of leaves and dirt stirred up by Lijuan\u2019s departure, Elena felt Raphael\u2019s hands lock on her waist. Used to the drill by now, she clamped her wings tight to her back and held on to his shoulders as he took them above the canopy, high enough that she could fly on her own.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t let go. Instead, wrapping her arms around him, she pressed her cheek to the warmth of his neck. \u201cTogether, Archangel,\u201d she said in his ear, a preemptive strike against any attempt he might make to distance himself. \u201cAlways. Remember?\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on her hips. I know where my mother Sleeps.</p><p>Jerking in surprise, she looked up. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She underestimated Illium\u2019s strength as you predicted. He is rising to consciousness and attempting to lead me to him.</p><p>Shuddering at the confirmation that Illium was safe, she met eyes gone a stormy midnight. Will you call Lijuan? It seemed safer not to say the name aloud.</p> <p>I should. She is the only one who may be able to battle Caliane and win.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother.\u201d A knot formed in her own heart. \u201cIf I had the chance to speak to my mother again, I would grab it with both hands.\u201d No matter how angry she was at Marguerite, no matter how much her mother\u2019s betrayal continued to burn like acid, she would walk into Marguerite\u2019s arms and hold on ... and hold on.</p><p>Caliane is likely to arise a horror, Elena. Far worse than Lijuan, for Caliane does not look monstrous in any way. Even her madness is a thing of impossible beauty.</p><p>If that\u2019s true, Lijuan will sniff her out soon enough. Perhaps it would only take her minutes, but that time would be Raphael\u2019s. You deserve the chance to talk to your mother alone, to see her one more time.</p><p>Raphael leaned down to claim her lips in a slow, potent kiss as the sky rolled with a wave of thunder, lightning spiking in vivid bursts of color on the horizon. I would leave you in a safe place.</p><p>I would just break out of it.</p> <p>He looked at her then, and she knew he was well aware he had the power to trap her in ways that would allow no escape. A cage of protection . . . but still a cage. Instead of arguing with him, she waited.</p><p>Wind whipped that midnight-dark hair off his face as he touched his fingers to her cheek. Not alone, Elena.</p><p>Her heart caught at the emotion in that simple statement. Never.</p><p>With those words, they turned and flew into the heart of the storm.</p><p>Two hours later, the muscles that supported Elena\u2019s wings had gone beyond protest and into an almost numb state that she knew would get her through the next few hours\u2014but would leave her whimpering in the days that followed. She had a feeling that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Whatever was going to happen would happen today. Either she\u2019d survive\u2014or she wouldn\u2019t. Anything else was a peripheral concern.</p><p>Raphael flew ahead of her, a blaze of white-gold against the roiling turmoil of the clouds that seemed ready to devour them both, the rain a freezing constant. According to her watch, it was a few minutes after four in the afternoon, but the skies were so black that had they been flying over a city, the entire area would\u2019ve been lit up by thousands of tiny lights\u2014in office windows, along the streets, blinking high up on the towers.</p><p>However, the land below them was composed of mountain and forest broken up only by the occasional isolated hamlet of farmers and their kin. They\u2019d also seen a village even smaller than the one where they\u2019d left Naasir. The glow of warmth from that village had been too small to penetrate the stormy dark, so when Elena caught a glimpse of light a bit farther on, she wiped the rain from her eyes and focused\u2014it was odd, but she could\u2019ve sworn her vision grew sharper, more crisp, as if her eyes were compensating for the conditions.</p><p>Shrugging off the sensation, she continued to concentrate. The light was diffuse, covering a wider area than could be accounted for by a farm or other small settlement. Guessing it to be a larger village, she dropped just far enough below the clouds to get a closer look. At first, she couldn\u2019t quite understand what it was she was seeing, her mind unable to process the impossibility of it.</p> <p>Because below her spread the gracious lines of what appeared to be a city of sparkling gray stone, all of it shrouded in an iridescent glow the color of the Aegean. Not only were the buildings utterly dissimilar to the accepted architecture of this region\u2014heck, this country!\u2014according to the satellite images Elena had accessed, that city hadn\u2019t existed this morning. Raphael!</p><p>No response, and she thought Caliane might have succeeded in blocking their communication again, but then she saw him sweep down below her, his wings spread to their widest as he held his own against the surging winds. Wait above, Elena. He flew toward that stunning shimmer of color.</p><p>Elena knew that would be the safest option\u2014but every part of her said it would be a very, very bad idea to let him go into that strange city alone. Dropping in a steep, scarcely controlled dive, she reached him just before he would\u2019ve gone through the ... whatever the hell it was.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s gaze was almost impossible to hold, it burned with such power when he glanced at her. Elena. It was an order.</p><p>Her hackles rose, but she bit back the reaction, blinking away the tears caused by the momentary contact with his eyes. I have to come with you. Trust me.</p><p>It\u2019s not a question of trust. I would not lose you to my mother\u2019s madness.</p><p>Flying a fraction below him, so their wings wouldn\u2019t tangle, she reached up with her hand. I won\u2019t lose you to her, either. This feels like a trap, Raphael.</p><p>Raphael curled his fingers around hers, holding her in position. It may well be. And you would fly into it with me?</p><p>She infused her voice with wickedness. Trouble\u2019s not only my middle name, it\u2019s my first and last, too.</p><p>A blaze of electric heat as Raphael\u2019s power swept out to cover her. She\u2019d been shielded by it when they\u2019d danced that most intimate of dances, felt it cut across her when he was angry, but never had it enfolded her with such brutal completeness, until her eyes streamed tears from the shocking force of it. Shutting them tight, she squeezed his hand. I can\u2019t see.</p><p>It won\u2019t be for long. If the shield around the city is the trap, it\u2019ll give us enough time to get back out.</p><p>With that, he flew, pulling her with him.</p><p>She knew the instant they hit the cool energy of the shield. The shock wave rocked through her entire body, but it was concentrated on where her fingers intertwined with Raphael\u2019s, a wrenching pull that attempted to separate them. She knew if it succeeded, she\u2019d be thrown out while Raphael disappeared inside the city she wasn\u2019t sure wasn\u2019t just a fancy mirage, a snare created by an archangel so old, it made her bones ache to even think about it.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know which one of them said that, her body battered by icy rain that had turned brutal, her wrist bones threatening to break\u2014Caliane was determined to smash them apart. Not on your fucking life, she thought, and set her teeth against the pain of tendons that felt like they\u2019d snap the next second.</p><p>An instant and an eternity later, they were tumbling out of the rain and toward the strange city at high velocity. A few months ago, she would\u2019ve been helpless to stop her descent. But a few months ago, she\u2019d been an angel newly fledged. Releasing Raphael\u2019s hand so she wouldn\u2019t drag him down with her, she stretched out her wings and began to beat upward in strong, fast movements, fighting the speed of her own tumbling body.</p><p>It became clear very quickly that her velocity was terminal.</p><p>Four seconds tops and she was going to find herself smashed to jagged fragments against the flat gray stone of the roof below her.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>She shoved up her shields when Raphael would\u2019ve taken over. Conserve your strength. Then she poured every ounce of her own strength into averting what might well be a fatal fall given her age. Lose enough pieces and she was toast, but she\u2019d been training hard. She had the skill. She just had to\u2014Got it!</p><p>Her wings brushed the coarse stone of a building as she managed to shift her trajectory enough that she missed the roof and fell into the gap between two of the graceful gray structures. It gave her enough time to stabilize and get herself back up into the sky. She more than half expected Raphael to be furious with her for her defiance, but when she reached him, he was staring down at the city, his wet hair shoved off his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, thrusting a hand through her own hair ... and realizing that no storm raged here. Rain lashed with unremitting force against the shield, but inside, the whole area was bathed in a golden light that almost succeeded in softening the stark edges of the buildings. \u201cIt needs flowers,\u201d she found herself saying. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look quite right.\u201d Unable to hold the hover, she made a controlled descent onto the roof she\u2019d almost crashed into only a minute ago.</p><p>Raphael followed her down with far more grace. \u201cIt was once overrun with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers.\u201d</p><p>Walking to the edge of the roof, she looked down and saw an amazing array of carvings on the wall of the opposite building, the stone sparkling with hidden flecks of color that would turn this city into a brilliantly cut diamond in sunlight. Her heart slammed against her ribs. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jewel in my mother\u2019s crown. Though it is far from where it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, most archaeologists believe Amanat never existed,\u201d she said, staggered by the awareness of just how much power it would\u2019ve taken to not only disappear, but move an entire city. \u201cThat it\u2019s nothing more than a legend.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile on Raphael\u2019s face that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI wonder at human archaeologists who do not speak to those of us who lived in these times of legend.\u201d</p><p>Elena snorted. \u201cAs if any of you angels would answer their questions.\u201d</p><p>You know us too well, Elena. Light words, but the way he stood, the way he looked at this strange city of stone and shadow, it spoke of lethal alertness.</p><p>Her own guard up, she continued to scan the area for any sign of Illium. They stood on one roof, but other roofs stacked up to her right, lodged directly into the mountains, as if they\u2019d been carved out of rock, had stood there for centuries. Which was impossible. Except of course, she was dealing with an immortal of such power that she scared Lijuan.</p><p>And that scared the bejesus out of Elena. \u201cIllium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dropping in and out of consciousness, but I can sense him.\u201d Stepping off the roof, he flew down to the ground with a grace and strength that made her wonder what he\u2019d become in another thousand years. Something extraordinary, of that she was certain. Unless . . . whatever it was that their relationship was doing to him ended up stealing his immortal life.</p><p>No. She repudiated the thought as her own feet touched the ground but knew it wasn\u2019t a truth she could ignore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you see, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she thought he\u2019d guessed the direction of her thoughts, but then she followed his gaze. This lost city, its stone walls carved with ethereal, delicate art she recognized as so ancient as to have no modern equivalent, slumbered around them, an elegant lady perfectly preserved. \u201cIt should be crumbling into pieces, but everything\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if the city is simply sleeping through a long night,\u201d Raphael murmured.</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d Followed the thought through to its logical conclusion. \u201cRaphael, what happened to the people who lived in Amanat at the time it went to sleep?\u201d</p> <p>Without discussion, they walked through the first doorway wide enough to accommodate wings, and found themselves in some sort of a temple full of light despite being carved into a mountainside. Elena didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected to see, but it wasn\u2019t what they found.</p><p>32</p><p>They lay in peaceful repose, small groups of women curved around each other, faint smiles on their faces, as if they were having the most pleasant of dreams. \u201cMy God.\u201d Stunned, she kept watch as Raphael walked across the stone floor inlaid with precious gems of sparkling fire and dazzling brilliance, his wings leaving droplets of water in their wake.</p><p>When he bent to touch his fingers to the neck of a maiden\u2014the word fit better than any other given the woman\u2019s gauzy, flowing garment of softest peach, her tumble of curls laced with ribbon\u2014who lay in graceful repose on a silk cushion of gold-shot ivory, she walked to join him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right below the dais,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>Because that dais was set only a few feet above the rest of the floor, coming to just below her breasts, she could see across the sweeping breadth of it, see, too, the square of stone that was a different color from the rest. It was, she knew without being told, the place where the statue of a goddess\u2014not a god, not in this place that sang of feminine power\u2014had once stood.</p><p>\u201cShe is warm.\u201d Raphael rose to his feet. \u201cThe Cadre of my mother\u2019s time was wrong\u2014she took her people into Sleep, not into death.\u201d</p><p>Elena shoved her hands through hair that was frizzy with damp. \u201cRaphael, this kind of power . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Walking up the steps cut into the side of the dais and to the empty space she\u2019d already noted, he stared down at the square imprint. \u201cThe populace of Amanat once had their own gods and goddesses, but when Caliane claimed it as her home, they became her people, their devotion complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she sing them to that devotion?\u201d Elena asked, able to hear the soft breaths of the sleepers now that she was listening for it. It raised the hairs on the back of her neck and nothing was going to get those hairs to go back down\u2014not until they were out of the unnatural grasp of this city frozen in time.</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cNo. Amanat was hers from long before I was born.\u201d</p> <p>Elena thought of all she\u2019d read about Caliane in the history texts, all Raphael had told her, remembered, too, that his mother had been called the Archangel of Grace, of Beauty. \u201cThe love always went in both directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Crouching down, he touched his fingers to the square of stone that spoke of absence. \u201cIllium.\u201d</p><p>Elena began to circle the stone walls below the dais, searching for an entrance. Nothing, the gray walls seamless. Then . . . a tiny blue feather lying at her feet. Illium. Tucking the feather into a pocket, she focused on the wall directly in front of where she\u2019d found it. She felt nothing under her palms on the first pass. Or the second. But on the third . . . \u201cRaphael, I think there might be a seam here.\u201d</p><p>He was beside her an instant later. \u201cI played in this temple as a young boy\u2014I may remember how it opens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She stepped away to stand guard while he ran his fingers over the spot.</p><p>As she watched, he appeared to press down on specific areas of the stone, though she couldn\u2019t differentiate any one section of the wall from another. But the instant after he lifted his hand, the stone cracked open with a groan that spoke of great age, releasing a puff of dust that had Elena coughing as she ducked to poke her head inside.</p><p>At first, she saw nothing, the area beneath the altar was so dark.</p><p>Then her nose picked up the wicked bite of some exotic liqueur. Lime, she thought, it had the tart sweetness of lime, kissed with a richer, more languid flavor. It was a scent she hadn\u2019t realized she associated with Illium until that second. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe ready.\u201d A brightness of blue.</p><p>In the lingering flash, she saw Illium\u2019s crumpled form in the corner, his head tipped against the stone wall, his wings crushed under his body. \u201cWhat\u2019s she done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Elena.\u201d Taut words. \u201cI need to remain here to ensure the door does not close.\u201d</p><p>Blinking against the aftereffects of the blaze of light, she stepped down into the cavern\u2014it went deeper than the floor outside, until even Raphael could\u2019ve stood upright\u2014and made her way through the dark space by feel, stumbling over Illium when she miscalculated. Please be okay. Crouching, she touched his leg, his thigh, his chest, then finally, found her fingers on his face.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sleeping Beauty. I can\u2019t carry you out of here.\u201d He was too heavy with muscle, and under no circumstances did she want Raphael to leave the doorway\u2014it would snap shut the instant he did, of that she was as sure as she was of her own name.</p><p>No response from Illium.</p><p>Leaning closer, she gave in to the urge to press her cheek against his, trembling in relief at the warmth of his skin. \u201cIllium, you have to wake up. I need you to protect me against Dmitri.\u201d</p><p>A change in his breathing, fingers brushing against her hip, then ... \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. She got to her feet, one of her hands around his. \u201cUp, Sunshine, now.\u201d</p><p>Illium mumbled something, but she could tell he was attempting to obey. He got himself on his feet after a few tries, but then all but collapsed against her. Bracing his front against her own, she let out an oomph before managing to manhandle him enough that she could wrap an arm around his waist, pull his own muscular arm over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWalk,\u201d she ordered, gripping at the wrist of the arm around her shoulders.</p><p>His wings lay heavy against her own as he spread them in an instinctive attempt to find his balance. The intimate slide was not something she\u2019d have allowed even Illium under normal circumstances. Today, she held him even tighter, muttering orders in the voice of a drill sergeant in an effort to keep him conscious as she hauled him out of the pit where he\u2019d been dumped, her back and shoulders straining against his muscled weight.</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d</p><p>Only when she heard Raphael\u2019s voice did she realize she\u2019d reached the doorway. \u201cHe\u2019s dazed,\u201d she told her archangel.</p><p>Illium lost consciousness again right then, becoming a dead weight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him.\u201d As Raphael reached in to haul the blue-winged angel up out into the light, Elena made a mistake. She put her hand on the wall and took a moment to catch her breath. At the same instant, Raphael shifted just out of the doorway, turning to set Illium down against the outside wall.</p><p>The door slammed shut.</p><p>The shock of the absolute pitch-dark was so sudden and unexpected that Elena didn\u2019t scream, didn\u2019t cry out, didn\u2019t do anything but stare at the door that she knew was there, though she couldn\u2019t even see her own fingers in the extremity of the blackness. There was no light. None. Raphael? she tried after a couple of seconds, her brain kicking itself back into gear.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>It didn\u2019t scare her\u2014she knew he was on the other side, working with single-minded focus to get her out. All she had to do was stay in place and fight the disorientation caused by the utter lack of sensory cues to aid perception. \u201cNice and easy,\u201d she told herself, shifting very carefully to lean against the wall, her wings tucked neatly to her back. The quiet within the stone room was . . . tomblike.</p><p>That was when she heard them.</p><p>Whispers. So many whispers. Around her. Inside her.</p><p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p><p>Come here, little hunter. Taste.</p><p>Get on your knees and beg, and maybe I\u2019ll let you back into this family.</p><p>Run, Ellie. Run.</p><p>She won\u2019t run. She likes it, you see.</p><p>Ah, ch\u00e9rie, you know I never left this room.</p><p>Mama?</p><p>Ari\u2019s having a nice nap\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she screamed, clapping her hands over her ears. But the voices continued to torment her, her nightmares boiling over to trap her in a prison far more terrible than the stygian gloom that surrounded her on every side.</p><p>Little hunter, little hunter, where aaaaaarre you?</p><p>Perhaps I\u2019ll tie you to Bobby, let him feed.</p><p>You disgust me.</p><p>Dead, they\u2019re all dead.</p><p>Because of you. Her sister\u2019s voice. Ari\u2019s voice.</p><p>Monster. Belle, whispering so low and mean. You\u2019re a monster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Elena whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Monster.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I swear I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Better that you die here in this tomb, than lead others to their deaths.</p><p>Ari would never say that to her. Belle had never spoken to her in that vicious tone. The wrongness of it snapped the snare of nightmare. Shoving up the mental shields she\u2019d been working on since she woke from the coma, she slammed herself against the wall, only then realizing she\u2019d taken several steps forward. \u201cI\u2019m not playing this game!\u201d</p><p>The instant her back met the wall, she became aware of the rush of cold air at her feet. Horror uncurling within her, she reached out with a foot, scooting forward an inch at a time. Her leg was almost fully extended when she felt a \u201clip\u201d of stone\u2014as if there was nothing beyond except a deadly crevice.</p><p>Shaking, she pulled back her leg, dropping her knives into the palms of her hands at the same time. Sweat trickled down her temples, stuck her hair to the sides of her face, made the air chill against her skin\u2014she welcomed the rush of sensation, even as she decided to gamble with what might very well be her life. Wish me luck, Archangel.</p><p>There was no response, but she knew he had to be blasting the rock with angelfire by now. He\u2019d get her out. She just had to keep herself alive in the interim.</p><p>Right on cue, she heard the slither of something on the stone, something heavy and scaly and reptilian. Shivering, she switched one of her daggers for the short sword Galen had drilled her in until she could fight in the dark\u2014so long as she avoided that gaping pit in the center\u2014and she opened her mouth. \u201cGames,\u201d she said, speaking to the alien intelligence behind this trap, \u201care beneath you.\u201d</p><p>The slithering didn\u2019t cease, but she felt the sense of something, someone watching and listening, the heavy weight of that presence pressing down on her as she drew in long, slow breaths and tried to pinpoint the location of whatever it was that had crawled out of the pit to join her.</p><p>Musk. Dirt. Moss.</p><p>It was the last that gave her the anchor she needed\u2014the stone room had been bare of living plants when she\u2019d retrieved Illium. The creature was in the left-hand corner, she thought, heading toward her. So she began to inch to her right a fraction at a time, always testing ahead before she moved. She didn\u2019t trust the hole to remain in the center of the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were a goddess,\u201d she said as she moved. \u201cIntelligent and beautiful, and worshipped by people not out of fear, but out of love. I am nothing but an angel new-Made, no real challenge to someone of your power.\u201d It was the unvarnished truth, and that, Elena thought, might just save her. Unless Caliane was still utterly insane. \u201cTo torment me serves no purpose but to lessen you.\u201d</p><p>A sudden cold that made her heart stutter in shock. The thing in the room with her hissed in rage at the same instant, and she knew she was skirting the edge of what would be tolerated. But she had to keep talking, had to keep Caliane from ordering the creature to attack. \u201cDo you know what Raphael told me?\u201d she said, hope flaming anew as she felt a vibration in the wall. Archangel.</p><p>The moment\u2019s distraction almost cost her everything as the serpent or whatever the fuck it was spit something in her direction. She caught the scent of acid a fraction of an instant before it would\u2019ve been too late and slammed herself down and to her right, breaking what felt like a rib in the process. That pain, however, was nothing to the searing agony on the very tip of her left wing. Swallowing the scream that wanted to escape, she blinked back tears and crawled another foot out of range. \u201cHe told me,\u201d she said through the agonizing hurt, \u201cthat you had a voice like the heavens, so pure and strong and imbued with love that the world itself stood still to listen.\u201d</p><p>The cold retreated with such unexpected swiftness that Elena wondered if she\u2019d surprised Caliane. But it was too late. She was trapped in a corner, with the floor falling away in a steep drop to her right, solid stone walls to her back and left ... and the creature coming straight for her. She could see glowing slivers of swirling yellow and green that she guessed were its eyes, and from the sound it made as it slithered across the floor, it was massive.</p> <p>There was no way in hell she\u2019d be able to fight that thing trapped like this, but there wasn\u2019t any time to do\u2014\u201cIdiot, shit.\u201d She was moving even as the thought entered her head, rolling off to her right and into the pit, wings flared wide to control her descent. She had a feeling she did not want to drop down to the bottom\u2014who the fuck knew what waited below, but she could use this space to maneuver. She didn\u2019t let herself consider the fact that the whole thing might snap shut, crushing the life out of her\u2014maybe, just maybe, Caliane had heard enough to decide to give her a chance.</p><p>Twisting so that she faced the last known position of the creature, she beat her wings up and sliced out with the short sword. A scream of rage and the thick, pungent odor of body fluids told her she\u2019d scored a hit. Her elation lasted only an instant\u2014before agony blazed down her left side and she realized the creature had spit at her again.</p><p>It felt like her flesh was being peeled off her bones. Tears streamed down her face though she tried to fight them, knowing she couldn\u2019t give in to any vulnerability. Then her left wing began to drag, and she knew the acid had hit something vital. Fighting to keep herself afloat, she slammed into a wall inside the hole, felt the roughness of it scrape away the skin on her arms, her face, to expose her flesh to the air.</p><p>A second after that, she heard the slithering below.</p><p>Jesus. Swallowing, she beat her good wing faster in an effort to rise, but only succeeded in slowing her momentum a little. Archangel, if you have something up your sleeve, now would be the time.</p> <p>A slam of crashing noise and then light, so bright that it made her cry out, shade her eyes with her uninjured arm as rocks and stone ... and wetter, slimier things, rained down from above. Ducking to the side, she scrabbled at the coarseness of unfinished stone as one wing collapsed completely. \u201cRaphael! Down here!\u201d</p><p>A nail tore off her finger, another, blood slicking over her skin. Hurry!</p><p>Strong hands clamping over her shoulders. Two seconds later, she was being hauled out through a gaping hole where there had once been a door. Blinking against the sudden light, she tried to speak but couldn\u2019t get the words out past gritted teeth, the agony on her left side starting to crawl to the right.</p><p>Raphael brushed the hair off her face. \u201cI have you, Elena. I have you.\u201d The warmth from his hands began to soak into her skin, chasing out the vicious pain that made her feel as if her organs were caught in a massive grinder.</p><p>Giving in to the need, she buried her face against his chest and fisted her hand in his damp shirt as he used his power to heal her. He was big and strong and warm, and she wanted to strip him to the skin and wrap herself around him until nothing could touch either of them. Sucking in a breath when his hand brushed her still-burning hip, she set her jaw, holding on with a white-knuckled grip.</p><p>Sooner than she\u2019d expected, the pain was nothing but a memory.</p> <p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d she asked against his chest. \u201cMy wing?\u201d It felt dead, gone. No, please no.</p><p>33</p><p>His arms around her. \u201cThe creature\u2019s poison was not as bad as Anoushka\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot reassuring, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wing was paralyzed, not damaged\u2014the acid didn\u2019t have time to eat through the tendon and bone. You\u2019ll be able to fly again in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>So relieved that she was shaking, she pulled away to sit up\u2014and got a good look at her side. Her clothing had been eaten away in spots large and small to expose her flesh. And it was flesh, the skin having been burned to nothingness by the acid. Bone gleamed white through one section and the sight of it made her want to retch.</p><p>Tensing her stomach against the urge, she wiped off her tears and blew out a breath. \u201cNot as bad as it could\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey go for the eyes,\u201d Illium said, sounding coherent and functional as he stood guarding the gaping hole in the stone below the dais, his sword in hand. \u201cGood thing it was dark in there or your eyeballs would\u2019ve been leaking down your face by now.\u201d</p> <p>Elena stared at him. \u201cThank you for that cheerful thought.\u201d</p><p>The damn blue-winged idiot winked at her, those astonishing lashes closing over one golden eye.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, can we kill him now?\u201d she muttered, trying not to think about the fact that she had holes seared into her flesh.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s bones cut against his skin as he helped her to her feet. \u201cNot yet, Elena. We may have need of him.\u201d It was said with such frigid calm that for a moment, she thought he\u2019d taken her seriously.</p><p>Then she followed the direction of his gaze into the dark maw of the chamber where she\u2019d been trapped. \u201cNo.\u201d She gripped his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not going in there.\u201d</p><p>A glance so arrogant, she knew most beings\u2014mortals and immortals both\u2014would\u2019ve fallen to their knees in submission. \u201cLeave me, Guild Hunter. Illium will take you to the roof, to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire\u2014\u201d Illium began, no hint of laughter in his expression now.</p><p>\u201cIllium.\u201d A single word. A command.</p><p>Illium looked as if he wanted to argue, but in the end, he bowed his head. However, Elena wasn\u2019t one of Raphael\u2019s Seven. She didn\u2019t have to obey his orders. Moving around to face him, she folded her arms. \u201cIf your mother is so powerful,\u201d she said, \u201cthen she can meet us out here just as well as in that pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane is not used to coming to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow and hoped like hell her next words wouldn\u2019t get them killed. \u201cOr maybe she\u2019s only powerful when she has her prey trapped and alone. You\u2019ve never had trouble facing anyone down in the full light of day.\u201d</p><p>The temple shook at her feet, trembling so hard she almost tumbled into Raphael. For a moment, she was afraid the entire structure would collapse, burying them. But she\u2019d forgotten that Caliane was a goddess in Amanat\u2014and that her people slept vulnerable beneath the stone roof.</p><p>When the trembling stopped, everything was as it had always been. Except that Raphael and Illium had their eyes trained on the dais. On what had appeared atop the stone.</p><p>Raphael strode up to what he now realized was an altar, aware of his consort and Illium coming to stand beside him, their swords drawn. But his attention was on the stone slab before him. Six feet long and three feet wide, perhaps as deep, it was a cool pale grey and free of ornamentation. Like the door below, the slab appeared seamless, but unlike the door, he didn\u2019t know how to unlock this puzzle.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>Placing his palm on the stone that should\u2019ve been cold but instead held a lingering warmth, he dropped his shields a fraction. Mother.</p><p>There was no answer, but he knew . . . \u201cShe is awake.\u201d It was too late to kill her while she lay weak and vulnerable.</p><p>Could you have done such a thing, Raphael?</p><p>Her voice, that beautiful, haunting voice, it penetrated to his very bones, stripped him bare. I am an archangel.</p><p>Yes. Such pride in that single word, a wonder of words unsaid. You are the son of two archangels.</p><p>He spread his fingers over the stone. Are you sane, Mother?</p><p>Laughter in his mind, painful in its familiarity. Is any immortal ever truly sane?</p><p>The temple shuddered again, but this time, it was different, dust and rock raining down from the ceiling. Raphael felt the touch of death an instant before he sensed the power of another archangel. \u201cLijuan is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Elena grabbed his arm when he would\u2019ve turned, headed out. \u201cI can taste your mother\u2019s scent in the air\u2014exotic and rich and sensual. Black orchids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go, Elena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s leavened with a strange, unexpected note of sunflowers.\u201d Her fingers clenched on his arm. \u201cThere were no sunflowers on the body of the tortured girl, on the bridge, on the vampires who went mad in Boston. The scent was too pure, too much the essence. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Guild Hunter. He was already moving, Elena and Illium running across the temple floor behind him.</p><p>They exited out into the streets of Amanat to see the Archangel of China in physical form, throwing arrows of power at the temple building. Each bolt was black. There was nothing inherently evil in black\u2014all of Jason\u2019s abilities manifested in that midnight shade\u2014but Lijuan\u2019s power was riddled through with a rotten core that made Raphael recoil.</p><p>Rising to face her in the air above the temple, he blocked one of her shots with the vivid blue that was the manifestation of his own power. \u201cI did not ask for your assistance, Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>Her hair whipped off her face. \u201cShe cannot rise, Raphael. You must not let your emotions blind you to the truth of her madness.\u201d</p><p>He knew Lijuan spoke the truth\u2014to a point. Blocking another arrow of power, one that slammed him back several feet through the air, he gathered angelfire in his palms. It might no longer do her mortal harm, but with her in her physical form, a direct hit would still cause significant damage. \u201cThe question of her insanity remains unanswered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took the young one,\u201d Lijuan said, her hair electric with black strands that Raphael realized were streamers of pure dark energy. \u201cAnd your consort looks injured. Those are not acts of sanity.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps not, Raphael thought, but most archangels walked a fine line between sanity and insanity. \u201cAny one of us may have done the same.\u201d He spoke not to defend Caliane, but to oppose Lijuan\u2014and because his mother, while she had acted with the cold arrogance of power, had done nothing as yet to speak of madness. Lijuan on the other hand ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat of the people she murdered around the world?

And her voice, when it came next, was nothing the least bit human. \u201cGood-bye, Raphael.\u201d</p> <p>There was no way to avoid it. The bolts came from everywhere.</p><p>He heard Elena scream as he took a direct hit to the chest. It was not angelfire, for Lijuan had never had that ability, but that didn\u2019t matter. Bloated with her toxic power, it was a killing blow, even for an archangel. The blackness invaded his blood, spread through his cells until he could see his veins turn black under his skin, feel the crawling of it across his irises.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Raphael.\u201d Lijuan\u2019s voice. \u201cI always did like you. But you would protect her.\u201d</p><p>He tried to speak to Elena, to tell her that she would be safe. Even after his death, his Seven would not break their vows. They would protect her. But Lijuan\u2019s poison spread throughout his system, blocking his efforts to fight it with the cutting blue of his own power. And he fought. He fought with every ounce of will in his immortal heart, every ounce of the unnamable, unending emotion he felt for Elena.</p><p>Even dying, he managed to throw a final ball of angelfire, using his fading vision. It made Lijuan scream. That high-pitched sound ringing in his ears, he fell to earth, coming down hard on the temple roof, his wings crushed but not broken, his fall cushioned by a power that felt akin to that which had once been the standard against which he judged himself.</p> <p>My son! My Raphael.</p><p>Too late, he thought, it was too late. Caliane had never been a healer, and his entire body was riddled with Lijuan\u2019s black poison. Shoving outward with his own newborn gift, he tried to heal himself, but his ability was young, scarcely formed. It stood no chance against Lijuan\u2019s brand of evil.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d Hands cupping his face, fierce determination in his hunter\u2019s voice.</p><p>He wanted to order her to leave, to warn her that the infection that was Lijuan\u2019s power could spread, as it had with the reborn, but he knew she\u2019d never leave, his consort with her mortal heart. Elena mine.</p><p>Elena swallowed the tears and panic that threatened to take her over when she saw Raphael\u2019s beautiful eyes overrun with tendrils of Lijuan\u2019s evil, obscuring those irises of a haunting shade found in the deepest part of the ocean, intense and absolute. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Above her, the sky fractured in a cataclysm of light, and when she looked up, Lijuan was no longer alone. An archangel with hair of tumbling raven black and wings of purest white faced her, her hands ringed by blue flame.</p> <p>The template from which I was cast.</p><p>Snapping back her head, she squeezed Raphael\u2019s hand, his golden skin pale above veins turned black and rigid. Archangel, can you hear me?</p><p>These words hold the last remnants of my power.</p><p>Focusing on the fact that he was still alive and refusing to consider anything else, Elena ducked as a piece of rock went flying past\u2014spreading her body and her wings above Raphael.</p><p>Go, Elena! They will fight to the death.</p><p>Ordering me around even now, Archangel? She wouldn\u2019t leave him. She\u2019d never leave him. Looking up, she saw that Illium continued to stand guard, his face streaked with anguished fury. Bluebell will tell us when to duck.</p><p>A moment\u2019s silence, and her heart almost stopped.</p><p>I should be dead.</p> <p>Trembling, she pressed her forehead to his. Don\u2019t say that. You survived Lijuan once. You\u2019ll do it again. Except that his golden skin had turned cold and pale, his eyes now eerie blocks of black, and his wings ... She lifted a fisted hand to her mouth, biting down hard on her knuckles.</p><p>The evil was spreading out over his wings in a slow creep, turning the gold and white to an oily darkness that brought out every one of her most aggressive instincts. She wanted to fight it, to cut at it, but knives wouldn\u2019t work here. Not when the canvas was Raphael\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cElena, cover!\u201d</p><p>She moved with Illium\u2019s first syllable, spreading her wings out over Raphael\u2019s vulnerable body. Something hit her shoulder hard enough to bruise, but she held her position until Illium gave the all clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are they doing?\u201d</p><p>I would like to know the answer to that question.</p><p>Realizing her archangel no longer had his sight, his beautiful eyes blinded by black, she looked up and felt the air leave her body. \u201cDear God, Raphael. They\u2019re . . .\u201d Swallowing to wet her throat, she focused on the two immortals in the sky. \u201cYour mother\u2019s managed to damage Lijuan\u2019s wings, and it looks like she\u2019s flickering in and out of her physical form.\u201d</p><p>Then it must take power for her to maintain her other form. That, we did not know.</p><p>\u201cYour mother doesn\u2019t look injured, but she\u2019s not avoiding Lijuan\u2019s bolts fast enough.\u201d Caliane was moving at phenomenal speed, but\u2014\u201cNext to Lijuan, she looks almost sluggish.\u201d</p><p>I was wrong. She was not yet ready to awaken.</p><p>And Elena understood, her heart twisting. Caliane had woken for her son. \u201cShe\u2019s holding her own.\u201d But now that she was searching for it, she could see Caliane\u2019s weakness and so, clearly, could Lijuan.</p><p>Looking down into Raphael\u2019s face, she wanted to lie to him, to give him peace, but that wasn\u2019t what they were. \u201cI think your mother\u2019s going to lose, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s body shuddered, his wings pure black, his skin without life.</p><p>Archangel!</p><p>Raphael heard Elena, but he couldn\u2019t answer her, his mind overrun with a searing burn so hot, it flared incandescent white against his vision, turning his world from cold black to a piercing conflagration.</p><p>The instincts of over a thousand years of survival urged him to fight the rage of flame . . . but then he saw what it was doing. Eating away at the black, obliterating it in a fury as wild as angelfire. As it did so, it left a lingering \u201ctaste\u201d on his senses, one he couldn\u2019t quite define, and yet knew to the depths of his soul.</p><p>Raphael, don\u2019t you dare leave me. Together! Your promised me if we fell, it would be together!</p><p>Even in the midst of the brutal fight taking place in his body, her demand made him want to claim her lips with his own, to stroke his hand over those warrior\u2019s wings in open possession.</p><p>A spear of lightning scored down his spinal cord and spread in a nuclear burst through his wings, blistering with such heat that he half expected his body to turn to ash. But when the burn faded to a dull, throbbing hum, when he lifted his lashes, he saw Elena\u2019s face staring down at him, determination in every line of her. I won\u2019t let you go, Archangel. I won\u2019t! Then, heartbreakingly quiet, \u201cI can\u2019t do this without you, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Raising his hand, he cupped her cheek. \u201cI am not so easy to kill, Elena.\u201d Except he should be dead. He was an archangel, but Lijuan had evolved to another plane of existence. Her power was beyond that which was known, which could be fought. It tasted only of death to mortal and immortal alike.</p><p>Elena\u2019s entire frame shuddered, and she pressed her forehead to his for a long, broken second. A single, painful droplet splashed against his cheek before she raised her head and he flowed to his feet beside her. Every part of his body ached, but he\u2019d fought feeling far worse\u2014even the violent heat that continued to spark within him, searching out and eradicating the final traces of Lijuan\u2019s taint, was no longer the overwhelming inferno it had been.</p><p>Raphael. My son.</p><p>Looking up, he saw Caliane\u2019s right wing crumple as Lijuan managed to slam her against the side of a building.</p><p>34</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said to Elena. \u201cMy mother\u2019s people will be waking. Get them moved to safer locations.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t fight him, stepping back so he could take flight. Take care, Raphael. You belong to a hunter.</p><p>With her words circling his heart, he flew up and caught his mother\u2019s falling form, protecting them from Lijuan by throwing out a spray of angelfire that made her swerve and lose concentration. He took the opportunity to lower Caliane gently onto a rooftop. She would heal, he thought, having seen the damage. It had not been a heart-blow like his . . . and it did not seem to affect her as it had him. But then, his mother was far older.</p><p>Her eyes shimmered an aching blue as he rose to meet Lijuan once more. You fight for me.</p><p>I fight against Lijuan. His mother might yet act the monster once she regained her strength, but there was no question that Lijuan already was one. If she wasn\u2019t brought under control, her brand of death would soon crawl across the world\u2014Caliane at full strength might be the only one capable of keeping her in check.</p><p>So you would use one monster to cage another? A voice that still held its haunting magic.</p><p>All archangels carry the threat of darkness within.</p><p>Lijuan rained a fury of black down on him. Throwing up a shield, he slammed the bolts into another wall, crumbling an edifice that had stood for centuries upon centuries. Sensing movement below, he saw Elena\u2019s distinctive wings as she half carried, half dragged a dazed citizen of Amanat to another area of the city. Elena, stay out of sight, he ordered, knowing Lijuan would go after her if she saw the chance.</p><p>Focus on keeping your neck in one piece, Archangel. I\u2019m not the one Lijuan\u2019s got a hard-on for.</p><p>Laughing at the acerbic reply, he threw several balls of angelfire, positioning himself just above Lijuan. She weaved out of the way, but he had her on the defensive, and using that, he maneuvered her to the edges of the city, where the buildings were more apt to be empty of mortals.</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s wings had turned black during the course of the battle, as had her hair. That wasn\u2019t as important as the fact that she no longer seemed to be able to shift to her noncorporeal form. It made her vulnerable in a way she hadn\u2019t been since Beijing, but she was far from easy prey.</p><p>Flinching as she managed to singe one of his wings again, he felt a renewed burn as that incandescent fire arced through his veins to neutralize the black. It made him wonder . . . Reaching deep within, he coaxed the near-uncontrollable wildness of it to his hands, then released it as he would angelfire. In every other way, his power manifested as either blue or a blinding blaze, but this was a luminous white-gold with iridescent edges of midnight and dawn ... and when it hit Lijuan, she bled.</p><p>Her shock obvious, she stared at him as the dark red stain spread across her front. Capitalizing on her disbelief, he hit her again, but the fire within him was already fading, and this hit was nowhere near as potent as the first. But, it was enough. It caught one of her wings, and she shrieked in rage before changing direction and slamming through Amanat\u2019s shield, out into the rain-lashed night.</p><p>Raphael went after her, the rain slicing at his face like so many sharp knives . . . but the Archangel of China was gone. Hovering to a standstill, he searched the forested landscape, thinking her wing might\u2019ve collapsed, crumpling her to the earth. But the forest lay undisturbed, the storm-dark skies empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d had a reservoir of power, he realized, had used it to escape by taking her other form for a short period. There was no way to track her\u2014but she was vanquished for now and would think twice before attacking him or his own again. Now . . . now he had to face the monster who had given birth to him.</p><p>Elena, having moved the last of the men and women of Amanat to safety, away from the damaged buildings, ran up to a small rooftop, then took flight, Illium at her side. It didn\u2019t take long to spot Raphael\u2019s mother on another, much higher rooftop. Caliane\u2019s white gown was streaked with black, that face of impossible beauty burned on one side, but all that was superficial to an archangel.</p><p>Landing, Elena looked for signs of the blackness that had overtaken Raphael like a creeping poison. Caliane\u2019s wings bore scars of the oily slickness, but ... \u201cI think she\u2019s got it contained,\u201d she said to Illium.</p><p>\u201cI am the most powerful of archangels,\u201d said a voice of such faultless clarity that it almost hurt to hear it. \u201cLijuan is yet weak.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes were as pristine a hue as his, a shade no mortal would ever possess, but there was something in them . . . something unknown and old, so very, very old. Stepping back, Elena stood, watching as Caliane flowed to her feet, elegant in spite of her injuries and torn clothing. Already, the scars of black were noticeably smaller.</p><p>The archangel\u2019s eyes bored into her. \u201cMy son calls you his consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am his consort,\u201d she said, holding her ground. Caliane didn\u2019t have the creepy Lijuan factor, and neither did she put out the bitch vibe like Michaela, but there was an alien quality to her, something Elena had never felt with any other archangel, no matter how old\u2014as if Caliane had lived so very long, she\u2019d become something truly other in spite of the fact that she continued to maintain a physical form unlike Lijuan.</p><p>Caliane raised a hand, flames of unexpected yellow green licking over her fingers, and Elena heard Illium unsheathe his sword in a shush of sound, knew he was going to move in front of her. \u201cIllium, no.\u201d</p><p>The blue-winged angel didn\u2019t obey. \u201cYou told me to choose my loyalty, Elena. It is to Raphael, and you are his heart.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing she\u2019d never be able to budge him, she instead took a step to the side so she could meet Caliane\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to be mad.\u201d She more than half expected a whiplash of temper\u2014archangels did not like being spoken to in such a way by mortals, or angels newly-Made.</p><p>But Caliane turned her head, her hair lifting in the breeze. \u201cMy son.\u201d Unbridled pride. \u201cHe is of Nadiel and I, but he is better than both of us.\u201d</p><p>Raphael winged in to land in front of Caliane then, and Illium shifted aside enough that Elena was able to watch mother and son come face-to-face for the first time in more than a thousand years.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s heart, a heart he\u2019d thought had turned to stone before he met Elena, stabbed with daggers of pain at the expression of love on his mother\u2019s face. It brought back memories that usually broke through only during anshara, the deepest of healing sleeps.</p><p>He remembered not simply that she\u2019d left him broken on that forsaken field, but that she\u2019d held him when he\u2019d cried as a child, wiping away his tears with long, elegant fingers before kissing his face with tenderness that had made him throw his arms around her, hold her tight. \u201cMother,\u201d he said, and it came out quiet, husky with memory.</p><p>Her responding smile was shaky. Reaching forward, she raised her hand to his cheek, her fingers cool against his skin, as if her blood had not yet begun to truly pump through her veins. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown so strong.\u201d</p> <p>It was an echo of the dream, and it made him wonder what she remembered of it. \u201cI cannot allow you freedom, Mother.\u201d It had to be said, no matter that the boy in him was reeling in stunned wonder at having her so close, so very near.</p><p>Her hand fell off his cheek and to his shoulder. \u201cI do not seek freedom. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Giving in to the need within him, a need that had survived over a millennium, he reached out and drew her into his arms. She wrapped her own around him, laying her head against his-heart, and for a frozen instant, they were nothing but mother and son standing beneath an impossible sky.</p><p>I was not meant to survive your father, Raphael. We were two halves of a whole.</p><p>The sorrow in her tone made him tighten his hold. He could not live.</p><p>His mother said nothing for a long, long moment. When she drew back, her expression was different, more formal. So, you have a mortal consort.</p><p>\u201cElena,\u201d he said out loud, refusing to allow Caliane to shut out the woman who made the idea of eternity a breathtaking promise. He placed a hand at the curve of her back when she came to stand beside him, \u201cShe is no longer mortal.\u201d</p><p>Caliane\u2019s eyes moved from him to Elena and back again. \u201cPerhaps, but she is no mate for an archangel.\u201d</p> <p>Elena spoke before Raphael. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he\u2019s mine and I\u2019m not giving him up.\u201d</p><p>Caliane blinked. \u201cWell, at least she has spirit.\u201d Folding away wings she\u2019d spread out after his embrace, she looked back at Raphael. \u201cEven your blood carries the taint of your mortal.\u201d With that, she turned and walked to the edge of the roof. \u201cI must look after my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour awakening changes the balance of the Cadre.\u201d Lijuan was no longer the strongest of them all\u2014and after her Sleep, Caliane was a complete unknown.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d She raised a fine-boned hand. \u201cI have no wish for politics at present. However, make it known that this region is now mine.\u201d</p><p>Since Lijuan wasn\u2019t likely to return to face Caliane anytime soon, that claim would, Raphael knew, remain unchallenged. There is no way to know what she will do, he said to his consort. If I am to have any chance of killing her, it must be now.</p><p>Elena curled her hand around his. She\u2019s done nothing as yet that another member of the Cadre might not have. The impact on you, Elijah, and the others was an unconscious effect, so you can\u2019t blame her for that.</p><p>She attempted to harm you more than once.</p><p>I rest my case\u2014even your Seven isn\u2019t sold on me. I never expected your mother to welcome me with open arms.</p><p>Raphael looked down at his hunter, at the piercing ring of silver around her eyes and knew that Elena would do anything to have another moment with her own mother; that her pain, her need, might blind her to the brutal truth. If this choice is wrong, thousands could die.</p><p>We won\u2019t let that happen. Her voice was resolute.</p><p>Even as she spoke, silver blue flashed on her other side and then Illium was standing beside her, his wing touching Elena\u2019s in an intimacy that made Raphael raise an eyebrow. Illium\u2019s lips curved in a wicked smile that did little to hide the intensity of his emotions. I would not watch you die again, Sire. His veins stood out against his skin as he gripped the wrist of one hand with the other.</p><p>Raphael met those eyes of gold that had stood beside him for centuries. If I had done so, I would have gone knowing you would keep my heart safe.</p><p>Illium\u2019s gaze went to Elena. Always. \u201cI will remain behind with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Illium.\u201d Stroking his hand down Elena\u2019s hair, he shook his head. \u201cI will send Naasir.\u201d</p><p>The blue-winged angel\u2019s jawline turned knife-blade sharp. \u201cNaasir has no wings should he need to follow Caliane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason will take care of that part of the equation.\u201d Shaking his head when Illium went to argue, he said, \u201cI need you in the city when Aodhan arrives.\u201d</p><p>When both his hunter and Illium gave him intrigued looks, he said, \u201cLater. For now, we will leave Caliane. She told the truth in that much at least\u2014she has always cared for the people of this place and will not venture from it until they are thriving once more.\u201d Taking a last look at the lost city of Amanat\u2014lost no more\u2014he rose with his consort into the skies, through the shield of power and into the rain-dark night beyond.</p><p>Standing in the huge bathroom of the penthouse apartment in Kagoshima-shi, the capital of the prefecture, Elena looked at her side in the mirror, saw that she no longer had holes in her flesh. Raphael had sent healing warmth racing through her before she walked into the shower, insisting on it though she was more worried about him.</p><p>Relieved nonetheless, she wrapped a plush white towel as firmly as possible around her body and padded out into the bedroom, heading to the windows. There was no angelic tower in this city, but the striking building across from this one seemed to be the center of operations, with angels flying in and out on a regular basis.</p><p>As she watched their silhouettes arc against the glittering skyline now clear of rain, she thought over the events of the day. What would it do to her if Marguerite suddenly rose from the grave and took flesh and blood form?</p><p>Pain. Need. Guilt. Love. Anger.</p><p>It was such a tumultuous blend that she took a shuddering breath in an effort to control herself, then another and another until she could shake it off. Tonight, this, it wasn\u2019t about her. It was about her archangel. Raphael. He\u2019d taken a quick shower of his own, then gone out to speak to the angel who ran this city. She hadn\u2019t wanted to let him go, the terror that had torn through her as Lijuan\u2019s evil spread through his veins a living, breathing entity, but as she was a hunter, he was an archangel.</p><p>I can see you, Guild Hunter.</p><p>Smiling, she pressed her fingers to the glass and looked out at the angels flying away from the ultramodern high-rise, its balconies asymmetrical\u2014almost seeming to hang in midair. It took her less than a second. Less than a fraction of a second. He was the strongest, most compelling of them all, his wingspan magnificent. Are wings proportional to body size?</p><p>A glow of silver on his feathers as they were hit by the lights from a nearby billboard, the Japanese nightscape a technological wonderland. You know what they say about men and their wings.</p><p>She laughed, and it was a sweet, unexpected gift. Yeah? Come here and show me.</p><p>Instead of landing, he dipped and dived far enough away that she could see him\u2014admire him\u2014before changing direction to come straight to the balcony outside the suite. Walking out to meet him, she shook her head. \u201cShow-off.\u201d Before he could say anything in response, she wrapped her arms around the muscular heat of his body and pressed her lips to his pulse, needing to feel the living, beating heat of him.</p><p>His hands tightened on her hips. \u201cI would kill anyone who saw you this way.\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his jaw as he walked her backward into the suite. The instant he reached back to pull the doors closed, she jumped up to wrap her legs around his waist, the towel falling to the floor. \u201cWindows,\u201d she muttered against his throat, kissing her way up the strong column.</p><p>Carrying her without effort, his heartbeat ragged against her lips, his skin hot, he reached out and flipped the switch that turned the windows opaque. Then his hands moved up the backs of her thighs and up over her butt, his hold raw and possessive. When he turned to pin her against the wall, she instinctively spread out her wings on either side, clamping her hands on his shoulders.</p><p>His mouth was on hers before she could draw breath, his hand closing over her bare breast. She tried to meet the kiss, but he was so wild that she had to give in\u2014to his mouth, to his kiss, to the hand he shoved between them to stroke at her damp heat with firm, demanding strokes that had her arching into him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He removed his hand much too soon, and she would\u2019ve protested if he hadn\u2019t claimed her lips for another deep kiss. Gasping in air when he released her mouth for a second, she moaned as he bit at her lower lip hard enough to sting before taking her again, his tongue stroking against her own. An instant later, she felt his cock nudging at her core.</p><p>A single, powerful thrust and he was buried to the hilt inside of her.</p><p>She screamed, her back arching off the wall, her nails digging into his shoulders as pleasure short-circuited her system, inner muscles clenching and unclenching over and over again. If she\u2019d had any hope of holding on to even a hint of rational thought, it went out the window when he bent his head and bit down on her pulse. Hard enough that she knew she\u2019d be wearing his mark.</p><p>After that, there was only touch and taste and the hotly intimate friction of skin against skin.</p> <p>35</p><p>Elena lay sprawled on top of Raphael, a surely stupid smile on her face. \u201cWow,\u201d she murmured into the warm curve of his neck. \u201cThat was ...\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand over her back, fingers brushing the sensitive inner curves of her wings. \u201cI was rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were.\u201d Nuzzling into him, she licked at the salt of his skin. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d That he\u2019d trusted her with the full fury of his emotions ... Smile growing deeper, she stroked her hand down the ridged musculature of his chest. \u201cWhen did you get rid of your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p> <p>He sounded so lazy and sated that laughter bubbled out of her. \u201cHey.\u201d She slapped his chest. \u201cNo going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m the archangel. I give the orders.</p><p>Her laugh turned into a startled grin. He had a sense of humor, her archangel, but not long ago, he\u2019d have meant it when he said that. Placing her hand over his heart, she listened to the deep beat that wasn\u2019t yet steady. She should\u2019ve felt sleepy, but all she wanted to do was stroke him, kiss him, feel him warm and alive under her hands. \u201cWhat happened, Raphael?\u201d</p><p>He understood without further explanation. \u201cIt was a fatal blow. Even had Keir been beside me the instant after I took it, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to heal me.\u201d</p><p>The words chilled the embers of passion. \u201cLijuan\u2019s that powerful?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cBut her power has twisted and changed from our last confrontation. It now carries total death, even for immortals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were scored on your wings and shoulders before the chest hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that type of a glancing blow would\u2019ve killed a weaker, young angel.\u201d His hand closed around the back of her neck, gave a little squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m old enough and strong enough that she needed to strike me either in the head or in the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Raphael.\u201d The idea of his death made her scrabble inside in panic. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d She\u2019d lost two of her sisters, her mother, and in every way that mattered, her father. If she lost Raphael, that would be it. She wouldn\u2019t make it.</p><p>\u201cI live Elena.\u201d Quiet words, his arms holding her close. \u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother said even my blood carries your mark.\u201d Reaching up, he ran his finger down the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cI thought she was being insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Raphael thought back to when he\u2019d first met Elena, when he\u2019d first begun to feel the impact of the nascent bond between them. \u201cLijuan told me you would make me a little mortal and, in so doing, kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt colored her expression. \u201cI have made you weaker, Raphael. You heal slower\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cI should\u2019ve considered the source. Everything came from Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Lines formed on her brow as she spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re saying she somehow twisted the truth? Tried to sabotage you from the get-go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she would have thought of it in that fashion.\u201d Moving his hand down to curve around her throat, he rubbed his thumb over her pulse ... over the mark he\u2019d put on her.</p><p>Elena arched into the touch. \u201cShe does seem to like you in that weird, creepy way of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch flattery will go to my head, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to keep you humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLijuan deals in death,\u201d he told her, her laughter sinking into his skin, an invisible mark of her own. \u201cA mortal is very much alive and of the moment.\u201d Humans didn\u2019t have the luxury of wasting years or decades, their lives beginning and ending in a firefly flicker.</p><p>Elena\u2019s eyes went wide, that thin ring of silver not apparent in this light, but he knew it was there, a silent meter of how deep immortality had grown into her cells. \u201cThe change in you,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever it is, means you have the ability to resist her powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only resist, but neutralize.\u201d Giving him an incredible advantage against the most powerful member of the Cadre, barring his mother. So long as he managed to get to safety long enough to recover from a strike, Lijuan could not kill him.</p><p>Elena whistled. \u201cShe knew. She knew that might happen.\u201d</p><p>Raphael wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI think she had an idea of it, but I also believe part of what she told me was the truth\u2014she did once have a lover who threatened to make her mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Elena completed, \u201cshe chose to kill him because he endangered her power. He scared her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He watched the expressions fly across her face. Such passion in that mortal heart, such a hunger for life. \u201cCome here, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down until her hair created a soft intimacy around their faces. \u201cYou worry that you have the seeds of madness in you\u201d\u2014a soft whisper husky with passion\u2014\u201cbut you\u2019ll never become what she is. Never.\u201d Because Raphael had chosen to love when it had seemed the worst possible option.</p><p>His gaze was a cold mountain lake and the cool heart of a gemstone. \u201cWe may have unleashed a horror, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She knew they were no longer talking about Lijuan. \u201cIf we\u2019d killed her in cold blood as she Slept, or as she stood weakened before us, we\u2019d be no better than monsters ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we wait.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Three days later, Raphael looked across the semicircle of the Cadre at a glowing Michaela. Whatever the nature of her relationship with Astaad\u2019s second, it seemed to be making her happy\u2014for the time being at least. Flanking her sensual beauty were Charisemnon and Astaad himself.</p><p>Elijah had taken the seat to Raphael\u2019s left, while Favashi sat next to the South American archangel. Neha reclined with regal grace beside her, Titus on her other side. Then there was Lijuan ... on Raphael\u2019s right. It was the first official meeting of the Cadre the Archangel of China had attended in over a year.</p><p>Elena had asked him if Lijuan would be held to account for Caliane\u2019s attempted murder, had been stunned when he explained that because the Sleeper lived, there had been no crime. Such was the ruthless world of the most powerful immortals.</p><p>\u201cThere has,\u201d Favashi now began in her serene voice, \u201cbeen a shift in the power structure of the world.\u201d</p><p>Michaela, dressed in a corset that spoke of bygone times, skintight black pants, and boots that skimmed over her thighs, crossed her legs one over the other. \u201cThe Queen of Understatements as always, Favi.\u201d For once, there was no bitchiness in her tone when she spoke to the other archangel.</p><p>Favashi\u2019s lips curved upward in a slight smile, her own dress an ankle-length gown in palest green that left her arms bare and reminded Raphael of the maidens in Amanat. \u201cYou aren\u2019t worried about this change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s mother is powerful,\u201d Michaela said, \u201cso powerful that she probably won\u2019t bother with day-to-day politics.\u201d Her gaze went to Lijuan. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected of you.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan, her body not as solid as it should\u2019ve been, didn\u2019t deign to reply, turning her attention to Raphael instead. \u201cYou should have killed her,\u201d she murmured, her skin stretched so thin over her bones that he could almost see the white of her skeletal structure shining through. \u201cIt\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>Raphael remembered the choice she\u2019d urged him to make when he\u2019d met Elena, thought of the consequences if he had listened then. \u201cYou are no longer the strongest archangel in the world. It seems to have clouded your judgment.\u201d</p><p>Those eerie eyes swam with gleaming black. \u201cI have always liked you, Raphael.\u201d Caressing words against his cheek, though she made no move to raise her hand.</p><p>Ignoring the silent invitation, he looked to Astaad. \u201cYou have not spoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to say?\u201d Astaad spread his hands in a graceful gesture, rings of finest gold flashing on his fingers. \u201cCaliane appears to want nothing beyond what she already has at this stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we certain?\u201d Neha\u2019s words carried an undertone of a sibilant hiss. \u201cThere were strange reports from your court, Astaad.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, his gaze on Astaad, saw the male\u2019s eyes flame with rage for a flashing second before he gave a lazy smile. \u201cThere are always reports. Be careful what you believe.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s shoulder brushed Raphael\u2019s\u2014and it felt akin to being touched by a solid illusion. \u201cDo you think he is taking Uram\u2019s path?\u201d Her voice was pitched low, meant to reach his ears alone.</p><p>Raphael hadn\u2019t considered that. But if Astaad was continuing to behave in an erratic fashion, then Caliane\u2019s awakening was not to blame. \u201cIf he is, he\u2019s a fool.\u201d Letting the toxin build up in your system until madness encroached was a gamble no one ever won. I stood in your way, he said to Lijuan. I tried to kill you. It was an implied question.</p><p>You are young, Raphael. You have not yet learned to choose your battles.</p><p>He wondered if Lijuan truly believed he would one day stand by her side, if her insanity was that deep, that true. But he said nothing, for her calm was necessary at this moment. Caliane might be powerful, but Lijuan remained a force who could destroy the world. \u201cNeha,\u201d he murmured under his breath. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has been visiting her mate more often of late,\u201d Lijuan murmured as Charisemnon and Titus exchanged stinging comments. \u201cPerhaps she wishes to conceive another child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d Titus said, turning away from the archangel who always seemed to rub him the wrong way. \u201cYou and your people are the only ones who are being allowed through her shields and into her city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will keep watch,\u201d he said, knowing that responsibility could be no one else\u2019s. After what he\u2019d learned in Amanat, he knew he held within him the potential to do what he hadn\u2019t been able to as a youth\u2014this time, if Caliane rose a monster, her son would be the one to bring her down.</p><p>When he returned home, it was to the embrace of a woman who reminded him that no matter what happened, he\u2019d tasted life, such life as no other archangel would ever know.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she said to him as they stood on the highest balcony of their home. \u201cWill you come with me somewhere?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnywhere.\u201d</p><p>A jerky nod. Not saying another word, she flared out those wings of midnight and dawn, and they flew out toward Brooklyn, landing beside a quiet row of storage units. She\u2019d come here with the Guild Director earlier, and now she came with him. When they\u2019d first met, he may well have taken that choice as an insult. Now he understood that Elena needed her friendships if she was going to survive and thrive in this new life into which she\u2019d been thrown. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d He pushed up the door for her when she unsnapped the lock.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she took a single step inside, and he could almost touch the conflicting emotions tearing at her. When she turned and held out her hand, he allowed her to tug him into the small space, nothing an angel would normally even countenance entering. And when she asked him to close the door, he did so without argument.</p><p>She switched on the single yellow bulb an instant later. \u201cSee this?\u201d Her fingers lingered on a faded orange blanket. \u201cIt was my blankie.\u201d A tremulous smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without it.\u201d Sinking to the floor, she let her wings trail on the cold concrete.</p> <p>He went down on his haunches beside her, listening and watching as she carefully folded the blanket, put it on her lap and opened a cardboard box overflowing with her childhood. She showed him drawings she\u2019d made in school, toys she\u2019d played with as a babe.</p><p>\u201cWe will keep this for our child,\u201d he murmured, holding a solid wooden bee meant to be pulled along on wheels.</p><p>Elena gave a shaky laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re having children are we?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never asked her before, but now, he raised his head. \u201cWould you wish for a babe, Elena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be afraid for him or her all the time.\u201d Nightmares whispered in her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the terror.\u201d</p> <p>He thought of her childhood, thought of the blood that had christened her. However, when he would\u2019ve spoken, she surprised him. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one man I could see myself having rug rats with\u2014you\u2019re bad-ass enough to reassure me.\u201d</p><p>Cupping her cheek as she rose to her feet, he rubbed a thumb over her cheekbone. \u201cIt will likely take a long time.\u201d Angels were nowhere near as fertile as humans. \u201cWe will have a chance to get used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll practice on Zoe. Poor kid.\u201d With that laughing comment, she walked to another box, opened it.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>Coming to stand by her side, he saw her lift up an intricately patterned quilt to her nose, breathe in deep. \u201cIf I think hard enough, I can still remember her scent as she used to kiss me goodnight.\u201d A whisper so quiet, he almost missed it. \u201cGardenias stroked with a hint of a richer, more sensual fragrance.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, he touched the quilt, felt a quiet hum of power. \u201cElena.\u201d</p> <p>Elena looked up at the strange tone in Raphael\u2019s voice, the heavy weight of memory easing for a fraction of a second. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned a stunning cobalt as he rubbed his fingers across the soft old cotton. \u201cThere is power in this, the kind of power that comes only with blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was on my bed,\u201d she said with a frown. \u201cUntil Jeffrey packed away everything of my mother\u2019s one winter while I was away at boarding school, this quilt covered my bed. Slater never went into that room. There can\u2019t be blood on here.\u201d She didn\u2019t want the evil to have defiled this, too.</p><p>\u201cNo, not his blood.\u201d Dropping his fingers from the quilt, he touched her wing. \u201cIt is the blood of the maker.\u201d</p><p>Elena ran a finger over the fine stitching. \u201cShe created it by hand, probably pricked herself.\u201d That scent was long gone, buried under the ghosts of the gardenias she wanted to keep fresh.</p><p>When Raphael said nothing, a warning sensation skittered up the back of her spine. \u201cArchangel? Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis kind of blood,\u201d Raphael murmured, \u201cthis kind of lingering power ... it is not a mortal thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was very much mortal.\u201d Elena had seen her dead, her face bleached of color, those beautiful, laughing eyes turned forever dull.</p> <p>Raphael closed his hand over her nape. \u201cAs a human, you once pushed me out of your mind. It should\u2019ve been an impossible task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael, she wasn\u2019t an angel, or a vampire. Only one thing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Eyes on the quilt, he said, \u201cVampires under two hundred years old can sire children. Those children are mortal.\u201d</p><p>Elena blinked, stared at the quilt, back at him. Her life shifted on its axis with a grinding screech. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m part vamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elena. You were mortal before you became an angel. But your mother carried within her blood something powerful enough that it survived her passing. There is a vampire somewhere in your lineage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to sit down.\u201d But what she did was lean against Raphael, the quilt clutched to her chest. \u201cMy father ... he can\u2019t know.\u201d Jeffrey hated vampires, only put up with Beth\u2019s Harrison because of business ties with Harry\u2019s family. \u201cI think it might break him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no reason he should know.\u201d Raphael stroked her hair off her face. \u201cI would see more of your childhood\u2014there is time enough for other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Then, as the most powerful being in the city, in the country, knelt by her side, one of his wings spreading over hers with heavy warmth, she showed him shining, laughing pieces of her life before Slater Patalis broke it into a thousand bloody pieces. Along the way, he told her how he\u2019d run wild through the flower-lined streets of Amanat, how he\u2019d been the pet of an entire city. \u201cTell me more,\u201d she said, enchanted.</p><p>Raphael had never spoken of these memories to any living being, but he told Elena all she wanted to know. In turn, she shared with him the joy she\u2019d found in being the third daughter of four, the one who was young enough to get away with everything, and old enough to be allowed privileges her youngest sister was denied.</p><p>Much later, as they stood on the cliffs by their home, looking across at the stark beauty of the Manhattan skyline after nightfall, she kissed his jaw and gave him another gift. \u201cShe lives, Raphael. There\u2019s hope.\u201d</p><p>Hope. Such a mortal concept. For you, Elena, I will accept that this hope might not be a foolish thing.</p><p>\u201cAh, you know us mortals\u2014or recent-mortals\u2014have a tendency to be foolish.\u201d A heartbreaking smile. \u201cIt makes life interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come, Guild Hunter.\u201d Putting his arms around her, he lifted them into the crisp night air. It is time to make your life very interesting.</p><p>She laughed, played, and later sighed as he took them into the ocean. Knhebek, Raphael.</p><p>And he knew no matter what happened when the pale rays of dawn hit the earth, it would not defeat them. Knhebek, hbeebti. </p> </body></html>"]
